He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are dealing with the Department of Health and the HSE under the Department of Health appropriation accounts, Vote 38 for 2016 and the HSE financial statements 2017.  However, the committee decided to provide up to one hour at the beginning of the meeting to deal specifically with the cervical cancer crisis issue.  We will proceed with our examination of the financial statements after that.  We will take the routine business of the committee in the afternoon.</p><p>There are a number of items relevant to this morning's meeting in correspondence which I am putting on the record so they can be discussed in detail in public.  The first is Nos. 1452 A and 1457 providing briefing documentation for today&rsquo;s meeting  from the HSE.  We will note and publish that.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence No. 1453<b></b>from Mr. Connaghan is his opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Correspondence Nos. 1458 and 1459<b></b>from Mr. Derek Finnegan of the Department of Health are providing briefing documents and a note on the Scally report.  We note and publish them.  Next is correspondence No. 1460<b></b>from Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing his opening statement.  It is noted and published.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1427<b></b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 25 June 2018, provides information on the management of legal costs and open disclosure as requested by the committee on 14 June 2018.  Mr. Breen's correspondence deals with the State Claims Agency management approach to CervicalCheck cancer misdiagnosis litigation; and details including the status of screening and non-screening cancer misdiagnosis claims for cervical cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer.  We note and publish this.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence No. 1432<b></b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE is in respect of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s access to CervicalCheck records.  It is noted and published.  Correspondence No. 1438 from Mr. Ray Mitchell, dated 29 June 2018, is in respect of the attendance of particular officials at today&rsquo;s meeting.  We have a relevant note on the screen.  We are not having a discussion; it is just by way of information.  It states in respect of the point about CervicalCheck attendees that at this point it is important to advise the committee that Charles O'Hanlon is on sick leave and certified unwell and, therefore, will not be in a position to attend the committee.</p><p>In respect of Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, she is employed by Holles Street and indicated that she is no longer with the HSE.  Since our meeting last week we have written to Dr. Flannelly in her course of employment and she sent an email back to the committee, reference 1451, which we note and publish.  Dr. Flannelly was the clinical director of CervicalCheck.  In her email, she thanks the committee for the invitation to appear before it on a voluntary witness basis to address the issues regarding the CervicalCheck programme.  She states that she is at present preparing to meet with Dr. Scally as part of his investigation next week, and that she is currently in the UK where she has work commitments until the middle of next week.  That is now this week.  She goes on to state that she would value the opportunity to help our committee by attending as per our request on a voluntary basis but in view of the above she requests that this be rearranged to a different date.  She states that she will liaise with the clerk in respect of rescheduling it.</p><p>I want to put on record that while she is not here today, Dr. Flannelly has given a definite commitment that she is happy to meet with us at a more suitable time.  I think we will have to come back to that.  We will discuss the timing of our meetings as part of our work programme in the afternoon.  We will not set the time now.</p></speech>

One is on certified sick leave and the other will come on another date.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1439<b></b>provides follow up information from the HSE in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Correspondence Nos. 1440 and 1441 are from an individual making inquiries about HSE circulars not circulated or implemented and HSE employees who did not make the criteria for the first round of the Haddington Road regularisation process.  All those items of correspondence are relevant to our discussion this morning, which is why I referenced them in advance.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.13" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Mr. John Connaghan (Director General, Health Service Executive) and Mr. Jim Breslin (Secretary General, Department of Health)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01000"><p>For this session we are joined by the HSE director general, Mr. John Connaghan; Dr. Peter McKenna, acting clinical director of CervicalCheck; Mr. Ray Mitchell; and from the Department of Health, we are joined by Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General and Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals division.  I remind members, witness and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones or put them into airplane mode as they interfere with the recording system when merely switched to silent.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provision under Standing Orders that they shall refrain from inquiring into the merits or policies of a Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives or such policies.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and considerations at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  We are allocating up to one hour for this session so there will be five minute slots.  I think people will understand that the topic might come up again as part of the general discussion with the HSE over the course of the afternoon. </p><p>I will put one question to Mr. Connaghan before the clock starts for this hour.  He got a request from us for information but I do not see the response.  Perhaps he can point it out to me.  We asked specifically for a note in advance of today's meeting regarding the three CervicalCheck laboratories and who signed off on the forms when they were returned to the HSE.  We asked for details of whether the person or persons were administrative or medical staff with relevant medical qualifications and we asked for the HSE to provide a sample of such forms, redacted as appropriate, and to explain what sign-off process was involved.  Can Mr. Connaghan tell us those details? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01100"><p>I think we have sent in what the process is, including a flow chart, for the receipt and sign-off of samples that go to the collection point in Ireland and are then transmitted to the laboratories and what happens thereafter.  It might be better if I ask Dr. McKenna to take the committee through that.  The correspondence and flow chart that we gave the committee contain the answer to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01200"><p>Time is tight and I am being generous, so the hour will only start after I have finished my bit, in fairness to the other members.  That flow chart, which is now up on the screen, does not answer the question.  It starts talking about the GP surgery and the whole way along, the forms going out and coming back.  All we want to know is when the laboratories that were contracted by the HSE to work for CervicalCheck sent results back to CervicalCheck and who signed off on them on behalf of CervicalCheck to confirm the HSE was happy with the work the contractors did.  Can Mr. Connaghan show me the spot where that is shown on the flow chart?</p><p>He understands my simple and straightforward question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00200"><p>Yes, I understand the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00300"><p>We do not need to know of the process before that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00400"><p>There might be a simple misunderstanding here.  Once the samples are read and the reports are available, they are directly sent back by electronic means or by post to the doctor or clinician who requested them.  That is detailed on the flowchart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00500"><p>It is entirely possible that a smear could be taken and the report returned a medical practitioner having direct sight of it.  Smears are read by laboratory technicians and may be taken by a practice nurse.  If the reading is normal, the result is returned to the programme and the woman informed without any input from a medical practitioner.  That is the system which is in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00600"><p>That is exactly my point.  For those who cannot see the chart, it details that women participating in cervical screening go to the general practitioner, GP, clinics and the laboratory has a collection system involving a pre-addressed envelope being sent to the laboratory for processing.  The laboratory reports are then sent to the GPs or clinics.  Are the witnesses saying that when the work comes back from the three laboratories, which are essentially contractors to the HSE, nobody in CervicalCheck looks at the results from a medical point of view?  Do I understand that correctly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00700"><p>If the results are normal, they would not, no.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses stating that smears went from a doctor to the laboratory and back and CervicalCheck had no medical involvement in the results?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00900"><p>If a result is normal, there might be no input from a medical practitioner between the taking of the smear and the result being filed.</p></speech>

Nobody in a public organisation for which a contractor is doing a job accepts that the work is done satisfactorily on the basis of the contractor sending back a report.  Rather, the results of the work are checked.  I am putting it as simply as I can.  The witnesses are stating that the contracted laboratories did the work but no check on that work was carried out by the HSE.</p></speech>

I do not wish to waste time.  The witnesses were asked a very specific question.  I am dealing solely with a question asked on the previous occasion the witnesses were before the committee and also submitted in writing.  The witnesses stated that it is possible that no medical staff may be involved in the process.  The committee asked for the sample of forms sent back to CervicalCheck by the laboratory rather than a summary report on the number of tests carried out.  Does CervicalCheck get a copy of results which are sent to doctors?  Is the laboratory report for each patient sent to CervicalCheck?  Does anybody in CervicalCheck review the forms sent back by the contracted laboratories from a medical point of view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01500"><p>Almost certainly not.  Some 250,000 tests came into CervicalCheck, the majority of which are reported as normal.  As part of the quality assurance an agreed sample of, for example, one in 50 or 100 cases are sent to another laboratory, which would be sufficient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01600"><p>The patient results sent to CervicalCheck are not usually checked by a medical professional in the HSE, which writes the cheque for the work to be done on behalf of the individual  patients.  That is my understanding of the situation and it is part of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01700"><p>The Chair is correct.  However, there are accredited quality assurance checks in place on a quarterly basis which look at overall quality.  The Chair is correct in regard to individual cases but such cases are sent back to the doctor or practising clinician who requested the samples in the first place.</p></speech>

As of 9 o'clock this morning, how many women have been identified as having been affected?  That figure was at 209.</p> <p>  It has been reported that the independent review of the cases of 3,000 women will not be completed on schedule and is only commencing now.  What is the reason for that?  Why has it taken so long?  If there were 300,000 slides per year and it takes five minutes to review each, a team of ten people could carry out the analysis in a few weeks even if each slide is surveyed twice and the women's slide history examined.  Why was there a commitment to complete the review within a timeframe which has not been followed?  Why was information on the delay not made public?  Why is the review only starting now?  It will not be possible for it to form part of the Scally review, which must be completed by the end of August.  The Minister for Health, stated that the final Scally review must be completed by the end of August.  However, these 3,000 slides will not be part of it because of the delay.  Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, who gave evidence to the committee, are extremely disappointed and upset this morning that the review of the slides will not form part of the Scally review.  Why was the review committed to on the basis of an unrealistic timeframe?  When will it be completed?  How in the name of God can we have a situation where Dr. Scally must report by the end of August to ensure credibility but this review will not form part of his report because of the delay?  How will his review be complete without that information?  How in the name of God did we end up in this situation?  Who committed to those unrealistic timelines?</p> <p>  I have a third question which I had better ask before the Chair cuts me off.  It relates to the legal cases, of which I understand there is a significant number.  I remind the witnesses that the State Claims Agency, SCA, will appear before the committee next week.  As I understand it, the HSE hired a legal firm, the identity of which I know, to draft a protocol for how cytology slides are given to the women affected.  That protocol has been in use for several weeks.  Solicitors for several affected women have gone to court to seek the release of the slides and in such cases the HSE has handed them over without the protocol being followed.  These are urgent cases.  All present know what that means: the women are in difficult health situations.  Why is a protocol needed for the release of slides to which the women are entitled?  Why is it taking so long?  Why can the protocol be bypassed when a woman goes to court and takes on CervicalCheck and it or the SCA is so embarrassed that it hands over the slides?  Some 80 to 90 women have sought their files from CervicalCheck and some have received access thereto.</p><p>When it comes to getting their slides they are being blocked by a protocol, which I doubt anyone has heard of up to now.  Given what the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, said in the D&aacute;il and the evidence given to this committee and the Joint Committee on Health, of which I am also a member, why is this protocol necessary?  What is its purpose?  If it can be bypassed in urgent cases why can it not be bypassed in this instance and these slides given to the women and their solicitors immediately?  As I understand it, Quest Diagnostics is releasing the slides but Clinical Pathology Laboratories, CPL and MedLab Pathology Limited are in discussions in that regard in light of this protocol.  According to the laboratories, the HSE, through the SCA, and this legal protocol, is holding up the provision of information to which these women are entitled.  </p></speech>

It was never intended that the RCOG review would be completed in advance of the Scally review.

RCOG will review all of the diagnoses of cervical cancer since the programme was established in 2008, including the 1,482 cases that were notified to CervicalCheck since then and the further 1,630 registered by the National Cancer Registry which had not been notified to CervicalCheck.  The review will examine the women within this cohort who were screened by the programme, which is approximately 1,856 women from within the total but that is subject to final validation within the review.  The review will examine the cases of women who developed cancer and were screened by CervicalCheck.  All of their screening histories will be examined.  This involves reviewing all of the smears.  The panel will have an algorithm for examining the smears and it will identify the number of cases in which there are discordant results.  A report in each case will be provided to the women involved.  The panel has its own quality assurance system and it wants to work systematically so that it can stand over this process.  We have been engaging with RCOG on a daily basis since it agreed to come on board with this review.</p></speech>

As for where this might leave us when this sorry saga is eventually complete and when every woman gets the justice she deserves, I note 28 cases are potentially before the courts and 209 women were not informed of the results.  If it is the case that the HSE has accepted liability for not informing Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na of her incorrect smear test, as Dr. McKenna put it, does that admission of liability apply to all 209 women?  As for those women who are not before the courts, how will they be compensated by the HSE?  I am asking a straight question, that is, was the acceptance of liability only in the case of this individual or was it in respect of all the women?  In answering that question, I want Dr. McKenna to bear in mind that when Mr. Gleeson, who was one of those people with responsibility for overseeing the process of informing or not informing the women, appeared before this committee, he did not and still to this day does not accept any mistake was made but yet in court, the HSE accepted liability that a mistake was made.  There are two parts to my question.  First, does the admission of liability apply only to this individual or does it apply to all 209 women?  In the latter case, how will they be compensated given there is no class action opportunity in this State?  Second, given that the individual who was responsible for the failure does not accept there was any failure, how will Mr. Connaghan, as the director general, deal with that problem?</p></speech>

If that is the case, 209 women were not informed.  Is the HSE accepting liability that it was a mistake, in respect of all 209 women, that they were not informed?  If that is the case, how will they be compensated?  Notwithstanding the other 209 cases, which Dr. McKenna can address shortly, there was an acceptance of liability in this case.  The person with responsibility for this process in the HSE, however, is still to this day saying he does not accept any failure on his part, which means there was no failure on the part of the HSE.

What would often happen in mediation would be that the process itself would be confidential so people could try to reach an agreement and offer positions that would allow that to happen.  What can happen at the end of that, particularly where dependents are involved, is that the outcome would be registered in the court so the actual outcome would be a public outcome.  The State Claims Agency, which has claims delegated to it and handles all the mediation and court processes, will be able to work this through with the committee next week in full detail.</p></speech>

The confidentiality aspect of a plaintiff is really that the individual does not want his or her name out there but details of the settlement could be out there without divulging the person's identity.  That is the person's right.  It is not something the State would impose.  The principle of open disclosure requires us not to push confidentiality agreements.

What happened though was that 221 women did not benefit from that.  It was quite the opposite.  What I am trying to get here is that the system accepted the results of the smear tests coming from the labs and now there is a serious question over the quality assurance and the checking of that.  Is that right?  There has to be a serious question on quality control with 221 women affected and more going to come to light.  Am I using the wrong language?</p></speech>

We are talking about the women affected.  Despite everything Mr. Connaghan talked about and despite the quarterly reports, something has happened here that this has failed.  That was not picked up by CervicalCheck nor by the HSE.  It came to our attention as a result of Ms Vicky Phelan speaking out and more women then coming forward.  Is that not right?

The first is the service specification, the second is the preparation of tender documentation and the third part is, after tender, mobilisation.  Those are three things on the critical path.  I am not able at this stage to tell Deputy O'Brien the time elements of each of those.  There are some things in play which we are going to try to deploy to speed things up.  Regarding tendering, there is a possibility that we can go for a negotiated contract which would truncate the tendering process.  We are considering that right now.</p> <p>  We need to tidy up the service specification and the tender documentation needs high level clinical input, so we need to have a clinical director for the CervicalCheck part.  We are working on that and we might have some news next week.  If that is the case, once we get that clinical input, authority, accountability and responsibility, it will allow us swiftly to close off the position in the service specification and to tender.  If we can go to a negotiated contract, then that might be the best way forward in getting HPV testing in place quickly.  There is also an element here of the capacity of each of the labs.  On what we want in respect of resilience, I have already given advice in response to a question raised by Deputy Catherine Connolly earlier.  My view is that we should have at least three or four.</p></speech>

I think my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, asked if the HSE had accepted liability for any part or role in respect of those 209 women, outside of Ms Vicky Phelan and Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.

My advice to Deputy Cullinane was that I know that the HSE has accepted liability for not providing the audit results.  Dr. McKenna has got further advice that there may be a clinical element to that and I would need to study all of the judgments to be able to give Deputy O'Brien a proper answer to that question.</p></speech>

She was also asked to sign a confidentiality agreement.  That was in March 2017.  One person I have met personally has told me that.  It is my information that there are a number of other women in similar situations.  I have yet to meet them but I am in the process of meeting with them.  If we are giving out information then we need to be 100% sure that it is accurate because I am sure Deputy Alan Kelly also has information that some of those 209 women have settled previously, before Ms Vicky Phelan's case became public knowledge, and have also been asked to sign confidentiality agreements.</p> <p>  I know that at least in one instance, the woman that I met, a case has been taken against the HSE for failings in CervicalCheck in not being referred to a gynaecologist and then developing cancer.  She is now, thankfully, in remission but she took a case, settled in March 2017 and signed a confidentiality agreement.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back with some additional information on those 209 women as regards exactly how many of them have taken cases against the HSE previously and been awarded settlements?  Those are the only questions I have at the moment.  </p></speech>

I find it unbelievable that the witnesses cannot provide the information relating to this protocol today.</p><p>Why is the protocol being pushed legally, particularly when it is preventing women from getting their slides?  Why can some solicitors representing women go into court and get the slides, thereby bypassing this protocol?  I do not understand how Mr. Connaghan cannot provide that information.</p><p> I understand what Ms Conroy is saying regarding the review of the 3,000 cases.  That is fine.  These are the words of Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap this morning.  They are surprised and disappointed and they were not aware of this.  It is not me or any other member of the committee saying this.  Whatever is going on, it had been expected that this would be completed by the end of May and would form part of the Scally inquiry.  It was not completed by the end of May.  When will it commence?  We now know that it is not part of the Scally inquiry.  Scally is already incomplete and a large chunk of the inquiry will be irrelevant.</p><p> On the previous occasion he was here, Mr. Connaghan said that he had to catch up with and meet Dr. Scally.  I presume he has done so on numerous occasions.  Has he visited Limerick?  Will Mr. Connaghan confirm that when Dr. Scally reports, he will not say that one reason he could not complete his report - which he will not be able to do - is because he was not provided some information by the HSE?  I want Mr. Connaghan to guarantee that Dr. Scally's review will not be able to say that at the end of August and that the HSE will have provided everything.</p><p> On the admission of liability in respect of non-disclosure of information, we know from Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na's case that this has been admitted.  Will that be the standard for all other cases?</p><p> Given what was said by a previous speaker, my next question is very important.  The State Claims Agency's clinical risk advisers met CervicalCheck in March 2017.  Why did the HSE not reveal the risk of this audit at that point?</p></speech>

Everything we have in our remit or within the HSE will be provided to the Scally inquiry.  The Deputy may not be aware that we sought and received agreement from the Minister that we will deploy section 40(c) of an Act, the name of which I have forgotten at this moment, that will allow us to send everything to Dr. Scally on an unredacted basis, save matters covered by patient confidentiality.  I have recently advised Dr. Scally of that.  The answer to the first question is that we will not hold anything back.</p> <p>  Will the Deputy remind me of the second question?</p></speech>

In the case of Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na, however, Mr. Connaghan clarified and accepted that there is liability on the part of the HSE and that an element of what happened was due, perhaps, to medical negligence - he does not have full details in that regard - and that another aspect involved her not being informed of the result of her smear test on foot of non-disclosure.  A monetary value was attributed in respect of the latter in court.  How many of the other 221 women were not informed of the results of their smear tests?</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right, that there is a sequence, but we need to be careful not to get to the end before we work through all of the issues with the State Claims Agency.  We have one case and it was last week.  We have to stand back, consider and assess it and then come to conclusions.  Doing it in the rapid way that might across the floor here could lead to us ending up in a place where none of us would want to be.</p></speech>

I have a further question on this matter and I will then finish.  I have no difficulty in stepping back, evaluating and learning from the court judgment in this case, but the committee has to consider the potential cost of an accepted failure by the HSE.  Can a note be given to the committee to help us understand it?  My question is valid and obvious.  If a monetary value is attached to non-disclosure in at least one case, it may also be attached in others.  That is my point.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Breslin-----</p></speech>

The legitimacy of the Deputy's question is plain to me.  The only risk is in doing it in real time.  Being fully apprised of the matter, having a clear understanding of the liabilities and where they fall between the laboratory and the State - the State Claims Agency will be part of it - and then accounting to the committee is the right thing to do.  However, if we do it in real time, we risk misstepping.</p></speech>

They separated two elements, telling us that the medical files were one matter, while the slides were another.  I have examined the contracts with Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology.  They are similar, if not identical.  Under the heading of "Storage and Disaster Recovery" on page 12, the contractor shall at the request of the national screening service forward eligible samples stored by the contractor or on the contractor's behalf to the national screening service or any third party specified by the service in a manner prescribed by it within three working days.  It seems clear from this that the national screening service is in control and ownership of the slides.  Why is there any question of a delay when the contract is clear about the contractors' obligations and the service's rights?</p> <p>  On radio in the past half hour, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan stated the HSE was holding up the protocol to agree to the release of slides and that, until this occurred, they could not be reviewed by clinical cytologists.  Is the HSE holding it up and, if so, why?  </p> <p>  Someone made reference to an apology, but an apology is hollow if it is not followed through with actions that will give it meaning.  We are being given the runaround on some of our questions.  The contract is clear, but we are not being given clear answers about the protocol.  If it is being held up, any claim about dealing sincerely with people who may have been harmed by the State is hollow.  Will the witnesses answer my question on the protocol?</p></speech>

As a process, we dragged out the three memorandums that existed.  Thanks to Ms Vicky Phelan and the other brave women who came forward, things are emerging.  Now we are quoting a solicitor.  It does not build confidence.  When Mr. Connaghan was before us a few weeks ago, I made this point to him.  It is not helpful.  Moreover, Dr. Scally had to come forward publicly and state he was not getting co-operation and he was not getting the information.  Bit by bit is the way this is proceeding.</p> <p>  My specific question is on the audit.  I am trying to tease this out.  Is the audit process now suspended?</p></speech>

As shown in Figure 1, on members&rsquo; screens, HSE direct expenditure on pay and pensions accounted for over one third of the expenditure, totalling &euro;5.36 billion.  This included around &euro;300 million paid for agency staff services.  Grants to section 38 and section 39 agencies accounted for just over a quarter of the expenditure and totalled &euro;4 billion.  Expenditure on primary care and medical card schemes, including drugs refund schemes, accounted for a fifth of the expenditure, or just under &euro;3 billion.<br/><br/>The HSE recorded income for the year totalling &euro;15.1 billion.  The bulk of this - 94% - came in the form of a revenue grant paid to the HSE out of the Vote for the Department of Health.  The balance of the income comprises charges to patients using HSE services, and a range of miscellaneous sources, including employee pension contributions paid by HSE staff and the proceeds of pension-related deductions in the health sector, which the HSE retains.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the increase in income in 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s outturn for the year was a net operating deficit of &euro;140 million - a significant deterioration year on year.  The 2016 deficit was &euro;10 million.  The operating deficit in a year represents an effective first call on the following year&rsquo;s recurrent grant funding provided from the Vote.<br/><br/>The HSE financial statements also include a capital income and expenditure account.  For 2017, this recorded income of &euro;462 million, mainly comprising capital grants from the Vote.  Expenditure in the year totalled &euro;454 million, resulting in a net capital surplus of &euro;8 million, which the HSE carried forward to 2018.  A capital surplus of &euro;15 million was brought forward from 2016 into 2017 but the HSE had not obtained formal ministerial sanction to do so<b>, </b>as is required under the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014.<br/><br/>The audit report on the HSE&rsquo;s 2017 financial statement drew attention to a continued significant level of non-competitive procurement by the HSE.  We found a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in regard to 36% of a sample of &euro;51 million worth of goods and services procured in 2017, spread across five HSE locations.  This is consistent with our findings in similar testing for many years past.  The HSE&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control outlines the steps it is taking to deal with this problem but states that it will take a number of years to fully address procurement compliance issues.  <br/><br/>The audit report also drew attention to inadequate monitoring and oversight of HSE grants to outside agencies, which is a continuing concern.<br/><br/>Members will recall last October examining chapter 19 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2016, which reviewed the HSE&rsquo;s framework for monitoring grants to service providers in the context of the audit of the 2016 financial statements of the HSE.  Our work for the 2017 audit, and that of the HSE&rsquo;s own internal audit, found that similar weaknesses recurred in 2017.  The HSE acknowledges the audit findings in the 2017 statement on internal control.<br/><br/>The appropriation account for Vote 38 - Health - before the committee relates to 2016.  As a result, the financial periods of the two sets of financial statements on today&rsquo;s agenda are out of step.  However, the substance of the relationship between them is the same during both years.<br/><br/>The majority of the Department&rsquo;s expenditure comprises recurrent and capital grant funding paid to the HSE.  This is accounted for across 17 subheads of the Vote, reflecting the historic basis for allocation of resources, rather than the programme-based type of presentation used in other Votes.</p><p>This is accounted for across 17 subheads of the Vote, reflecting the historic basis for allocation of resources rather than the programme-based type of presentation used in other Votes. </p><p> Non-HSE related expenditure under the Vote for health includes grants paid to a range of research, development and advisory bodies; payments in respect of hepatitis C compensation and other legal claims against the Department; and the Department&rsquo;s own administration costs.  </p></speech>

The other item on today&rsquo;s agenda, the HSE financial statements 2017, will be addressed in the first instance by Mr. Connaghan, as the accountable person for those accounts.</p> <p>  Since 2015, under the provisions of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014, funding of the HSE is provided from the Vote of the Minister for Health - Vote 38.  Accordingly, in 2016 the Department was responsible for a budget of &euro;13.649 billion for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister and certain other services administered by that office, including grants to the HSE and to research, consultative and advisory bodies.  The budget includes the additional &euro;500 million provided by Government in 2016 to the health Vote, by way of mid-year adjustment, to improve the base funding of the Department of Health.  This succeeded in 2016 with the health Vote coming in under budget by &euro;2.221 million without recourse to a Supplementary Estimate.  </p> <p>  I will now set out the main points of the 2016 accounts as they pertain to Vote 38.  Funding is allocated to the Department of Health in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department such as the HSE, the Mental Health Commission, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the HIQA and a range of other bodies.  In 2016, the Department had 400 staff.  The Department&rsquo;s role is to provide strategic leadership for the health service and to ensure Government policies are translated into actions and implemented effectively.  We support the Minister and Ministers of State in their implementation of Government policy and in discharging their governmental, parliamentary and departmental duties.  </p> <p>  Much of the public debate tends to be on weaknesses in our health services.  Identifying measures to address these in association with our colleagues in the HSE undoubtedly demands continuing work on the part of the staff of the Department.  However, we also have other roles.  Importantly, we seek to frame policies and legislation to promote health.  Under the Healthy Ireland umbrella, we work cross-sectorally to achieve this objective.  Our life expectancy, at 81.8 years, is now one year above the OECD average but there is much more that can be done to better promote health and prevent ill-health.  We also work internationally with EU colleagues and the World Health Organization on health issues.  Considerable work is under way with the EU and the United Kingdom to address the health challenges caused by Brexit and to ensure that North-South and east-west co-operation on health matters is maintained.  We also support the Minister and Ministers of State in their work including their legislative priorities and their public and parliamentary accountability.  For example, in 2017 the Department processed over 11,000 parliamentary questions, representing 22% of all parliamentary questions tabled to Ministers across Government. </p> <p>  The 2016 gross provision, current and capital, for Vote 38 was &euro;14.109 billion.  The 2016 outturn was almost &euro;14.107 billion, leaving an overall saving of &euro;2 million.  Of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure, &euro;205 million was provided to the Department-related subheads in respect of its own costs and in respect of grants to agencies under the aegis of the Department, other than the HSE.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;176 million, giving an underspend of &euro;29 million, and &euro;13.387 billion of the 2016 gross provision for current expenditure was provided to HSE related subheads.  The 2016 outturn for these subheads was &euro;13.405 billion giving an overspend of &euro;18 million.  The overspend primarily related to funding the existing level of service in both acute and community services and pension costs.  This overspend was met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The 2016 provision for capital expenditure was &euro;516 million and the 2016 outturn was &euro;525 million.  However, funding was transferred by means of virement to the capital subheads from savings elsewhere in the Vote to provide for capital developments at mental health facilities.  The 2016 appropriations-in-aid to the health Vote was on profile at &euro;460 million.  The end year net outturn for current and capital was &euro;13.647 billion against a net provision of &euro;13.649 billion, resulting in a saving to the Exchequer of &euro;2 million. </p> <p>  The Department continues to develop its policy and performance oversight in respect of a range of complex services falling within total public health expenditure.  We are working on a significant reform agenda in line with the report of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  This includes, as an initial important step, legislative proposals approved by Government to improve governance within the HSE through the introduction of a competency-based governing board this year.  Subsequent policy development is likely to see a strong national centre but with greater devolution of decision-making and accountability, including financial accountability, to regional integrated care organisations.  The further development and linkage of corporate and clinical governance at all levels within the health service, again in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report, will be a priority in ensuring the delivery of effective, safe and accountable health services. </p> <p>  I look forward to continuing to work with the committee and with the Oireachtas generally on this objective and am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#O00300"><p>I will introduce the senior management members with me today.  They are Mr. Stephen Mulvany, Mr. Liam Woods and Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan.  We have submitted information and documentation to the committee in advance of the meeting and I will therefore confine my opening remarks to a number of issues, the first of which is the financial outturn for 2017.  A Revised Estimate for health was approved and notified by letter of determination of 29 December 2017.  The HSE received once-off revenue funding of &euro;208.3 million to cover winter initiatives, State Claims Agency increased costs, the shortfall of acute hospital private patient income and central pay awards.  The HSE&rsquo;s annual financial statements for 2017 record a combined revenue and capital deficit of &euro;131.5 million.  Within this there is a capital surplus of &euro;8.3 million and a revenue deficit of &euro;139.9 million.  The total 2017 revenue deficit when deficits in section 38-funded providers are taken account of is &euro;165.9 million.</p> <p>  The most significant area of deficit in 2017 relates to the acute hospital division which was &euro;139.7 million.  The majority of this deficit - &euro;73 million - is attributable to income shortfalls and associated bad debt costs primarily related to hospital private maintenance charges.  In addition, there are cost overruns of 0.4% equivalent to &euro;13.4 million on pay and &euro;54 million or 3% related to non-pay of which the majority - &euro;44 million - relate to clinical non-pay.  A significant driver of these cost overruns is the provision of additional activity in response to service demand, the complexity of that activity and the growing age and related needs of hospital inpatients.  As evidenced within the health service capacity review 2018, Ireland reported the second highest occupancy rate of those countries reporting to the OECD.  This indicates a hospital system that is operating under considerable stress and which is short of the necessary capacity. </p> <p>  Social care services reported a deficit of &euro;24.5 million.  A significant element of the deficit in this area relates to the costs of providing residential care to people with an intellectual disability, including the provision of emergency placements which continue to be a significant pressure in 2018.  Individual placements can cost up to &euro;0.5 million.  The costs of compliance with HIQA residential standards in the intellectual disability sector has also been a contributory factor in the deficit.  </p> <p>  To put the HSE&rsquo;s financial performance in context, if we look back over the ten years from 2008 to 2017, there has been 0.68% or &euro;838 million in net Supplementary Estimates provided to the HSE in respect of areas directly related to service pressures and financial performance challenges.  The balance of supplementary funding over this period has been in respect of Exchequer-related or technical items outside of the HSE&rsquo;s control.  That is equivalent to 1.56% or &euro;1.9 billion.  It includes the PCRS at &euro;0.791 million or 0.64%, whose costs are largely driven by policy, legislation and related demographic and societal factors not amenable to normal financial management. </p> <p>  I will turn now to matters of exception reported on by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of 2017.</p><p>In the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate which accompanies the annual financial statement the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to concerns about the monitoring and oversight arrangements for grants to outside agencies, non-competitive procurement issues and also noted that the HSE had not received sanction from the Minister for Health for the capital surplus brought forward from 2016.  The HSE acknowledges these matters of concern and is progressing medium to long-term plans required to bring about improvements as follows.</p><p> I shall turn first to the issue of non-compliant procurement.  The HSE incurs procurable expenditure in excess of &euro;2.2 billion annually.  Given the scale and complexity of the HSE&rsquo;s overall procurement activity, it has been highlighted and acknowledged at previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and by my predecessor that it will take a sustained effort over a number of years to ensure high levels of compliance.  This is a key focus for the HSE.  The HSE, through its health business services, HBS, procurement function, continues to progress a transformational programme of reform of its procurement arrangements to improve compliance with public procurement regulations, increase the usage of contracts, put frameworks in place by it and liaise with the Office of Government Procurement.  The HBS procurement function works closely with the Office of Government Procurement.  There have been a number of successful tender outcomes, particularly in the utilities category such as electricity, fuel oil, gas, telecommunications and vehicles.  We also know that there is a considerable amount of work ahead in cleaning, security and professional services.  This collaborative effort is achieving value for money and contributing to an increase in overall procurement compliance and the development of the overall procurement reform programme.</p><p> The HSE is implementing a number of initiatives which are organised around three key themes: supporting infrastructure; sourcing and compliance.  Further detail of the steps being taken to address the issue of non-compliant procurement are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.</p><p> On the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies, the HSE has consistently acknowledged the positive role the voluntary sector plays in the development and delivery of health and personal social services.  The HSE is also acutely aware of the need for the appropriate level of oversight of the grants provided for outside agencies.  In 2017 just under &euro;4.1 billion of the HSE&rsquo;s total expenditure was related to grants to more than 2,000 outside agencies.  The agencies range from the large voluntary hospitals and disability organisations to small local community-based agencies.</p><p> The HSE&rsquo;s governance framework is consistent with the management and accountability requirements for grants provided from Exchequer funding as set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Circular 13/2014.  Weaknesses in the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies have previously been identified.  The HSE continues to take the necessary actions to address these weaknesses.  The national compliance unit which was established in 2014 supports the development of improved grant oversight by community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and hospital groups which have delegated responsibility for the management of the relationship with outside agencies at operational level.</p><p> Improved oversight has raised the level of compliance by grant funded agencies.  An example of the actions already taken is the external review of governance arrangements for section 38 providers  which is under way.  The purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place and aligned with those set out in the annual compliance statements provided by section 38 agencies for the HSE.  The main compliance issues identified in the review process relate to procurement, HR legacy issues and a need, in some instances, to establish an appropriate internal audit function.  It is expected that the external reviews commissioned will be completed by October.  Agencies will provide status reports on the progress made in addressing issues and such issues will be included in local operational oversight.  The HSE is committed to implementing a five year rolling programme that will prioritise section 38 agencies not reviewed in the current programme.  It will be extended to include the larger section 39 agencies.  Further details of the steps being taken to address the issue of weaknesses are published in the statement of internal control within the 2017 annual financial statements.</p><p> It would be remiss of me not to look ahead and consider the role of healthcare transformation and how we employ the HSE's assets and resources.  As is the case in many developed health systems, we face the challenge of growing user expectations, unmet need and core infrastructural deficits.  For many years we have been aware of the need for a shift in health service delivery in order to move from the more traditional focus of treatment and cure to that of prevention and treatment, when required.  The current arrangements for service delivery in Ireland are characterised by an over-reliance on more costly, hospital-based care, with continuing opportunities to deliver care more appropriately in primary and community settings.  There are challenges in responding effectively to the planned, unplanned and emergency needs of patients in hospitals.</p><p> Similar pressures are faced by services in primary and community services, including services for people with disabilities and people who need mental health support, with demand outstripping supply in many areas.  In addition, there is a growing need to maintain or replace our current infrastructure and equipment.  I am pleased to note that I am a personal supporter of the Sl&aacute;intecare report which signals a new direction of travel in relation to eligibility, delivery and the funding of health and social care in Ireland into the future.  We are implementing a range of programmes to prepare the ground for longer term transformation in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  There are tens of thousands of dedicated staff working in health services, changing practices, improving care for patients, advocating for and driving service improvements day in and day out.  Staff and management working locally are providing leadership and support for nationally supported initiatives, with the aim of reforming services and seeking to deliver higher value care.  A number of transformational programmes are continuing in 2018, with a particular focus on four key themes, the first of which is improving population health and well-being by keeping people well and reducing the incidence of ill health and supporting people to live as independently as possible.  The second theme is delivering care closer to home, with the intent of meeting the vast majority of the population&rsquo;s healthcare needs in more local settings, with institutional and hospital-based care being reserved for only those individuals who require complex, specialised, emergency care and even then only for the shortest time possible.  The third theme is the development of specialist hospital care networks by progressing numerous workstreams in our national clinical and integrated care programmes.  The fourth theme is the improvement of quality, safety and value by building support for effective care that is delivered according to best evidence of what is clinically effective in improving health outcomes by reducing variations in how care is delivered and developing skills and capacity for quality improvement in healthcare delivery settings.  In addition, we are developing structures and reconfiguring teams within the HSE to strengthen our approach to population need assessment, demographic analysis and the utilisation of service design in order to develop more equitable and effective resource allocation models, particularly for primary and community services.  This goes hand in hand with Mr. Breslin's statement on geo-alignments and local devolved responsibility.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s public health service was designed for a time when we had a different demographic profile.  Today the expectations surrounding clinical governance and standards have never been higher.  The population, however, is older.  Modelling forecasts tell us that the number of people aged over 65 years will increase by nearly 110,000 in the next five years.  The fact that people are living longer is great news, but a large proportion of this older age group now live with two or more chronic conditions which make many of them more vulnerable and frail.  This has a consequential impact on resources.  In that context, the imminent publication of the Department of Health&rsquo;s Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan provides a powerful opportunity to create much needed strategic certainty for the health and social care delivery system in Ireland.  We are committed to working with the Government and the Department to do this and implement the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.</p></speech>

Members will need the two slots as there are a lot of issues to be raised.  I have, at least, six that I want to raise and will certainly not get to raise all of them in the first round of questions.  Most of my queries relate to national, but there are two regional issues.  Mr. Connaghan is aware that all politics is local.  While there are two issues that are important to me, they have wider implications for the State.  The problems we have in the south east also seem to manifest elsewhere.  I will, therefore, offer them up as examples more than anything else.</p> <p>  I shall start with the deficit.  In his opening statement the Comptroller and Auditor General said the deficit was &euro;140 million.  Mr. Connaghan has said total the revenue deficit was &euro;165 million, but that it includes funding to section 38 organisations.  Is that correct?  Is it the case that the overall deficit is &euro;165.9 million?</p></speech>

The annual financial statements show the HSE's overall deficit.  It shows what we paid out to voluntary organisations.</p><p>When we include the section 38 agencies and the deficit they are running we arrive at that figure of the &euro;166 million.  We wanted to give a more representative figure.  Even though that extra bit is outside of our own annual financial statements, it is part of the overall health system.</p></speech>

Whereas in the past we would have had supplementary budgets if there was an overspend in health, we are led to believe they are gone, or at least in practice they should be gone.  I am trying to understand why there is a deficit, if Mr. Connaghan could help me with that first of all.  Is it because the HSE has increased capacity or is it because the costs of doing healthcare - the demand from the public - have increased?  Is it because the HSE is simply standing still while it costs more to provide the level of service that was provided in 2016?  Is the deficit there because the HSE is spending more to increase capacity?  Is it both?</p></speech>

It might be better if I start with the position over the last six months to a year.  Let us understand the impacts of what we have seen over the last winter, going back to the last part of 2017.  We know we had the worst flu season for ten years.  The health service coped adequately with that but it did drive additional costs in terms of isolation, intensive care unit, ICU, costs and extended lengths of stay and intensity.  That is one factor.  We also had some of the worst trolley figures ever over the course of the last six months, although taken year on year, as Mr. Woods stated to the health committee yesterday, we are roughly the same.  That period drove some really quite exceptional costs.  I had to make some decisions during that time in the interests of patient safety in terms of sourcing additional capacity, authorising things like weekend and overtime work just to ensure we could get people out of hospitals appropriately.  There were some decisions made around some of the winter pressures we had.  With that in mind and as an introduction to the kind of pressures that the health service faces, I will turn to Mr. Woods to add some colour to that in respect of 2017.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#Q00600"><p>In terms of the question about the key drivers in the hospital system of pressure on budget and cost overruns, in 2017, as was referenced in the director general's opening statement, there were two big factors, namely, the position relating to income and the charging and collection of statutory maintenance charges for people who opt to be treated privately.  The behaviour of insurers around that gave rise to a probable &euro;73 million of the total, which was &euro;139.7 million.  On the service delivery side, the biggest driver last year both in terms of growth year on year and against budget was the non-pay clinical costs of treating patients.  That was a &euro;44 million figure within a total service deficit of &euro;67 million.  Driving those costs are two factors, namely, the volume of care provided, which is increasing, and the complexity of care.  They underlie what is going on in the hospital system operationally.</p> <p>  The other factor the director general mentioned is that there was a &euro;13 million challenge against the pay budget.  That is against a pay base of over &euro;3 billion.  There are a couple of factors driving pay.  One is that it would include agency and locum costs, so the specialing within the hospital system of cases that have high-intensity need around the clock is a factor.  That is growing as an element of cost.  Clearly, effective movement to community of people who are fit for discharge is an important piece in managing that.  That is a driver.  The other is to control the total numbers of those employed within the health environment.</p></speech>

That gives me answers as to why there was a deficit.  Essentially, Mr. Woods is saying the two main drivers in terms of acute hospital spend were that the volume of care has increased as has the complexity, which I imagine is things like unexpected flu outbreaks and so on, resulting in greater isolation and containment needs.</p> <p>  Mr. Connaghan also mentioned the trolley figures.  I imagine they reflect increased demand with more people looking for beds when there are not enough beds.  We know that.  The more demand and pressure on hospitals, the more spend there will be.  However, why is that not forecast?  Why was it not built in to the estimation of the spend?  Were the circumstances really exceptional?  Were they outliers or were they potentially foreseen?  Did we just not allocate enough money in last year's voted expenditure to health to cover what should have been the amount given to make sure we were in a position to properly treat patients?</p></speech>

Over the time period, ED attendances of people aged 75 years and older were up 6.7% and ED admissions over that period were up by 6.4% for the over 75s.  ED attendances across the whole population were up 4.8% so there is considerable pressure that I do not think was anticipated at the start of the year.  The other factor, which is important in relation to those who are over 75, is that it is quite clear - and this is very welcome - that with the population living longer, there are more patients presenting with more complex needs inside our hospital system.  There are some marvellous studies available about the level of comorbidity or multiple chronic conditions currently in the population.  I think I said in my opening statement that this is a factor, so the complexity of care is also increasing.</p></speech>

According to figures I have from parliamentary questions submitted by one of my colleagues, agency spend by all of our acute hospitals has doubled since 2011, going from &euro;158 million to &euro;293 million.  We seem to have a greater dependency on agency staff.  Mr. Woods may be in a position to answer my question as to whether we are getting good value for money.  Is this the best way to deliver healthcare, having such dependence on agency staff?  Why has expenditure gone from &euro;158 million to &euro;293 million since 2011?</p></speech>

However, in terms of the core of the Deputy's question, our overall approach is to seek to reduce agency staff figures and in 2017 in the acute system there were reductions.  The three main components of agency costs in the acute system are medical, nursing and healthcare assistants.</p></speech>

For example, in medical agency the cost has gone down by 10%, but there is no doubt that there is a premium cost attached to agency.  As Mr. Woods said, about 6% of our total pay cost is agency, so about 94% of it is not but is our own staff.  Agency is essential at times, but there are parts of the country where the cost premium - Mr. Woods talked about the average - can be higher, particularly in respect of medical agency.  The issue is the market and the availability.  To be very clear for Deputies, our aim is to reduce as much as possible the cost of agency.  Not only are there cost issues associated with it, there is also not as much continuity of care.  We sometimes end up with agency costs because there is a demand to open or maintain capacity at short notice.</p></speech>

My final point on this is that notwithstanding that, it strikes me as odd that agencies can provide staff for many of these services but we cannot recruit those staff into the public sector.  If there is a premium and an increased cost, how is it that agencies can recruit these staff yet hospitals or non-acute settings cannot?  I ask that this be addressed in the context of whatever briefing paper is given to us as well.</p> <p>  On a related matter, I wish to come to one of the regional issues.  I gave prior notice to Mr. Connaghan that I would raise this issue.  A briefing note on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, was given to Oireachtas Members in the south east.  Waterford and Wexford form one catchment area for CAMHS.  We had five child psychiatrist positions at University Hospital Waterford last year.  One of the psychiatrists retired and three resigned citing workload, poor infrastructure and not being listened to.  They resigned out of frustration and annoyance at not getting answers to questions they were putting.  The briefing note I have been given by the Department states that with effect from Friday, 6 July, there will only be one consultant paediatric psychiatrist employed in the Waterford area and that person will be on annual leave from 9 July 2018, which was pre-booked in April.  In other words, we will have no child psychiatrist at all in Waterford - none.  The only service being supplied at the moment is an agency consultant coming from Galway to do a clinic at weekends.  The actual child psychiatrist provision and the resultant care they would give to people is almost non-existent.</p> <p>  How did it get to the sorry state that we are left with one child psychiatrist in one hospital?  This is an issue throughout the State.  The briefing note also states there is difficulty in recruiting child psychiatrists.  How did we end up in a situation whereby three psychiatrists resigned, with the reasons they have given, not on Mr. Connaghan's watch but certainly on the HSE's watch, and whereby for a period there will be no cover whatsoever in one of our major acute hospitals?  How did this happen?</p></speech>

Nationally, we have 2,900 consultants of all types in the Irish health service.  We have more than 300 current vacancies across that complement.  Regarding the questions the Deputy has raised about excess costs around locums, in many ways one can see the relationship there in terms of what we need to do to try to fill service slots to keep services running with expensive agency, locum and overtime rates.  When the Deputy gets the analysis, I hope he recognises that.</p> <p>  Regarding the position in the south east, I will start with budgets.  The south-east community health care mental health budget was increased from &euro;83.5 million in 2012 to &euro;99.4 million-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#R01500"><p>I ask Mr. Connaghan to bear with me for one second.  I do not want to be rude in any way.  My questions were very specific.  Notwithstanding whatever money was allocated, we now do not have the staff.  Money might have been allocated, but three psychiatrists have left.  They have walked out on his organisation.  They have left.  They are gone.  They have said they have had enough.  They have been raising issues for years.  They have not been listened to, so they are gone.  Now children in Waterford and Wexford and elsewhere are being left without cover.  I will read out to Mr. Connaghan from one of the newspapers one quote from one of the children involved.  She said:</p><blockquote>Just giving people medication and telling someone 'we'll see you in two weeks' isn't enough ...  And what was given to me first wasn't even right for me as things turned out.  They definitely need to do [an awful] lot more.</blockquote> <p>This issue was echoed by the three consultants who resigned.  Why did they resign?  Why did it take their resignations for the HSE to listen to their concerns?  Does Mr. Connaghan accept that it is unacceptable that this has left children in Waterford and the south east with mental health issues with no cover or very little cover?</p></speech>

What I am going to give him here is not new because we have been aware that there have been issues since at least October 2017 and I think much earlier in terms of the provision of the service.  First, we have a national and international search and recruitment under way to fill these posts.  Tomorrow will be an important date for that because we have a teleconference with a number of interested candidates from the UK.  This is new news.  We think we might be able to get at least two of those to come on board very quickly.</p></speech>

What is extraordinary about his response is that while every effort is being made by the HSE to get replacements, which is fine, and I have a briefing note in which all that is covered, it should not have come to this.  We had three psychiatrists providing a service and they walked out, and what we are hearing is that more will do exactly the same in other parts of the country.  This is leaving CAMHS in crisis.  Mr. Connaghan said himself that the HSE was aware of these issues going back to 2017 and before that.  I am asking Mr. Connaghan, as director general, why were these people not listened to then?  Why was corrective action not taken?  Now the HSE is left scrambling to look internationally, doing conference calls and all the other work to fill the posts whereas the HSE had people in posts and they felt it was so bad that they walked away.  In fact, I heard one of them on national radio in a very distressed state, almost feeling guilty that he walked away from his post, but felt he had no choice because people in power, people with responsibility for delivering services, were not listening to him.  How does Mr. Connaghan respond to him and to the patients who are now being left without a service?  Whatever is being done now is great, and the HSE has to do its job to fill those posts, but Mr. Connaghan has to account for why those people left in the first place and why, as we sit here, patients in Waterford and elsewhere, young people, are not getting the services they should get.</p></speech>

We are in the process of conducting, or have conducted, exit interviews with each of those consultants to find out the issues.  Clearly, we cannot recruit new people into a service if we have not listened to the concerns of those who have been in post in the past.  If it is an issue of minor capital, we will address that.  If it is an issue of major capital, clearly, we cannot turn that on overnight.  I would expect that the first port of call would be that local discussion on the issues that require improvement and need to be put in place swiftly.</p></speech>

I accept Mr. Connaghan is new to the post.  I must say he is very forthright and very upfront in answering questions, and I commend him on that.  I gave him prior notice that I would raise this issue because it is very important and will have wider national implications.  I spoke to one of those psychiatrists myself, and he said many of his colleagues across the State feel exactly the same and could make the same decision.</p><p>It will be a very serious situation.</p><p> My final question relates to section 38 agencies and organisations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done some work on this issue and we have had to deal with a number which have come before the Committee of Public Accounts where there were serious issues and breaches in governance arrangements, how money was spent and so on.  Mr. Connaghan said in his opening statement that &euro;4.1 billion of the total expenditure is spent by these agencies, which in itself is incredible.  We seem to have an increased dependency on section 38 organisations, which is possibly part of the problem.  In some respects, we are over-reliant on them and we cannot pull back when there are problems because there is no one there to pick it up.  The HSE itself cannot pick up the slack if corrective action is taken.</p><p> Mr. Connaghan said in his opening statement that the purpose of these reviews is to confirm that appropriate governance arrangements are in place.  I would argue that the weaknesses in governance are not the problem.  They are part of the problem.  Enforcement is a problem.  If these organisations do not see any sanction, there will be more and more of this.  How many of them have come before the Committee of Public Accounts?  We have not even heard from some.  One is the hospice in Harold's Cross.  There is a report on that which we have not got to yet, though we will.  Is Mr. Connaghan satisfied that the sanctions are robust enough to make sure that we do not have recurring issues with governance failures and misspending of money by these section 38 organisations?  The Comptroller and Auditor General has reported on this.  Is he satisfied that we have seen improvements in compliance and governance generally across this system?  Are we in a better place now than when we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, first examined this issue?  I will leave it at that until I get the response.</p></speech>

The acute sector includes voluntary hospitals etc.  I am assured that we have a comprehensive control and oversight mechanism in place.  It looks very different from what I understand was in place a couple of years ago.  We have a service arrangement in detail and an annual agreement with penalties for late completion in place for section 38 and larger section 39 bodies.  We have grant aid agreements for section 39 organisations.  Against that background, we have an annual compliance statement which covers things like governance, risk, pay policy, tax and procurement which comes from each of these organisations.  Annual financial statements for the larger organisations are audited and approved.  We monitor that through an annual financial monitoring return.  The process that is in place is fine.</p> <p>  The Deputy will ask me how effective it is.  One might have the greatest process in the world and if it delivers something, it is fine.  All of that is good on paper.  We then come to what we have put in place over the course of the past year, as I understand it.  I can only go back to my knowledge from the past six months to a year.  We have fully established a compliance unit at national level and we are in the process of rolling out the work of that compliance unit to more local situations so that each locality has the capability to have oversight and compliance locally.  That also covers the external review for the section 38 bodies, which is under way at Deloitte.  There are 40 reviews.  Some 31 have been finalised and recommendations will be put back to the organisations.  We are tracking these through.  Lastly, we have internal audit.  I have recently taken the decision to extend the internal audit capability for the HSE such that, when we come to 2019, there will be greater capability.  For me, we have enough processes on paper.  We need to make that work as we proceed into 2019.</p></speech>

The systems are improving.  The great value of having systems and the kinds of reviews that he is talking about is that there is a systematic focus on all of the issues rather than one issue becoming a popular issue that everybody is focused on, then it moves on and things fall back into process.  The governing organisations within section 38 and 39 bodies will be forced by the systems that have been put in place to address this and to provide assurance on a routine basis.  The one area where it is very important that the HSE keeps a focus is on its own internal review escalation and dealing with the issues as they come out of the reporting process.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin said that in 2017, the Department processed more than 11,000 parliamentary questions, 22% of all parliamentary questions for Ministers across Government.  I know from my experience that practically everything I table in parliamentary questions to the Department of Health receives a one line reply, referring it to the HSE.  I am not asking Mr. Breslin to do it now, but will he give us a breakdown of that 22%, indicating how many go to the HSE?  It probably overstates the amount of work that falls on the Department and understates the work that falls on the HSE in responding to questions.  Many of the questions that I pose which go to the HSE can take some time to come back.  It would be useful to hear from the HSE the quantum of work relating to parliamentary questions.  If that is not available now, it would be quite useful for us to get information.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions relating to how money is spent when people are in an acute hospital because there is inadequate provision of home care packages, although I know it is always finite.  The witnesses gave us a note on that.  I asked some parliamentary questions about this which the HSE replied to.  Like most other Deputies, we look at people coming through the door in our constituency offices.  We see the kinds of challenges that people face.  It would give us some sort of insight about how services go and are provided.  What is the average cost of an overnight acute hospital stay?</p></speech>

In looking at an individual case, I wonder how it is playing out generally.  I asked a question and got a reply in June about community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 7, Kildare and west Wicklow.  There has been an increase in the budget between 2014 and 2018.  When I asked a question about the availability of a home care package for an individual person, I was told that the money for this year had been spent earlier this year.  There is no scope in my location for home care packages.  The &euro;6.9 million is essentially all accounted for at this stage.</p><p>I understand there is a degree of scoping out for a year for a particular individual, and that may change if somebody goes into a nursing home.  There is a bit of flexibility in that.  Is that the same throughout the process or is it just in one particular area of the country?  Is it the same profile?</p></speech>

That is the same everywhere.  Different areas will come under pressure because of capacity issues.  In fairness, a significant amount of the tens of millions of euro invested over recent years has been invested additionally in home care.  As the Deputy indicated, there is no argument that it is, for those for whom it is suitable, a far better option than the more expensive acute care.  Fundamentally, there is a limit so we prioritise discharge from hospitals.  That means we can end up with people in the community waiting and it is an area of constant focus between ourselves and colleagues in the Department about reprioritising the resource we have.  Fundamentally, there will be a limit.  It is a reality.</p></speech>

We have queues of people who could benefit from home care as another means of care but there is no money to deal with it.</p></speech>

During the year there is typically some level of a winter initiative that the Department generally prioritises.  Further funding comes from that and we will see during the year if we can prioritise resources towards home care.  It gets much focus but as has been mentioned, eventually the limit is reached.</p></speech>

In 2016, the budget for the area was &euro;349 million.  In 2017 it was &euro;377 million and in 2018 it was &euro;417 million.  There has been an increase of approximately &euro;67 million in investment in the area, notwithstanding inflation over the past two years.</p></speech>

The 2018 national service plan has home support services for approximately 50,000 packages.  As of May this year, the HSE is providing funding for home support for 52,700 packages.  That is 5% or so more than what is in the current national service plan.  As the chief financial officer has outlined, at some point there is a limit in what we do in terms of prioritising what we can.  Where the Deputy is going is absolutely appropriate.</p></speech>

Going back to the section 38 and section 39 bodies and the weaknesses in the process, given the amount of money allocated was &euro;4.1 billion, members will recall examining last October chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for the public services for 2016.  It reviewed the HSE's framework for monitoring grants for service providers.  The final sentence indicates that the HSE acknowledges that the audit findings of the 2017 statement on internal control make it obvious that what occurred in 2016 reoccurred in 2017.  I accept the point made that there is a systemic examination ongoing.  What did the HSE do as a consequence of some of those weaknesses?  Will the witnesses give a few examples of weaknesses identified and if there was a financial implication identified?  Were there penalties applied to change behaviour?  A few examples would be helpful.</p></speech>

During the course of 2017, and with regard to the work of the national compliance unit established, we wrote to all chief executives and chairs of section 38 and section 39 bodies, bringing to their attention the key findings of national and systemic importance that were uncovered through internal audit.  It has always been a criticism from this committee that something in one organisation is sorted but downstream we might find some of the exact same issues reoccurring.  We have taken that on board.  One of our key actions has been to ensure that the learning from internal audits is not just compartmentalised to one organisation but is spread out.  We made it an absolute requirement that chairmen and chief executives note these.</p></speech>

To take one example, an issue in the past was late signing of the service level agreement, the key governance document between ourselves and the relevant voluntary body.  We instituted a policy of withholding cash at a level of 20% from organisations, which has had a significant effect on improving the speed at which people will get their service level agreements signed.  There are also a number of incidents based on internal audits where there may be a requirement to pursue a return of moneys and some of those are being progressed.</p></speech>

For example, St. Raphael's Garda credit union was a case we dealt with some time ago in which salary increases were awarded outside what was allowed.  A repayment of those was to be sought.  Is that the kind of example to which the witness is referring?</p></speech>

One of the outputs of the external review ongoing currently is to determine the precise amount that we need to pursue with the organisation.  My expectation is we must address that directly with the Order of St. John of God.  It is not a sanction but it relates to reimbursement.</p></speech>

The number of oral questions, and they are all done within the Department, is 597 in 2017.  The number of written questions answered by the Department is 3,205.  A further 152 are answered by the Minister having been referred to the HSE.  Some 7,900 are assigned within the Department, looked at, signed out to the HSE, there is liaison with the HSE and then the answer comes from the HSE.  In a very significant number of them the final piece is done by the HSE.  The HSE can comment on the daily work involved in responding to those.  I also have a page which shows the responsiveness of the HSE to those referrals, that is, how many of the questions the HSE gets that are answered within ten working days.  I have those statistics.</p></speech>

What stands out for me with regard to speech and language therapy, CAMHS and the assessments of needs is that there appears to be a failing across all areas in one healthcare area, CHO 4, which covers Kerry, north Cork, north Lee, south Lee and west Cork.  In terms of speech and language therapy, in March this year there were almost 11,000 assessments waiting to be carried out, which was a 5.5% increase from September last year.  The good news is that 70% of them are being carried out within four months, which is positive.  It is slightly down on last year when it was slightly higher.  The bad news, however, is that 28% of children are waiting more than a year for speech and language therapy.  Some 50% of all the assessments that are currently outstanding are in the CHO 4 area.</p> <p>  In terms of CAMHS, in March this year there were 2,691 people waiting for assessment, which was a 15% increase since September 2017.  Some 14% of them, 386 people, are waiting more than a year.  Of those, 55% are in the CHO 4 area.  Regarding assessments of needs, in March this year there were 4,242 people waiting for assessments.  Of those, 80% are waiting beyond the statutory timeframe of three months.  Again, 50% of them are in the CHO 4 area.  Clearly this area has issues which need to be addressed.  Do the witnesses have any comments on this area within the organisation?  It is falling far behind everywhere else across the board in terms of speech and language, CAMHS and assessments of needs.  Can the director general tell me the reason?  That is my first question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#U01700"><p>For any child to wait longer than is necessary is a tragedy.  Looking at some of the other services aside from the ones outlined by the Deputy today, clearly our position is not one we would want to readily accept.  We should be doing better, particularly for children.  It is important because of the stage of development they are at and the implications for later in life.  We understand the gravity of the question the Deputy is asking.</p> <p>  There was some investment in this area in 2016 and 2017.  I realise it is difficult to attract staff to certain locations.  We need to do more in terms of providing cross-regional support, so if there is one CHO that is in trouble because it cannot attract and retain staff or where we do not have the right mix we must do more.  Looking at the statistics here, it is 50% in CHO 4 but it is nothing in CHO 1 or CHO 2, for example.  The question is what we can do to provide cross cover.  That is the first issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is due to meet officials soon and we will wait to see what action plan comes out of that.  However, we accept that the numbers waiting for speech and language therapy services are high and that more must be done.  We want to address the absolute resource in these areas as part of the Estimates process as we approach 2019.</p> <p>  With regard to the CHO 4 area, Cork and Kerry, an additional 13 posts were allocated in total.  I do not have the up-to-date details regarding where we are in the recruitment cycle for those, but I can find out and forward that information to the Deputy.</p></speech>

That must be recognised as well.  However, there is definitely an issue across the board in the CHO 4 area.  Perhaps a little more focus could be put on that.  I do not know if it is due to recruitment or other other issues, but it must be examined.</p></speech>

A situation such as that described by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien would be very unusual and I am not aware of employees receiving payment other than their HSE salary.  However, if the Deputy is aware of such practices, I would be very interested in knowing more about them.  Some work relating to income collection is facilitated because the hospital must submit claims, including consultant claims, in order to receive payment.  That is about getting income for the hospital.  That is the only such practice of which I am aware.</p></speech>

He has a hard job ahead of him and will be under constant scrutiny, which is of importance in regard to the spending of public money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that the overall spend was &euro;15.2 billion for 2016 but &euro;13.64 billion was referenced in Vote 38 health.  Can the witnesses explain that difference of &euro;1.6 billion?</p></speech>

Two sets of accounts are involved.  One is the appropriation account for 2016, the lion's share of which goes to the HSE, and the other is the HSE 2017 accounts.  To make life even more complicated, the appropriation account contains the gross amount or total spend and the Exchequer amount or net spend because we get some income from sources other than the Exchequer such as the United Kingdom, which contributes money.  The amounts can be reconciled but doing so is not very straightforward.</p></speech>

Income from patient charges, superannuation etc. offsets some of that cost.  The net figure is approximately &euro;14 billion.

Could the problems in the health service be resolved were the Government or Minister for Health to decide to allocate &euro;16 billion to the HSE or does the answer lie in increasing efficiencies?  I am regularly asked about that issue.  It is frequently stated that the funding of the HSE is adequate to provide the service needed across all sectors but that we are not getting value for money and more efficiency is needed.  I put that to the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#V03000"><p>It is a case of all of the above.  Nobody could say that every euro is used as effectively as it could be by the HSE.  That is the experience of health services the world over.  We have some distance to go to ensure that we are best in class in the delivery of services.  The expanding and aging population is placing us under pressure to grow services and that pressure will continue.  Waiting for additional money to fall through the letter box every year for investment in new services will not be sufficient to address the demand for those services.  We must also consider how our services are organised and how productive they are.  That is at the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare report to which Mr. Connaghan made reference.  One often finds that individual parts of the service are working productively but that services are not properly joined up and the right services are not being offered in the right places.  Taking the example made earlier, a person waiting for a year for speech and language therapy will experience developmental delay as a result and his or her requirements, when eventually seen, will be significantly more complex than would have been the case had earlier treatment been provided.  Putting resources into a primary care community setting for far more accessible care can often help us avoid some of the more expensive approaches of highly specialist care such as acute hospital care and so on.  That is key to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  Also of significant importance is working very smartly, using information and technology and doing things really well.  I earlier mentioned telehealth in that regard.  We need to move forward with a huge reform agenda.  While that will not be delivered with a static budget, nor can it have an open-ended chequebook.</p><p>No country in the world can afford that.</p></speech>

Are we getting value for money?  We are told we are spending as much per person as they are in other countries but we are not getting the same value for our buck.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his kind opening remarks.</p> <p>  What examples do we have of the ability of the health service right now in Ireland to pursue good value for money?  That was the first question.  The second question is: how can we spread that best practice throughout Ireland?  I will consider the three different types of value-for-money activity in terms of our pursuit of better value for the public purse.  One is what I would call the usual suspects.  They are the basic things that are non-clinical in essence.  They are good procurement, conversion of agency posts into full-time and substantive posts, efficiencies in back office services such as print, energy and postage, and shared non-clinical front-line services.  We do not need to have 29 or 56 of everything for Ireland.  They are things that are being pursued right now by each CHO and each hospital group.  That is the first category.  One must understand that the first category only touches a certain element of the cost base.  One needs to look beyond it in terms of being able to look at the entire &euro;15.2 billion.</p> <p>  The second category I will draw the committee's attention to is clinical efficiency.  We need to do a lot more in that regard.  Clinical efficiency does not mean we need to get our clinicians to work harder - although maybe in some cases we do - but to work smarter with better technology and more modern methods of delivery of services where we help clinicians to do that.  An example is the pursuit of theatre efficiency.  We know if we were to arrange things better and look at the best performing theatre system in Ireland we would probably get more throughput but to do that we would probably need some investment in things like theatre systems and new and innovative ways of working.  That is an example of clinical efficiency.</p> <p>  The third and biggest area, which is where most of the &euro;15 billion would lie, is in what I would call efficiencies associated with the model of care.  I will boil that down into a couple of big things.  Sl&aacute;intecare gives us a hook here.  One of the big hooks is the separation of elective and unscheduled care.  I came from a system where we had developed that over a five-year period.  What we found by separating elective and unscheduled care was much greater efficiency in terms of throughput because it was unrestricted and not stopped by the vagaries of winter.  Where there was protected elective time we could plan efficiency and throughput through a system, which in that case was protected.  The idea in Sl&aacute;intecare to do something with investment in that would drive better clinical efficiency.  Another example is we can do things differently.  Mr. Breslin made reference to the fact we are doing too much in acute systems.  If I take some of the examples such as the Sligo air care model or the Letterkenny urology model, which move activity out of the hospital system into the community, they mean faster delivery which is closer to home and also more efficient.  It allows clinicians in the acute system to concentrate on the things they need to concentrate on.  They are three buckets of things on which we can pursue value for money.  We are only part of the way down that road.</p></speech>

As a result of the recent fallouts over the cervical cancer thing, it is generally thought by the public that no one in the HSE can be touched or moved aside.  I am not picking on any individual but if a member of personnel is not up to scratch and not doing his or her job, are there sanctions in which the person can be moved aside or sacked if necessary?  It is important because of the recent scandals, or whatever one wants to call them, that the public is assured that if someone is not up to scratch something will happen.  If people in other Departments, particularly in other countries, are not up to scratch they are taken out or moved aside.  In this country, the public's opinion is that no one in the HSE can be touched and that no matter what goes wrong no one takes responsibility, no one is moved aside, demoted or moved to some other Department and the person is left in his or her position and the thing just goes on.  Can Mr. Connaghan answer that question?  It is important with regard to the public having confidence in the HSE.</p></speech>

I will address it in two parts.  I gave the committee, in the session immediately before this, an answer about what we are doing and the conduct of the investigation.  I have to be absolutely neutral on this.  We have 116,000 staff in the HSE.  Many of them are doing a fantastic job every day of the week, particularly when it comes to times when the provision of healthcare to the nation is threatened such as during storms and snowfall.  Many of them are doing a fantastic job.  That is reflected in patient satisfaction surveys.  The Deputy raises a more fundamental point about the process in place to assess, in particular, senior managers and staff in responsible positions.  How do we assess whether The objectives they are meant to pursue in a year on a personal basis have been delivered?  We do not have such a system operating in the Irish healthcare system.  It is something we need to consider carefully as we go forward.  It is one of the things on my radar.</p></speech>

I will not go over the issue of juvenile services again.  It is a disgrace that we do not have a juvenile psychiatrist.  My constituency is in the south east and includes Kilkenny and Waterford.  We do not have a juvenile psychiatry service in the south east.  If a young person has a problem and it is addressed early there is less expense on the HSE, the country and the taxpayer but the five counties in the south east have no psychiatric service for under 18s.  I will not dwell on it.</p> <p>  I want to ask about psychiatric services for adults in St. Luke's in Kilkenny.  This week a strike was averted by management which was planned because of overcrowding of the psychiatric unit in St. Luke's where there are 44 beds in two units.  I raised the issue in the D&aacute;il.  The strike has been called off.  It is the second time a strike has been threatened by SIPTU workers as a result of the overcrowded conditions.  They had to say they would not work in the system that was in place.  I am told a bed management officer is needed for the south east, including Wexford, Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  That would be an officer to manage the beds.  There is also a unit promised for Clonmel to relieve the pressure on Kilkenny.  The same is required in Wexford and Waterford.  Has the HSE a plan for psychiatric services in the south east, both juvenile and adult?  I am speaking in particular about St. Luke's and the unit there that is overcrowded.</p></speech>

At the very beginning, I need to conclude some stuff on the previous topic.  In the interval, while we had the break, I had a chance to speak to Mr. Stephen Teap and Ms Vicky Phelan.  It is not good news.  I also had the opportunity to listen to Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na's interview, one of the most emotional interviews ever on RT&Eacute; radio.  Ms Phelan stated on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" that, after speaking to Scally, the HSE is not co-operating.  This is Ms Vicky Phelan saying this, not me or anyone here.  I asked Mr. Connaghan a question earlier.  I asked would he be able, by the end of August, to ensure that the HSE had provided full co-operation.  Ms Phelan stated on radio, and to me privately as well, that the information was not being provided.  According to her conversation with Dr. Scally this morning, there was still information he was not getting, much information was being redacted, and there was much legal process before information was being provided and questions were not being answered.  That is what she said.  I am paraphrasing what Ms Phelan stated on radio, which is the same as what she said to me.</p> <p>  This is a live situation.  This is Ms Vicky Phelan said this on national radio a little less than an hour ago.  Ms Phelan is referencing her conversation with Dr. Scally.  There is something significantly wrong and Mr. Connaghan is in charge.</p></speech>

I will deal with the position of redaction first.  I would advise the committee that we have sought and received permission from the Minister to apply section 40C in relation to all the information we hold.  That information can now be released in an unredacted format.  We took action last Friday when we received that.</p></speech>

I met with Mr. Scally last week.  We had previously sought, at the back end of last week, a section 40C direction from the Minister which would allow us to supply everything to Mr. Scally on an unredacted basis.</p> <p>  We had previously supplied redacted documents.  We, therefore, worked over the weekend to re-provide all of those documents.  My belief is - I have been told - that all of those have been supplied as of the close of play last night.  I will just check again that that has been done.</p> <p>  Dr. Scally is comfortable in so far as he tells me that if there is something, particularly in relation to patient confidentiality - this will be very, very rare - we will take that out because we need to preserve some of the interests of the patients in this as well.  All of that should be provided.</p> <p>  In relation to the provision and searchability of documents, one of the things that hampered the position between Dr. Scally and the HSE right at the very outset was the different platforms that we had in terms of their use and searchability.  We have made recommendations - I think Dr. Scally has taken these board - that we invest in an appropriate eDiscovery platform which can search anything.  For the very few instances where we do not have original documentation that can be searched through the normal Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Pro, we can use eDiscovery platforms with OCR to be able to identify everything.  We are now on that.  My position, just now, is that we have certainly turned the corner in the course of the development over the last week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#X01600"><p>I thank Mr. Connaghan for that.  There is a fundamental issue here.  The lady who brought us to this stage is on national radio, on the most listened-to programme on radio in Ireland, stating that she heard in conversation with Dr. Scally this morning that the HSE is not co-operating fully.  That is merely a fact.  Everybody in Ireland who was listening heard it.  I listened to it after speaking to Ms Phelan.</p> <p>  I accept what Mr. Connaghan is saying.  Whatever is going on, it is not working.  There is not a hope in hell of Dr. Scally having a comprehensive report by the end of August.  I am saying it now - not a hope in hell.  We already know it will not be comprehensive because the 3,000 cases will not have been reviewed and that will not tally.  That means the report itself will not be comprehensive.</p> <p>  I am sorry but this is deeply unacceptable to the public watching the committee today.  I was emotional listening to Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na on the radio today.  I will not get into what was said because Mr. Connaghan would not have had the chance to hear it but the whole country is talking about it.</p> <p>  It is time for a quick period of reflection and change course as regards how information is being provided to Scally and, immediately, although I accept Mr. Connaghan has not had time yet to get rid of this protocol that the HSE is undertaking with this firm.  If this protocol exists tomorrow, my confidence in the HSE as an organisation will have collapsed.  No legal protocol can be put in place that will take this length of time.  These women are entitled to their information.  Just, bloody well, give it to them.  If they go to the High Court, they will get it anyway because the HSE will be too embarrassed in front of a judge.  Will the HSE just give these 80 to 90 women the information they are all looking for?  Never mind about protocols, for dignity purposes give it to them.  Many of these women do not have the time.  Mr. Connaghan should just do that.</p> <p>  My third issue relating to the information provided is that the process for moving the HPV would be in place by October.  According to the liaison committee which met, and I spoke to Mr. Teap, that committee was told that it would be at least the first quarter of next year.  So which is it?  That is a complete contradiction.</p> <p>  I will leave it at those three issues on CervicalCheck.  Then I will come back to other matters.</p></speech>

I briefed the committee at the previous session on the four parts of the critical part that we need to put in place around HPV introduction.  We need to get this absolutely right.  It is so important for the women of Ireland that we do not want to rush on it.</p> <p>  One can understand our national caution about pitching something to the committee here that says we will promise to have this in by October, and that does not materialise.  I would be back in front of the committee being asked about what went wrong.</p> <p>  It may well be that we are able to get something in sooner rather than later if our position on a negotiated contract with some of the laboratories that are interested in doing this are more fruitful in the short term rather than the long term, but we will take out the tendering process and tender evaluation part of that.</p> <p>  I hope we will have a clinical director next week who we can put into this full time to be able to take the service specification and make sure it is fine from a clinical point of view.  That is one of the key steps we need to put in place.</p><p>I am reluctant to give an answer at this stage until I have an appropriate critical path in front of me.  The Deputy can understand that. </p></speech>

There was a mood change and change of direction regarding co-operation with the Scally enquiry.  The protocol has to be gone immediately and third, the HSE needs clarity on the HPV vaccine.</p> <p>  There are other issues, for example, the general practitioner, GP contract, negotiations have not kicked off.  The witnesses should not try to pull the wool over our eyes.  Mr. Breslin might give us the facts on that and an estimate of how long it will take.</p> <p>  The second issue is a matter for the HSE and the Chairman will be aware of this.  I refer to a circular, dated 17 July 2015, about the appeals procedure in relation to circular 17/2013.  This was issued to allow for any staff in position over a certain period to apply to regularise their positions.  It was not communicated to staff.  The HSE is facing a class action because of this.</p></speech>

The HSE is facing a class action and the witnesses know full well what I am talking about.  The staff covered by this circular were not informed as this letter states:</p><blockquote>Dear Colleagues,<br /><br />Please find attached procedure and associated appeal form to be used in the case of those who wish to put forward their case for adjudication by Mr. John Doherty.<br /><br />I would ask that you ensure those who have made applications prior to the 30th June 2014 and have been refused the provisions of the Circular, or have had no decision given to them, are formally made aware of their option to utilise this process.<br /><br />All applications under this appeal procedure must be submitted to Susan Keegan, 63-64 Adelaide Road, <b>before 5 pm on the 21st August 2015</b>. </blockquote> <p>It was very hard for members of staff or their unions to submit these seeing that they bloody well were not told about it.  How will this be dealt with and how much will it cost the taxpayer?  They will take a case and they will win it.  How will the HSE fast forward this?  How will it deal with this on behalf of the taxpayer? </p><p>There is a serious issue in respect of residential care.  The next big scandal in the health service will be in residential care.  We do not put enough money into it.  Granted, it is expensive.  It can cost up to &euro;250,000 per person for people with serious disabilities, such as severe autism and various other conditions.  I know of many cases, as do my colleagues, of people who are being left in limbo with their families left in difficult circumstances.  The director general of the HSE knows of one case that I have raised with him.  People with these issues are residing at home and endangering other family members.  The State is allowing this to happen, whether there is potential for sexual or physical violence or whether these people are a danger to others or themselves.  The provision of residential care needs to be dealt with from a budgetary and service point of view yesterday.  It is the next big scandal.  What provisions are being put in place to do that? </p><p>I represent Tipperary.  There is not a single mental health bed in the county.  A lobby group seeking mental health services in Tipperary is upstairs.  I will meet with it after talking to the witnesses here.  When and how will that be dealt with?</p></speech>

We have a substantial sum to get the type of reform to GP services and an enhancement of those services that everybody wants, including the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We have engaged with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and have put that position.  It has gone away to consider it.  Its preference is that we would unwind the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation and hand back all fee reductions that have taken place.  Our preference is to address that but we also want to get an enhanced contract that delivers chronic disease management and a range of other objectives.

I am aware of the case the Deputy mentioned in his remarks.  The issue is how we do risk and needs assessments on an individual basis.  The answer I sent back to the Deputy on that case applies generally.  An assessment of the risk associated with each case is required to decide how we deploy that budget locally and individually, from what we have nationally.  Whether that is right or wrong and whether we have the risk assessment right all the time remains to be seen and that is open to challenge and it should be challenged because if it is not right we need to fix it.</p> <p>  The second point to consider is what will demand be like in the future.  How do we assess that demand and how can we make it much more responsive to the needs of the future?  We do not want a hospital-based system; we want one that is based in the community.  That is important for our future provision of care and the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan. </p> <p>  I am keen that we give as much flexibility in decision-making within the budgets we have available not just to the staff involved in care but also their families.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has met a local delegation of Deputies.  It has been acknowledged that if we were to apply the bed norms for the entire south east, there would be a deficit of 18 acute psychiatric beds.  I know that the chief officer is looking at the options for delivering those beds.  Like the Minister of State, she has heard from the local group in County Tipperary about the proposal for them to be delivered in Clonmel.  That is being looked at.  Other sites are also being looked at.  The four acute hospital sites are being looked at, with a view to trying to come up with a plan in that regard.</p></speech>

They have been very helpful.  I want to come back later to the audit that has been stopped because I have still not gotten my head around it.  First, I have practical questions on the accounts.  In Mr. Connaghan's opening statement, on page 2, it says that the majority of the deficit, &euro;73 million, is attributable to income shortfalls and associated bad debts, primarily related to hospital private maintenance charges.  Could Mr. Connaghan elaborate on that?</p></speech>

There are two issues.  First, the insurers have taken a stance in the last two years around the timing of when we are entitled to charge in their view.  Our understanding of the legislation is very clear in that once the individual elects to be treated privately it is from the date of admission and the insurers are pursuing a line which says they will only pay from the date of a particular form being signed.  We have an entirely different view from that.  There is also what we would refer to as a campaign that the insurers are running, encouraging members not to use their insurance when admitted through the unscheduled care route into hospitals.  Those two issues are matters which we are considering our options on and we are engaging with our colleagues in the Department.

That is what prompted the HSE's compliance unit to write twice to the chairs of all the section 38 organisations and to the larger section 39 bodies around those issues, as the director general said at the start, and share those learnings so that the wider system had an opportunity to begin addressing those issues under their own governance.</p></speech>

The issues include non-rotation of board members, expenditure on gifts and entertainment, poor audit trails over credit card expenditure, salary payments in excess of approved pay scales, board members not completing standards in public office returns and a high number of bank accounts.  My time is limited.  These are serious issues that should be dealt with very quickly.  Why are still they ongoing year after year?  When will this basic stuff be finally sorted out?</p></speech>

There is a large number of organisations.  The position is improving and our expectation is that it will continue to improve.  Our compliance unit and our service teams have put a lot of effort into engaging with section 38 and 39 organisations, into the compliance annual statements which they must complete, and into circularising them about these control issues.  It receives significant attention.  At some point, we have to rely on these separate legal entities to organise their own governance arrangements.  Our task is to support them significantly in that and to ensure the service they provide is up to scratch.</p></speech>

Through the Office of the Attorney General, we have got a significant amount of legal advice which is being finalised and which will, I think, be released to us within a few days.  At that point, we will look to secure the best option to secure as much money as we can.</p> <p>  As Mr. Mulvany said, there are two issues.  There is the day from which something is chargeable.  A quite separate issue is that all of us have an entitlement to go to a public hospital, whether one has health insurance or not.  If one has health insurance in one's back pocket, one is entitled to go to a public hospital and be treated as a public patient.  That is a person's primary entitlement as a resident of the State.  The means by which one becomes a private patient is when one waives that public entitlement and decides one does not wish to be a public patient and ones wishes to be a private patient.</p></speech>

To wind it back another bit, a legislative change was made in 2014, which allows somebody to be charged as a private patient, regardless of where he or she is accommodated in the hospital.  Up to that point, the insurance company was charged if the patient was in a private or semi-private room.  Over an extended period, both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department looked at that and said that was a major hidden subsidy to private healthcare within public hospitals because insurance companies were having their members treated in the public hospitals but because they did not get a single room, which is one of the cheaper parts of the total cost of a person's stay in a hospital, the insurance company was not paying for it.  I was not there at the time but in 2014, the Minister changed the law and said that one is chargeable at a somewhat different rate, regardless of what bed one is in.</p> <p>  Over a period we saw the yield from private insurance to public hospitals go up, and then - I am not quoting anybody but I am giving the committee my take on this - last year the insurers said, "Why do we not try to suppress that by saying to people that if they do not get a private room, if they come in as an emergency patient and if they are not under the care of a consultant with whom they have a relationship, why go private?".  They started to publicise that and we have seen is a reduction-----</p></speech>

It is important that people make an informed decision.  We are not advocating for people to go private within public hospitals.  It is important that they make that decision on an informed basis.  The only bit that is somewhat unfortunate is that if the insurance companies adopt a position which is that there are no excuses for not having it signed off on as the person arrives in.  There are other things to be done with people, particularly those who are sick, as they arrive into the hospital.  It would not be a priority for the public hospital to throw a form in front of the patient while it has all these other things to do.  As Mr. Mulvany pointed out, it is unfortunate that they are requiring the paperwork to be done at the start of someone's stay.  It would be an administratively fair thing for both sides if there was some allowance for that.</p></speech>

The State Claims Agency told us that 50% of claims to do with the HSE are settled without an admission of liability.  I asked what processes existed for retraining for, or supervision of those who may have been associated with an incident which was settled without the admission of liability.  The State Claims Agency told us it was unaware of one.  I suggested that it should recommend to the HSE that this should happen, that is, that without prejudice, consultant X, nurse Y or doctor whatever should be subjected to a mandatory period of supervision or retraining, relevant to the area where an issue has come to light.  Has the HSE thought about that?</p></speech>

The Deputy's question is probably wider than CervicalCheck and we should consider it in its widest sense as it would apply where care is substandard and it is down to someone's individual practice.  With that thought, perhaps I might ask Mr. Woods to outline where we are there.</p></speech>

That happens and it is very useful.  Claims settled are normally settled some time in arrears of three to five years.  If the opportunity for learning arises, it should be visible at the time or soon after an incident and it should be built into professional training and development.  There are situations where there may be support or retraining happening within an individual unit or-----</p></speech>

I was told "support" was available.  Mr. Woods said this could happen, this might be identified and that this would be available and there would be support.  Is it not prudent for us, as a State, to have a mandatory process?  I accept one size does not fit all.  Cases are often settled without an admission of liability and that may be due to fortuitous and creative legal work as opposed to supporting the absolute facts.  Would it not be prudent for us to have mandatory processes of supervision or retraining in place to ensure we learn?</p></speech>

If one looks at the women and infants programme at the moment, there has been huge learning from issue arising from obstetrics over the past number of years.  There are very specific education processes going right across the 19 units.  There is a real learning process there.  There is dedicated training taking place in areas of high risk.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point was well made in terms of looking broadly at all claims and asking, "From that perspective, what are we seeing?".</p></speech>

There are those who are not on a specialist register who were appointed pre-2008 and did not have a duty at that time to be on the specialist register, and continued since that time.  There are also those who have come in since 2008.  We would like all categories to be on the specialist register.  There are 27 in mental health and the balance of that 134 are in acute hospitals.  Many of those are psychiatry posts, which we discussed earlier today.  These doctors are mostly, though not totally, located in smaller units outside major urban centres.  With regard to human resources, HR, we have a national unit that works with doctors on doctors' training.  We have written to all groups, group chiefs and clinical directors to support as many of those doctors as we can in registering on the register of specialists.</p></speech>

The larger numbers here are in a relatively small number of units.  Going to the heart of the matter, there is a balance between providing a safe service and having clinical personnel to do that and assuring ourselves that that is safe.

The first phases of that contract were paid, so they saw increases.  A phase in the contract was not paid because of the financial crisis.  That was a time when many people were either not getting increases or, in many cases, having their pay reduced.  The Government of the day took the decision not to implement that increase.  That persisted up to last month, when a number of cases were taken.</p></speech>

The total quantums in the settlement, which will be staggered now over 2019 and 2020, will be &euro;73 million payable next year in retrospection.  Then, on an ongoing basis, the cost will be &euro;62 million per year.  As we will implement the corrected salary with current effect, there will be a payment back to June of this year but we will not pay it until next year.  That will cost &euro;31 million.  Next year, a combined total payment of about &euro;160 million will be made.  Consultants will also be due a further element of the retrospection in 2020, and that will comprise &euro;109 million.</p> <p>  This was a multimillion claim, involving hundreds of millions of euro.  The initial figures put forward by the HSE were a cost of &euro;700 million.  The clock was ticking on it, or better described, the taxi meter was running on it.  It was continuing to escalate.</p></speech>

It was robustly defended over a period of years.  There was a great reluctance on the part of the State to pay this.  The consultants felt particularly strongly as we moved out of the emergency that this was a contractual commitment and that it needed to be paid.  Ultimately, they took the case all of the way to the High Court to enforce it.  The settlement is not a comfortable place to be in terms of the amount of money being paid out.  This was on the risk register of the Departments of Health, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  We saw this as a very significant financial implication and ultimately the reason for reaching the settlement was the discount that was involved.</p></speech>

The reason for that was because the consultants were suing the State for not complying with the terms of the contract, and the State wanted to establish the extent to which the consultants were complying with the terms of the contract.  There is one part of the contract which is particularly difficult.  Some consultants have an entitlement to off-site - not in the public hospital - private practice.  That is not something that is observable to the public hospital.  We cannot see that as it is not happening within our institutions.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Breslin to bear with me.  There was obviously a contract of some description with individual private investigators or a firm to track the movements of three individuals.  I am making a judgment on the rights and wrongs of that but trying to establish what the process was.  In the first instance, which arm of the State was responsible for employing the private investigators?  How did it go about doing it?  What type of contract was in place?  What were the terms of reference for the contract?  How were the rights of the individuals in question protected?  At the same time, the witness would argue this was justified to ensure the huge claim being made was properly defended by the State and, as such, any information the State could obtain from the work of the private investigators would help in that regard.  Will Mr. Breslin help me with those questions?</p></speech>

I have not been lobbied by any of them, nor have I met any of them.  I have seen the media coverage of the matter and I am aware of the criticism made for using private investigators and the defence made by the State.  I imagine if I was one of the individuals involved, I would want to know what safeguards were put in place by the State.  If the State is to employ private investigators to track the movements of individuals who work for the State, what protections do I have, as an individual, that whatever the private investigator is tracking, it will not encroach on my right to privacy?</p></speech>

It may not be something that one would like to do, but when one faces those kinds of catastrophic costs, it is an option to take on.</p></speech>

The State went to what I consider to be extraordinary lengths in hiring private investigators to track the movements of these individuals.  Incidentally, I am conscious that this practice is sometimes used in cases involving people receiving social welfare payments and, as such, is used in a number of different contexts.  In this case, the way in which this was done seemed to be somewhat unusual.  Perhaps it has been done before and it would be interesting to find out how many times the HSE and the Department have used private investigators.  Mr. Breslin stated the results of the private investigators' work informed the settlement agreement and their work did not find anything of substance.  In terms of the good names of the three individuals in question, who may be easily identifiable within their world, is it safe to say that nothing was found in that work to suggest any substantial wrongdoing on the part of those individuals?</p></speech>

What I am trying to present here is that we were heading into a court case where the plaintiffs would have argued that the State was in breach of its contract.  There would have been a discovery process attaching to that, to the extent to which the plaintiffs were going to introduce evidence into the court.  The same would have applied to the other side.  The other side would have been told what the State knew and would have had to defend its obligations under the contract.  It was not as if it was an entirely secretive process in which it was not obvious to people that both sides of that argument were going to be played out across the court.  I acknowledge this is unusual and I want people to understand, including people who are employed in the health service, that I recognise it to be unusual.  The circumstances that we found ourselves in, where we were starting off with a &euro;700 million exposure, were highly unusual as well.  In the context of some of the other coverage that was done over the period, including, for example, the "Prime Time" programme, it was not unprecedented either.</p></speech>

I gave prior notice of this.  My final question is a very local one.  Mr. Connaghan will have to forgive me for that but I did give him a heads up on it.  The Minister for Health announced last week that he would deploy a modular catheterisation laboratory for University Hospital Waterford.  Mr. Connaghan knows that this has been a long-running issue.  An independent report carried out following the formation of the Government headed up by Dr. Niall Herity did not recommend a permanent second catheterisation laboratory at the hospital.  In any event, a modular laboratory will be deployed for a time period.  The Minister has stated the money will be made available in this year's budget but that there would be significant tendering, project design work, planning, construction and commissioning work.  Does Mr. Connaghan have the updated information because in his letter to Members of the Oireachtas, the Minister stated he had asked the HSE to commence the work of making this happen now?  Has that been done?  Has that direction from the Minister been communicated to the HSE?  What work is being done and can be done now?  Can Mr. Connaghan give us an indication of timeframes in delivering that project?</p></speech>

It is very fresh.  I have not yet seen a written instruction from the Minister but that could be in our own system or on the way to us.  As the Deputy rightly said, there would be a piece of work around things like planning, site clearance and connectivity to the main hospital.  I will come back to the Deputy about precise timelines but I think we are probably looking at something up to a 12-month time period.  I will confirm that.</p></speech>

This includes the tendering process, the project design work process, planning, construction and all the rest of it.  All of the Members from the south east have met the Minister on this issue several times.  This is a hugely important issue for me.  I would not accept 12 months.  There is not a chance that we will accept that we must wait for 12 months for this.  I have no doubt but that it could be done far more quickly.  I am a bit disappointed that Mr. Woods has not yet received the letter from the Minister but has just seen it in the media or wherever he saw it.  This needs to be done quickly and 12 months is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I have had a look at the protocol.  It refers to the provision of slides from the laboratory that currently holds them to a third party laboratory.  Having looked at the protocol, I can say that it is as much set up for the protection of the patient because it deals with the request from the patients, the identification of the patients and a safety issue, which is taking a high-resolution digital image of a slide before it is then sent out.  I am quite happy to give the Deputy a copy of the protocol.  As regards the patients waiting for those slides, I am advised that we have had 120 requests, 50 of which have been fulfilled within the relative timescale.  I checked today on the remaining number, which is 70.  I think the Deputy referred to something like 80 or 90.  From my records, I believe the figure is 70.

Is this included as a bad debt when in fact, there can be something legally dubious about the demands if people are put under pressure?  Is there any issue relating to this because it seems that this amount is growing every year?  I believe this is what the former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, intended it to be.  Nobody has a dispute if it is about a private room.</p><p>Of course, there should not be a separation when a person attends at an accident and emergency department in terms of queues or the kind of treatment people receive.

All of the advice we have received, which is based on the 2014 Act, upholds that the Act made that change and we can follow it through.  The rationale for that is that although some cost attaches to the room in which a private patient is treated in a public hospital, the majority of the cost is accounted for by treatment, staff input and technology.  That is the philosophy behind that policy.</p></speech>

I will not address the specific case to which she referred.  The insurance company of a patient who attends a public hospital through the accident and emergency department or as a booked admission and wishes to be treated as a private patient will be charged even if the person is placed on an ordinary ward rather than in a single room.  The single rooms may be occupied by persons with MRSA or other clinical issues.  The State may legally recover the fee from the insurance company.</p></speech>

One must plan services and hire staff based on existing needs.  A child must undergo an assessment of needs to determine what supports he or she requires.  I am aware that it is increasingly the case that people are told there is a three month waiting time for assessments of needs.  I assume other members are aware of people in such situations.  After three months, the person is told the waiting list is six months but after six months he or she is told it is nine months, and then 12 months.  Is that occurring across the country or is it limited to one location?  How does the HSE plan its services when there is a waiting list of that length for assessments of needs?  Is there a problem with that process and what are the guarantees in that regard?</p></speech>

We heard this morning that the service is fine in some parts of the country but not in others and we fully acknowledge and were aware of that.  As part of the annual planning of the budget and service plan for the following year we consider what investment or change is needed in each local area.  Those requirements are addressed in the national service plan in terms of targets for the activity we want to see and the expenditure to be provided to that end, as referred to by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  The national service plan is clear on what we wish to achieve.  The reality is that those plans are sometimes not realised because of issues such as staffing, additional demand or a significant historical backlog.  We fully recognise the variability in services across the land and that we need to do something about that.</p></speech>

She mentioned speech and language therapy and other services.  I am also interested in the number of children awaiting a basic eye assessment.  There are many ways of approaching that issue in light of the fact that we may encounter barriers or constraints in terms of the available workforce who can deal with the assessments.  For instance, I am interested in exploring whether the optometry community in Ireland can, with the appropriate supervision, take some of that burden from the hospital and community-based system.

As regards waiting lists and the projection of needs, some people are unable to even get onto waiting lists, which is a further impediment.  I ask Mr. Connaghan to arrange for the committee to be sent a note detailing where the problems are in that regard.  He stated that assessment of needs provision is satisfactory in some parts of the country but not in others.  I wish to know which areas are performing well and where there are gaps because the issue is increasingly being raised in my area and I wish to compare services in different areas.  What steps does Mr. Connaghan intend to take to address the issue and in what timeframe will that be done?</p> <p>  On procurement, in a sampling exercise the Comptroller and Auditor General found evidence of a lack of competitive procurement.  Some &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million could be saved through a competitive procurement process.  I note that in his opening statement Mr. Connaghan referred to successful tender outcomes, particularly in the utilities category.  That is very welcome because it shows that savings are possible.

The previous director general intimated almost a year ago at the meeting of the committee in regard to the HSE financial statements for 2016 that it would take some time to bring all of the &euro;2.2 billion of expenditure inside our appropriate procurement framework.  We can see from the figures now available that significant progress has been made over the course of the past two years.  Some &euro;1.1 billion of contracts are inside the framework and provision has been made to increase that to &euro;1.5 billion, which shows that work is continuing in that regard.  We will confirm those figures shortly.  Mr. Mulvany might have the figures for 2016 and be able to offer further information in that regard.  I ask him to outline from where we have come and what we have done.</p></speech>

As regards the HSE spend, our target is to bring the total procurement spend of in excess of &euro;2.2 billion inside the framework.  As Mr. Connaghan stated, at the end of 2015 approximately &euro;488 million of contracts were in place between the HSE and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  That figure has now risen to &euro;1.1 billion.</p></speech>

I do not want to give the expectation that that amount of money would be saved but there are savings to be made.</p><p>There is also an issue of procurement compliance.  There are contracts which are not any more compliant but are still delivering value.  Let me give members more information.  In terms of frameworks, which go alongside the contracts between the Department of Health and the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, we have 202 frameworks in place compared with having 97 at the end of 2015.  We are showing year on year progress.  Between those contracts and the frameworks, we have &euro;1.56 billion in procurement spend covered by either contracts or frameworks.  In 2017, we estimated that we had saved about &euro;21.6 million purely from price savings on our contracts.  There is a significant process of work on the way to assist our locations to become more compliant, to look at local contracts and some of them can actually be registered as national contracts.</p><p> I will now deal with the sample and as we said this time last year, it is a sample so whether the results are good or bad we cannot say it applies to the whole HSE.  Last year's sample had a 48% non-compliance rate whereas this year, the non-compliance rate is 36%.  While we would not argue with the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is one contract of a particular type for medical services which we are very satisfied is delivering value and it is about another 5%.  We would not rely on the samples year to year to say it is definitely improving but it provides some evidence of improvement and the figures I gave earlier provide more evidence. </p></speech>

I think comparing the figures of 48% and 36% is not indicative of a trend.  The difficulty is that there are 11 systems and there are many ways in which procurement is happening and getting a complete overview is very difficult in the HSE.  There may be progress being made but we may not be able to identify it until we see regularly, where we do samples in four or five locations, that the figure is coming down and staying down from year to year.</p></speech>

In 2017, some 11,000 parliamentary questions were tabled.  In the years from 2012 onwards it ranged between 7,000 and 8,000, but there was a major spike in 2017.  Members do not table parliamentary questions for fun but because they see failures or people come through the door with an issue.  It strikes me that there was something going on.  Does the Department use the process of parliamentary questions to analyse the trends where the failures are happening?  What does the Department do to address the issue in order that the system is fixed rather than that the individual problem is fixed?</p></speech>

What we do periodically is that the research until drills down into the data to identify the policies that the clusters of questions relate to.  For example, we have talked a great deal today about home care.  We are pretty confident that if we move home care towards a statutory basis that the public clearly understands and can see the rule set, the number of questions would diminish.  We see from the fair deal scheme that the number of questions diminished once we did that compared with previously.  That would help us prioritise policy development.  In addition, when individual cases are aggregated it could indicate a performance issue.  As people ask questions around therapies and waiting times for them, not only do we rely on the HSE's performance information telling us how things are going but as the Department looks periodically at the parliamentary questions, we also would be able to say we are seeing a pattern.  To the absolute credit of Deputies, there are always nuggets of parliamentary questions that shed a light on something, which is a cause of surprise to us.  Not that there is an aggregate, but one question will tell us that there is something that we did not know.  The civil servants in the Department are encouraged not just to do the parliamentary questions in order that we get an answer for the Member but to use it as part of their own understanding of the services they are interacting with and to challenge people using the information they are getting from the parliamentary question process.</p></speech>

I raised this yesterday with the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the reasons for it and Mr. Connaghan has outlined some of them.  The answer I received is that he is currently assessing with the Minister for Health and the Department the reasons for such underfunding of the service.  It seems to be a continual process when it comes to health.  We give a budget but it is never enough.  We always come back for a Supplementary Estimate.  We keep making the same mistakes over and over again.  Will Mr. Breslin or Mr. Connaghan talk me through the process of negotiation with the Department?  How does the planning process work in terms of next year's budget?</p></speech>

To take the example of 2017, the Supplementary Estimate was &euro;195 million and some &euro;75 million of that figure was to do with the national pay deal, where the pay increases were brought forward.  In fairness, I have robust debate with the HSE on their finances, that is something that was imposed on them.  The Government met that cost.  There was a &euro;40 million Government initiative to try to improve winter responsiveness and try to open extra beds in acute hospitals and try to get home care levels increased.  Again that was a Government initiative.  Consequently, &euro;115 million from a total of &euro;195 million arose as a result of two Government decisions.<br/><br/>There was &euro;50 million for the State Claims Agency, with which members of this committee will be familiar and this reflects settlements and court settlements, which can be very significant.  One can have a &euro;10 million settlement and these figures can be both significant and unpredictable.  That is not say that we do not try to estimate them and try to provide funding for them but it is hard to get it exactly right.  The other area foe which the Supplementary Estimate was made available in 2017 was the area to which we have given some time, namely, the income area.  We provided &euro;30 million for that.  Above and beyond that Supplementary Estimate, last year there was a figure of &euro;140 million for the deficit that the HSE had generated at the end of the year.  I would see issues within that where again, although we made &euro;50 million available to the State Claims Agency, we got it wrong by &euro;10 million.  By the end of the year, during November and December, it was &euro;10 million above the figure we expected.  There are certainly other areas, where the Department would consider that it gets a budget that is set by the Government and which is based on the fiscal rules.  We are told that is the total amount of funding that is available for the health service and then we work with the HSE, outlining that it must come up with a service plan that can deliver the greatest value within a budget of &euro;15 billion.  There must be some areas of the health service, even though they are complex and difficult to manage, where people seek to manage their budget in such a way that by the end of the year, they do not have a deficit.  If there is not, the difficulty becomes that the people who have the deficit get that dealt with and the people who seek to manage without having a deficit have to bear it.  Although it is hard in the health service and there is demand that is hard to manage, we are seeking with the HSE to improve upon the budgetary discipline in the health service.</p><p> To bring it back to the Estimates process, we would look at each element of the HSE's budget with them.  As part of that we would engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and then we would conclude a service plan.  I do know, in terms of Supplementary Estimates for example, that in previous years there were areas, perhaps pensions and retirements costs, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Where people seek to retire they must be paid their lump sum and these cases have been difficult to predict in advance.  Last year, no costs arose excess to what our predictions were in respect of areas like the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, pensions, demand-led schemes and fair deal schemes.  Last year, we did a better job in those areas and we continue to refine our methodologies.  Ultimately, it is the Oireachtas, on the recommendation of the Government, that decides the health budget but we and the HSE must come up with a service plan to deliver upon that.    </p></speech>

Does the HSE approach the Department and tell it what is needed to run the service the following year?  Does the HSE say that if the Department does not provide money that a service will be reduced?  Does the Department just tell the HSE what funding it can give within the fiscal rules and ask the HSE to cut its cloth to measure?</p></speech>

I think I have previously described the three tentative value elements to what the HSE is currently about.  One is what I would call the usual suspects, and I have gone over those, like print, postage, back office services, etc.  Right now the HSE is well engaged on that, with every CHO and every hospital group at national level, through what we are doing in terms of our procurement strategy.  The next bit is one where we are only partially engaged and we can do an awful lot more.  I would recall it is the clinical efficiency bit that I have previously explained.  That is doing things like increasing the level of day care surgery that we have.  That in itself leads me back to one of the drivers that we have in the national service plan.  We have always had, in the national service plan, a desire to do more for the amount of money that we have.  That is a good thing but the question is whether we are doing the right things.  Maybe it is not always right that we drive more activity through our hospitals.  Maybe it is a sign of success to be driving less activity through our hospitals and doing more in the community, doing the right kind of things.  We should optimise inside hospitals what should only be done inside hospitals.  Is the Deputy with me?</p></speech>

I would like a couple of things to be further explained.  To be fair, we received very detailed accounts and some of the accounts ran to more than 300 pages.  The accounts were broken down into categories such as catering, cleaning, washing and medical but really everything.</p></speech>

I ask because the figure almost reached &euro;300,000 in one year for patient transport.</p></speech>

Given that we do not have a single financial system, some of the code and classification of those figures may be slightly different in areas so we would have to look at the specifics.

I have only been looking at the mental health figures which have broken it down by ambulance and by taxi.  In some areas we are spending nothing on transferring patients by ambulance but in CHO 7, for example, &euro;270,000 was spent last year.

A taxi contract or service use contract would have rolled over from year to year with the same people being used and so on.  In more recent years that has not come up.

The cases relate to the HSE and our role is to lower the risk as much as possible by providing safe services.  Every time we check this with the State Claims Agency, the reasons for the increase are not related to the health service provision.  The increases are related to the cost of addressing legal cases.  This is because legal costs are rising or because the internal rate of return around compensation is increasing and so on.  The growth in overall costs is due to the operation of the legal and claims process.  Consider the area of catastrophic births, which is about half of the overall clinical figure.  Ireland's incidence of this is within international norms.  This does not mean we are not trying to reduce it, but it is not the incidence of such cases that are driving the increase in claims year on year.</p></speech>

Another is the clinical indemnity scheme which was only set up in 2003.  There is a long tail when it comes to insurance and everything before it was being picked up by insurance arrangements.  The State now picks it up by way of self-insurance.  That means that the cost to the State Claims Agency will build until it reaches a plateau which I believe is still three or four years away.  Even with better management of individual cases, the aggregate cost might still grow.  The State Claims Agency has put a great deal of effort into the management of individual cases, but the Deputy is correct.  The Department of Justice and Equality has undertaken reforms to try to improve how the system works.  The Deputy may be aware that last week the Minister established an expert group on medical negligence.  It will examine this issue further to try to find a better solution for everyone when medical negligence cases are taken.</p></speech>

I do not believe an audit has ever worked in real time, if I may use that expression.  When it kicked off in 2013 or 2014, it went all the way back to 2008.  The Deputy is right - a range of women were informed some significant time after they had been treated for cervical cancer that this was what was known about their previous smear test history.  Having got it up to date, there would still have been a time lag in the audit.  It is not that someone would be diagnosed today and told within a couple of weeks that we had looked at her smear test and that here was the result.  Dr. McKenna reflected that, rather than carrying out an audit that could be criticised and seen as inadequate, including by Dr. Scally who might say there was a problem with it, there would be a pause period of a couple of months.  The relevant individuals would be new diagnoses during that period.  They would be caught up with as soon as the audit recommenced with a clean bill of health.</p><p>Those results would be communicated in line with the best practice that would be applied from there on.  The Deputy is correct, but it only stands up to scrutiny if the pause period is limited and a backlog does not build up.</p></speech>

We all feel a responsibility to continue with the audit, but there are aspects of it that can be improved, including information about the audit so people know about it.

There are improvements that can be made to it.</p></speech>

We have been successful coming out of last year to quite a high degree in terms of retaining graduates from last year, and that is a key focus for us again this year.  That is helping us fill some of those roles and to reduce agency staff, which was discussed earlier.  It is hoped in time it will help us staff the capacity to come.  The nursing numbers in 2018 to date are up 1,300, but if I eliminate students we are up about 400 in total nurse numbers.  We are recruiting additional nurses now.  We still face challenges.  The reference in the note may be specifically to challenges in areas such as theatre and intensive care where specialist skills are required.</p></speech>

I live in Galway and when two operating theatres closed in Merlin Park, we found out that St. Finbar's ward in the centre of excellence is closed.  I have mentioned that we find out things by accident.  A ward is closed in the hospital in Galway where there are huge waiting lists.  When I ask why it is closed, I find it is an absence of staff.  If there is an absence of nurses at that level, we have an emergency.  We need proper packages, and the package that was provided to attract nurses home has not worked.  Is it correct that there has been little uptake of it?</p></speech>

Some of the work taking place at present in intensive care units, for example, is training.  There is training under way within our system to grow the number of nurses available for that, but both that and the theatre have been two areas of critical deficiency that we have had to address.  It remains a challenge.</p></speech>

The discussion which Dr. McKenna was a party to about how that should be dealt with appropriately over that period is not simply an administrative matter, it is a clinical matter.

I will bring it back to the beginning.  The trigger for an audit of a case is a diagnosis of cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme being informed that somebody has been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That is an individual notification.  CervicalCheck asks then if the person has a screening history.  On occasion the person will not have a screening history.  Where the person has a screening history the audit looks at the engagement with that person to see when CervicalCheck last engaged with the woman.  It is a case of whether they called her and whether she did not come, which is a possibility, or whether they called her and she came and she had a difficulty with the quality of the smear test, and it goes all the way through the chain.  The most important issue, however, is around the reading of the smear test and, after that has been looked at through a process to try to determine if there is a discordance, to communicate - this is where it fell down - that discordance to the woman's consultant who is treating her for cervical cancer, and for him or her to inform the woman that a previous smear had missed a screening potential to send her in for further review.</p> <p>  To bring that forward, as I understand it as a non-clinician, and it would be helpful if Dr. McKenna were here, the pause is for a period.  If somebody is diagnosed with cervical cancer, and there will be a lag in that information getting to CervicalCheck so there is always a lag in any event, that information would come to CervicalCheck and the pause is that the look-back or review is not done and communicated over that period.  It is to be a very short period, as I understand it.  In all likelihood it will be much shorter than the period that would normally arise from the woman being diagnosed and the result becoming available.  I will use some very rough figures but it is not 3,000.  If there are 300 diagnoses in a year on average and, for example, half of them have a screening history - I am using very rough figures now - we are talking about 150, and if that is spread over the course of a full year, we are talking about ten or so in any single month.</p><p>That means over two months or so approximately 20 cases have to be done.</p></speech>

I can speculate that people might leave based on a range of issues.  It could be pay, conditions or advancement elsewhere.</p> <p>  Let us consider the three psychiatrist positions in Wexford and Waterford.  One was a locum who is going to another job somewhere else &ndash; I do not know where that job is.  One is leaving to pursue additional studies as part of a pre-determined study plan.  One is leaving to move elsewhere in the healthcare system.  I am told one of the major reasons one of the consultants is leaving relates to the premises, the conditions of buildings and various other things.  The latest information I have on that is that we are pursuing arrangements to move the service into new premises.  This should happen soon &ndash; by soon, I mean this autumn.</p></speech>

On the basis of these exit interviews it would be useful for the committee and the State generally if the HSE could correlate some of this information.  The executive could tell us X% are leaving because of money and Y% are leaving because of facilities and so on.  In that way, the committee could prevail upon the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get more money for the HSE, if that is what is needed, or to change conditions or whatever it is.</p></speech>

Specific research was done on doctors through our human resources unit with the support of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The research looked at doctors in Ireland and Irish doctors who have gone overseas.  It looked at the drivers that caused them to leave, their views when they were away and what they thought about coming back.  Another question was whether they thought about coming back before going away and whether that changed while they were away.  There is good analysis.  I suggest we made a copy available to the committee.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting there are no shortages or that, based on growing demand, we do not have difficulties.  Anyway, let us consider three areas.  Last year, the number in nursing increased by 942.

The latest information is that more people are taking that up.  There was a time during the crisis when jobs could not be offered and people went abroad.  Now what happens is that people take the job and do it for several years.  However, they would still like to see a country and experience travel and so they go abroad.  At the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, Ms Collette Cowan, who is the chief executive officer of the University of Limerick hospital group, explained the approach.  She said the important thing is that when the hospital staff get someone in from college, they get the graduate accustomed to the work.  Then they get the recruit to make a connection with the hospital.  Crucially, they offer a career break.  If they do not make a career break available then, when the recruit goes it is a break and she does not come back.  We will always see people leaving.  The important thing is that when they have experience, they come home to give us the benefit of it.</p></speech>

The second issue, which is bigger in terms of its impact, particularly in the context of the 2017 figures, is what we would refer to as the insurers' campaign to encourage their members not to use their private insurance when they are admitted through the emergency route, which people are quite entitled to do.  From memory, this has caused the bigger difference between income in 2016 and 2017.  The first issue is that relating to retraction, in respect of which we are identifying all of other options and will then pursue one of them.

As a committee, we need to look into this matter.</p> <p>  The issue of agency staff was discussed yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health.  Mr. Woods said earlier that 20% would be the differential in the context of agency staff but that would depend on the job involved.  Are we taking into account the considerations, such as pensions, sick pay and so on, that come with the public sector job?  I imagine that agency staff do not have the benefit of the public sector pension and I am not sure what their sick pay entitlements are, although I imagine that the latter come via the social welfare system.  In regard to the average of 20%, does that take into account the terms and conditions of the staff member?  Is it a net figure?</p></speech>

Progressively, the difference between agency employed staff and directly employed staff is being narrowed but it has not been narrowed completely.</p></speech>

Mr. Connaghan said that this came to the fore in 2017 but I have been aware of issues in Wexford and in the south of Ireland for many years.  I argue that 2017 is not the right year.  I have been told, anecdotally, that it is not just about the consultants, it is about the team that is under the consultants.  In situations where the HSE tries to attract people into the State by teleconference, is it not a big issue for consultants who their senior registrar is, who their senior house officer is, whether the team comprises agency staff and whether they are there for a long time?  I have heard that many consultants leave because they do not have control over the team.  How is this being addressed when trying to recruit from abroad or are those consultants not bothered about that issue?</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell has raised an important point about where we want to go, which is also dear to my heart.  Mr. Breslin has previously described a system we eventually want, with much greater delegation and responsibility at local level.  From my perspective, this means empowering local clinical directors, at local level not just at group level, to have as much delegated responsibility and authority as possible.  That includes budgetary authority as much as possible and responsibility for the team.  We do not have this on a universal basis, but it is in some places in Ireland.  To my mind, this is a good direction to aim for.  I say this because the kinds of decisions that are made at local level cannot really be made 15 or 20 miles away.  One needs to be able to make decisions as they happen on the ground with regard to staff, team deployment, team working, analysing the workload ahead and sorting out the resources appropriately.  To answer the Deputy's question, if we can get interest for that type of delegation, and if we can put in the appropriate training to make it happen, then this will be a good thing to look forward to in the future.  I have spoken to a group of clinical directors on this very subject and I know that clinical staff would really warm to that idea.</p></speech>

I live very near to the unit and walk by it a lot.  I understand there is very poor occupancy there.  Does the provider get paid regardless of how many beds are filled?  Perhaps the witnesses cannot answer this today as it has just arisen recently.  There are abandoned operating theatres there.  The car park has grass growing through the pavements.  I believe that sometimes there are only 20 or 30 people in the place.  Does the cheque get paid no matter what the work is?  Perhaps I am being parochial, but could I get an answer to this?  Could we have sight of the contract that was awarded to that company?  When is it due for review?  What are the terms and conditions of that company taking on the contract?</p></speech>

Obviously, there are the women who have the diagnosis of cervical cancer, but are there proposals to do random checks?  I have asked this before at other committees.

It is not really a question, but it is relevant.  I spent yesterday morning at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health.  Mr. Woods, who holds a senior position in the HSE, was there.  I am aware that Mr. Breslin also has a lot to be doing, as I am sure all the witnesses do.  When do the witnesses actually get to do their day jobs if they are at committees all the time?  I am being deadly serious.  I almost feel that I should be sending the witnesses Christmas cards because I know them so well.  This is serious.  If a witness such as Mr. Woods is the chief of operations of acute hospital services, surely he has better things to be doing than sitting here since 9 a.m.  I am delighted to see the witnesses, but when is the work done and when are operations directed?</p></speech>

On agency staff, why is there a need for agency staff at all if the HSE is doing its job and able to recruit qualified nurses directly?  I understand some nurses want to go abroad, to travel and so on but why is the HSE not employing nurses directly?  The agency is only there to make money.  Instead of the HSE losing its money to agencies, which are there to make a profit, why not get rid of agencies and just have the HSE as the employer?  A figure of &euro;2.2 billion was referred to as costs for agencies, please correct me if I am wrong-----</p></speech>

Some maternity leave and other forms of leave may make sense.  On the Deputy's core point, we have more agency than we want to have and we have agency in places where we do not want to have it.  The challenge is to recruit to replace that.  We will have some natural movement of staff that gives to agency just for short periods.</p></speech>

How come the agencies are able to get the personnel and yet the HSE cannot do so?  We have a deficit of 4:1.  Do the agencies pay more than the HSE?  Is it that people who have retired return as agency staff because the hours or whatever suit them better?  I am puzzled by the fact that agencies can hire personnel yet the HSE cannot do so where there is a 4:1 deficit.</p></speech>

Some of that is about individual choice.  A person may choose to work with an agency because he or she plans to move on or is there only for a short time.</p> <p>  Some of our hospitals do what they call bank, which has been the subject of discussion.  They look to provide, from within their own staff, extra hours rather than bringing in agents.  To go back to address the issue made about the consistency of care, maybe that is a more tenable way to attract additional staff.</p></speech>

The biggest slice of cost in agency and locum is on the medical side.  It should be remembered that we are in an international recruitment market in many ways so we are not fishing just in the pool of Ireland.  There is inevitably going to be some delay in terms of our ability to recruit into certain specialist posts.  That drives some locums and additional agency posts.</p></speech>

What we are doing in nursing is being led by the chief nurse's office in the Department but, along with the HSE and all of the stakeholders, including the nursing unions, they have produced the research on nursing under the task force on staffing and skill mix.  That has been able to identify, and they have gone into a number of wards at this stage, that even if the staff nurses, the agency and the overtime are identified on a ward and it is changed to a more stable workforce, it will not totally eliminate agency or overtime.  There will be somebody, unpredictably, who gets ill and is gone for a period and somebody has to be called in.  If annual leave, training courses, all of the natural things that happen in a year and so on are built into the roster and there are sufficient staff to cover that, it saves money, the quality of care indicators go up on that ward, the actual care that people receive improves and staff satisfaction goes up as well.   We are successfully rolling out that model to wards across different sites and hope to do that across the whole hospital system.</p></speech>

We could have spent that sum.</p> <p>  Earlier the Comptroller of Auditor General asked why the HSE had not complied with its statutory responsibility to obtain the required ministerial sanction at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit.

We certainly would not cut somebody's future budget because they did not spend money.  That is a real recipe for having people just throwing money up against the wall, as it were.  The capital budget for next year and the year after remains the same.  It is a question of both our having to do some work with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from a legal point of view on how it interacts with the Health Act, and us then having to make a judgment call.  Do we roll that over so the capital spend in the subsequent year is available or, in a situation where there is a revenue overspend, do we say that one has to be set off against the other?  If there is an overspend in one area and underspend in the other, is it possible to come forward looking for the underspend to be carried over if one has not come within one's budget?</p></speech>

I want discuss primary care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report is a ten-year programme that has been rolled out.  We all hear about primary care.  We, as politicians and Ministers, refer to primary care and the Departments keep promoting primary care as the way forward and as a means to keep people out of hospitals and accident and emergency units.  How far has the Sl&aacute;intecare report on primary care advanced?  How much will it advance over the next couple of years?  We all want primary care.  We all want to provide assistance that keeps people in their homes and out of hospital.  Will the HSE comment on the matter and on the Sl&aacute;intecare report in general?</p></speech>

Work is under way to try to bring that into an implementation plan.  If I were to pick one element of the overall Sl&aacute;intecare vision, it is that piece around primary care and moving some of the work that happens in hospitals back into the community, but also intervening earlier in more accessible care such as home care and self care so that people, increasingly, manage their good health.  We are very strongly supportive of that.</p> <p>  We are doing some things in advance of the finalisation of the implementation plan.  As we discussed earlier, we have opened negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation on a new GP contract.  A key priority for us in that would be chronic disease management, so that somebody with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, would not have to wait for an exacerbation of their condition and end up in hospital but would have it managed in primary care.  We are also rolling out community nursing and in particular advanced nursing in the community.  Somebody with asthma or another respiratory problem such as COPD would have an advanced nurse that would be trained in respiratory illnesses and, under a protocol, either in the primary care centre or in somebody's home they would be able to visit them over the course of a year and prevent their admission into hospital.</p> <p>  When we look at the type of money that we spend as a country, we have now reached a point where we are spending at least the average if not above the average.  In total terms we spend the eight highest of OECD countries.  In terms of public expenditure we spend the 12th highest of OECD countries but we do not manage as well as some others because we have people who are not accessing services in the right way and we need to develop primary care and make sure it is more accessible.  We have done the research on this, and if we do not do that, when we look at the capacity we will need to put in place to respond to an ageing population, we just could not afford the type of numbers of acute hospital beds that we would have to put in place to continue with the model we have got.  It is not even a case of affordability.  We could not staff them or find space on the hospital sites that we have got, so we have to put the emphasis on primary care and also to put a statutory scheme in place for home care.  There is a clear consensus now across all areas of the House in relation to that and it is one that we would be very anxious to deliver on with colleagues in the HSE over the next ten years to try to realise that vision.</p></speech>

Some GPs have tried to start up primary care centres but they have had to get out of the business because they could not afford it.  Is money the problem in terms of getting GPs to work together?  Usually what happens is that three or four GPs come together and they build a primary care centre with the grants that are available but some have failed.  Is that the model going forward?  We have to make this work on the ground and convince GPs that it is worth their while to come together and give the service that has been outlined, whether it is dentistry or whatever else.  We have a couple of examples in my county of Kilkenny which are very successful but other places are starved of such a service.  What is the problem?</p></speech>

They had invested in properties and the centres did not fail for healthcare reasons, but in some cases they were caught by the property bubble and the financing.  We have now got a very significant programme of primary care centre roll-out.  We are rolling them out as direct builds by the HSE.  Where the HSE owns centres we are rolling them out as leases, where the HSE leases the primary care centres.</p></speech>

It can also put other staff in it.  Alternatively, the HSE leases the centre and often when it leases it, it will lease it from a developer and the developer will also lease part of the facility to GPs.</p> <p>  The third option is PPPs.  We now have a public private partnership programme under way with funding in place from the European Investment Bank to put in place a programme of primary care centres.  Right across this year we have openings of primary care centres.  We will have to keep going at that for the next couple of years but we have a significant upgrade in the infrastructure of primary care.  It has to be modernised if we are to say to people that healthcare is not all about hospitals, it is also about primary care facilities.</p></speech>

This is my last question.  I accept it is not under the remit of the Department but I wish to ask about the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  What is the role of the Department?  Does the Department play a part in the management of the scheme and getting operations and reducing waiting lists?  Does the Department negotiate with the NTPF, assist it and try to co-ordinate its work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#ZZ00700"><p>The National Treatment Purchase Fund is another body under the aegis of the Department of Health, just like the HSE, but obviously it is a smaller body with smaller funding.  We do put a programme of work in place with the NTPF.  The one that is most familiar to people is tackling waiting lists.  We have a significant programme of work under way this year and we are already seeing a reduction in inpatient and day case waiting lists as a result of that.  There are two components to it; there are treatments in private hospitals on the island and also in one hospital in Northern Ireland, and then it also has funding available to the HSE where it can come up with a discrete proposal to do extra activity within HSE facilities.</p> <p>  I know the committee had the NTPF in last week.  The Department has given the NTPF, under the nursing home subvention scheme, responsibility for negotiating pricing with private nursing homes.  It has done that since the initiation of that scheme.  It negotiates the prices; it does not pay the money.  The payment is made by the HSE to the private nursing homes.  The reason for that is that if the HSE were to do it, one could perceive a conflict because it also has its own facilities, so we separated that function out.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Breslin explain the system to me?  People have asked me about it and I want to be able to explain it to them.</p></speech>

The one the Deputy is probably asking about is the cross-border directive.  That entitles one to go to another European country for a large number of treatments, but not for every type of treatment.  One can get the cost of the treatment that would be borne in one's own country.  One has to pay one's own way.  One has to pay for flights and one has to pay upfront to the facility elsewhere but when one comes back, one can apply to the HSE for the cost of that treatment.  If one went for a hip replacement or an eye procedure, one would get the price of the hip or the eye procedure in Ireland.</p></speech>

The schedule of those prices is published.  The other thing for people to be aware of is that very specialist treatment that is not available in Ireland but is available in another European country can be accessed through a European scheme.  One's consultant here would refer one to another facility elsewhere in Europe and one could get treated there and that would be as part of public healthcare which means one would not be charged.  They are two good schemes.</p></speech>

I have a series of questions to put to the Department.  Some of these issues relate to process and some relate specifically to the financial statements.  I hope Mr. Mulvany is listening.</p> <p>  I would like an update on an issue that has crossed our desk recently.  I do not want the response now.  It relates to the Harold's Cross hospice.  There was a HSE internal audit report about a property being disposed of, allegedly, at a serious loss.  We have discussed the issue.  I know it has been reported to the Garda by some individuals.  We want the witnesses to send us a detailed note, insofar as they can.  We do not want to cut across any other investigation.</p> <p>  The second item corresponds to something we mentioned in the information that was sent about what we would raise, namely, dental treatment for high-risk patients.  I refer in particular to Irish people with an intellectual disability or sensory deficit who can be either blind, deaf or dumb.  Some dental surgeons are now getting letters in regard to them.</p><p>They had a routine system for these high-risk patients for the service to be approved.  They have now received letters from the HSE asking for documentary evidence of a person's medical condition to justify the high risk.  They took that up.  I have a letter here from the HSE Mid West Community Healthcare which states it has always been the case that there needs to be a record of the high-risk patients.  Henceforth, it says, the HSE will audit a sample of approvals.</p><p> Is the approach in that region consistent across the country or is that region on its own?  It seems to be a severe issue that if somebody is deaf and dumb, and it is well known and they are in the service year after year, he or she is all of a sudden subject to medical audit of his or her condition.  Does Mr. Connaghan understand the query?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#AAA00200"><p>Yes, I understand the query.  We sent the committee some briefing but I do not know if it covers that query.</p></speech>

We want a bit of clarity on that.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane mentioned the consultants' contract and the enforcement issue which led to the private security people's actions.  This came up at the committee in February.  I subsequently asked the Minister for Health a parliamentary question about whose job it was to ensure the consultants comply with their contract.  The reply I received from the Minister on 14 February said it was the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are enforced.  Mr. Connaghan gave us some details about the percentage of inpatient discharges that are private versus public.  If the HSE's managers had been doing their job, there would have been no need to hire private security firms.  It looks as if when the HSE went to court, it could not prove its case around the mix of public and private because its hospital managers were not doing their job to start with.  It could not verify or stand over them, which is why it had to go to an external source.  </p> <p>  What robust measures are in place to ensure hospital managers make sure the consultants comply with the contracts in their area?  The HSE sent a detailed note about the role of the clinical director, the responsibility of the hospital CEO, the responsibility of the group CEO and the responsibility of the national director.  Much of it seems to have fallen on the hospital CEO.  Formal arrangements should be in place with the clinical directors to review and report on individual contract performance across compliance with contracted hours as set out in the practice plan.  Is that happening in each hospital?  We have been here before and were told circulars had been sent out so we all assumed they were being implemented.  We cannot assume anything.</p></speech>

Yes, that is actively managed.  It is part of the dialogue between me and a hospital group as we meet monthly.  It is also subject to return to me by way of assurance from a hospital group that they are complying, and if they are not they flag the issues.  There is a process and a strong management practice around it.  The process is basically as outlined in the consultant contract itself.  The clear focus needs to be on managing exceptions.  Overall, compliance is quite high and the public work is approximately 83% of the total.</p></speech>

I would have thought it was very simple.  If somebody is diagnosed with cervical cancer, the obvious thing to do would be to look at whatever information is on file in the system about that person.  That should include any screening that was done.  An audit is not needed.  If somebody is diagnosed, the first thing should be to look at his or her medical history.  We should not call that "audit", it is basic patient management.  I do not see why checking a person's medical records has to be called an audit process.</p></speech>

We will see how Dr. Scally describes it.  One of the causal factors is that it is not a singular relationship with that woman.  She had a smear test taken by a GP that was sent to CervicalCheck, which dealt with it, and that is in the past.  Through some other process, however, she may have symptoms, and she finds herself in a hospital with a consultant who was not engaged on that prior history at all.</p></speech>

However, it is not the GP who guides the person through the next stage when an abnormality is detected.  It is the specialist service.</p></speech>

The presence of Mr. Breslin today is good and timely and it has helped.  It was not the only reason but it helped to get it over the line.</p> <p>  We will now have questions on the financial statements which is the reason the witnesses are here.  I refer to Mr. Connaghan's opening statement.  There was a deficit of &euro;139 million being carried forward from the end of 2017 into 2018.  I understand that is called the first charge on the 2018 financial statements.  There is a paragraph in the accounts which states that section 33(3) of the Health Act 2004, as amended, requires the HSE to manage and deliver services in a manner that is in accordance with an approved service plan, and within the determination notified by the Minister and that the Act provides for any deficits to be charged to income and expenditure in the next financial year, meaning 2018, subject to the approval of the Minister and consent of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Has this first charge, which amounts to &euro;139 million, gone against the 2018 accounts?</p></speech>

I am looking for a black and white answer.  The reason I ask is that somebody told me when the Estimate was being discussed in the D&aacute;il that this issue came up and there was a reference to not having the audited accounts for 2017 to finalise that figure.  Is there discretion on this as to whether it is the first charge?  The legislation seems to be quite clear.  I have read the HSE's report.  There has been an assumption in recent years that the deficit from last year is the first charge and that is the phrase used in the HSE's financial statement.  Has there been the first charge?</p></speech>

We are at this stage in the year and the HSE is down &euro;140 million from the first charge that was not specifically mentioned in the service plan.  The HSE is down &euro;200 million for the first two months of the year, which was reported last week.  The figure will be higher figure as the year goes on.  The payments for the cervical check issue must not come out of the patient care budget.  The HSE will have to provide additional resources for that otherwise it will be taken from the health services, which people would find unconscionable.</p> <p>  The HSE is already down several &euro;100 million at this point of the year.  It has not quantified the first charge and has already indicated that it is in an over-run situation.  There is going to be another serious charge as a result of the cervical cancer issue which will have to be met upfront and the figure will be quite large before the year is out.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am concerned that it will not be long before we face the same issue that the health service is down hundreds of millions again.</p></speech>

The service is receiving &euro;15 billion.

The Supplementary Estimate I mentioned earlier for 2017 was &euro;195 million.  It was not the type of figures that we were talking about there.  At least half of it was for Government initiatives.  It is not that we have repetition.  We now have a figure for a first charge that is larger than the Department would have considered was likely to materialise and as a priority we are engaging to try to address that along with the other items the Chairman mentioned.  That is the very detailed and intensive discussions that are going on with the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  The important thing is we do that within the context of the service plan, so that the services - just as the Chairman said - are not affected.  Some of the slippage in the current year relates to savings initiatives that have not yet borne fruit, that are not patient care related and we have to redouble efforts to achieve those.  The Chairman is right in saying that there are significant financial challenges in 2018.  There is a commitment in 2018 on behalf of the two Ministers to seek to address those and to do so without affecting patient care.  However, it is going to require serious effort on behalf of the Department and the HSE to achieve that objective.</p></speech>

I will flag an issue related to the current position.  Page 122 shows that mental health accounts for 5.5% of the total budget of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE cannot be happy with that.   Of a total budget of &euro;15.229 billion, mental health accounts for &euro;841 million or 5.5%.  Is Mr. Connaghan satisfied that only 5.5% of the budget should be spent on mental health?  It seems to be a very small proportion.</p></speech>

Clearly, we need to live within that budget.  We understand the service issues that give rise to budget pressures.  I do not have anything I can relate to that outside Ireland which indicates that is a good or bad figure.  It is clearly historical.  I point to the significant increase in the mental health budget between 2016 and 2017.  I have not worked out the percentage increase but it has been more than &euro;60 million-----</p></speech>

We know we have done &euro;460 million in framework agreements, which are not the same as contracts but similar.  We know that we have &euro;1.56 billion coverage in terms of contracts being sourced.  The issue then is compliance with those contracts.  What percentage of the actual expenditure, now that the contracts are in place, is being used against those contracts?  We do not have a single system that allows us to have one report on that.  What we are doing is that we have a compliance approval programme and we are going around, area by area, determining or estimating a level of non-compliance, and then digging into that and assessing what contracts are there locally that we can make compliant and register nationally, what contracts we need to move away from, and what items we need to put on the sourcing plan to put contracts in place.  Typically, that is showing good progress.  That is the second of our three-year plans.  That one finishes in 2020.  It is a significant volume of work.  If we had a single financial system - again we are working on this - we would be much more easily able to simply run off a report.  Given the scale of our operations, we simply cannot do that.

It was a lecturer or assistant lecturer post, as I understand.  The person was asked and agreed to take on a role to provide locum for a consultant.  For a lot of reasons it took over seven or eight years to fully regularise that and then make all the back payments.  There was no element of settlement in it.  It was simply the difference between a junior doctor's salary and a consultant's salary over seven or more years.</p></speech>

My recollection, and I will double-check the figures, was that the figure is closer to &euro;450,000 or &euro;500,000, but I am open to correction on that.  That is still far too much.  The Chairman should not get me wrong on that.  I will not go into how many billions we actually spent and what percentage of the total the figure is.  We know from some of the work we do around processes that the reporting and, therefore, the payment of prompt payment interest, has improved.

This, it adds, resulted in an underpayment of tax identified in the course of the self-review.   No figure is given for the underpayment.

It has to be looked at in that context.  If we go back to 2017, when we started this, the figure was a multiple of that, and it has reduced progressively every year since.  The largest single figure in that is &euro;1.274 million in employment taxes, and then construction taxes, as I would describe them, at &euro;400,000.  The interest figure, and there is no penalty, has dropped from being as high as &euro;2.2 million five or six years ago to being &euro;104,000.  Again, we would like the figure to be zero, but if we were compared with most public bodies, including this House, the HSE would emerge rather favourably.</p></speech>

Essentially this arises out of the merger of the colleges of education which took place when the former Church of Ireland College of Education became part of Dublin City University, DCU, along with St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and the Mater Dei Institute of Education in 2016.  Part of that arrangement was that there would be a reservation of places on the bachelor of education programme over the following five academic years to allow Church of Ireland or other schools with a minority reformed Christian ethos to have a flow of primary teachers.  A similar arrangement has been put in place and approved by the Oireachtas in 1999, 2003, 2008 and 2013.  This is consistent with our desire, as discussed in debates on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, to ensure that there is a place in our system for minority church schools and that they can continue to operate.  This is an arrangement that was entered into at the time of the merger.  The 32 reserved places represent fewer than 5% of total places in initial teacher education.  The measure ensures that these schools, which probably represent about 5% of schools, have a flow of teachers who are committed to teaching with that ethos.  It works as a reservation, so the Central Applications Office, CAO, system will still apply, but the places will be treated as though they were on another course.</p> <p>  A limited number of people, perhaps 70 to 100 over the years, have applied for this number of places.  The points requirement could be different because they are treated as part of a separate course.  However, it is consistent with a policy that has been in place for many years.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time.  I understand the need for this measure in the current context.  As the Minister will be aware, Sinn F&eacute;in has a distinct policy calling for the complete separation of church and State.  However, we understand that we cannot start from here, so we support this particular move.</p> <p>  However, I want to ask the Minister about a related matter concerning the Employment Equality Act 1998.  I refer to section 37, which allows religious schools to discriminate when selecting teachers.  This is something we have managed to get rid of in Northern Ireland.  Does the Minister have plans to do something similar down here? </p></speech>

In the written script sent by the Minister, which the committee members received in an email this morning, he acknowledged that the place of religion in education is changing.  We all understand that there is a lot of fluidity around this issue at the moment.  Views similar to those Senator Gavan has just expressed are growing in this country.  In this case, however, I certainly understand the background to it.  The merger of the colleges was a significant move at the time, and it is important that we have that kind of integration.  In some ways it is historic that colleges like St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education are coming together in a secular university to train teachers in initial education.  I do not have a question.  I just want to acknowledge that it is the right thing to do at this stage.</p></speech>

I also support the order.  It is important that minority faiths are supported, and without this order the Church of Ireland would have grave difficulty in maintaining the ethos of its schools.  On the broader front, in the long term, does the Minister believe that it is the State's place to support the ethos of particular faiths?  I ask because there are a number of different minority beliefs out there and there may be more in the future.  Regarding the entry requirements, I note that this entry route has a lower CAO points requirement and a lower threshold of leaving certificate results is required.  Could the Minister expand on that, or is there any particular reasoning behind it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#B00900"><p>Taking the questions in reverse order, there is no preordained reason why the reserved places have lower entry requirements.  They are treated as another course.  If a lot of people apply for them, there could be a high threshold.  There is a competition for this particular segment.  It may have historically been somewhat lower.</p> <p>  In regard to the issue of how the State supports schools of different diverse natures, Ireland is unique in that in primary education we have just ten State schools run by the education and training boards, ETBs.  More than 3,100 are private institutions, run by either Educate Together, of which An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta is the patron, or religious denominations.  The State has traditionally supported primary education across a range of patrons.  Where we introduce new schools now, we allow parents to choose which patron should succeed.  We do not say whether it should be a State patron or a non-State patron, but we do seek to ensure that whatever patron succeeds promotes diversity.  The de facto situation is that in the past seven years, which is all I can recall or account for, a primary school has never gone to a patron with a denominational ethos.  They are all going elsewhere.  </p> <p>  However, the State has allowed for considerations of ethos, characteristic and spirit.  That is embedded in our legislation.  That brings me to Senator Paul Gavan's point.  To a degree, the provisions in employment legislation follow on from that.  In this case, people who go undertake this programme must demonstrate an understanding of and a willingness to support the distinctive ethos of Protestant primary schools.  Those are the people who are expected to apply for the places.  I know that Sinn F&eacute;in has a view that primary schools should be a State provision rather than something provided through private or distinctive institutions of different types.  However, the approach in employment law reflects our general approach to educational diversity, rather than trying to be discriminatory.  I suspect that trying to change that would be a bit like the ivy root, as they say.  We would pull one piece thinking it is distinctive, and then all the rest would follow.  I do not know of any proposals to change the provisions to which the Senator refers.</p></speech>

I am genuinely disappointed.  Alongside colleagues who campaigned in the recent referendum, I came across many teachers on the pro-choice side who expressed concern about the fact that they could be discriminated against because they happened to be working in Catholic schools, because the vast majority of schools are Catholic schools.</p><p>That issue must be addressed.  It was done in the North and the world did not end.   Unfortunately, far too many schools are still attached to the Catholic and Protestant churches.  I ask the Department to seriously consider bringing forward legislation in that regard.</p></speech>

The only issue is whether account may be taken of the suitability of a recruitment candidate in terms of the ethos of the school.  It is worth examining whether the provisions are too wide in that regard.  I do not know of any test cases to the Workplace Relations Commission involving such discrimination.   No such case has come to my attention.  I do not know whether the provisions have been tested to ascertain the extent to which such discrimination may be possible under the legislation.  I was not prepared for the question-----</p></speech>

The theme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which the Minister discussed yesterday in the Seanad, is followed on in the documentation.  There are concerns, some of which were outlined by Senator Gavan, in regard to discrimination and so on.</p> <p>  I am satisfied that the doors of Catholic and other schools are open.  As I stated to the Minister in the Seanad, if Damien, a four year old character in the film "The Omen", arrived at the doors of any school, he would be welcomed with open arms.  Some 15% of school-going children in north Monaghan, my area, are non-Irish but that is not an issue and, thankfully, they are integrating very well into society.  We must keep abreast of the matter but I am satisfied that the current situation is acceptable.  However, we must be conscious that the face of Irish society is changing daily.</p></speech>

The requirement for religious discrimination in order to protect minority rights arises from our sectarian school system.  Does the Minister agree that this points to the need for a wholesale transformation of how our education is delivered, the separation of church and State and the creation of non-religious public schools?  Religions could deliver faith education outside school hours.  They are better placed to so do than qualified teachers.  This issue highlights the problems inherent in a sectarian education system.</p> <p>  On a related theme, we have been discussing the question of sex education-----</p></speech>

Education is a very fluid and changing environment.  Deputy Paul Murphy is correct that an education system being designed today would not be 95% composed of denominational schools.  The question is whether such system would have no denominational schools, which the Deputy puts forward as the optimum situation.  The wishes of parents must be taken into account in this matter.  Parents are the primary educators.  It is a strength of society that people wish to bring up their children in their ethos and faith.  However, that must not make others feel small or not valued, etc.  There is undoubtedly an imbalance in our education system.  We are trying to change the system to reflect the changing Ireland without losing some of its strengths.  The transfer of schools from religious to non-religious patrons must occur far more quickly.  That is urgently needed and I have recently initiated a new approach to try to drive it forward.</p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy also raised the issue of whether ethos should be taken out of other areas, specifically relationship and sexuality education.  Again, there are different views on that matter.  Come what may, the proper, factual educational content must be delivered to every student, regardless of school ethos.  In light of the concerns of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and our inspectorate, we initiated a timely review of the delivery of relationship and sexuality education.  The law has changed, as have many other matters.  Deputy Paul Murphy brought forward the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018, which has passed First Stage.  As I stated on Second Stage of the Bill, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, must undertake a broad consultation on the curriculum in order to gather expert views on the content of programmes and how they are delivered.  Although I acknowledge the principle behind the legislation, stipulating curriculum content in primary legislation such that curricular evolution would require amendment of that legislation would probably not be ideal.  However, we must get the view of the NCCA on this matter and allow education stakeholders an input into the discussion in order to be able to make decisions based on the best expertise because it is vital that we get this right.  The NCCA is proceeding with all possible haste in that regard.  It realises the urgency the Oireachtas attaches to the issue but it will do a thorough job.  We have a robust system for the development of curricular change.  It is an evolving space and we must consider how to ensure that religious ethos does not prevent proper progress.  That is a challenge which we must meet.</p></speech>

It met departmental officials on the ancillary recommendations it was considering.  One of the big concerns raised was the fact that school patrons and management have the ultimate say in terms of implementation.  I share that concern, although I welcome the Minister's comments on factual information and so forth.  The next session of this committee will involve discussion of these issues with patrons or joint managerial bodies.  However, the lingering concern is that, because of the manner in which  the patronage and management system works, schools would be able to implement this requirement as they see fit in spite of the good intentions of all present to ensure that it is factually based.</p></speech>

The existing arrangement allows for a policy statement along with the delivery of the programme.</p><p>As the Deputy said, the programme must still be delivered.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, must examine it.  There are concerns about whether it is being delivered to the standard we want.  Apart from the ethos question, there are concerns about it being outsourced to groups in that we do not know what their programme is.  It is not teacher led.  There are concerns about the educational standards in this area generally as well as the ethos, but all those issues are being examined.  While there is an urgency about this matter, and the committee's work will be a valuable input into this, we have to get it right also.  I appreciate the work the committee is doing by having consultations.  It will clearly inform the NCCA in the way it develops a new specification.  It will also deal with the issue that the committee raised.</p></speech>

As everybody is aware, this is fourth engagement on this matter.  Therefore, it is a very important one.  This meeting provides us with the opportunity to explore further the role of management boards, including any challenges which they may encounter in the development and implementation of RSE programmes and any impact that the ethos of the school may cause.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I welcome, Mr. John Curtis, the general secretary, Joint Managerial Body.  He is welcome to the committee once again.  I also welcome Dr. Martin Gormley, director of schools, Donegal Education and Training Board.  He is also very welcome.  I pass on apologies on behalf of Deputy Catherine Martin.  She was here earlier but had to leave to attend another meeting.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan will have to leave to attend another meeting shortly.  I will also have to step out to deal with an oral question in the D&aacute;il at 11.10 a.m. and I ask that another member of the committee take the Chair in my absence.  Deputy Thomas Byrne will be here but he will also have to step out to deal with an oral question at some stage.  I apologise for the intrusion but that is nature of D&aacute;il and Seanad life.</p><p>The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the each of the witnesses to make a brief opening statement of three minutes, which will be followed by engagement with members of the committee. </p><p>Before we begin, I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence about a particular matter, and they continue to do so, they are entitled, thereafter only, to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that evidence only connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I advise witnesses that opening statements and submissions made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>I invite Mr. John Curtis to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#D01100"><p>The Joint Managerial Body is grateful to the Oireachtas committee for its invitation to present the perspective of post-primary faith schools on the provision of relationships and sexuality education.<br/><br/>The Minister&rsquo;s recent request that a review of all aspects of RSE provision be carried out is very timely as the majority of curricular frameworks and resource materials are almost 20 years old and the vital professional development support layer requires additional capacity.  Many of our school mission statements cite development of the whole person as their central aim.  Education, however, cannot be deemed to be holistic in any sense if it ignores either our actions or the spiritual or moral basis of the values that inform such actions.  Schools must therefore engage fully with parents in the development of high-quality programmes of relationships and sexuality education congruent with the characteristic spirit of the school and setting out to educate, in the truest sense, the values, understandings and actions of the generation of young people in their care.<br/><br/>The position of Catholic schools in regard to sex education was outlined in a church document, <i>Familiaris Consortio, </i>which states: &quot;Sex education, which is a basic right and duty of parents, must also be carried out under their attentive guidance, whether at home or in educational centres chosen by them.&quot;  At our annual conference in May of this year, Archbishop Eamon Martin said: &quot;Relationships and Sexuality Education ought to be an integral part of the curriculum in a Catholic school ... [but] should not be reduced to the imparting of so-called 'objective' information, dissociated from a morals and values framework or from the totality of relationships.&quot;</p><p>Archbishop Martin further stated: "I agree that a review of relationships and sexuality education in all schools, including our Catholic schools, is essential if we are to help young people cope with the risks to their health and well-being presented in both the virtual and real worlds they inhabit".  Setting the scene for the delivery of RSE at local level requires the establishment of a school policy which clearly articulates the context and content of the programme and engages, in particular, with the parent perspective.  Informing what transacts within the RSE classroom equally demands a high level of engagement between teaching staff, school leadership and the support services.</p><p> To this end, the Joint Managerial Body, Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, JMB AMCSS, as an organisation, and JMB schools on an individual basis, have been closely associated with the development, consultation and piloting of both the SPHE, incorporating RSE curriculum at junior cycle, and the senior cycle RSE programme and materials.  It is nonetheless incumbent upon school management at local level to ensure that such programmes are compatible with the school&rsquo;s ethos and that parents have had their right to consultation respected, as well as their right to withdraw their child from RSE classes.</p><p> There remains, however, an ongoing challenge in this area which can only be remediated by high quality in-service and ongoing professional support for teachers.  A reduction in the professional support service for teachers in RSE in recent years represents an opportunity for policymakers to engage with both HSE and the Department of Education and Skills, DES, in maintaining such support across the system.  The provision of social personal and health education classes across junior cycle is not an option for schools and should be universal.  The RSE element of the SPHE curriculum is similarly prescribed from first to third year, with the caveat of an opt-out for parents, but challenges to provision include the availability of teachers trained and willing to teach this</p><p>element.  As a matter of priority, and in advance of any medium-term review, DES should invest in a new round of training opportunities for teachers to maintain and increase the pool of such educators available for scheduling into RSE classes.</p><p> In short, we need to adequately train and professionally develop RSE teachers in their own right &ndash; developing expertise in every aspect of both the course materials and the likely questions necessarily arising in the classroom setting.  The development of a postgraduate diploma course in SPHE-RSE is particularly to be recommended.</p><p> The policy of age appropriateness has always formed a central pillar of provision of RSE education in schools, particularly as it relates to the question of sexual consent.  The concept could, however, be widened to incorporate conceptual appropriateness in that students with special educational needs or English language deficit or those at particular ends of the maturity scale should be provided with a differentiated model of teaching and engagement with this critical subject area.  Local school management is best placed to identify such needs but yet again, such nuanced practice will demand high-calibre teacher professional development and school leadership awareness.</p><p> These are critical elements in a young person&rsquo;s education which demand higher than usual levels of school-family mutual awareness and at least some level of genuine partnership in achieving the holistic goals of the educational enterprise.  RSE, in all its forms, represents such an imperative.  Parents and guardians need face-to-face contact with the school on this matter.  Beginning with general information sessions and offering individualised meetings with school personnel where required, represent a basic level of engagement.  The development of an RSE policy must also involve the parent representative body in the school as well as the staff, student council, board of management and trustees.  The relationship between home and school on this issue must be a trusting one, and this can only be developed by maintaining high levels of awareness and communication.</p><p> This is equally true of the relationship between outside agencies and school communities.  School management is charged with the duty of ensuring everything that happens in the school community aligns with its ethos.  Specific areas such as religious education, faith formation, pastoral care and relationships and sexuality education, necessarily demand greater levels of alertness in this respect than, for example, many of the other subjects on the curriculum.  Building up high levels of trust between external agencies and school management should therefore represent a priority for all.  </p><p> JMB is aware that the Minister has written to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to seek a professional review of the landscape of RSE provision in our schools.  JMB is encouraged by the scope of this work which will include: how the RSE curriculum is planned, is taught and how parents are involved; the entire curriculum is being taught in schools to a high standard; the role of the classroom teacher in teaching the curriculum and the appropriate levels of supports which are currently being provided by external providers; what time is given to it, what resources are being provided, and what support materials are being used; and how effective is the continuing professional development opportunities which are currently provided by the Department and other bodies to RSE teachers.</p><p> JMB will, of course, engage fully with this process and looks forward, in particular, to the subsequent investment of new ideas, energy and resources into this most important of educational enterprises.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

As mentioned in our submission, we welcome the opportunity to engage and collaborate.</p> <p>  For the purposes of the presentation, I wish to outline the underlying characteristic spirit of the schools under ETB patronage that informs our delivery of the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, in our curriculum and the role of the boards of management of our schools in its development.  Each ETB, as the patron, appoints a board of management to manage the particular school or college.</p> <p>  I would like to highlight the functions of the school as outlined under section 9(d) of the Education Act 1998, which defines the functions of a school as to "promote the moral, spiritual, social, and personal development of students and provide health education for them, in consultation with their parents, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school."  I believe this is a key point.</p> <p>  ETBs are statutory education authorities with our own corporate identity.  They manage and operate community national schools, some second-level provision, education and training centres as well as a plethora of adult education and training programmes.  While an ETB is the body corporate for all schools, colleges and centres established and maintained under our patronage, ETBs delegate many management functions and responsibilities to its boards of management.</p> <p>  The characteristic spirit and core values of ETBs are important.  Our schools are State, multi-denominational schools.  This has a significant impact on the core values and characteristic spirit of our sector.  At primary level, with the ETB as patron, the core values of our community national schools, CNSs, are: excellence in education; multi-denominational; equality-based; and community focused.  All members of our CNS boards of management receive extensive training to enable them to participate fully in their role as board of management members and to promote the core values of the schools.</p> <p>  There is currently a significant piece of work being carried out across ETBs at post-primary schools, and this is to enable us to clearly articulate our core values and characteristic spirits.  Although this work is ongoing, we can say with confidence that all of our schools are committed to equal respect for all of our students, regardless of their faith or belief, nationality or other aspect of their identity.  Our approach to the curriculum is influenced by this.</p> <p>  Our approach to RSE is not through any particular religious or belief lens.  Therefore, RSE is embedded in social, personal and health education in the curriculum at all levels.  The content of the RSE programme is delivered in an objective and critical manner that avoids any particular religious bias.  In line with our core values and characteristic spirit, we believe that all children and young people have a right to a high quality, holistic and inclusive RSE.  The ETB position, as communicated to the boards of management of our schools, is that RSE is about relationships, emotions and well-being.  This has been central to our roll-out of well-being within the context of the new junior cycle.  This holistic approach considers not only the sexual health of young people, but does so by informing them in a holistic, balanced and factual way.</p> <p> ETBs also have designated schools under its remit.  They manage these community colleges under what we call a model agreement.  This is an ETB school where the management of the school is governed by a specific agreement between the ETB - formerly the VEC - and a co-trustee, possibly the local diocese or a religious congregation or other recognised school patron.</p><p>The model agreement refers to the agreement between the ETB and the co-trustee &ndash; an agreement that as well as giving the co-trustee a role in the management of the school, gives the co-trustee a role in determining the school&rsquo;s characteristic spirit.  This is consistent with the Education Act 1998.<br/><br/>While designated model agreement colleges have a co-trustee, the ETB is the patron.  In regard to this type of designate school, that is, a community college, the characteristic spirit can have some impact in terms of the methods chosen to deliver aspects of the RSE programme.  It may also have a bearing on what resources are chosen to assist delivery.  However, designated schools do not cherry-pick or omit aspects of the RSE programme.<br/><br/><b></b>It is important that the board of management within non-designated schools communicate and consult with the key stakeholders about the RSE policy.  They include students, parents, teachers, school management and, in the case of community colleges, the co-trustee.  These stakeholders have much to contribute to ensuring a successful and highly effective RSE programme is implemented in a school.  The characteristic spirit of a school should not preclude children and young people in any way from acquiring the key messages within an RSE programme.<br/><br/>An extensive training programme to board of management members has been delivered by a cascade model through the ETBI structures.  This is to help members to carry out their role within the boards of management effectively.  It is useful to highlight that the quality assurance aspect of the RSE programme is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills, through its inspectorate.  Quality assurance is possibly through subject inspection.  In this regard, I refer to SPHE.  There is a robust process.  It is also addressed within the management, leadership and learning aspect of the whole-school evaluation.  The board of management is central to this inspection.<br/><br/>The review of RSE by the committee is welcomed by ETBI.  We very much look forward to seeing the deliberations and findings positively influencing the outcomes of the overall review process.  It is important to ensure the review of the RSE curriculum will identify the changes necessary to meet the needs of young people in a very much changing Ireland.</p></speech>

Mr. Curtis said that education cannot be deemed to be holistic in any sense if it ignores either our actions or the spiritual or moral basis of the values that inform such actions.  Does JMB have a stance on what it believes to be the moral issues relating to the teaching of RSE?  Are there particular things that JMB does not want taught under the RSE curriculum?</p> <p>  My next question is for both delegates.  Should RSE be compulsory for students?  Should parents have the right to remove their children from RSE classes in any circumstances?</p> <p>  What do the delegates see as the main challenges in teaching students from different ethnic and religious backgrounds?  We all appreciate that we are living in a more diverse Ireland.  How can we deal with that?  Is there a lack of adequately trained teachers?  Is there something else prohibiting the holistic approach in the roll-out of RSE throughout the country?  Is it more than a matter of teachers getting adequate training?  Are there other challenges?</p></speech>

Is there anything in the State curriculum that is not taught in some or all of his schools in regard to RSE?</p> <p>  Dr. Gormley mentioned the ETBI schools and the community schools.  A town in my constituency has an ETB school, which I will not name because I do not want to talk about particular schools.  There is an ETB secondary school and also a community school.  Is there a difference in what is taught in RSE in those two schools, which are in a small to medium-sized Irish town?</p></speech>

Some of the questions have been covered so, to facilitate progress, I will not go over them again.  Dr. Gormley placed great emphasis on boards of management and their importance as stakeholders.  My experience of boards of management is that it is sometimes difficult to get local people to sit on them.  Is that an issue that Dr. Gormley has come across?  Will it be a problem when trying to implement whatever policy is ultimately agreed?</p> <p>  We often hear it stated by teachers and as part of a campaign by school principals, particularly principals of primary schools, that working school principals' current workload has reached breaking point and that they cannot take much more.  For this to be worthwhile and meaningful and if we are serious about trying to implement change for the betterment of everyone, do we need to consider this issue?</p></speech>

When first reading the material, I noted morality was mentioned many times.  Maybe it is the philosophy student in me.  The word "morality" just kept jumping out at me.  Morality can be relative.  Who exactly sets out the moral indicators for children in terms of what is and is not acceptable, especially regarding sex education and every type of relationship, including transgender relationships.  Who exactly is responsible?  What does morality mean in each of the statements?  In the resource materials for fifth and sixth classes, morality is also mentioned.  The word "morality" is used a lot, in addition to the word "values".  Deputy Naughton asked about what is not taught, as did Deputy Byrne.  Are the delegates aware of the Catholic Church interfering with the sexual education of kids, regardless of the RSE programme?  I refer to when the church becomes aware that particular schools are bringing in external providers or teaching about sexual consent and positive sexual experiences.  I am aware of a number of cases of an individual - I think it might have been a bishop - sending letters to schools to stop what they are teaching regarding sexual consent.  I suppose it makes the schools somewhat fearful because of their boards of management.  How do the delegates feel about that?  I am reading the quotes from Archbishop Martin.  He used the phrase, "the imparting of so-called 'objective' information".  I believe I am right in saying the Catholic Church has been imparting so-called objective information.  Sexual education is much more factual when we move to a new age and away from the Catholic values associated with sexuality.  I notice phrases such as "essential if we are to help young people cope with the risks to their health".  Sometimes when it comes to the Catholic Church and sexual education, the statements are risk-associated.  It is about the risks to one's life and health, the risk of becoming pregnant outside marriage and the risk of STIs.  The approach is all risk-oriented rather than about teaching sexual education in a positive framework around negotiated sexual experiences, what is acceptable, why experiences should be positive and why one should be confident in certain circumstances.  My main question is on who sets out the idea of morality in each school.  Second, how do the delegates feel about the Catholic Church sending letters to school to stop them from carrying out sexual consent workshops?</p></speech>

Almost three quarters of students found their experience of sex education to be at least extremely unsatisfactory.  Some 87% of students surveyed found that LGBTQ+ relationships were not discussed sufficiently.  Some 25% or so said contraception was not mentioned at all.</p><p>Mr. Curtis referred to the document <i>Familiaris consortio</i>as informing how schools with a Catholic ethos would deliver relationships and sexuality education.  Does he agree with the views set out which I will quote and does he think they should inform how sex education is delivered?  It states:</p><blockquote>In this context education for chastity is absolutely essential, for it is a virtue that develops a person's authentic maturity and makes him or her capable of respecting and fostering the &quot;nuptial meaning&quot; of the body.  Indeed Christian parents, discerning the signs of God's call, will devote special attention and care to education in virginity or celibacy as the supreme form of that self-giving that constitutes the very meaning of human sexuality ... For this reason the Church is firmly opposed to an often widespread form of imparting sex information dissociated from moral principles.  That would merely be an introduction to the experience of pleasure and a stimulus leading to the loss of serenity - while still in the years of innocence - by opening the way to vice.</blockquote> <p>Does that inform how sex education is delivered in schools with a Catholic ethos?  If we had a curriculum which was, in the view of the bishop, supposedly objective and not informed by a religious ethos, would the schools under the delegates' management, in their opinion, have the legal right not to deliver some of that curriculum if it was found to go against the ethos set out in, for example, <i>Familiaris consortio</i>?</p><p>The final question is for Dr. Gormley.  Atheist Ireland has carried out some research, while we have raised some of these cases in the D&aacute;il with reference to education and training board, ETB, schools, for example, in County Tipperary which state they have a Roman Catholic ethos.  How can the ETB ensure the professed Roman Catholic ethos does not interfere with the delivery of objective sex education?</p></speech>

With Deputies Hildegarde Naughton and Jan O'Sullivan and Senator Lynn Ruane, I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, of which a key ancillary recommendation concerned the need for a consistent programme of sex education, regardless of school ethos.  I do not see how that can sit within the remit of schools that come under the Joint Managerial Body, JMB.  I say that respectfully, but the last questioner made it very clear why that was the case.  Even the language used in <i>Familiaris consortio</i>sounds like something from another century which I guess it is at this stage.  Is Mr. Curtis saying the JMB cannot agree with the idea of having an objective, consistent programme of relationships and sexuality education, regardless of school ethos?</p><p>With regard to Dr. Gormley's presentation, I have a concern about the model agreement college, whereby it is tied with a trustee partner such as the local diocese or religious congregation.  That surely has to have a impact locally on how the issue is dealt with.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very clear that it is a republican party.  It believes in the complete separation of church and State.  It also believes education in this area should be consistent.  It does not think it should be watered down or changed because of ethos.  Fundamentally, we are dealing with a problem in how the education system grew.  It should be democratic and under the control of the State, but it is not.  As the Minister said, it is primarily under private patronage.  I want to understand those views.  It was key in the debates we had at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, its outworkings and the outworkings on which we will report.</p></speech>

I am a fan of the home-school liaison system.  It is a good one.  The link between parents and teachers in school is important in the provision of RSE.  Do the delegates believe home-school liaison officers could be an appropriate link?  They would, however, need extra support through training, etc.  That question is particularly for Mr. Curtis.</p> <p>  Dr. Gormley talked about the characteristic spirit of ETB schools.  The ETB's post-primary section is carrying out work to establish what are the schools' core values and characteristic spirit, another word for "ethos" to a certain extent.  When do the delegates expect this body of work to be completed?  Is it something that could inform the process?  "Ethos" can sometimes be a loose term.  Is it the delegates' opinion that it can sometimes be used as an excuse to avoid implementation of an effective RSE programme in schools?  Something that has come up in our stakeholder meetings is that the delivery of RSE in schools has not been monitored through whole-school evaluations and inspections.  There is a sense that what is measured is monitored.  Therefore, if RSE became part of whole-school evaluations, we might have better implementation.</p> <p>  On the guidelines issued by the Department for developing, monitoring and implementing an RSE policy in schools, there is a list of protocols.  A public meeting has to be held to be attended by parents and representatives are nominated to participate in an RSE and a social, personal and health education, SPHE, committee, with the principal and other staff members, etc.  They will have the opportunity to develop a set of guidelines, but that process does not seem to be happening or adhered to.  Do the delegates have views on why that is the case?</p> <p>  What is the delegates' opinion on what should happen at departmental level to ensure effective implementation of the RSE policy that will I hope be developed both from the recommendations of this committee and the review the Minister is undertaking?  We will start with Mr. Curtis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#G00700"><p>On the issues raised, any RSE programme has to look at the facts in all aspects of humanity and sexuality.  We are very strong on that point, that that has to be the case.  Ultimately, our schools are Catholic and, as such, have a right to determine that their ethos will have a say in how they are administered and governed and how programmes take place.</p><p>We are also very conscious that parental choice is very significant here and there would have to be consultation on the development of any RSE programme and how it would be delivered in schools.  Any sound relationships and sexual education, RSE, programme must engage in all issues such as contraception and LGBT.  As a management body, we work with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, on LGBT issues to ensure that school pupils are looked after and supported there.  All aspects of humanity must be examined and dealt with.  At the same time, we are Catholic schools, that is how we differ from the schools Dr. Gormley represents, and we are cognisant of that.  We are keen to ensure our children are prepared for the challenges they will face as they embark out in life and that there is some moral framework or compass provided to assist them in that.  That is very important.  </p><p> A key point is that the issue of consent in relationships has come front and centre in this course in Ireland in recent years.  Perhaps we have not looked at that as closely as we should have on what consent is and how relationships should develop.  That should be to the fore of any programme being examined, remodelled and re-evaluated.  There are caricatures of what Catholic schools are which do not reflect the reality.  We are diverse and inclusive.  We have to be discursive; in this day we cannot teach teenagers, which is what we do, without being discursive and open.  I take the point that has been made about some of the student surveys which point to some difficulties that we have.  We will engage with those through the RSE consultation process.  I note that in 2010 when Comhairle na n&Oacute;g had a survey on this issue, that the Department reissued some guidelines to schools on RSE to which schools adhere.  It is very important that we listen to the student voice.  We need to learn.  </p><p> I was starting off as a principal when the RSE programme began.  We invested a lot of time and energy into discussions at local level with our parents, into liaising with the Department and management bodies as to how the programme would roll out.  A lot of resources were put into it supporting those who might speak on RSE in schools or teach on that subject.  Over time, perhaps because of cutbacks, we might have taken our eyes of the ball.  That training and the urgency we had around the area has stalled and it is important that we re-examine it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1414" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#H00300"><p>It is across the country.  I imagine in the context of some of the negative feedback we have had from student groups on this I would be surprised if there was a difference between denominational or non-denominational schools.  We live in a dialectic age and one cannot sterilise information.  If one is talking to teenagers, of course all facts must be presented to them.  Obviously, in our Catholic schools we want to have some moral framework or compass to help guide our children through the challenges they have, and I return to the consent and relationships.  Perhaps we have not spoken enough on issues such as relationships and have taken our eye off the ball.  Currently, the big issue we are confronted with arises from the digital age and what information is out there for children.  The huge issue in RSE and all it entails is what is age-appropriate.  When it was first constituted, one thing RSE looked at very closely was the age-appropriateness of information.  The goalposts have changed immeasurably on this and we need to re-examine it.</p> <p>  I am dealing with a broad range of questions here.  We are absolutely committed to a review of the process and aware that all information must be given to children and students in schools.  We are very committed that, as Catholic schools, we try to provide a moral framework, and must be cognisant of parents' views on the subject.  As someone who is not long out of working in a school, and being a practising principal, I know that parents are very vocal in schools and have a very strong voice.  Perhaps, through this process, their voice will be louder.  We need to engage.  The Chair issued a press release around today's proceedings which noted that this is not an issue that should be left to schools.  Schools are not a panacea for all society's ills.  There ought to be an awareness-raising exercise on this.  In discussion such as this, we may disagree on some aspects but I think we all want to educate our children on the difficulties out there, the difficulties around relationships and those that they face in the digital age.  As an educator, we are somewhat like rabbits caught in the headlights because of the speed of change.  I do not think that we have caught up sufficiently.  We will engage in any process that the Minister puts in place on RSE and we are fully committed to that.  Obviously, we have a Catholic perspective but we have always been strong on the private public partnership and what that entails for our schools.  We have always worked very closely with the Department to ensure the delivery of what it determines in the curriculum and will continue to do so.  </p> <p>  There is an issue of resources and training for teachers.  A principal might not have people jumping up and down to teach RSE classes.  It can be difficult to get people to engage with it because of its complexities; it is not a simple subject for teachers to go into.  We need to upskill teachers and encourage them.  We should look at the positives of what is involved and of relationships and why we need to talk about these things.  Work must be done on teacher training and the Department can help by providing resources.  Perhaps a diploma programme could be established to give people the confidence to engage in these very complex issues.  I would reiterate a point which is fundamental, namely that children must be given all information.  We have to discuss matters such as contraception and those related to LGBT.  We are all aware of that and do it as best as we can but we must be cognisant that schools have their ethos.  As Catholic schools, we have a strong belief in providing a framework to equip  children for challenges they face now and in the future.  It must be done in a dialectic way involving communication.  There will be disagreement and we will be challenged.  We are dealing with teenagers, it is their job to challenge us, give out and criticise.  That is what happens in schools.  We cannot go into schools, not deal with things, and expect our students and parents to be happy with that.  That does not happen.</p></speech>

We are an advisory body for schools and all schools have their own patron bodies, etc.  As I am not aware of that, I find it difficult to comment.  I know on occasion at local level people wrestle with some of these aspects and they are trying to determine what is best for the school.  Those are issues that will be teased out and it will be useful to have this national conversation around it as well.

I am talking about the idea of an outside body becoming involved.  The school was running this programme for nearly two years.  It was going well with positive feedback, parents were involved and the school principal sanctioned everything.  It was the Catholic Church outside intervening in what was already a decision within the school.  The school was not wrestling with it or finding any complications or obstacles with it.  It was very happy with the programme.  I know Mr. Curtis is saying he cannot comment on something he is not aware of.  He is now aware that I am saying this is happening.</p></speech>

I repeat the point that I find it difficult to comment on individual cases I am not aware of.  I suppose I would not comment on them anyway because the schools have their patron bodies and they have a voice.  I am not aware of that.</p> <p>  Again, I come back to the point that I am fully aware of the generality of fantastic work being done in our schools in the context of looking after the students and supporting them in the RSE and SPHE areas, and dealing with them in a discursive open way on all these issues.  From my point of view, I am trying to make the case that there may be local difficulties on occasion and maybe we need to discuss and address them.  The generality of what goes on in our schools needs to be sharpened.  We need to look at it as a society and as an education sector, but there is great work taking place.  I am fundamentally certain of that.</p></speech>

The point we are making is that parents are the prime educators in this sphere.  That is what we are attending to.  In the context of anything that emerges obviously we need to talk to the parents at local level.  We represent Catholic schools.  Parents send their children to Catholic schools.  We are cognisant of that and we deal with those parents.  We are trying to educate children to deal with the difficulties they will face in this world, based on some moral framework that gives them some moral compass as they move through.  Where we might differ in the context of our opinions is that we do not believe it is possible to have purely objective information; everything in some respect is values based.</p> <p>  I recently came across a circular issued by the Department in 2010 further to the deliberations of the National Youth Council at the time.  The point it made was that schools needed to properly engage with the RSE programme.  It also made the point that programmes based on information alone are very limited in the learning outcomes they can achieve and can, in fact, be counterproductive in influencing values, attitudes and behaviour.  We are encouraging issues to be dealt with in a discursive manner and students can talk about issues and can be presented with the challenges or the promise of a Catholic framework.  Obviously children and their parents have to engage with that.  If parents do not want their children to be part of an RSE programme, they have the capacity to withdraw their children from it.</p> <p>  It is a complex issue.  I contend that we have been dealing with it at school level very productively.  It is important that we review the issue because obviously, as I said, we have differing views in the sector.  I firmly believe there needs to be a focus on talking, on the dialectic and on engaging with the students.  The crucial aspect is that we talk about everything and put the focus on the "R" in RSE.  Relationships are more and more important in the context of the issues we are dealing with in schools today.  Children can be in very lonely places now because we are in the digital age and because of smartphones.  The capacity to engage that was part and parcel of our generation is no longer there to the same extent, with all the attendant mental health issues that might accrue from that.  This is a highly complex area.</p> <p>  I am very interested as well in-----</p></speech>

We need to recognise that parents are the prime educators.  We need to respect the views of parents as well as the student voice in terms of compulsion.</p> <p>  On the main challenges for teachers, we are living in a very different Ireland now.  The children and young people who sit in front of teachers today have considerable exposure to the Internet, social media, etc., and this presents serious challenges for teachers.  Importantly when teachers are delivering RSE, taking due respect of the characteristic spirit of the school, they must be inclusive and respectful with an emphasis on well-being and trust.</p> <p>  Deputy Naughton also asked about training.  We used to have a specific group of teachers who are what we would call SPHE teachers.  This is very much changing in schools now with the introduction of the new junior cycle and the whole emphasis on well-being.  The junior cycle training under the directorship of Dr. P&aacute;draig Kirk is very much based on a whole-school approach.  When there is training on well-being, all the teachers in a school attend.  If we are to move forward as educators that is the emphasis we need to have in our schools.  It is not just selected teachers who are delivering on SPHE and RSE ultimately.  There has to be a whole-school approach.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne, who is now in the Chair, asked about an ETB school as a non-designated school and a community school.  There is a difference there.  We have ETB schools, community colleges and community schools.  Community schools come under the remit of the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, AMCSS.  A community college is a school whereby the ETB and a co-trustee go together.  The ETB is the patron.  I am not sure if the Deputy is referring to a community school or a community college.</p></speech>

That is the nub of this whole debate.  Is there a difference between what is taught in the co-patronage school and in the ETB school in this area?</p></speech>

The role of the inspectorate is to ensure that the curriculum is being rolled out as stipulated.</p> <p>  On the question from Senator Gallagher, boards of management are challenging in terms of the role they have to play for their members.  Capacity is one thing in terms of ensuring that we have the right expertise around the table.  We are fortunate in ETB schools in that we have ETB nominees.  We also have staff nominees and parental nominees.  That forms the board of management in ETB schools.  An extensive training programme has been implemented by ETBI through a cascade model where each ETB is responsible for the training of the members of the boards of management.  We do recognise the role ETB boards of management play.  It is a very comprehensive role and a lot arrives on the tables of boards of management, for example, matters under section 29 on suspensions and expulsions, inspection reports, meetings with the inspectorate and school policy among other areas.  Extensive training is required.  We have been fortunate in that we try to identify expertise from an ETB point of view and then we have our staff nominees and parental nominees.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher also referred to the workload of principals.  We recognise that the role of the principal is an increasingly difficult and challenging one within the current educational space.  For example, over the past year we have had a number of new initiatives and new items that have come onto the desks of principals.  There is the general data protection regulation, GDPR, the new childcare arrangements in that regard, the posts of responsibility and the reviews in that regard, and the implementation of the new junior cycle.  They are just some of the things as well as trying to run a school on a day-to-day basis.  The role of the principal is a very challenging one.  That has been communicated to the Department through ETBI.  We recognise that workload.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane talked about morality.  It is important that core values are clearly identified.  We are doing a lot of work around that with the post-primary sector.  The reason that has been highlighted and has come on the agenda is in terms of school patronage, and it is very important.  Another issue is the changing Ireland we are now in.  We have seen that in recent times with the various amendments that have been voted upon and agreed and they influence our school.  Core values are very important.  In the RSE programme things that need to be central include consent, contraception, sexual expression in relationship, safe use of the Internet, social media and LGBTQ+.  The important thing from an ETBI point of view is that it is delivered in a holistic, balanced and factual way.</p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy referred to the recent survey from the students' union on the delivery of RSE within the curriculum and the lack of satisfaction a number of students expressed in regard to it.  His question was whether we are aware of that.  The Department of Education and Skills is the body charged with ensuring implementation.  It consults by means of a whole-school evaluation, WSE, with both parents and students.  What is delivered back to us is that there has not been a huge amount of negativity expressed towards us, but I accept that we are trying to deliver to second level students who have so much access to the Internet and to social media and are coming in with some views they have formed from external sources.  There is a challenge in that regard.</p> <p>  We would like to see an increased emphasis on SPHE and RSE being central to the Department of Education and Skills inspections.  The student voice is so important.  We now see that as very much part of the implementation of the new junior cycle.  There is an increased emphasis on listening to students within schools, and rightly so.</p> <p>  Senator Gavan talked about the model agreement in terms of the characteristic spirit.  The characteristic spirit of a non-designated ETB school is quite clear in terms of being multidenominational, inclusive, respectful and concerned about well-being.  In terms of a designated school, a community college, the fact that there is a co-trustee influences the characteristic spirit of the model.  That was why the model agreements were set up at the time.  One is respectful of the characteristic spirit of both the patron and co-trustee.</p></speech>

Dr. Gormley can say the content as delivered is the same but then he says different materials and different methods are used, which gives rise to the question of whether what the student is taught in the classroom is any different.  It would seem to me that it is likely that it is.  It is a Jesuitical distinction between the content and the method of delivery.  To give an example, in Coachford College in Cork, I presume there is an ETB co-trustee and it has an RSE policy which says the human body is sacred and that marriage is the natural context in which the self giving love in its entirety is possible in co-operation with God and bringing new human life into the world.  That is its policy.  How on earth then do the students in that school not receive different content?</p></speech>

The content is delivered but how it is delivered is key.  If one takes an issue like contraception, if it is delivered in a way that says this is not the right thing to do, it is going to make a crucial difference.  To be frank, that is what the Catholic ethos teaches us, namely, that it is not the right thing to do.  In terms of what we are trying to develop, namely, a comprehensive, consistent approach to RSE, this is a major stumbling block.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Martin Gormley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#K02600"><p>We must be respectful of co-trustees and the characteristic spirit of the school because it is enshrined within the Education Act.  We referred to section 9(d) earlier.  The reference in the overarching piece of educational legislation is to the characteristic spirit, as promoted by the board of management, which may incorporate a co-trustee or have one central to that.  We cannot ignore it.</p></speech>

I will address Dr. Gormley's point about the co-trustees in a moment, but when Mr. Curtis was giving his initial presentation, he said schools must engage with parents in the context of the ethos.  He described the parent as being the primary educator and then he talked about that within the context of the moral and values framework of the ethos of the school.</p><p>I do not know if there is any research on this but in some cases parents have no choice but to send their children to a school of a particular ethos because of where they live.  In many other cases, parents make the decision to send their children to the local school.  I live in an area with two local schools, one of which is a Catholic boys' school, a diocesan college, and the other a Catholic girls' school run under one of the religious orders.  If people are making the choice to send their child to the local school and consider that to be more important than anything else, there must be a lot of parents in Catholic ethos schools who want something much more inclusive in the RSE curriculum than is contained in the Catholic ethos description.  When the delegates say they consult parents, exactly how does that take place?  Do they just assume parents have sent their child to a school because they want a Catholic ethos, for example?  I know that from my own experience.</p><p> For Dr. Gormley on the same issue, in respect of co-trustees, what about the rights of the other trustees and the parents of children in the other half of the equation?  Surely they have the right to the ethos they have chosen, which is that they want complete, open, direct information without any judgmental imposition on them.  Both delegates talk about the rights of parents but they are assuming what the parents want in both cases.  Is that not true?</p></speech>

Everything seems to be mediated by the characteristic spirit and by ethos.  Both delegates talked about the challenges and obstacles, such as trying to balance the co-trustees.  In their honest opinions, is the only way forward to remove characteristic spirit and ethos from our schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#L00300"><p>I am going to return to Familiaris Consortio.  In his opening statement, Mr. Curtis said that the position of the Catholic schools on sex education was outlined in this document.  Does he agree that RSE in Catholic schools should be taught in the context of that document's statement that "in this context, education for chastity is absolutely essential"?  Does he agree that this should inform the teaching of RSE in Catholic schools today?  Does he agree that the imparting of "sex information dissociated from moral principles ... would ... be an introduction to the experience of pleasure and a stimulus leading to the loss of serenity ... by opening the way to vice"?</p> <p>  There can be lots of reasons for teachers to be uncomfortable teaching RSE.  One of the reasons cited by teachers is a sense that because of the characteristic spirit of the school, they can walk into difficult territory and that by answering certain questions or giving certain information they can contravene the characteristic spirit of the school.  Do Mr. Curtis and Dr. Gormley agree?</p> <p>  The last comments by Dr. Gormley get to the point of Senator Ruane's question.  Section 9(d) of the Education Act, 1998, provides that a recognised school shall use its available resources to "promote the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students, and provide health education for them, in consultation with their parents, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school."  That is key.  Does Mr. Curtis agree that it gives a legal right to Catholic schools to mediate - which is the word he has used - the content of the curriculum in respect of RSE?  A key question for us is whether we need to deal with that.</p></speech>

If we listen and accept what they are saying, we are not that far apart.  Everyone seems to be saying that schools must teach what the NCCA sets down and that the curriculum at least should be taught as set down by the NCCA.  What we seem to be saying is that the resources or the materials may be different.  There is a difference of opinion on this issue between Catholic schools and other views that are reasonable but actually not that far apart.  Little may need to be done to make this satisfactory in protecting Catholic ethos but also ensuring that sex education is objective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018070500002#L00500"><p>The Vice Chairman has put his finger on a key point about proportionality and balance in the arguments.  In practical terms, we are not that far apart because information is being disseminated according to the RSE guidelines determined by the Department.  Schools will have a separate frame.  I know the point he is making.  We will engage with the RSE review and see what emerges from the consultation but we will also advance the position that in our schools there is a Catholic frame and a set of Catholic values and attitudes that need to be advanced and given to children.  There is a dialectic space after that whereby dialogue will be engaged in and people will speak.<br/><br/>I am more concerned about the issue Deputy O'Sullivan raised about parental engagement.  We had an awful lot of parental engagement on RSE when the programme emerged in the first instance.  Many meetings were held at school level and that created an awareness around it.  There was a lot of discussion.  That has not occurred recently in as serious a space.  There is ongoing consultation with parents at school level in respect of RSE programmes because we have student council meetings.  I imagine that as part of this process there will be engagement with parents on a more fundamental level than might hitherto have been the case.<br/><br/>I take the point that we advance a Catholic frame and try to educate the children to have some kind of a moral compass <i>apropos</i>of how they engage.  It is hugely important that we get our teachers to engage and that they want to teach in this space.  Perhaps there can be a reluctance because it is a complex area.  It is a complex area for all of us - for the members and for us.  The conversation we are engaging in now will be useful in this sphere.<br/><br/>I take the Vice Chairman's point that there is not that fundamental a difference between us.  We have characteristic spirit in our schools.  It is enshrined in the Act and is the <i>modus operandi</i>of our schools.  However, we operate in partnership with the State, as we always have and always will.  We will engage in dialogue with the State on this as on all issues to ensure that partnership can go forward as well.  The characteristic spirit is key and crucial to our schools.  It is how we fundamentally operate and we would like to think that our Catholic schools are a good example of how a private-public partnership can work.<br/><br/>I will come back to what concerns us at school level, namely, the changing nature of technology, the digital age and the challenges that students are facing on the ground.  In the context of proportionality, I would like to go back to the &quot;R&quot; in RSE.  Perhaps even in today's debate we are focusing too much on one aspect of this.  It is a matter of how children engage with each other, how to get them talking to each other, how to deal with issues around mobile phones, etc., and how we engage parents in a broader conversation.  That is useful.<br/><br/>A lot of the activity around the review of RSE resulted from the Belfast case and issues around consent and relationships.  That led to forthright and frank conversations around kitchen tables in all households in the country.  That is hugely educative for us and perhaps we can use this debate in a broad sense as a springboard to ask parents to engage more.  Schools cannot do everything.  I take the point Senator Ruane made.  We ask so much of our schools now.  These are complex spaces and we are overloaded.  Of course we will engage with this as best we can.</p><p>We are cognisant of the fact that our principals can only do so much.  We need resources from the Department in the context of RSE as well.  We need programmes whereby our teachers can feel confident in teaching the RSE programme and we need resources in that space.</p></speech>

We have a small minority of designated community colleges under our patronage.  The question concerned whether the RSE programme should be devoid of characteristic spirit.  It is important that parents are consulted on how RSE is delivered and the space within which it exists.  The primary school RSE curriculum was introduced in 1999 and the post-primary curriculum came in in 2000.  Each board of management has an RSE policy on which parents and students are consulted.  It is a stakeholders' policy.  We often refer to parents as partners in education.  Increasingly, students are also being recognised in respect of the contribution they can make as a student voice, which is also important.  In terms of characteristic spirit, then, should RSE be devoid of it completely?  What we have to recognise is that it is important to consult and work with parents on the delivery of the RSE programme.</p></speech>

What I will take away from the meeting is that we all want the best for children.  I speak as a parent.  What I want for my children is that they would be as best equipped as possible to face the many challenges that lie ahead of them.  Mr. Curtis said that in many ways here we are like a rabbit in a headlight and that is true.  The world is moving at such a pace that we are all struggling to keep abreast of developments, be they in social media or wherever.  As parents, there are many challenges in how we interpret what is going on around us and how best to equip our children.  A key component in all this is the home and what the child hears from his or her parents.  We cannot lose faith that although we hand them over to our teachers for a few hours a day, fundamentally children will be developed primarily by what they hear in the home.</p> <p>  I am encouraged now that we are undergoing this process.  All of us are coming at it from different angles but ultimately we all want the best for our children.  We have to give this process space.  I welcome the fact that we are having this conversation.  I am confident that all of our hopes and aspirations in respect of this end process will be incorporated into the report.</p></speech>

I do not think we are that far apart either.  It seems there is a huge gulf on this issue but  it can, and should be, resolved and this committee will certainly work to make sure that it is resolved to everybody's satisfaction in the near future to ensure our children are educated properly and that every interest will be protected.</p> <p>  I welcome our visitors in the Gallery.  Ms Nessa White is the new general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland and Ms Deirdre Matthews is the new president of the Joint Managerial Body, JMB, for school management in voluntary secondary schools.

I am the director of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, in Ireland.  I am joined by Ms Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, who is a humanitarian affairs adviser on migration.  I thank the committee for affording MSF this timely opportunity to share an update on our lifesaving work in the central Mediterranean Sea and on the ground in Libya.</p> <p>  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res is in an international, independent, medical humanitarian organisation that delivers emergency aid to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics, natural disasters and exclusion from healthcare.  Our teams offer assistance to people based solely on need, irrespective of religion, gender or political affiliation, and our actions are guided by medical ethics and the principles of neutrality and impartiality.  Simply put, we go where we are needed, regardless of who and where our patients may be.</p> <p>  To put this into perspective, we currently have around 40,000 staff working in more than 70 countries worldwide.  Importantly, more than 95% of our funding comes from private individuals, including some in Ireland, which means we are financially independent from state power, religious groups and multilateral organisations.</p><p>As has been seen in this committee previously, Irish medical staff are providing life-saving care to communities caught up in some of the world's most severe humanitarian crises.  The Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen are just a few of the places where field workers from Ireland are working.<br/><br/>MSF also provides medical care to refugees, migrants and asylum seekers around the world.  Wars, persecution, conflict and poverty are pushing record numbers of people from their homes.  The United Nations estimates there are 68.5 million displaced people worldwide and today, with 85% of displaced people hosted in developing countries, looking after people on the move is a necessity worldwide and not something that is only relevant in Europe.<br/><br/>We appear before the committee today following what was the deadliest seven-day period so far this year, during which at least 200 people lost their lives, 170 of whom died since last Friday when European leaders agreed to blame search and rescue missions and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and obstruct their work.  This is a critical time for people embarking on these crossings but NGO search and rescue is being blocked and demonised by European governments.<br/><br/>We commend the Taoiseach's offer to welcome 25 vulnerable people from the humanitarian search and rescue ship, <i>MV Lifeline,</i>which was turned away from a number of European ports last week.  It is a truly humanitarian gesture which sends out a positive message when Europe is in dire need of such acts of solidarity and compassion.  Speaking at the conclusion of the EU summit last Friday, An Taoiseach quite rightly made the comment that this &quot;is not so much a migrant crisis as it is a political crisis.&quot;  Unfortunately, however, he also made some more unhelpful comments about NGOs saving lives at sea, saying that some were not up to much good in the Mediterranean.  These were unfair comments.  NGOs engaged in search and rescue have saved tens of thousands of lives in the past three years.  In Europe it is becoming popular to seek scapegoats, rather than acknowledging Europe's failure to respond to migration in a way in keeping with Europe's stated values of solidarity and humanity.  NGOs have provided the only dedicated search and rescue capacity in the Mediterranean as European policies support efforts by the Libyan coast guard to intercept and return people to Libya.  Demonising NGOs or the refugees and migrants they assist will not help this situation.  Search and rescue is a response to, and not the cause of, the crisis.<br/><br/>We note that Ireland is using its strong identity as a neutral, humanitarian player on the world stage to pitch for a non-permanent member status on the UN Security Council.  It is important to exercise this same consistency of voice and approach on behalf of the people attempting to flee violence and abuse in Libya, especially in a moment when the politics of populism threatens to take away the human element of the response to migration.  It is crucial that we put the lives of the men, women and children we assist every day at sea above politics.<br/><br/>MSF appeared before the committee one year ago, before the decision was made to end the humanitarian Operation Pontus.  The men and women of the Irish Naval Service have shown great professionalism and compassion saving lives as part of Operation Sophia.  It should be noted, however, that a main focus of that mission is to support the Libyan coast guard&rsquo;s efforts to intercept migrant dinghies and boats leaving the shore and return them to Libya, where many face horrific treatment and abuse.  European migration strategy prioritises preventing people from reaching our shores above the lives of people.  The aim is to keep human suffering out of sight and out of mind for the European public.<br/><br/>We again thank members for giving us an opportunity to address the committee today.  I hand over to Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui, humanitarian affairs adviser on migration with MSF.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018070500002#C00200"><p>I have spent time in Libya in detention centres for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers and on the <i>MV Aquarius</i>, the ship which MSF operates with SOS M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e doing search and rescue at sea.  MSF began its search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea in May 2015, after Italy discontinued Operation Mare Nostrum.  At the time, it appeared that Europe was willing to allow people to die at sea in large numbers.  We fear that is the case again today.  Since then, MSF has rescued and assisted more than 76,000 people in peril and provided emergency healthcare to people on board our rescue ships.  Time after time on board, we hear the stories of refugees and migrants who come through Libya.  I would like to share a testimony that our nurse from Ireland collected on the <i>Aquarius</i>ten days ago:</p><blockquote>When they beat people and they saw the UN was coming, they would hide the beaten people in another room and they said to us: &quot;Don't tell the UN anything that happens here, if you say that, we are going to kill you.&quot;  They will threaten to kill us so nobody would say anything.</blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, this is one experience we have heard many times.<br/><br/>Last week&rsquo;s European Council conclusions fall short of the humanitarian obligations of Europe.  The only thing European countries seem to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are or the horror they are escaping, and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations.  This is a distraction.  The real issue is that EU member states are putting migrants and refugees in a position where they have a choice between risking their lives at sea or being trapped and abused in Libya.<br/><br/>For a summit that was supposed to be the defining moment for the EU, governments appear to have only agreed on the lowest common denominator, hardening their stance on search and rescue and further dehumanising people in need, and turning migrants, refugees and asylum seekers into little more than commodities.  The same governments that were just a few months ago condemning reports of slave markets in Libya seem today to have no hesitation in escalating policies that may increase the suffering of people trapped there, whose only crime is to have fled conflict, violence and poverty.<br/><br/>The European Council stated: </p><blockquote>[it] will step up its support for the Sahel region, the Libyan Coastguard, coastal and southern communities, humane reception conditions, voluntary humanitarian returns, cooperation with other countries of origin and transit, as well as voluntary resettlement.  All vessels operating in the Mediterranean must respect the applicable laws and not obstruct operations of the Libyan Coastguard. </blockquote> <p>It may sound innocuous but make no mistake, behind this wording there is a deliberate policy from EU member states to trap some of the most vulnerable people in Libya.  MSF is directly witnessing the human cost of this policy at sea and in Libya.<br/><br/>We all agree that Libya is not a safe place, especially not for migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  Whether those who risk their lives at sea in overcrowded and unsafe dinghies are fleeing conflict, persecution or poverty, or are on the move for other reasons, what they all have in common is their experience of Libya, which is marked with physical and sexual violence, torture, forced labour, beatings, exploitation and all forms of abuse.  Most of the people we assist at sea will have spent time in places of detention or in captivity, where they suffer and witness extreme levels of violence.  Under the pretence of saving lives and disrupting the business model of smugglers and traffickers, the Libyan coast guard is supported and empowered by EU states to intercept people at sea and send them back to the very conditions they were seeking to escape.<br/><br/>I would like to share another testimony that our colleague from Ireland heard on the <i>Aquarius</i>:</p><blockquote>When the Libyans caught me in the sea they took me to a place, a deportation camp.  When they took me there was no deporting.  There were so many things happening there.  In the middle of the night they would wake up some ladies to sleep with them.  Some of the women got pregnant in that situation.  They would inject them to take away the pregnancy because the guards didn&rsquo;t want the baby in that place.  They would beat the women and inject them to take away the baby.  One pregnant woman lost her life.  They covered her with black lino.  She had no good treatment, no hot water to clean her womb.  Her baby was bleeding and the baby died.  I stayed there for six months.</blockquote> <p>A rescue should conclude with a disembarkation of rescued people in a place of safety.</p><p>The Libyan coastguard intercepts people at the behest of European Union member states and forcibly returns them to land.  People will end up back in these situations if they are brought back to Libya.  This is a policy supported by European Governments.<br/><br/>The presence at sea of NGOs doing search and rescue is being questioned.  We are seen as being up to no good.  The reality is that at present, no NGO is doing search and rescue at sea.  The four remaining NGOs are either banned and not allowed to operate or face criminal prosecution.  Today the <i>Lifeline</i>team is in front of a court in Malta for refusing to hand over to the Libyan coastguard the people it rescued.  They are refusing because they believe that torture is wrong and because international law bans torture and <i>refoulement</i>to places of torture.  However, they are the ones in court.<br/><br/>People are taken back to extreme levels of abuse in Libya.  The kidnapping of migrants and refugees, holding them captive and using torture to obtain ransom is common.  In one area, Bani Walid, where places of captivity are operated by traffickers, we donate 50 body bags a week, such as the mortality rate of the people held there.  No one fleeing Libya should be intercepted at sea by the Libyan coastguard and forcibly returned.  Libya is not a safe place and we all know this, so when the European Council states we should upgrade or step up our support to the Libyan coastguard, we need to be fully aware of what it means in concrete terms.  People are intercepted in reckless operations by the Libyan coastguard and taken to these places of detention.<br/><br/>The European response to addressing the high number of drownings in the Mediterranean Sea is to seal off the coast of Libya and contain refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in a country where they are exposed to extreme and widespread violence and exploitation.  Even if Irish and other European navies are not directly transferring rescued people to the Libyan coastguard, greater numbers of people are being forcibly returned to Libya as a result of European policies with the help of European money.  The fingerprints of European states are everywhere.<br/><br/>For almost a year, the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre has been putting our rescue ships on standby as the Libyan coastguard is directed to the scene to intercept those fleeing the country.  The standby can last for up to several hours.  This further endangers vulnerable people.  Saving lives is not a crime.  Destroying search and rescue capacity will lead to more unnecessary deaths at sea and further entrap people.  I want to share the latest figures from this morning.  Since 8 June, when most of the NGOs were squeezed out of the Mediterranean, more than 500 people have drowned or gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea between Libya and Italy, with the total for the year being 1,000.  We are reaching a rate that one in ten people who try to cross the sea might drown or go missing.  It used to be one in 60 people.  We have been told the NGOs are a pull factor and that they are not doing good.  NGOs are not present at sea today and people are dying in numbers we have never seen before.</p></speech>

Her contribution and that of Mr. Taylor depict a very frightening and depressing picture of what is happening to people.  We have heard outlines from the colleagues of the witnesses and from other NGOs about the terrible situation in so many crises throughout the world in recent years but I have never previously heard the phrase used by Mr. Taylor.  He stated, "We appear before the committee today following what was the deadliest seven-day period so far this year, during which at least 200 people lost their lives".  To say the least, it is a desperate situation.  Obviously it is getting worse and policies are not having the desired effect we all want to see.  I compliment the witnesses on the great passion in their contributions, reflecting the views of their organisation and their colleagues who are out there trying to assist people in the most difficult of circumstances.</p></speech>

It is extremely difficult and harrowing.  I have met doctors and nurses, most recently Aoife who was on the <i>MS Aquarius</i>.  Words fail me with regard to comprehending how they keep going in such difficult circumstances.  It is opportune that the witnesses are here today because yesterday we had post-European Council statements in the D&aacute;il.  One point I made was the word used about the EU approach is &quot;comprehensive&quot;.  We do not hear the word &quot;caring&quot; and we are dealing with extremely vulnerable people.  The other very disturbing point is that while I acknowledge the EU is a major donor for development aid, we also know there will be increases in the European defence budget.  There have to be alarm bells as to where all the money will come from and whether one budget will compete with the other.  We know from what we hear which budget will be most at risk in that scenario.  It is also disturbing when we see the words &quot;migration&quot; and &quot;security&quot; together.  Part of me can understand the political situation in some European countries and the way in which they are trying to find a compromise to prevent the increase in far-right politics but we possibly are going too far bending over to them.</p><p>I acknowledge the work of the Naval Service and I hope its fine work in the Mediterranean is never compromised.  Smugglers are making money through their disregard for human life.  Are any of them being brought to justice?  Where are the guards in the detention centres from?  Are they Libyan nationals?  Are they forced into being guards?  What is the situation?  I presume it is somewhat lucrative for them.  Perhaps they are also coming out of very difficult situations.</p><p>We know that EU states say one of the ways to deal with migration is to tackle the root causes.  I keep asking where do we see this actually happening.  Where are they getting to those root causes with regard to conflict, famine, poverty and the abuse of human rights that cause people to take all of these risks?  What would the witnesses have wanted to have heard from the European Council meeting?  I know we are here to talk about Libya but I ask the witnesses to refer to Yemen because we do not hear very much about the humanitarian crisis there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018070500002#D00400"><p>I will speak about the situation in Libya, which I have experienced for many years.  We need to contextualise what is happening there to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  There is a breakdown in law and order.  There are weak institutions, if there are any, and they are not necessarily in control.  There are a lot of armed groups, militias and criminal gangs and a lot of the migrants, refugees and asylum seekers fall prey to these groups.  The detention centres are formally under control of the Ministry of the interior, more specifically the department for combatting illegal migration.  The guards are Libyan and only men, and it is a huge issue that we have vulnerable women and girls being detained by men.  However, much of the work is also done by other detainees, depending on whether they speak Arabic.</p><p>The conditions in the detention centres are inhumane compared to recommended international standards.  People are held arbitrarily for long periods.  When one visits these detention centres, those held there describe the anguish of not knowing what is going to happen to them, not knowing why they have been captured or why they have been jailed, not knowing how they can get out or if they can get out.</p><p> There is also a lucrative business around this.  The best way to get out is to try to bribe one's way out or work one's way out.  When one has been considered to have contributed enough or generated enough income, one can be released.  For some women, it could be that they are forced into prostitution.  In addition to the thousands held in detention centres, there are tens of thousands of people held in the hands of traffickers and smugglers.  These traffickers are reckless and ruthless.  They are now seeing that reaching Europe is increasingly difficult.  Accordingly, the best way to make money is to extort the people.  They hold them for longer periods, torturing them and trying to get as much money as possible from their families and their diasporas abroad.</p><p> MSF tries to support survivors of trafficking.  They present with multiple fractures and torture burns.  They are released because the traffickers know they can make no more money from them anymore.  To be accused as a NGO to be colluding with traffickers is extremely hurtful.  We are dealing with the consequences of the treatment of these people by the traffickers.  We are also dealing with young Nigerian girls who we fear are being trafficked for prostitution in Europe.  What we try to do is flag their cases to the authorities and to the UN agencies.  We try to provide awareness on the boat.  We have a system where every woman and girl will have an individual consultation with a nurse or a midwife in order to be able to speak.  We have signs everywhere on the boat that there is a risk of trafficking and there can be a way out.  To be accused of colluding with traffickers is hurtful.  It is certainly incorrect.</p><p> Facts seem to no longer matter in the US but also in Europe.  This is why we welcome this opportunity to present to the committee so much.  We must have policies based on facts.</p></speech>

We have had discussions about this in the past.  Unfortunately, what we hear is the continued outsourcing of EU borders, whether that is the EU-Turkey deal or similar proposals, which look to further push the borders of Europe out of sight and out of mind.  This is not out of MSF's sight or mind.  We would hope for a political solution which is humane, however naive that may sound.</p></speech>

I also heard them earlier on "Morning Ireland".  It is a significant issue and we have all seen the horrendous pictures and newsreels of what has happened with migration over the years in the Mediterranean.  However, there are major challenges coming in Europe.  There is a new Government in Italy against migration.  Recently in Germany, the issue nearly brought down Angela Merkel and Britain is leaving the EU.  There is going to be a significant clampdown in Europe on taking in immigrants.  With the population of Africa to double in the next 20 years, this is going to get worse.  It will come to a stage where Europe will say it can take no more.  What do we do?</p> <p>  This committee has been in Africa and has met the most beautiful people one could ever meet.  The traffickers charge an exorbitant fee to bring people across the Mediterranean.  When we go to Malawi and Mozambique, we see how much can be done for a family with the &euro;6 in the cash transfer scheme.  Where do these migrants get the money to pay these exorbitant costs to the traffickers?  These are people not just from Libya but from all over Africa.  Can the EU do more within Africa to keep people there?  Something will have to be done because there will be a clampdown.  Unless we dealing with the problem at source, there will be larger issues in a few years from now.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the tremendous work MSF does.</p></speech>

That is one of the difficulties because there is no way out for these people.  The minute they embark on the journey, they already owe a lot of money.  The only way for them to pay back that money is to make it to Europe to work and to reimburse the traffickers.<br/><br/>Some of them are also misled.  They are told they do not have to pay anything.  Those are mainly the victims of traffickers.  Most of the Nigerian girls I have interviewed will say they have not paid anything but have been promised jobs.  Once they arrive in Europe, they are given the bill that they need to pay.  Then it becomes forced labour or sexual exploitation.<br/><br/>For some refugees, such as those from Eritrea or Somalia, they have diasporas abroad.  These people are fleeing conflicts and persecution and rely much on their diaspora.  For that very reason, traffickers know there is money to be made.  They are the ones who are the most abused.<br/><br/>Arrivals of migrants to Italy have dropped by 80% this year, yet the political crisis has never been as big as this year.  It is not based on facts but fearmongering.  Up to 80% fewer people are reaching Italian shores.<br/><br/>We also need to agree that we want to maintain an asylum system which works and protects people from persecution and conflict.  On the <i>Aquarius</i>when we were stranded at sea for several days with no port to disembark at, we had people from Darfur, South Sudan and Eritrea.  We need to agree that these people need our protection.  They would not need to come to Libya to get the protection.  They could get that protection in refugee camps in Sudan and Ethiopia, if there were proper refugee camps there with real opportunities and possibilities for them to make a living.  However, we are forcing these people, with the lack of any opportunity or hope, to undertake a dangerous journey to Europe.<br/><br/>Looking at the complex issue of migration, we need to have long-term policies.  We do not address inequalities, lack of development or the lack of rule of law in a week, a month or a year.  However, our politicians and policies are all based on the next electoral deadline.  There are very quick fixes with fearmongering which will get a politician votes rather than well thought through policies.  This is all we ask for.  Of course states have a right to regulate entry and stay.  They also have international obligations.  In Europe we have values.  We believe life is important, that we need to preserve it and that people should not die at sea.  We must have these discussions, but they must be based on proper information.</p></speech>

We have heard it before.  We have supported M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res's actions.  I wish Mr. Taylor well.<br/><br/>Hopefully, NGOs will be allowed to be back at sea to rescue people.  That is the genuine feeling of most Irish people.  Whether they agree or disagree with the European Union, there was a presumption before Ireland signed up to Operation Sophia that we were involved in a humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean.  I have become increasingly concerned, on questioning the Minister of State at the Department of Defence and even with some of the briefings, that the concentration has shifted totally from an Irish point of view to other actions under Operation Sophia and that, as we warned, it is neither a search and rescue mission nor a humanitarian mission any more.  If so, what is it other than the security of Europe?<br/><br/>Only yesterday, I received answers back from the Minister of State in respect of future funding on defence in Europe where he outlined an extra &euro;13 billion to be spent between now and 2027 on the European Defence Fund.  In the middle of it, there was an extra &euro;6.5 billion on transport to make the roads and transport networks in the European Union better for military transport or mobility.  This is in contrast with what we spend on what MSF referred to - refugee camps in areas of conflict that can protect people and then try to rebuild their lives in their own countries.  From having spoken to a number of refugees over the years who managed to come as far as Ireland and make good here, I know they never wanted to be in Ireland.  They did not know half of the time whether they were coming here.  They still do not like the weather, even if it is gorgeous at present.  They would prefer to be at home in their own community.<br/><br/>What is it that makes people take this arduous journey?  I presume at this stage word is filtering back of the dangers that are faced and that those taken at sea will be sent back to torture camps in Tripoli.  Is Tripoli or any other port regarded by the NGOs as a safe port in any way?  We have had testimony previously about what is ongoing in some of those camps.  Is there much information other than that from the refugees one meets coming from Libya?  What are we hearing back?  Mr. Taylor gave a number of examples and what is going on is quite obscene.  Ireland or the European Union can be seen to be facilitating that by returning refugees to those dangers.<br/><br/>I read in <i>The Guardian</i>the figures on the number of people who have lost their lives recently and Mr. Taylor repeated them.  Does Mr. Taylor believe the absence of NGO ships at sea contributes to the increased deaths?  Mr. Taylor stated the death toll has gone up substantially in recent times.  Is it that refugees are taking a more arduous journey or are at sea longer?  Are the boats in which they set out in worse condition?  If the NGO ships that were there previously were at sea, would they have the capacity to help in any way beyond what they have done previously?<br/><br/>Finally, given what happened in recent weeks, if NGOs get to take to sea again and if the Italians and the European Union continue their policy, I presume it would be much more costly, or probably more dangerous for MSF ships to have to go to other ports in Europe if they are sitting in the middle of the Mediterranean on low supplies trying to figure out where the hell they will go with these refugees to give them some type of comfort and humanity and to avoid facing the torture they fear they would face, were they to get caught and brought back to the Libyan coastguard.</p></speech>

This has been said and repeated by a number of UN bodies.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights has expressed his concerns about people being returned to Libya.  We do not even want to open that discussion.  The guidance from the UNHCR is extremely clear.  One who would suggest that Libya is a safe place for migrant refugees and asylum seekers is either not reading the news or completely delusional.<br/><br/>I will give some more figures.  The situation at sea is changing.  NGOs currently are not present.  There are other factors and it is difficult to attribute the cause of the increasing mortality rate to the presence or the lack of presence of NGOs.  However, we have all been pushed out.  This has been a campaign of more than a year that started with snide comments in the media about us colluding with traffickers, and then prosecutors in Italy announcing in the media that they were investigating us.  It got to a point where MSF approached the various prosecutors mentioned in the media to tell them we were available to talk and to ask whether they had any questions but that is not the way to conduct an investigation.<br/><br/>Then there was the code of conduct that the Italians tried to push last year.  After that, a few NGOs stopped being at sea.  We had also a lot of judicial proceedings against different NGOs and boats being seized.  There were four remaining.  Today, none of us is there and we see an increase in the mortality rate.<br/><br/>We also see that the Libyan coastguard has intercepted at sea and returned to Libya 10,000 people this year.  That may explain also the drop in 80% of arrivals to Italy.  These people end up in the detention centres where we intervene and we see them.  They end up with that cycle of abuse.<br/><br/>The UN, which is present in Libya, has a very limited capacity.  Libya is not a state with strong institutions.  The UNHCR is not necessarily welcome and the few evacuations that were mentioned that we were able to secure to Niger are a drop in the ocean.  Those have been done after much negotiations.<br/><br/>The cost for NGOs, and certainly for MSF, is not about not being able to disembark in Italy and having to go to Valencia.  It is about the fact that those are days when we will not be at sea conducting search and rescue.  We can take the financial cost.  This is not the issue.  There is also the cost for the people who have been rescued.  When the <i>MS Aquarius</i>was stranded in the Mediterranean, we had people who had hardly escaped drowning at sea who had pulmonary problems and they were waiting on that boat not knowing whether they would be able to disembark.  The weather conditions were really bad and a lady was trying to breast-feed her baby while throwing up.  This is what not allowing us to disembark meant.  For the people who have just been rescued, they should be able to disembark in the nearest safe port.  This, until now, has been Italy.  It is not only Italy's responsibility.  We are not dogmatic about it.  What we want to see is a place where the rights of people are upheld.  We are not going to disembark people in a place where asylum seekers will not be able to seek asylum and where there will be no guarantees they will not be sent back to their country of origin.</p><p>This is the yardstick we apply.</p><p> I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018070500002#G00300"><p>I thank the witnesses both for their powerful testimony and their ongoing work.  The information they have provided is stark.  What is also stark is that we were warned about these things and they have been signalled for a long time.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, they were signalled when Ireland decided to change its approach.  We ask whether ships with these goals make a difference.  We have previous evidence in this regard.  During the period of a number of years in which Ireland operated on its own and in accordance with the Pontus deal with Italy, which focused on humanitarian search and rescue, just one Irish ship was in operation and Ireland saved 17,500 lives in the Mediterranean, and I think people were so proud of that.  In the same number of years, the subsequent incarnation of Operation Pontus, Operation Sophia, which had - the witnesses may correct me if I am wrong - on average five or six ships, sometimes more and sometimes slightly less, rescued 34,000.  That is five times the number of ships and only twice as many people rescued because the priority of the operation was not humanitarian search and rescue.  The ships are in the same waters and their crew sees the same things.  There are concerns about a shift.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, was very clear when Ireland joined Operation Sophia.  He said in July last year, exactly one year ago, "Transferring to Operation Sophia will result in the redeployment of Irish Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue operations to primarily security and interception operations."  That is a quote from the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.  It is a very clear statement, and that is the decision that was made and which left a space into which NGOs moved.  We have moved from a situation whereby our newspapers in Ireland celebrate and show the search and rescue operations and what our Naval Service has done - and I share the pride in our Naval Service that everyone has expressed - to one whereby we have flipped to concerns, worries and insinuations about operations in respect of which NGOs are perhaps taking the place of the Naval Service.  We need to be very clear: this is bad for Europe because when we start militarising our borders in this way, we see the ripple effects in the militarisation of borders within Europe because that is the next step, and it is bad for our humanitarian reputation.  The idea of the pull factor is really concerning because it is very similar to what we have seen with the Mexican-American border.  The US Administration is not pulling certain families apart and taking children away and interning them because it is concerned about those families; it wants to send an example and a signal.  The idea that we would let people drown as an example or signal to others is the same kind of message and it is not the way to tackle the traffickers.  We have heard about the root causes.  The root causes are not boats.</p> <p>  I will be brief in asking my questions.  A family reunification Bill introduced by my group is before the Houses at present.  Regarding the question of tackling trafficking, do the witnesses agree that the financial model and the financial incentives is where this can be tackled by providing safe passage and alternative legal routes for those whose loved ones are living here in Europe to reach them?  This is one reason people take desperate journeys.  Are any of those routes operating out of Libya?  Are people interned in Libya being permitted to make claims or seek reunification or granted access to any of these measures of safe passage?  This is a key question.  Do the witnesses have concerns about EU money financially incentivising the warehousing of people?  Is there a concern that the money may be provided on a per-head basis and that there may be a drive to bring people into Libya and then store them in these detention centres in order that payments be made per head?  We know from private prisons in the US and even from direct provision here that any incentivising of the warehousing of people creates a perverse incentive.  The witnesses might touch on similar migration control agreements that Europe has signed with Sudan.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have concerns about tied aid?  Ireland has had a very strong tradition of untied aid, but increasingly there seems to be a blurring of the line between EU defence spending and what we are told we are investing.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh commented very eloquently on what we put in as actual support as opposed to support to governments.  Again, Sudan comes into this concern.</p> <p>  I also have a very quick question about the UN concerns.  What other pressures can Ireland, as a country which is bidding for a Security Council seat at present, bring to bear to show we are very serious about these UN laws?  We mentioned our mass migration in our bid just last week, which is somewhat ironic, given that we have not hit our target of 4,000 refugees and that we have sent 200,000 people abroad ourselves in the past decade.</p> <p>  I know these are more statements than anything else, but I ask the witnesses to touch on the financial model, the perverse incentives, the real shift in policy and what it means on the ground for search and rescue and so on, the witnesses' concerns about the militarisation of borders, and perhaps Sudan.</p></speech>

They are so to the point and really hit where it hurts.</p> <p>  I will be very honest about the money.

Some of this money is then assigned to Italy, Italy uses it, and this is where we lose track.  It is very easy to say the EU as such - the Commission, for example - does not finance detention centres.  However, there is also this organised system or lack of transparency in order to support that.  For example, the Italian Minister of the Interior, Mr. Salvini, has just announced that ten or 12 more assets will be provided to the Libyan coastguard.  Where is the money coming from?  We ask these questions; we do not get answers.  Perhaps as Members of Parliament, the members will get the answers.  As a European citizen, I also want to ensure that my taxes do not fuel human rights violations.<br/><br/>The discourse of some politicians is very much to focus on the pull factor, never to mention the push factors or the complexity of the situation, including the lack of safe and legal routes.  Of Eritreans who make it to Europe, 90% will get asylum there, yet not a single resettlement of an Eritrean to Kenya, Ethiopia or Sudan has taken place.  Family reunification is extremely difficult.  The seriousness of the violations in Libya and the CNN video created some sense of urgency, and then the UNHCR was able to secure a deal with Niger to evacuate to Niger the most vulnerable people.  That was the promise, that these people would be resettled in Europe.  How many have been resettled?  The centre opened in November.  About 200 people have been resettled.  Niger had to suspend the programme because it saw the most vulnerable ones arriving, the unaccompanied minors, the women and the children from Eritrea and Somalia, and they would not be resettled.  When we say &quot;comprehensive&quot;, we are actually only looking to pass the buck to someone else and to ensure that it becomes someone else's problem while promising we will help, yet we never help.  We have the example of the EU-Turkey deal.  How many people have been resettled from Turkey?  How many people are currently stuck in Greece?  My impression from working on these issues is that there is an extremely perverse discourse that is all about bypassing the law.  For example, Italy has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for breaching the prohibition of torture and the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>for its co-operation with the Libyan coastguard.<br/><br/>What do we do now?</p><p>We now train and equip the Libyan coastguard to set up a search and rescue region.  We get it to do the dirty business for us and to say it is not us.  However, our marks all over this.  We cannot simply say we are doing this in the name of saving lives.  We hear all of the time that we are supporting the Libyan coastguard because it is saving lives.  Of course, no one wants anyone to drown at sea but saving lives means disembarking them in a place of safety, not taking them to detention centres where they might end up in the same cycle of abuse.</p><p> On Sudan, I work for MSF Amsterdam.  We do not have an operation in Sudan but other centres do.  I will speak from a non-specialist point of view.  The EU is supporting the rapid intervention force formerly known as the Janjaweed, which says it all.</p></speech>

Ireland, as we all know, punches above its weight at EU and international level.

This is a welcome development.  There also have been attempts to prosecute in Italy but these were not necessarily successful.  We also had an arrest warrant issued in Libya.  It is difficult to understand smuggling.  First, I would like to distinguish between smuggling and trafficking.  Traffickers are committing crimes against people.  They are torturing and abusing them.  Of course, we want them to be held responsible, but as a humanitarian organisation what we really want is for the survivors of trafficking to be cared for.  We want them to be granted protection and to have access to the medical care they need, but this is not happening.</p> <p>  The EU is trumpeting the fight against trafficking.  Recently, a group of approximately 130 people in Bani Walid escaped from the hands of traffickers during Ramadan.  The went to a mosque and the community in Bani Walid protected them.  The response of the authorities was to send the survivors to detention centres in Tripoli.  This shows how humanitarian messages are being corrupted.  States are paying lip service to saving lives and to humanitarian assistance.  This is very problematic.  Also, NGOs are being corrupted in trying to humanise detention centres so that it becomes more palatable for us to accept that people are sent to detention centres.  NGOs should intervene based on the needs of people and not on the political will of a country, but this is what is happening, unfortunately.</p> <p>  I am unable to respond to the question on Yemen.</p></speech>

We are told that through the work of Operation Sofia, boats were removed from the criminal organisations involved in smuggling and trafficking people.  Do the witnesses accept as a positive element of the work of Operation Sofia the removal of vessels from criminals who were in the process of smuggling and trafficking people?</p></speech>

I would not want to reach any conclusion in this regard.  Unlike Operation Sophia, MSF was keen to reach a conclusion about the negative role of NGOs.  We all participate in destroying these boats.  If we do a rescue, we try to destroy the boat.  Once the people have been rescued, we destroy the boat because we do not want the smugglers or traffickers to use it again and further endanger the lives of people.  We also play a role in this.  The question regarding the work of Operation Sofia might best be answered by Operation Sofia.  From where we sit, at sea we do not see that necessarily.  What we see are people who, if unable to flee Libya on these dinghies that are not seaworthy, will be trapped in abuse in Libya.  This cannot be only about fighting smugglers and traffickers.  It must also be about evacuating people from Libya.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  This is the third time we have invited M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, to appear before the committee.  In previous discussions with Mr. Taylor we indicated our appreciation for people who are working in very difficult circumstances, in particular the Irish doctors and nurses who are working in the Mediterranean who have come here to outline their experiences to us.  I represent the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I know people, including friends, who are medics and nurses and other support staff working in those very difficult circumstances.  Migration is once again a topical issue in terms of the many different crises throughout the world.  I was anxious, with the support of the committee, to invite MSF to make a presentation to us today.  We are glad that the witnesses took the opportunity to do so.  As a committee, we do not have an executive role.  All we can do is try to get a message across to the Government and create an awareness among the public in regard to the need to support organisations such as MSF and the good effect to which they put Irish Aid money.</p> <p>  A year and a half ago we would probably have been speaking at committees like this about 65 million people being displaced, which was the UN figure at that time.  Today, the witnesses quoted the figure of 68.5 million people displaced, 85% of them in developing countries, which shows the huge pressure on the least advantaged countries.  The point made by Ms Hadj Sahraoui that facts no longer matter in the US or in Europe has to be a huge concern for all of us who value truth and democracy.  There is a coarsening, unfortunately, of public debate, not just about crises but about general politics on a day-to-day basis as well, and this is unfortunate for society.</p> <p>  I thank MSF and the other NGOs and our Naval Service for the Trojan work they do in very difficult circumstances.  As a committee, we continually afford this forum as a place where people can come and outline to us the issues that they see every day in the places most affected.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and wish them and their colleagues the best while working in extremely difficult circumstances. </p><p> Our policy adviser for the past year and a half, Ms Marylee Wall, has been promoted and is going back to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade unfortunately.  I record our appreciation for her help, advice and assistance to us a committee.  She did exceptionally good work with the committee and her work on our Irish Aid report was extremely beneficial to us and to the sector.  We will have an informal meeting next week and the members will be notified of the informal meetings that we have for the rest of this month.  The meeting now stands adjourned.  </p></speech>

Joining me is Mr. Gavin Kelly, CEO of our retail Ireland division, and Mr. John O'Beirne, head of products.  In my opening remarks, I will focus on three key areas; the external environment in which we operate, the transformation under way within Bank of Ireland and how we are responding to a number of key issues facing our sector and our customers.</p> <p>  First, I will outline the external environment in which we operate.  As members know, the Irish economy is expanding.  Gross domestic product, GDP, growth has been well above the euro area average since 2011.  This strong performance is translating into job gains with falling unemployment.  More than 2 million people are now at work in Ireland, with figures out this week putting unemployment at just over 5%.  This is down from a peak of almost 16% just a few years ago.  Looking ahead, Ireland is going to see significant change.</p> <p>  The national development plan, Project Ireland 2040, sees a population growing by more than 1 million people, up 50% in cities beyond Dublin, with a one third increase in job creation and a need for half a million new homes.  Bank of Ireland is strongly supporting this growth.  We are the largest lender to the Irish economy, a position held for each of the past four years.  In 2017 we provided &euro;7.1 billion in lending to personal, business and corporate customers across Ireland.  This includes providing more than 50% of all new lending to Irish businesses, including the agricultural sector, and supporting two out of every three companies engaged in Foreign Direct Investment, FDI, in Ireland.</p> <p>  Banks ultimately exist to support their customers.  Therefore, wherever possible, we work to enable our customers to overcome the challenges they face.  In Ireland today, one of the most pressing of these challenges is access to housing.  We are currently funding the construction of almost 3,000 residential units and 1,700 student accommodation beds in Ireland, and are supporting development on 160 sites across the country.  Last year, we enabled approximately 8,000 people to buy a home in Ireland.</p> <p>  In the years ahead, we want to do more to support house building and home buying and business and corporate lending.  We recently announced our new strategy.  This reflects both the expanding Irish economy today, and the considerable demographic changes forecast over the coming years.  This strategy will see us playing an even more active role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic development &ndash; growing our loan book by about 20% over the coming four years, with approximately &euro;9 billion lending growth focused primarily on mortgages, business lending and support for construction and development in Ireland.  To help us do this, we have started a significant transformation programme within the Bank.  There are three parts in this programme; culture, technology and our business model.</p> <p>  I will first address culture.  A healthy internal culture in any organisation is vital.  However, it is the external proof of this culture that gets the most attention.  Put simply, a good culture creates great customer outcomes.  As part of our culture review work over the last six months we have launched a new purpose statement and set of behavioural values.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s purpose is to enable our customers, colleagues and communities to thrive.  Our values are to be customer focused, accountable and agile, and to work as one team.  To embed our purpose and values within the company, we recently held 50 events for 6,000 colleagues across the Bank in Ireland and in the UK.  We are also reducing the number of layers between head office and our front line.  This will ensure our senior managers are closer to our customers.  That will be positive in a number of ways.  A simpler organisation will empower our people, speed up decision making, and make the bank more responsive to customer needs.</p> <p>  Our technology is the second part in our transformation programme.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s systems must be modernised.  This is why we are undertaking a once-in-a-generation investment in our technology.  We are replacing myriad legacy systems with simpler, state-of-the-art technology designed for how customers bank today and into the future.  While core technology is a big part of this, we are also making improvements in our digital channels, services and security.</p> <p>  The third part of our transformation programme is our business model, that is, how we are structured and how we serve our customers.  I want to ensure that digital service is combined with a physical presence and personal touch.  This is particularly true for Bank of Ireland.  We are committed to maintaining our extensive branch network, which currently operates in 265 locations in communities across Ireland, the largest reach of any bank.</p> <p>  I have listened carefully to feedback from our customers since taking up my role as CEO.  It is clear that we need to improve the service we provide.  Among a number of initiatives, we are now increasing our full-service branches by more than 160%, from 61 to 164.  These branches will have a counter service during the full day, not just morning hours.  We are increasing the number of employees in our branches and contact centres &ndash; again, this is in response to customer feedback on the need for more accessible support for day-to-day banking.  We are also going to continue to use our branch network to support small businesses across Ireland.  Some of our branches in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway offer spaces where startups can work for free.  What we call our Startlabs and FDI hubs, in Dublin, Galway and now New York help companies at the next stage of their development &ndash; growing and expanding into new markets.  We are proud that our branch network is connecting, supporting and enabling the communities we work and live in to thrive.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues facing our sector and our customers which we are also addressing, including Brexit, regulatory capital requirements and the tracker mortgage examination.</p><p> On Brexit, having worked in nine countries in different parts of the world, I understand the value of being outward looking.  It is something that has served Ireland very welll from an economic, social and cultural perspective.  Nonetheless, Brexit is a reality for which we must prepare.  We have been working with our customers to provide as much support as possible as they plan for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.  We have held 26 "prepare for Brexit" events across Ireland.  They are aimed at the small and medium enterprise, SME, community, with partners that include Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce.  Additionally, the bank is a strong supporter of and participant in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, Brexit loan scheme.  We have held a number of events to inform SMEs of the scheme, its features and how to apply.</p><p> With regard to the regulatory capital requirements, banks in Ireland continue to be impacted on by the financial crisis.  We see this in both non-performing exposures, NPEs, and the regulatory capital requirements banks must observe.  At Bank of Ireland, we remain highly focused on reducing our NPEs.  We have made significant progress in that regard, reducing our stock of impaired loans by almost 75% in the past few years.  We have the lowest level of NPEs as a percentage of customer loans of any bank in Ireland.  According to Central Bank statistics, Bank of Ireland is three to four times better in terms of Irish mortgages than the industry average.  Our approach is to work with our customers to put in place sustainable solutions.  We make every effort to support those who want to pay their mortgage and legal action is an absolute last resort.</p><p> There is a clear requirement from the regulatory authorities for all European banks to reduce NPEs further and to do so more quickly.  The strategy we presented recently to the market does not assume any change in our proven approach to reducing NPEs.  Given evolving regulatory requirements, especially as they relate to NPEs, we keep our approach to the resolution of non-performing loans under review.  This is to ensure it remains appropriate in order that we can continue to make real progress in reducing our NPEs, while ensuring we retain the capital needed to deliver our strategy.  That strategy is to support loan growth in Ireland, invest in the transformation of our business and deliver returns to our shareholders.</p><p> I would like to give an update on the Central Bank of Ireland tracker mortgage examination.  The tracker mortgage issue became a key focus of mine shortly after I took up my position as CEO last October.  I unreservedly apologised to all impacted on customers for the financial loss and anxiety this issue caused them and their families and do so again today.  I set out to make sure we would deal with customers fairly and as quickly as possible.  In recent months we have placed a major focus on our redress and compensation process.  Today, approximately 99% of all affected customers have received an offer of redress and compensation.  Affected customers have been offered redress and compensation of over &euro;137 million, of which approximately 90% or more than &euro;123 million has been paid so far.  For the remaining offers, as soon as offer forms are returned to us, payment will be made swiftly.  Approximately 1% of customers impacted on have yet to be offered redress and compensation.  This equals about 80 accounts, with a redress and compensation amount of &euro;1.1 million, or an average of around &euro;14,000 per account.  They are mostly cases in which a customer&rsquo;s address has changed, including when a customer has moved abroad.  There are also some cases in which the customer is deceased, with no contact information on record for their representative or solicitor.  The bank is actively attempting to trace all customers or their estates in order that we can makes offers in each outstanding case.</p><p> I have provided some context regarding the economy and the economic, demographic and housing demand we will see in Ireland in the coming period.  I have highlighted some of the issues our sector and customers face and how we are responding to them.  I have outlined the transformation under way at Bank of Ireland, including in our culture, technology and business model.  I thank the committee for giving us its time and look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

There was a time when Bank of Ireland had full service which was cut back such that customers were only able to make certain transactions on certain days and so on.  Is this a reversal of that policy?</p></speech>

I have listened to feedback.  Since being here I have spent time on the front line listening to feedback from customers and our colleagues.  I have listened to many calls with the team in our contact centres.  I have read complaints and about concerns our customers and stakeholders may have and I am always looking for ways to improve the service we offer and support the growth of Bank of Ireland's customer satisfaction levels and business.  We saw an opportunity in some branches that did not offer a full service and in which one might have had access to the counter only in the morning and there was demand for it in the afternoon.  We have expanded that service in response to customer feedback.  We work in a dynamic environment and customers' behaviour changes, but people still want value and some of the full service elements.  Hence we have increased the number of branches from 61 to 164, an increase of 160% , which is good evidence of our commitment to deliver a better service.</p></speech>

Every branch has people in it to serve our customers.  Some branches are self-service and offer advice only.  Some provide a full service.  We are getting a better balance between what is and is not a full service and increasing the number on the front line.  As well as increasing the number of branches that offer a full service, we have also increased the number of people on the front line by over 100.  That is a very tangible example of the commitment we have made to improving customer service on the front line and responding to feedback from our customers.</p><p>We would never want to turn a customer away when they need our help.</p></speech>

That is absolutely wrong so I welcome that, I hope other banks will take the lead from that and I hope Bank of Ireland will continue to go down that route so that people are not marginalised and socially and economically excluded.  I am tired of banks coming in here telling us that they are just responding to the tastes of people and that people want to do everything online when they often do not have the computer skills or broadband to do so.  I was really glad to see that in Bank of Ireland's presentation and I urge them to continue that.</p></speech>

There are occasions where we have had outages.  Some of those have been an internal issue that we faced at Bank of Ireland, some have been related to external factors that have impacted all banks - whether it is in a particular country or in Europe.  We have had an issue where we had an outage through Visa and we were not the only bank impacted.  We could also ask Mr. Kelly to speak in more detail about some of the challenges we have had more recently.  We have had very short periods of outage that have impacted on our customers and he can speak to what we have done about them.</p></speech>

One of them related to Visa and it was a sector-wide issue that happened in Europe.  Another one was that for one hour and 45 minutes in February we had a bank connectivity issue for certain ATMs.  Connectivity was re-established within 50 minutes.  The others were intermittent impacts from a Mastercard technical issue which impacted all credit cards, not just ours.  This is not related to the changes and improvements we are making in our transformation.  It was not as a result of some migration or change that we did.  We are very mindful that as we transform our IT system, we need to ensure we do not create any disruption to our customers, but also this underlines the importance of constantly investing in upgrading our technology.  A 99.7% success rate is good but I would rather if it was 100%.</p></speech>

I will start by asking for the witnesses' perspectives on the housing market and what Bank of Ireland's expectations and forecasts are on housing because it has quite a good overview of the market, is dealing with builders and developers on the supply side and dealing with home buyers.  We have seen significant house price growth in recent times, so what is Bank of Ireland's assessment of where the property market is going on the residential side?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1583" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Francesca McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#F02100"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Two and a half weeks ago I presented our strategy from now until 2021 to the market.  Within that we were very specific about our ambition to support our customers - personal, corporate and small business customers - to be successful.  A big part of doing that is by being the leading supporter of house building and home buying in Ireland.  We see that as a need for both the customers and companies that we want to support.  One of the issues that is facing many of our customers, and no doubt many of the Deputies constituents, is rising house prices.  We see that as driven mainly by a mismatch between supply and demand.  Ireland is growing in demographics and in GDP and average household sizes in Ireland are relatively large when compared to the European average because people want to move out and get their own home and renting or purchasing it can be prohibitively expensive.  For us, the solution to that is to support companies to construct properties and homes that are appropriate for Irish home buyers or tenants.  We see an opportunity to support that need.  </p> <p>  Last year we provided 8,000 mortgages to customers wanting to buy a new home or move home.  We provided corporate clients with support to build 3,000 homes in Ireland; I mentioned in my opening statement that we also supported 1,700 student beds, which is a challenge, and we are helping 160 construction sites to get built.  There is still a gap.  We expect that there would be around 40,000 residential units needed per annum to meet demand and last year I believe 15,000 were built.  That is still driving an increase in property prices.  For us, our role, as the largest lender in Ireland, is to support the companies to build the properties and for the people to move into them with mortgages that are attractive.</p></speech>

Supply is increasing but the demand is very strong so does that provide for continuing house price growth for the foreseeable future until supply comes somewhere close to meeting demand?</p></speech>

We see the supply-demand mismatch continuing but the gap narrowing over the medium term.</p></speech>

There seems to be a step up in house building but it is a challenge to get to the 40,000 units which are needed.  There will be constraints, such as with the availability of skilled labour, which will affect the process.  On the demand side, the housing market is starting to normalise and we are getting back up to 3% liquidity.  It used to be 2% but it is now 2.8% and that is what people deem to be normal.  There were 54,000 home purchases and 15,000 home constructions and there has been good progress in simplifying some of the regulations, in particular some of the obligations around house building.</p></speech>

In the table of rates provided, the lowest rate offered by Bank of Ireland is 3%, fixed across a number of loan-to-value bands for between one and five years.  In the past few days, Ulster Bank has announced a new, two-year fixed rate of 2.3%, which is 70 basis points lower than Bank of Ireland's cheapest rate.  Even taking account of the cashback offering, can Bank of Ireland afford not to respond to what appears to be a significant move by one of the bank's competitors in the mortgage market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Francesca McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#G00300"><p>I will talk broadly about our approach to mortgage pricing and Mr. O'Beirne will talk about the competitive dynamics in the market.  Even from before I started as CEO, we have been very focused on a fixed-rate offering for our customers as we think it provides the best offer and gives a level of certainty, particularly in an environment in which interest rates are more likely to increase.  Nine out of every ten new mortgages are at a fixed rate, particularly for first-time buyers of whom only 2% look for a standard variable rate.  We believe we offer very good value across all loan-to-value ratios and terms between one and five years.  Our customers tell us they value the cashback offer and it is a shame to take cash out of the pockets of Irish consumers when they need it most, which is when they move house and need curtains and carpets etc.  There is a real value in the cashback offer in this context.  Combined with a clear, consistent and simple product offering, supported by a process in which we have invested time and effort to improve it for our customers, we think we have a very attractive offering and our customers must think so too, because our market share has increased from 25% in 2016 to 27% at the end of last year.  Our interim reports will be out in the next few weeks so I cannot talk about the latest figures but we have seen growing interest and improvement in our mortgage proposition.</p></speech>

The Ulster Bank offering, at 2.8%, is a good offer but it is only available for two years.  We talk to customers and research what they want and they have told us they have two major concerns when applying for a mortgage.  One is whether they can get a mortgage, and we approve nearly nine out of ten applications.  The other is whether they are going to have a monthly repayment amount that is manageable within their budget.  Given the competitive dynamics in the market, last year we moved to simplify our fixed-rate structure so that customers could have the option of fixing for a period that suited them.  We will continue to keep all those different items under ongoing review.</p></speech>

I am not a great fan of cashbacks as I feel they serve to camouflage high mortgage rates and it is very difficult for consumers to weigh up where the best long-term value lies as the picture can be quite confusing.  Can the bank provide us with a<i>pro forma</i>, or an anonymised version, of the information it provides to new mortgage customers who take up a cashback offer?</p><p>I know that new rules are coming into effect from the Central Bank from January 2019.  The Central Bank did a review of mortgage-related advertising recently which had a focus on cashbacks.  It looked at 183 different advertisements and found 75% of cases not to conform with the consumer protection code of 2012 and EU consumer mortgage credit agreements.  Three quarters of the advertisements had to be either amended or withdrawn because key information was not provided, some of the content was inaccurate and some websites were not up to date.  Was Bank of Ireland involved in that?  Did it have to amend or withdraw some advertisements relating to these incentives following the Central Bank's review?</p></speech>

No one buys a mortgage; they buy a home and a mortgage is an enabler.  We have fundamentally changed the pricing of our fixed-rate offering to enable the simplicity we want.  The rate of 3%, regardless of loan to value, LTV, for between one and five years, is designed to bring simplicity and clarity and ensure there is no confusion in how we market the offer.  The rate has reduced by 1.85%, or 38%, since 2015.  Our cashback offer, of 2% at drawdown and a further 1% in the five-year anniversary, is very clear.</p> <p>  In the area of advertising, there is always an opportunity to improve and we engaged on this.  There was some feedback and we did make some amendments.  Mr. O'Beirne may have some specific examples of what was changed.  We feel the underlying proposition of 3%, with a 2% cashback, is very clear.  The fact that we have increased our market share by focusing on that single proposition, for over 90% of cases but particularly first-time buyers who value it most, gives us feedback that suggests our customers, who vote with their feet, like the offer.</p></speech>

In relation to some of our advertisements, this was to ensure they complied fully with the full code by making sure warnings and other things were fully visible.  We are working with the industry, through the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, to ensure we meet the various commitments under the new regulation on transparency and changes to the consumer protection code of 2012.  We will ensure that customers seeking to switch their mortgage can do so within a particular time.</p></speech>

Given what Ms McDonagh said about nine out of ten new mortgage drawdowns starting on a fixed rate these are, in effect, legacy accounts.  The bank's variable rates are high because they are not its core offering, at 3.9%, 4.2% and 4.5%.  I am concerned that a lot of the bank's customers are still paying more than they need to.  The bank has written to them but can it do more?  There is inertia among some mortgage holders and this is frustrating for me and members of the committee.  We feel consumers need to do more to get better value for their mortgages.</p><p>I imagine Bank of Ireland still has customers with low loan-to-value mortgages who are still stuck in the band greater than 80%, while paying at a rate of 4.5%.  I am unsure whether Bank of Ireland has that granularity of detail, but it is a source of frustration.  What more can it do to help its customers to get the best value from the mortgage products they are on?</p></speech>

It is a little less but still too many.  I do not agree that there is inertia.  For most people, the mortgage payment each month is the largest outgoing from disposable income.  It is the biggest bill and one of the most important payments people make to pay for the roof above their heads.  It is also their largest investment.</p> <p>  I do not believe there is inertia.  It is our responsibility to be proactive and clear in speaking to customers about alternatives.  We include an insert with the annual statement.  In addition, this year we have written a letter to customers to make them aware of the alternatives.  That has been working.  Last year we saw 7,750 accounts move from a variable to a fixed rate.  That might have been in response to the letter but also to the advertising and communication we have undertaken consistently on the attractiveness of our fixed-rate offer.  In the year to date we have seen the number increase.  Some 7,500 customers have moved from a variable to a fixed-rate mortgage.  That is because customers see the likelihood of an increase in interest rates that would impact on their variable rate mortgage payments.  They see that that is looking more probable; therefore, the fixed rate offering is attractive.</p></speech>

For a non-first-time buyer, the Central Bank deems it appropriate that the loan-to-value ratio should be 80%.  Is that the case?  If I went to Bank of Ireland or Allied Irish Banks and obtained a loan of 80% of loan-to-value and then decided to switch, would I be able to avail of a 90% loan in the switching process?</p></speech>

The short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes", if a bank had availability within the macro-prudential lending rules.  Let us suppose a customer originally borrowed a loan of 80% of loan-to-value.  Let us then suppose that over time, depending on the value of the property and the mortgage, the customer looked to switch.  He or she may require additional moneys for other purposes, whether it be house refurbishment works or whatever else.  Under the macro-prudential lending rules, banks can provide up to 10% above-----</p></speech>

We hear about the volume of lending.  A total of 12% of the Bank of Ireland lending business in the first quarter of the year involved switcher mortgages.  We have heard the same from the other banks.  This money is circulating, but it is not real new money into the economy.  When we are looking at the figures from banks for new lending, some of it is inter-lending to other banks.</p></speech>

Obviously, switching is becoming a more dominant feature.  It should be and people should be encouraged to do it.</p> <p>  That takes me to my next point.  In reality, how would the bank representatives speak to a friend in the pub?  Let us suppose a friend has a mortgage with Bank of Ireland.  The advice a bank representative would give to a friend over a pint would be to go to Ulster Bank, fix for two years and then come back to Bank of Ireland.  Is that right?  That is because Ulster Bank will pay &euro;1,500 towards the cost of the legal fees.  Over the two years, the customer will pay &euro;2,800 less in interest.  The bank representative could then advise the customer to take the family away for a nice holiday with the money saved.</p></speech>

I do have these conversations and the answer when we are having them is "No."  It depends on the individual.  I am not going around passing on personal advice on people's individual circumstances.  Let us suppose I was speaking to someone.  In two years we may not necessarily have the same fixed rate offer available.  The interest rate environment may change.  Many of our customers are attracted to three or five-year arrangements because they pay at 3% for a longer period at a time when interest rates may go up and people really want to have certainty on monthly cashflow and outgoings.  Our 3% offer over three and five years with cash back is incredibly attractive.</p></speech>

If they were to look over the next two years, they would save &euro;2,800 by simply moving to another bank.  Moreover, that bank would pay &euro;1,500 towards the cost of legal fees; thus the switching process becomes more advantageous.  Why would someone not do so?  I do not expect Bank of Ireland to tell its customers that they can take their families on a holiday in two years' time for free because they will save that amount of money in switching.  What they should do afterwards is look at what Bank of Ireland and others have offered and decide where to switch next.</p></speech>

There is always the benefit of moving between different prices.  Certainly, from a Bank of Ireland perspective, we have always been active in the mortgage market and will continue to be.  Let us suppose someone needs to move home.  With the fixed rates we are offering, we allow a carrying or transporting of the fixed rate to the mortgage on the next home.  We also look to help and work through with customers the different things that many come up.  As part of having a long-term mortgage with Bank of Ireland, a customer may look at taking a mortgage break or may wish the bank to provide other services.  It is always in the round and depends on individual circumstances.</p></speech>

It is important to note, for anyone listening, that the Central Bank encourages people to switch and not do what the Bank of Ireland representatives are suggesting, that is, staying with the bank because of the relationship.  We need to break that cycle and get people to switch and force banks not to charge the high interest rates they charge.  The rates are still way above the European average; in some cases. they are double the average rates.</p> <p>  I want to discuss the position on mortgage arrears.  It has been identified that approximately one third of those in restructuring arrangements have terms and conditions that will run out, whether they are interest-only or other types of solution.  When these clauses come to an end, the mortgage holders will come under serious pressure.  This applies to one third of all restructuring arrangements throughout the banking sector.  What analysis has Bank of Ireland made as to when the restructuring clauses will come to an end?  What analysis has the bank made of a potential rise in the ECB interest rate that is certain to happen at some time?  The only question now is whether it will be at the end of this year or sometime in 2019.</p></speech>

I will then ask Mr. O'Beirne to talk about the details.  We have an arrears history and track record that is four times better than the industry average.  Our focus consistently has been on working with individual customers to find solutions, provided that they are willing to repay their mortgages, despite some challenges, and work through solutions on a tailored one to one basis.  This has served the bank and customers well.  It works for those who are willing and want to pay and find a solution that is sustainable.</p><p>Mr. John O'Beirne can talk about restructuring and the longer term as we go forward.</p></speech>

When we look at the range of forbearance treatments that we have they cover everything from short, to medium to longer term.  More and more we are looking to ensure that what is put in place is sustainable for the longer term.  I think 91% of all of the forbearance arrangements that we have in place are maintained and held.  As interest rate environments arise and as people's environments change, it goes back to the previous discussion, it is something that the bank looks to engage and work on with people.</p></speech>

I now want to deal with the housing market.  Deputy McGrath also spoke about it.  Ms McDonagh talked about the number of houses that she believes are needed to deal with the demand, which is 40,000 but this varies in the different reports and ranges from 25,000 to 40,000.  Perhaps Ms McDonagh can explain the reason that Bank of Ireland is at the upper end.</p> <p>  Is Bank of Ireland doing enough to ensure that finance is available to contractors who want to build houses?  The reports that I get is that banks are lending, but only lending to the most safe projects.  The project needs to be gold standard before one would get funding from the bank and many projects that should have support from the banks are not being supported at this point in time.  There is an issue in terms of non-performing loans, NPLs, that may be a factor.  We now have legislation going through the Oireachtas, which in my view should not be needed in the first place if banks were providing the necessary loans.  What is the increase in the proportion of lending for house construction that the bank has seen year on year and where do the witnesses see the bank going in the next couple of years to be able to meet the demand for the 40,000 houses that must be built each year?</p></speech>

A couple of weeks ago I shared our strategy and its key elements with the market and our investors.  The first key element we focused on was growth and increasing our loan book.  We have set out an intent to increase our net loan book by 20% between now and 2021 and some 65% of that is expected to be in Ireland.  Not all but a big part of that will be mortgages for consumers and home builders construction and also SMEs that are related to the home building sector or industry in some way.  We have been very explicit and clear in setting out a growth ambition.</p> <p>  There are two elements that enable this to happen, first the economic environment we operate - we have based our growth on how GDP will continue to increase and grow in Ireland at a slightly lower rate.  We also base that growth intent on the credit and risk appetite.  We want to make credit available to the corporate sector to build properties that are needed but they have to be within a risk appetite.  To lend in a way that is non-sustainable or not to consider the risk parameters appropriately would be bad for this sector in the economy and the individuals concerned.  We have been conservative and prudent in the way we have lent to large corporates as well as consumers and that has been evident by our track record in credit risk management.  We are not going to change our risk appetite statement and risk appetite in general to lend in a way that would be unsustainable as this would impact on the broader economy.  We have been explicit about a &euro;1 billion fund for construction and development, the majority of which is in Ireland and we have set out our growth plan.  After ten years of a reduction in lending in Ireland, we see that changing and normal lending beginning again.  We put 65% of our lending ambition in Ireland, particularly around construction, home building and home buying.  </p> <p>  I hope that gives the Deputy an indication of our intent to support the growth in Ireland in a sustainable way.</p></speech>

What I am trying to find out is what is prudent from the viewpoint of Bank of Ireland.  We have reports this morning in the Irish media that the European Commission is saying that the major domestic economic risk to Ireland is the issue of house supply and house price inflation.  We have seen house prices increase by 13% in the past year.  Rents are now 22% above the peak rate of 2008.  Where do prices have to go?  Ms McDonagh talked about the mismatch in supply and demand as 15,000 compared to 40,000.  With these fundamentals, how much risk is there in terms of lending to a certain sector?  How can that risk be reduced because we have a situation where people are telling us that they cannot get the funding, to the point that the State is introducing legislation to make the State's funding available because there is a view that the banks are not providing the funding to the sector?</p></speech>

We are supporting the building of 3,000 units and we are active on 160 sites across the country.  That ranges from large corporate sites down to small infill builds where there are a couple of constructions going on.  Typically we would look to fund about 60% of the transaction and I say typically, because each one is unique and we sit down with each customer and work through the cash flows for the site, the plans they have for building.  We generally look to make sure that there is a reputable builder and we look to make sure that the relevant planning is in place and the site is what we call "shovel ready", which is making sure that it is ready for construction.</p> <p>  We would expect about 60% debt finance from the bank and the remainder coming from private equity.  Each client is dealt with individually, each case is assessed individually against a number of different parameters but as Ms McDonagh said we have &euro;1 billion available and we want to fund construction and housing.  The challenge for the market as a whole is that construction must ramp up again.  We need more builders, and the building firms need more employees.  We will fund when the funding is required to start that construction but we have to be prudent and understand what happened in the past.</p></speech>

Ms McDonagh mentioned the 3,000 units and 1,700 places in student accommodation and the work on 160 sites.  What else can be done by Bank of Ireland to help to increase supply and do the witnesses see any pitfalls along the way?

Our focus is working with our corporate clients in supporting them on the transactions, deals and projects that Mr. Gavin Kelly referenced in a sustainable way.  The supply and demand issue is very apparent in terms of the increase in property prices and also in rental prices, but house inflation is beginning to slow.  It is still high but it is coming down.  One will see that the house price inflation is 8% and there was a reduction in the last quarter.  I cannot project whether that will endure but the supply and demand dynamic is beginning to have the effect of some reduction in house price inflation.  Prices are still rising but at a slower rate.  It is also important to put in context that house prices today are still 30% below the peak and that is a reflection of many things, including macro prudential rules that are appropriate in limiting lending to a sustainable level.</p><p>When we look at an individual's mortgage application, we look at the affordability, at the loan to value ratio of the property, at the income multiples and at the credit history of the applicant to ensure we are giving mortgages that are sustainable for the people moving into the properties, and to support corporate clients on projects that make sense.  We are the largest lender in Ireland and our purpose is to enable our customers to thrive, be it a big corporate or a first-time buyer, and we do it in a sustainable way.  Bank of Ireland has a track record relative to any market average or statistic that demonstrates we consistently do that.</p></speech>

We have done 26 events around Brexit and what it means for all sorts of sectors.  We are in constant contact with our customers and we have invested in more people on the front line.

It was very important to us on a couple of fronts.  One was to protect our footprint in 265 locations across the State, and to make sure we were providing the right services for the community.  As part of our change last year, between 800 to 1,000 staff were put out to support communities.  The committee will have come across this as it was referenced last year by the Senator.  The bank has been out and about supporting the community and running enterprise events in schools right across the country.  The remaining staff were in the branch networks.</p> <p>  The changes were made based on what we saw.  We had 265 locations and 100 of those are now self-service and advice branches and will remain so.  Before we made the change, typically in those branches we would have seen 20 to 30 over the counter transactions per day.  A teller has the capacity to handle a lot more transactions than that during the day.  As part of the change we moved the teller from inside behind a pane of glass to outside, onto the floor of the branch, to meet the customers' needs and requirements.  Some 99% of transactions that happen in branches are lodgements and withdrawals.  These transactions can now be done at our self-service machines in the 100 branches and can also be done 24-7 at the external lodgement ATM.</p> <p>  The change referred to by Ms McDonagh earlier was around the middle group of branches, where in approximately 100 branches we close the cash transactions at 12.30 p.m.  When we spoke to customers after this change they told us that this was confusing.  We got that part wrong so we have changed it and are now extending the opening hours in those branches until 4 p.m. every day.  Now it is a simpler model where we have two branch types in the business: 165 branches with the full traditional teller service and the other-----</p></speech>

I spoke about deepening and broadening this investment.  We deepened it to include other systems also.  Previously it was very much focused on our core, but we have included new systems such as our mortgage platform.  While price is important, speed of response and clarity is also important for people when they are going through the big decision on buying a home.  We have also looked at our various channels.  I do not want to have to wait until the call banking, which is a big programme, is done before we become better at some of our mobile applications, including the technology that our customers face into.  We are looking to improve our mobile banking proposition during 2019.</p> <p>  At the end of this investment our customers will have a bank that is simpler to engage with and where processes are quicker.  There will be absolute clarity, independent of which channel customers choose to engage with us on, and where they do not have to speak to lots of people to get something sorted.  We will have a single customer view of every customer across all their products and channels.  It will be simple, at the channel of their choice and more efficient.  This will also have an impact for our shareholders because of the lower cost of running a better system.</p></speech>

We see significant reductions in their use.  I do not have the exact figures but I will forward them on.  Reduction in use has been in the double digit percentages year on year.  We still have cheques in the Irish economy and they are still lodged into our machines and across the counter every day.  It is still a challenge, as indeed is cash.  Despite all the moves towards contactless technology and the increase in card transactions, cash usage in the economy is still high.  It is one of the aspects we need to keep looking at to see if we can lower the use.  We have started to see it reduce slightly but we have more to go.</p></speech>

It was just something we had to get over.  Cash transactions are costly and expensive and there are security issues when moving cash around.  Is there a policy on this?  Is Bank of Ireland trying to get people to move away from cash and more towards contactless transactions and credit or debit cards?</p></speech>

Many customers, young and older, like the convenience of using contactless transactions and going online, but not every customer will.  I have worked in other markets in other banks where they have tried to eradicate cash or cheques.  This is done to the exclusion of some customers who will always want to use cash and cheques.  Even though we want to offer our customers improved service, the fact that we have increased the full service branches by 160% is a response to specific and strong customer feedback.  We are moving with the changing preferences and habits of our customers, younger and older, and we see a very big shift towards digital use.  We have no plan, however, to remove cash or cheques if some of our customers continue to use them.  This is the reality of the market we serve and we have to respond to that.</p></speech>

I am delighted to say Bank of Ireland has recently funded many developers.  Mainstream banks do not seem to be funding developers to the same extent as previously; rather, developers are sourcing capital from funds to bankroll developments.  In the past some developments were not completed.  Individuals with mortgages for houses in such developments were not treated very well and found that they had houses but no proper facilities, roads or infrastructure.  Some developers funded through mainstream banks are at a disadvantage because of a higher cost of capital than might be the case if they sourced capital from funds.  There is a difficulty in that regard.  There has been a big change in how developers are funded.  Some banks do not fund them at all.</p></speech>

In that regard, we focus on funding good quality developments, understanding them and ensuring planning is in place and all regulations are being met .  We get to know each customer and his or her requirements.  We fund approximately 60% of the cost of such developments and developers use equity from other sources to fund the remaining 40%.

She has not been able to give details about the level of refusals.  Has Bank of Ireland a targeted level of residential unit building for 2018?  The 3,000 figure is low.</p></speech>

Hence, we have stated our intention to grow our total loan book by 20% by the end of 2021.  Corporate lending into Ireland to support construction is a key driver of that, within risk appetite.</p></speech>

As we have told the market, we have a target of a 20% increase in lending growth.  That breaks down to approximately &euro;2 billion corporate banking in Ireland.  We do not break that net growth down further in terms of what is construction or non-construction, but a significant part of it is construction.</p></speech>

That is unhealthy.  I would like to see the banks getting more involved.  Bank of Ireland's funding of 3,000 units today is not good enough.</p> <p>  Ms McDonagh referred to how house prices were well off the peak, but when they peaked, they were way above what they should have been.  That is why we got into this mess.  The only path that will resolve this issue sustainably is to increase supply.  I urge the banks in this regard.  They are looking to heal their own balance sheets, which is fine, but they must play a part in increasing the number of residential units that are available to first-time buyers.  If those units come on stream, it will dampen house prices further.</p> <p>  Ms McDonagh stated that prices were well below peak, but peak was when the top came off the chimney and the whole thing imploded.  Does she regard current house prices as being reasonable value?  What will be their rate of inflation in the coming years?  At what level does that become unsustainable?  The Governor of the Central Bank appeared before us recently.  He expected inflation to be 5% per annum for the next three years.  Anything above that and we would be entering dangerous territory.  At least, that is what I understood him to mean.  I want to know Ms McDonagh's perspective on this overall matter.</p></speech>

We have 20% to 25% market share in construction.  We would like to support more of our clients in building property.  I could not agree more with the Senator in that regard.  We also provide self-build mortgages to individuals in excess of the 3,000 figure.  We agree that a healthy, well-functioning and fairly priced housing market is in everyone's interests - the economy, the Government, individuals and the banks.  Obviously, we exist to serve society.  Having a property market that is healthy, sustainable and appropriate is in everyone's interests.  This has been a key part of the strategy that we have set out.  Since I have been in my role, I have been examining the strategy and what we want our growth to be.  I have been explicit about that growth.</p></speech>

We asked the bank to provide details of its proposals on pay and bonuses.  On page 19 of the submission supplied, it told us that the group's remuneration committee had recently commenced an engagement process with major shareholders to get their feedback on the adoption of an appropriate executive incentive scheme.  Why is that being proposed at this time?</p></speech>

The chairman's letter at the AGM referenced the initiation of a conversation with major shareholders about what a more normalised incentive and pay regime could look like.  I am on record as saying that I am supportive of normalisation of the banking sector in Ireland.  Given the financial crisis ten years ago, I appreciate that many people have strong views about how bankers are rewarded.  The Minister for Finance has said that he is in the process of tendering for consultants to undertake a review of bankers' remuneration.  We support that, and we would contribute our perspective if asked.  Normalisation would allow the sector to attract and retain talent in an appropriate and sustainable way while being mindful that we are not competing against other Irish banks but against international banks that are coming to Ireland.  We are also competing with non-banks in Ireland and internationally for talent.  I am not just talking about big deal makers but about people who manage risk, security, human resources and the cultural changes we are going through.  Normalisation would support that.</p></speech>

This is an area that we have progressed very well.  In working with our customers, we have an objective to get below 5%.  We have not set a specific time or target but based on our progress to date, it is not unreasonable to expect us to be below 5% over the next 24 months.  Unlike other banks we do not have a set target that has been defined by the regulator but we have made good progress.  To date, our approach has consistently been to work with individual customers to find solutions when they face distress and that has proved to be successful.  If the regulatory environment changes and if the regulatory capital that is attached to non-performing exposures were to change, we have the responsibility to keep our management of NPEs under review, as one would expect, for us to be dynamic and respond to market change.  Our practice to date has not been to sell mortgage portfolios but to manage them individually with our customers.</p></speech>

He replied that approximately 3,000 Bank of Ireland staff who were entitled to tracker mortgages were put back on tracker mortgages.  The mortgage holders who have not been put back on tracker mortgages have complained.  They claim that there is one rule for some and another rule for others and different decisions are being made.  There are between 150 and 200 of these cases in that cohort of people.</p></speech>

Within that, we confirmed that we had increased the number of customers who had been impacted to a total of 9,345, including approximately 6,000 entitlement cases.  These cases included some customers who were staff at that time or in the past.  The Central Bank is doing further work on the examination, which will not be complete until this work concludes.  Currently, however, no cohort of customers are the subject of discussion between Bank of Ireland the Central Bank in respect of them being excluded.</p></speech>

I am aware of the cases.  We have undertaken a very deep review of every single impacted customer.  We have looked at this from a customer perspective and lens, not just from a legalistic lens, and we believe that we have captured every single customer who has been impacted by the tracker mortgage issue.  There is work that is ongoing by the Central Bank and that conclusion is subject to the Central Bank completing its work.</p></speech>

One of those was that mortgages would roll in terms of what their roll rate would go to.

If they were never on a tracker in the first instance, they would have signed the same mortgage form of authorisation but it referred them back to their original mortgage.</p></speech>

I am just stating a fact.  We have been focused on ensuring all customers who should be included are included.  We have a total number of 9,345, a segment of which would have been staff.  Regarding the scenario the Chairman described where we do not believe they are to be included in an examination, we will wait for the finalisation of the Central Bank's review of the tracker mortgage issue.  At the moment, we are not in discussion with the Central Bank about whether we have inadvertently excluded any customers or any cohorts.</p></speech>

They are slightly different issues.  Mortgages were originally set up in one way and then, after the withdrawal of trackers, they rolled back to a standard variable rate because a tracker rate was no longer available.  Through the course of this review, that is where we have deemed the customers were impacted and have included them in the tracker redress programme.</p></speech>

Ms McDonagh presented a description of her bank.  I accept she cannot touch on everything.  However, the people who write these letters to the committee are members of staff of the bank.  They kindly ask us to raise the issue but say that because they are current staff members, they wish to keep their details confidential as they are mindful how it may affect their career and job progression in the bank.  Earlier Ms McDonagh spoke about culture.  There should be a culture in the bank where no one feels threatened about coming forward.  These people, as of 8 June, feel threatened.</p></speech>

That is why, as chief executive officer, I have sponsored a code of conduct relating to how we treat our customers, the conduct we exhibit, how we show respect and courtesy to our colleagues and how we ensure compliance from a legal and regulatory perspective.  With our code of conduct, we have a defined speak-up culture where people can raise concerns, whether anonymous or not.  I would look at those cases, regardless of whether they are anonymous, with the same lens to see if we are doing the right thing.  We believe to date we have done the right thing by including the 9,345 customers in the tracker examination.  I would be happy to take those cases away and have a look at them.</p></speech>

It is clear to me from reading some of the documentation that there are issues around it.  The bank refused the person in question the tracker mortgage.  She was then contacted and told she should not have got that letter as the bank was still examining the matter.  The bank then refused her again.  I look at the paperwork and I see clearly where the individual may have signed the three-year fixed paperwork but did not fill out the form.  The bank tells us that the second page of this document is missing.  At the end of it, however, one can clearly see that the tracker-variable option has been ticked.  It has taken years for this person to get this information from the bank.  She had to go to all sorts of lengths to get it.  These may be just quirks in the bank's system but they affect the lives of people.  That is what I am anxious about.</p></speech>

Nine of those 13 are now closed but four are the subject of legal proceedings.  The case to which the Chairman referred may be one of them.

We have announced an intention to enter the mortgage broker market in the second half of this year.  Those plans are proceeding.  We will enter slowly at first.

I note it held an investor day in London last month.  Bank of Ireland is targeting quite significant reductions in its cost base, reducing to &euro;1.7 billion by 2021.  The bank is investing &euro;250 million to, as the plan describes, "broaden the extent of transformation to deliver business model benefits and accelerate the reduction in [its] cost base".  It has been widely reported that this will mean job losses, particularly at middle management levels.  Can Ms McDonagh set out the bank's plans in this regard?  I ask her to start by confirming the bank's current employee headcount.  How many of those are in Ireland, and what has the bank publicly confirmed, if anything, about planned redundancies and job losses?</p></speech>

Approximately 85% of that is in Ireland.  I do not have a specific breakdown, but the figure is approximately in that range.  The Deputy is absolutely correct in that at the investor day two and a half weeks ago, we set out some key messages.  We talked about loan growth and reshaping our UK business, and we talked about transformation and a cost reduction to get to a total cost base of &euro;1.7 billion by 2021.  In order to get there we do not have any headcount reduction targets that have been agreed internally; therefore they have not been shared externally.  We will reduce our costs in a number of ways.  One way is by improving our efficiency through improving the end-to-end journey to customers, digitising more of our business and changing how we are organised.  We are doing that already by making the bank a simpler organisation.  We also will be changing the contractors or suppliers we pay externally and renegotiating to get better value out of those relationships.</p></speech>

We have fewer people today than we have had in the past.  I have gone on record and said that.  We are likely to have fewer people in the future than we have today.  That can be managed in number of ways.  One of the things I did early in my tenure was implement a headcount freeze so that we do not automatically backfill vacancies.  That is one way of reducing headcount.  If vacancies are in the front line, speaking to and supporting customers and providing services, they are backfilled.  With regard to other roles, I am questioning whether we need to recruit for every vacancy.  That is one way we have been able to manage our headcount costs that does not necessarily have a negative impact on individuals.</p></speech>

However, I have said we are likely to have fewer people in the organisation than we currently have despite growing our business in the future.  I think every European bank would normally say that because there is an increased move towards efficiency and digitisation and customer behaviour is changing.  We will do that in a way that is proactive and constructive and we will work with our people to reduce headcount.  As for examples of headcount reduction initiatives that we have taken, the difficult ones are to not necessarily backfill every vacancy.  That is an example that has enabled us to reduce some of our headcount costs already.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael McGrath has covered a good deal of the cost reduction issues.  Ms McDonagh referred to Bank of Ireland's non-performing loan exposure being reduced by 75% in the last several years.  How was that done?  Was it achieved by restructuring, write-offs or moving people to a different process?  How much of it was achieved by write-offs, how much was restructuring and so on?</p></speech>

We have not sold any loan book during that period with the exception of one in 2014.  That was part of the EU restructuring deal and was for a relatively small amount of about &euro;200 million.  We have consistently managed our loan book through working with customers.  There has also been the backdrop of an economic recovery, which also has helped many customers to be in a stronger financial position.</p></speech>

I also wish to raise an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions when the witnesses were before the committee.  I refer to the bank's staff and how the tracker mortgages issue is being resolved for them or not resolved as the case may be.  Some staff members had a two-year fixed product.  In the internal systems of the bank, to which many of them had access, it was clearly stated that they would roll onto a tracker mortgage.  This was unilaterally switched on the accounts in November 2008.  However, no staff member signed or agreed to that change.</p><p>Do the witnesses not believe they have an entitlement to redress and compensation given their understanding of what was available to them, according to the Bank of Ireland computer screens, was that their product would automatically roll on to a two-year tracker mortgage?  Does this not come into conflict with the clear statements from the witnesses and the bank of a customer-centric approach in dealing with this issue?</p></speech>

I answered the Chairman's question on the same topic.  I will repeat the point.  We have been very dedicated to ensuring that all customers negatively impacted by the tracker mortgage issue have received offers of redress and compensation.  We have looked at all cohorts and the Deputy will note from my last appearance here we have included additional customers.  We have identified a total of 9,345 customers.  We do not believe there are any outstanding customer groups impacted.  Further Central Bank of Ireland work is ongoing.  The examination will not be complete until that concludes.  There is no ongoing discussion between Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank on a disputed or disagreed cohort.  We await the conclusions of the Central Bank's work but we do not believe we have not appropriately captured or identified any other groups of customers.</p></speech>

I will need to validate and confirm exactly what the roll-to rate for that group was.  Once we got to November 2008, trackers were no longer available as a product so they were withdrawn.  For any customers who had an entitlement, either through the documentation that was originally put in by the bank or through the enhanced inclusion of additional customers late last November, in terms of the transparency of that documentation, anyone who had that entitlement to return to a tracker has been returned to it.</p></speech>

Let us find out what is disputed.  Do the witnesses accept that prior to November 2008, with regard to staff members of the bank who had a two-year fixed mortgage, the internal systems of the bank that staff members had access to stated they would automatically roll on to a tracker?  We can accept that as a factual position at that time.</p></speech>

The way the documentation was always framed was that one's mortgage would roll back to the available rate of the day at that point.  That is how we moved to the point of including the additional customers late last year.</p></speech>

They are not just relying on that.  They also make the point that verbal confirmation from staff mortgages was given at the outset that they would roll onto tracker mortgages.  Is it possible for the screenshot or what was said on the computer system to be provided to the committee?  It leads me to believe that if that was there, there would have been a reasonable expectation that they were entitled to a tracker mortgage.</p></speech>

Typically a graduate starting at the bank would earn between &euro;25,000 and &euro;30,000.  In terms of their career, a big part of our competitive advantage is attracting and retaining talent.  For new entrants and also for people of different seniority and age at different stages of their career we have a career reward framework.  We spend &euro;15 million per annum on providing training, development, upskilling and support for our staff.  I cannot be successful in my role if I do not have high quality and engaged people.  I put a huge emphasis on culture.  I am conducting a survey for the first time in many years to understand how people feel.  I am focused on investing in our people, retaining talent and developing their skills.</p></speech>

We have won industry awards for our graduate programme being one of the best in Ireland.  Entry position graduate trainees are permanent employees.  On occasion, we recruit people for a shorter period of time to fill a specific project or programme or to fill a temporary vacancy so there is flexibility.  In terms of managing our costs and efficiency we have looked at whether the use of short-term contractors, who often have quite high daily rates, is the best use of our resources or whether the role is better done internally.  Sometimes we will in-house our contractors to some extent.  Sometimes we will develop the skills of our own people to do the jobs we are paying a daily rate contractor to do.  We want to give our people sustainable and attractive careers at the bank regardless of whether they come in as new entrants or have been loyal members of staff for 30 or 40 years.</p></speech>

As somebody who used to lecture many people who did finance and accountancy degrees, I increasingly encounter people who say they cannot afford to live unless they are living at home, which I think a fair number of people are.  They cannot afford to pay rent because of the wages at entry level.  I encounter a lot of people like this; some are former students or people I know who are students where I used to work in DIT.  Ms McDonagh spoke about career paths but the entry grades do not pay a living wage.  Is there a policy to have a living wage for people who work in the bank?  As she probably knows, even sharing student accommodation costs &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 a month.  That kind of rent would absorb a lot of a salary of &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.</p></speech>

I am very aware of current and previous living wage discussions.  The living wage is &euro;11.70.  We do not have any employee working below that rate at Bank of Ireland.  I am very mindful of it.  I will clarify and come back to the committee on whether we have a stated policy.  I do not have one to hand.  I have verified that we do not have anyone earning below the living wage working as an employee of Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

If we do not pay people fairly in an economy that has a positive GDP figure and in which the level of unemployment has decreased, we will have a high attrition rate of good people.  That will have a considerable impact on customers and other colleagues.  As it is also cost inefficient to have that turnover, I am mindful of the issue.  If we have a stated policy, I will confirm its application to shorter term contract workers also.</p></speech>

The legislation which applies to the carrying forward of tax losses is not industry specific in Ireland.  It is also not specific to Ireland.  The position is the same in other markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia.  Some will have time limits.  For example, there are 20-year limits in the United States and Canada.  My focus is on operating within the rules and requirements set by policy makers in the countries in which Bank of Ireland operates.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the forum does not permit all the subcontractors to be here so we take this opportunity to thank all those involved for their work and support to date.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, the collapse of Carillion, which was a joint partner in the Inspired Spaces consortium delivering the public private partnership, PPP, bundle 5 schools, and the subsequent liquidation of the builder, Sammon Contracting Ireland, have ensured that these building works will now be completed by a new main building contractor.<br/><br/>Our group represents a number of specialist subcontractors who were engaged by Sammon to deliver the buildings.  We began meeting informally to share information when it became clear to us that there were growing financial issues with both Carillion and Sammon.<br/><br/>We have been invited here to give our input in regard to irregularities in the certification processes for the school projects.  We hope to outline the context and scope of these concerns and the potential implications for the delivery of the schools.  Further to that, we will also address more wide-ranging issues regarding PPPs, the delivery of the PPP company and the remit of the NDFA, on which the committee has previously heard evidence.<br/><br/>It has become clear that for several of these projects the assigned certifier intends to certify large portions of works undertaken by specialist subcontractors without providing relevant documentary evidence, which has become routine, using the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, certification system.  This approach has become accepted practice due to building control guidance and project precedent.  These precedents include all previous PPP schemes and standard building contracts that I and other subcontractors have been part of; we know that is the standard.<br/><br/>We strongly question the ability of any certifier to ensure that all relevant building regulations have been met, that the works have been carried out as designed, and that all the building products are compliant without the support of ancillary certification from the specialist subcontractors who carried out the works.<br/><br/>In essence, these certifiers intend to move well outside the established precedent of evidence-based submissions and ancillary certification.  This has wide-ranging potential for implications for the health and safety of the eventual occupants, who in these specific cases will be mostly children and young adults.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the current building control management systems were introduced after several high-profile failures.  The problems were eventually recognised to be partly due to systemic failures, which the current system was designed to address.  One high profile example was the evacuation of the Priory Hall apartments in Donaghmede in 2011 due to the dangers presented by substandard works and lack of inspections.<br/><br/>The current BCAR system relies on an evidence-based approach, ensuring there is a clear record of works being completed to the required standards, and to meet the design specification.  In essence, it becomes a risk management strategy, overseen by the assigned certifier who assumes the legal responsibility simply to collate this information.<br/><br/>It is clearly stated in the code of practice for certifiers that the role of the certifier does not include responsibility for the certification of any builder.  That is why the BCAR system is relied upon and begs the question: if ancillary certification from specialist subcontractors was a requirement of the original contract with us, Sammon Contracting Ireland and building control approval, what has changed?<br/><br/>The proposed approach by the assigned certifier would be similar to the historical <i>laissez-faire </i>attitude to building control compliance, something the current systems and legislation were specifically put in place to avoid.  Committee members will be in no doubt about the headline issues such as structure, fire safety and environmental performance being regulated by building control legislation but that regulation also extends to virtually every element of building works, for example, technical guidance document D.<br/><br/>Our group comprises contractors specialising in many different areas.  We are able and willing to demonstrate in detail, if required, numerous building elements where it is extremely difficult to see how certification can be achieved without our support.  Most of these arguments are technical in nature, relating to the specifications and performance issues of products and installations.<br/><br/>With regard to some issues, for example, CE marking of the structural steel elements that hold up the buildings or various elements of floor covering systems, it is impossible for any third party to provide certification.  As we have said, these issues with the certification of the building could also have a knock-on effect on the contractual arrangements between the State and the NDFA and the delivery consortium.  Perhaps more important, the risks will have real-world effects on the students who use the facilities should they be unavailable, which could affect the value delivered by the projects considerably.<br/><br/>The potential for delay in building control certification could lead to the current temporary arrangements for the affected schools having to continue for an unknown timescale.  Should there be challenges to the final certification of the schools, occupation and use of the buildings could be further delayed.  Ultimately, should certification be granted and subsequently removed, the buildings occupants would have to leave and services re-sited.<br/><br/>In these circumstances, it has been made clear by the NDFA that the financial risk falls to the PPP company rather than the State.  This is true in that the facilities would be unavailable and thus penalties applied, but it appears that the consequences have been somewhat overlooked.  In this case, it would mean that facilities are not available to students.  It is difficult to argue that risk transfer and value for money are working as intended if students are not in their places of study.  This is especially true should there be any widespread failure of building elements or systems due to inappropriate certification leading to longer periods of unavailability, especially considering that the sites have been unattended for several months.<br/><br/>The PPP contracts allow for deductions in payments should facilities or services not be available.  This seems reasonable in smaller instances, for example, classrooms not being available for an afternoon or even several days due to a leaking pipe.  It does not seem to be designed to allow for the loss of an entire school which, considering current proposals and our concerns around the law regarding certification, is a distinct possibility.<br/><br/>As we have no contractual arrangements directly with the NDFA, we also hope to use this forum to get clarification on several points.  The first is that whether this type of potential large-scale failure of service and facilities has been examined in any risk analysis of the projects.  We also question the ability of the PPP company and the certifier to demonstrate that the original specification has been met.  Design and construction changes at all stages had to be shown by subcontractors to whom I have spoken to meet specifications.  We know of numerous examples that can be provided whereby changes to design elements have occurred.  Without the support of the subcontractors and manufacturers involved, these changes cannot be reliably shown to meet the specification originally set out.<br/><br/>In previous evidence to the committee, the NDFA has also referred to independent advice in regard to building control and specification issues.  Should it confirm if this advice is also provided by the assigned certifier?  While we do not intend to question the professional integrity of any persons, it seems counter-intuitive that a party employed by the PPP company could be seen to offer independent advice to the client or the NDFA.<br/><br/>While the NDFA has been clear that it does not have any responsibility regarding payments to subcontractors, it seems that meeting building specification falls strongly under its remit.  We would ask for further detail on how it intends to ensure that the full specification is met.<br/><br/>Another issue we would like to raise in regard to the collapse of Sammon is that of retention moneys.  Many subcontractors have completed works on previous Sammon publicly financed projects, met all necessary standards and agreed final accounts for their work.  They have been paid for their contract but they have not been paid in full.  A portion of the final contract sum is retained during the liabilities and defects period.  In some cases, these sums are substantial.  These moneys are now due and we believe are held by the State.</p><p>As Sammon does not exist, the contracts cannot be completed, leaving contractors out of pocket yet again.  To our knowledge, no contractual arrangements exist to recover these payments, which are plainly owed to contractors as retained moneys.  Can the NDFA comment on this, or is it again outside its remit?</p><p> Considering all the issues which have been raised, we are also forced to question the PPP model more generally.  A main stated aim is the transfer of risk to the private sector.  We point out that in this case the risks have been transferred back to Irish citizens and businesses through a series of holding companies and funds.  It is they who have suffered considerable financial damage and personal stress due to this collapse, again bringing the real-world implications of risk transfer into sharp focus.</p><p> There is a huge issue of fairness which seems to have been overlooked when designing the PPP contracts.  The NDFA has oversight of finances until the point where it truly matters, when paying those who carry out the works.  We are in a situation where students will be using buildings and equipment that have not been paid for.  This is in no way morally acceptable.  </p><p> It was acknowledged that cherry picking occurs from subcontractors, in that certain specialties are paid to provide certification.  Again, this is morally wrong.  Some contractors do not have the option of withholding certification, and it would be reprehensible should they not also be paid for work carried out.</p><p> As a group we are ready and willing to engage constructively to resolve these issues.  The NDFA has produced a detailed briefing paper regarding payments to Sammon subcontractors for the committee.  We ask the committee to ensure the issues raised</p><p>today are clarified in a similar manner.</p></speech>

We have been in business for more than 60 years.  We supplied schools bundle 5 and parts of schools bundles 3 and 4.  Out of those five schools bundle projects, 40% or two out of five have failed, which is a high failure rate.  Approximately 12 schools in total have been affected.  PPP schools have been run by facility management companies for 20 years, which replace furniture that is damaged, including table-tops, replacement feet, chairs and so on.  The schools under these schemes have lost all control over the management of their own schools, to the extent that the caretaker cannot even change a light bulb, and the principal cannot update his furniture to suit the latest methods of teaching which are standard in other European countries, such as group work and other methods.  I can speak only on my own behalf as a school furniture manufacturer.</p> <p>  We furnish seven to ten new school builds on average annually, and we also look after existing customers.  In the 33 years of business that we have run it ourselves, we have never experienced anything like this.  At this time, we are owed &euro;250,000.  In layman's terms, this is approximately &euro;1 million's worth of work to cover the costs.  This has a knock-on effect.  We work on a 30-day credit term with both customers and suppliers.  As one can imagine, this puts a financial strain on our company.  We have been waiting for nine months for payment for furniture that is in schools.  We have been told through the media that these schools will open in September.  How?  They have furniture from our company that has not been paid for.  That is not right and it will not happen.  </p> <p>  We received liquidation letters from companies involved which clearly state the first creditor to be paid will be Revenue, the Government body.  The mistake was not ours as the subcontractors.  We, as subcontractors, should be paid first, before the Government bodies, because the error was not ours.  It always seems to be the small man who carries the can.  We are a small company which has to do due diligence on all customers and suppliers alike.  Who has done due diligence on the companies in question, if any due diligence was done?  We have signed no contracts with the companies involved.  This furniture was supplied on an order-invoice basis.  All invoices clearly state goods do not pass until invoices have been paid in full.  We were told we cannot access these buildings to reclaim our furniture, which has not been paid for, because we would be trespassing and would be held in contempt.  One can imagine how surprised we were when we heard the schools will open in September with furniture that has not been paid for.  The Department of Education and Skills has washed its hands of this until the schools are completed.  It must be resolved, and the Department needs to become involved.</p></speech>

We were left short from approximately October.  We kept pestering them to get the money from them and we heard every excuse under the sun.  Eventually, at Christmas, we said we would pull the security from the site, and we were paid one invoice.  After Christmas we went after them again and we were paid a second invoice.  We are still owed money to the tune of &euro;16,000.  That is our working capital, and it puts a strain on us and on our relationship with the banks.  It means that for us to take on work now, we have to pay upfront.  All our men were paid at Christmas.  Now it means we cannot take on work because our working capital is with Mice&aacute;l Sammon and company.  We do not have it anymore.</p> <p>  As a result, I started to ring other subcontractors.  I realised my predicament was not as bad as others.  When one rings a company now, one rings the man on site, which might turn out to be the husband.  The phone will ring and then go through to a secretary, who is his wife. If one wants to get the real story, talk to the wives and one will hear it.  The wife will say not to tell the husband what she said.  In one instance, a woman confided in me she had three children, and all the money they had from christenings and communions and so on was in the credit union, and they had to take the money out to prepare one of the sons for confirmation two months ago.  The husband supplied and is owed close to &euro;100,000 because of this debacle with Sammon.  That is one example.  To say these people are close to suicide is an understatement.  We have tried to get this across to Deputies and Ministers.  I sat before certain Deputies and Ministers and asked if they understood that from their front door, half a mile away, there were people in distress.  I asked if they had talked to them or their wives and the answer was "No".  On the following evening, I saw them parading on the television in Paris or somewhere else.  These are the people we elected to represent us.  There was no leadership coming from them.</p></speech>

It takes bravery because many of them are involved in the construction industry and specialise in education, where are contracts that are awarded, and the State holds a lot of the purse strings.</p><p>It is important for people to speak up and call it as it is.  It is clear that the subcontractors have been abandoned and let down by the system.  We have many public private partnerships, PPPs, holding companies and other elaborate structures.  The subcontractors are the lifeblood of the Irish economy, employing people on the ground and building up family businesses throughout the generations, some of which have been wiped out or are in real danger of being wiped out.  </p><p> How many subcontractors are affected?  We heard from the NDFA that there are 160 subcontractors in total.  How many subcontractors is the group in contact with and from the witnesses' understanding what is the total sum owed?</p></speech>

We can only appeal to people to reach out for help.  </p> <p>  What is the impact that people within the group have experienced in terms of their businesses?  Are businesses still clinging on and are many of them in danger?  The amount of money owed individually varies.  We hear figures of &euro;16,000 and &euro;250,000 but everything is in proportion.  A business could be owed only &euro;5,000 but that could put a business under depending on its size and scale and its credit agreement with a bank.  Will the witnesses give an indication of how it has impacted on businesses thus far and the likelihood of it so doing if this is not resolved?</p></speech>

For a week or more, I could not get out of bed.  Creditors who have been paid, having heard this on the grapevine, are no longer supplying our company even though we have no bad credit history with them.  This is having a knock-on effect for projects on which we depend to work ourselves out of this situation.  My father is the second generation and I am the third generation in our company.  My father is 67 years of age.  He was hoping to retire but it does not seem like that is going to happen now.  His legacy, which he was expecting to leave me, my brothers and my sister, is gone.  I know of companies that were in the group but are not longer in it because they are no longer in operation.  One can only imagine the magnitude of wrecking this has done throughout the industry.</p></speech>

We were fortunate and happy to be able to work through the worst recession this country has endured.  We seemed to be able to manage, to do our jobs and keep everything nice and tight.  We ran a tight ship.  At the start of the upturn, this project came along.  The main reason we took it on was because it was a government job.  When I heard that it was a government job I thought it would be a safe, secure job.  Having traded through a bad recession, this is the first time we have been hit with a company owing us money.  Our suppliers have reduced our credit limit from approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;5,000 per month.  We can go through &euro;5,000 in five working days, which leaves us trying to finance ourselves for the rest of the month.  We have tried to open up accounts with other creditors.  One is almost on one's knees begging for credit.  I have traded through the recession.  We have been hit in this instance but we are fighting back.  We will continue to fight back.  We will not let this do us down but it will be a hard long slog to get back to where we were.</p> <p>  We have been trading in Dublin for 20 years but it feels like we just walked into Dublin last week in that we are starting from scratch trying to access credit.  As Mr. Hennebry said, when tendering for jobs one knows the materials that will be needed but we cannot tender for work because we do not have the credit to supply materials.  This is putting us back a long way.  Thankfully, we have picked up one project that I have to try to manage myself.  I have not taken a salary from the company since December.  I had to let my office staff go so I have to run the office and the site myself.  I am trying to ensure I have wages for my staff and I am tendering for work.  I had to let three staff go, the weight of which is on my shoulders.  As stated by Mr. Hennebry, we are just engrossed in the work.  When we go home at night, it is very hard not take the work home with us.  As much as we try, we cannot do it.  If one has a bad day, it is hard to put it at the back of one's mind and not take it home.  I emphasise that one of the reasons we took on this contract was it was a government project.    </p></speech>

However, as stated by the chairperson last week or earlier this week they will be sitting on chairs and playing on football fields in respect of which subcontractors may have gone to the wall because they have not been paid for and so on.  </p> <p>  The issue is that the NDFA has to certify the works.

The issue here is that it is washing its hands of that process.  It is allowing Woodvale to carry out that process with an independent assessor.  In Mr. Hennebry's view, how can an independent assessor certify works that the subcontractors have done?  In correspondence to the committee, the NDFA said that the main contractor, which is Woodvale, will employ other subcontractors to complete the works not completed or to certify works that have already been done.  In Mr. Hennebry's view, how is this legally possible under the Building Control Act?</p></speech>

The NDFA has said that the role of the certifier is to satisfy himself or herself regarding the works done.  That is not what is stated in the code of practice.  Item 3.5 sets out the certifier's role.  It states:</p><blockquote>The role of Assigned Certifier does not include responsibility for the supervision of any builder.  They may or may not be a member of the design team. </blockquote> <p>It also states: &quot;The Assigned Certifier is assigned by the Building Owner as required under the Building Control Regulations<font color="#004080">.&quot;</font>Under the building control regulations, Part D, the assigned certifier is the subcontractor.  As I said in my opening statement, this is why the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, are in place.</p><p>I do not see that the NDFA has looked into this in enough detail to realise the law is on our side.  I have a statement from the flooring adhesive manufacturer mentioned by Deputy Pearse Doherty at the committee's previous meeting.  It is a huge global manufacturer.  It states it is its belief that without ancillary certification these products cannot be guaranteed, warranted or certified.</p></speech>

The adhesive is the bond for the floor covering.

We have been waiting for nine months to get paid.  We have already had to pay our suppliers, which has created huge financial strain, as well as mental strain as everybody here will say.  Family life no longer exists for us because we are taken up with the worry and stress of this.  I have been told I cannot enter the building because I would be trespassing and I would be held accountable.  Why?  I am only going in to get something that is already mine.

One is to picket the schools and get ourselves arrested as a group of people.  That has been suggested by many subcontractors.  It would cause further delays to the State and the NDFA so they would incur further costs but that is not what we want to do.  Another option is the legal option and challenging this.  We have spoken about this in recent days.  We are starting to build very strong cases to challenge this and have a judicial review on the basis the building regulations have not been met, which means the buildings would have to be evacuated and the children rehoused.  Half of the schools that were there have been knocked down.  Where will these children be put?  There are many options available to us.  Some of them are not very plausible but they are options.</p></speech>

I spoke to one man this morning, and this can be verified but I will not name him, who told me not to talk to him about court because he spent &euro;19,000 taking Mr. S and company to court only to lose it.  I am not exaggerating, but he said to cap it all his wife died suddenly two months ago.  This is the offshoot of this.  We want to convey this to the NDFA and everybody else.  We are the lifeblood of this country, and from Wexford to Meath subcontractors are keeping the country going.  We cannot afford to lose any more of them.

By way of information, I have raised this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills five times, directly in the D&aacute;il and by way of questions.  It is the same with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  I represent Dublin West, which has a massive school building programme at primary and secondary level.  All of this stuff, including the 20-year company management, is very important for the parents sending their children to school.</p><p>I specifically asked questions about Wexford because my understanding was that in Wexford the teachers had moved some of their stuff into the school.  This is what I was told.  The witnesses have spoken about the legal niceties.  Technically this was a completed building because all that was left was the cleaning, dusting and final opening and handover to the facilities management company process.  We were told by the Minister of Education and Skills that this is all sorted with regard to that school and the other school that is practically finished, and that subcontractors were being found to get the other schools on track.  While there was no commitment on those schools, I and Wexford Deputies from all parties left the D&aacute;il Chamber with the strong impression the Wexford situation was fixed.  To follow up on what Ms Walsh said, will there be an arrangement whereby the schools that are practically finished will be available in September, as they have been told and as has been in the public media?</p><p>The witnesses have a contact group of the various subcontractors.  What is their liaison with the NDFA?  Is there a specific subgroup or an individual who is the link person to deal with the practical issues and the handover issues should there be a replacement main contractor?</p><p>I read up on the history of Carillion and Capita in the UK.  Much of it has been covered over the past two months in major articles in the <i>Financial Times</i>.</p><p>There was a strong suggestion running through the articles of a problem with underbidding and also poor management.  The company was being sold on and it was a stock exchange company.  In respect of Sammon, the main contractor, did the witnesses, as the principal subcontractors, get a sense that there were these problems?  Eight months ago, did they wonder if the project would last?  Were there any indications from the UK that Sammon and Capita, which does not have a major presence in Ireland, had overreached in how they priced?  What do the witnesses believe is likely to happen in Wexford in September?  What structures, if any, has the NDFA established to assist?</p></speech>

Deputy Burton was in possession.  I ask her to remind the witness of the questions she asked. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1892" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#BB00200"><p>My first question was about the Wexford school.  The Minister for Education and Skills, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have been highly reassuring that the two schools that were almost finished would be ready for occupation by students.  The communities have been told this as well.  We are told the other projects will be back on track and will be built on time.  What barriers, if any, are there to that happening?  Ms Walsh indicated that her company has a lien on the furniture it supplied because ownership does not transfer until payment is made.  I do not know, in terms of others in the building industry, if it has been absorbed into the actual building or whether that is feasible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1893" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennebry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#BB00300"><p>I am aware that the certifications have been passed for Wexford, which is probably why there is such confidence in respect of that school.  The building was far advanced.  By nature, the top heading of the ancillary certification form states "on completion."  Completion of the contract is when a contractor is paid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1894" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#BB00400"><p>I have a follow-up question on that.  Can another contractor such as an engineer, architect or other qualified person step in, even though the person who has done the work has been shut out?  Is there a process through the Dutch investment whereby other contractors can be brought in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1895" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennebry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#BB00500"><p>We would very strongly challenge that, as I pointed out In my opening statement.  We do not believe there could be such a process if we build a legal case from the manufacturers, installers and so on.  We do not believe that anybody else can certify our works in Ireland because of the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, system and the precedent that exists.  Maybe it would be possible to some extent in the UK but not in Ireland.  It has never been tested as far as I am aware but there are historical reasons for the system that is in place.  We do not believe anyone else can certify and we would be willing to challenge any such decision.</p> <p>  On the retraction of the certifications that are in Wexford - the Deputy's question was specific to Wexford - again it is on completion and the contract is not complete until somebody has paid.  I think we have legal grounds to retract that certification.  If the school opens, the group in Wexford has talked about handing out leaflets.  It is very strong on that.  If that does not get anywhere and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, ignores us, we may use pickets.  We would contact the parents' associations and ask them to understand our position and not to cross the picket line.  That would create a problem for the NDFA and the finance committee.</p> <p>  I have mentioned the legal challenge.  Ms Walsh rightly referred to the removal of her products.  Who will stop her from entering a public building and removing her products, as she is legally entitled to do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1896" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mick Miley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#BB00600"><p>At this stage, we have provided a fair overview of what has happened, how it happened and how we arrived at this point.  My mission today is to find out what members can do to ensure we get paid for works carried out.  We are dancing around the edges, while legalities, barristers, pickets, financial statements and state of health are all issues in a big pot.  The big question is whether the Government can stand over not paying us.  Can it stand over skipping off out the back door and bringing in a new certifier to ensure we are not paid?</p> <p>  The Government, State and Department of Education and Skills are in control of some &euro;250 million, which they will pay to a Dutch finance firm they engaged in the first place.  It looks like they are trying to do as much as they can as quickly as they can and eliminate or ignore us.  By doing that, they are ensuring the Dutch company gets its full and total payment of &euro;150 million profit, subsidised by us who have paid our staff.  It seems the Government also wants VAT from us.  It is keeping our retention and for us to stay in business it wants us to keep the Revenue Commissioners happy by paying them money that the Government refuses to pay us.  It is a naive of the Minister to choose not to meet us.  The finance company does not want to meet us.  We are being ignored.  The Minister stated on television that the State was at no financial risk.  He should wake up because we are contributing to his existence.  We pay our way and pay Revenue and we did so through a bad recession, yet this is the answer we are getting.</p> <p>  We are not on trial today.  All of us survived a recession when we were paid poor rates, had high costs and had to get rid of staff.  As Mr. Kelly said, he had to let girls out of his office go.  We are not on trial.  All those who are hanging on to ministerial, departmental and Government stuff and trying to bypass us are out of order in the sense that not one euro of the &euro;250 million has departed the coffers of the State.  Meanwhile, &euro;4 million is the figure bandied around for contingency works such as roundabouts, lead-ins, footpaths, gateways and entrances.  Not one penny has been paid to the schools.</p> <p>  If the members do not have an idea how to help us, I ask that, before the Government makes any payment to any financier, it should create a contingency fund for people who have paid into the State but have not been paid for work on these sites.  We are not looking for a subsidy or contribution like those paid in agriculture.  This is not a subsidy but a reimbursement to people who worked and were paid for revenue that was paid to the Exchequer on their behalf.  We are unpaid collectors of Revenue money.  We have paid, otherwise we would not have our C2 tax clearance certificate or access code, as it is now known.</p> <p>  It is very simple.  There is &euro;250 million in the hands of whoever controls the project here, be it the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Education and Skills.  That money remains unpaid.  We have carried out work for which we have not been paid.  We are not looking for delay money, penalty clauses or anything, just the price agreed on the day we qualified to do the job.  If we qualified on day one, we are still qualified.  We do not need to be court-martialled, assessed or certified and no verification is needed of whether we did it right or wrong.  We were under scrutiny throughout the project.</p><p>We were scrutinised by representatives of Carillion which seemed to think it was a good idea to send them over to keep an eye on us.  We passed that test and our work is done.  Our invoices have been submitted and we are not paid.  How will the committee ensure that we get reimbursed and not cost the State in investigative costs such as lawyers, barristers and going to court without the necessity picket a site?  This is simple.  How does one solve it without that necessity?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1904" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#CC00800"><p>The second question I asked was whether there is any kind of a liaison with the NDFA.  What Mr. Miley has been saying is almost that they have been pushed to one side.  Is there a mechanism whereby one has a contact structure for the NDFA?  Ultimately, the NDFA is the holder, on behalf of the State, of the contract.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1905" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennebry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#CC00900"><p>I watched the questioning by Deputy Pearse Doherty of the NDFA in the other committee room a few days ago.  As of yet, we have not contacted the NDFA.  After watching the attitude of the NDFA's representatives, it would be useless for us to try to contact them because their attitude is to wash their hands of it.</p> <p>  I have read statements prior to reaching that view of various TDs and Senators who had contacted the NDFA on our behalf.  We contacted them as our local point of reference from all over the country.  The statements that we were getting back from the NDFA were akin to the victory gesture.  That is why we see no point in contacting them directly.  There is no contact between us and the NDFA currently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1906" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#CC01000"><p>Finally, the witnesses spoke about exploring the legal option of a judicial review, which, in a similar case to this, many people probably do.  Have they had legal advice in the context of what Mr. Miley was saying, that they have a legal status which they could ask the courts in some way or other to enforce to give them fair play?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1907" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennebry" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#CC01100"><p>I have had legal advice in a personal capacity as chair of the group.  The legal advice came from a close friend of mine.  He is overseeing the whole scenario and helped me to write my opening statement.  He is of the opinion that there is a strong case there.</p> <p>  However, as my colleague stated, we would prefer not to go down that route.  The finance committee needs to make a decision here so as to avoid that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.1908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018070500002#CC01200"><p>I thank the construction sub-contractors for the presentation and for sharing their stories.  I am sorry we had to go for the vote earlier on.</p> <p>  It is clear what has happened here in terms of the Government responsibility.  We had the NDFA in before us the other day.  In terms of the failure to conduct due diligence, the NDFA failed.  As to whether the Government needs to sue the audit company that stood over the accounts of the company the contract was awarded to, that is an option that Government needs to be seriously looking at.  The buck has to stop somewhere.</p> <p>  The decision made was obviously the wrong decision and the sub-contractors were at the end of the food chain in the sense of the impact.  It will continue to have an impact because through no fault of their own their creditworthiness in the future will be brought into question.  The Government has a responsibility to protect indigenous businesses such as these first, second and third generation businesses.  That is what would seem to me to be the first step.  We, as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, should suggest that the Government put such protection in place immediately.</p> <p>  When I asked the NDFA the other day whether it had correspondence with the audit company involved, the NDFA's representatives stated they did not.  They need to enter into formal engagement with the audit company because it gave them misleading information in terms of standing over the accounts.</p> <p>  I am a parent of somebody going to school.  If one does not pay for something, one has stolen it.  It is as simple as that.  It is the Government's responsibility.  Sending children into a school where they will be asked to use stolen property is so unethical it is off the scale.  What else can parents do in that situation?  Is it the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills?  It comes back to what Mr. Miley said.  We need to get who is responsible.  The Government is responsible for that.  They are responsible for the situation that the sub-contractors find themselves in and they are responsible for the situation that they will put children, parents and families in come September if this is not resolved.  There is a small window of opportunity there to resolve it.  For the Government to put a contingency fund in place that will assure these businesses in the future, ensure that the furniture is paid for and then sort it out with the main audit company, would be the clearest way that I would see it being done.  In terms of the certification for the other company, it must be compelled to bring this company on board to be able to certify the work done to date.  It needs to be instructed.</p> <p>  In terms of what the Chair is saying as to whether Mr. Miley will have an answer going out of here today, it has been valuable to have Mr. Miley here.  In one sense, I wish Mr. Miley had been here before the NDFA because one could see that there was this hands-off approach of it being nothing to do with them.  All of us, collectively, on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, know it had everything to do with them and everything to do with the original decision that they made.  It may be that we will even have to bring the NDFA back in here but there will be specific actions that we should be able to take at the end of the hearing today.</p> <p>  I will not take any more time.  We are much clearer now on what needs to be done than we were before we heard the presentations from the sub-contractors.  We also feel, even though many of us are not in government, an obligation to ensure that theft is not facilitated which, to me, is what has happened here.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, the Senator's children, everybody's children, teachers and whoever one likes to include are the owners of the ground.  They purchased it.  They inaugurated this project in the first place.  They just cannot pick out a spot in the middle and say, "That has nothing to do with us".  It was there at the beginning, it is there in the middle and it should be there at the end.  I strongly suggest that contingency be taken out of the pot of gold that is due to be paid to the Dutch finance firm or whoever that man is at the end of the day so that he loses out on the overall amount.  I am not picking on him in particular.  That figure of, say &euro;20 million, should be taken out as a contingency to hold for someone to adjudicate over as to who is entitled to be paid.</p><p>If at that point they wanted to change their contractor, team and engineers, without their consent, I would be okay with that; I just want to be paid.  I stand over what I did and I am sure the same applies to others.  If they wished to go away and pick a new contractor, I believe that would be acceptable.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;85.3 million of a contract worth &euro;87 million was paid.  The National Development Finance Agency had oversight of the system of payment.

The repayments - what one can describe as hire purchase - over the next 25 years are that the State will pay &euro;10 million annually for 25 years; hence the figure of &euro;250 million.</p></speech>

There have been considerable savings in every construction project.  It is probably now costing Dutch Infrastructure Fund less than &euro;100 million to build them.  There will be liquidated damages which could be blamed on KPMG or the NDFA, as the case may be, but the figure of &euro;250 million which the Government proposes to pay still represents a very good deal.</p></speech>

The initial cost of the buildings was &euro;100 million which I understand was the tendering price and of which &euro;87 million has been spent so far.  It is like buying a car by hire purchase.  The delegates should correct me if I am wrong, but the Government will start to pay once the contract has been finished.  It will be &euro;10 million per year for 25 years or &euro;250 million.  That is my understanding of how the process will work.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

However, by October, November and December the quantity surveyors for Sammon were coming back and saying for no reason that they did not agree with our applications.  There was no substantiation, but they were knocking sums off in the 10,000s up to 50,000s.  When it comes to having a meeting with them, one does not do it in the first or second week but when the next application is due to be made.  That was in November/December.</p></speech>

I think the only outcome was that their attitude infuriated the members present; it certainly infuriated me.  I am sure it also drove the delegates to the same conclusion that it was not fit for purpose.  They said two things which I ask the delegates to consider.</p><p>It was said that it has two reasons for its existence.  One is to give advice in relation to the funding of all of these projects and the other is to ensure the delivery of the PPP contracts.  It is in the delivery of the contracts that it has failed, because the subcontractors are not part of the conclusion to the contract or finalising it and they are due the payment.  Mr. Miley asked what can we do.  The purpose of hearing from the NDFA was to establish its position within this structure of companies that now exists.  I do not know whether the witnesses have seen a copy of the transcript of the meeting but we will make it available to them.  We then wanted to establish the number of contractors and how we can assist.  I can safely say from what members are saying that it would be our view that we would consider either bringing back in the NDFA, sending the transcripts to the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills among others, and making some form of recommendation as to how we feel the subcontractors should be dealt with, and how they should be included in the process of payments in some way.  There is a responsibility on the State to ensure that happens.  That is my firm view on it.  While we do not have the authority to instruct the Department of Finance, we certainly have the pressure within the committee to begin to raise the matter, perhaps as a report to the D&aacute;il, and to ensure further engagement with the agencies of the State that we feel are responsible for this, and that is what we will do.  To the extent of our remit, we will pursue the issue to the nth degree.  I think that is a commitment the committee can give to the subcontractors today.</p></speech>

Could I suggest that you might explore two other potential options?  We need legal advice from the Oireachtas legal service about the overall structure of the contract, and where, if any, responsibilities down the chain to the subcontractors may lie.  The alternative to that is to, for instance, get some advice from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the same area in that this is a significant public project.  What we are being told is that, notwithstanding a lot of legal structures around the contract, the suggestion is that there is in fact no legal status for the subcontractors in relation to the fact that the contract has collapsed.  I say that without judging it, but that they have been left holding the baby, which is really sad and unfair.</p></speech>

We might also seek clarification on the &euro;250 million.  We are trying to establish a focus here, to represent as best we can the views that we have heard today.  Ms Siobh&aacute;n Kelly wishes to say something.  I will also call Senator Murnane O'Connor but first I will call on Deputy Deering.</p></speech>

There are two issues.  First, there is no doubt the subcontractors who are at the end of the supply chain must be looked after.  The first question is how that will be done in the short term.</p> <p>  The Construction Contracts Act went through the House a few years ago.</p></speech>

If that is the situation it must be addressed going forward given the current situation and the fact that other situations could arise and it is very important to plan for them.</p> <p>  Ms Kelly mentioned that Sammon had a bad name for many years and everybody knows about that.  There could be another Sammon in the future and we must be able to plan for that.  We should investigate whether the legislation needs to be strengthened to ensure that in future subcontractors would be looked after, in addition to the short-term measure we are discussing.</p></speech>

It was scathing in its recommendations, including calling for the break-up of the big four companies.  It is not a document I have gone through in detail but I had a chance to glance over it.</p></speech>

For the information of the witnesses, Mr. Cahillane told us at that meeting that the audit and how the analysis was approached was flawed.  If that is the case, and taking into account what Deputy Doherty has told us about the parliamentary report in the UK, the Government has an obligation to pursue KPMG.  That is something we will be investigating also.  I invite Ms Kelly to give us the wife's perspective - she who must be obeyed.</p></speech>

We have all heard from the guys.  As Mark has said, he has not received a wage now from the business for a number of months.  If he is not receiving a wage my three children are not receiving what they are entitled to.  Home life has been extremely stressful as a result.  I am watching my husband come in every evening and I can just see the worry on his face about where he is going to get the money to pay the next bill or the next wage.</p> <p>  Now that the school term is finished the children are looking to go on day trips and holidays.  We have to say sorry, it cannot be done.  They are looking to attend camps but that cannot be done either.  Our eight year old boy with special needs cannot get the full attention he deserves.  Every day when the postman comes we wonder what bill is coming in or what urgent matter we have to deal with next.  The situation has brought us down to rock bottom in the past couple of months, to the point that we have fought, argued and cried.  It is hard to try to block that from the children every day of the week.</p> <p>  I can understand where every one of the men is coming from.  It has been so difficult and the Government really needs to step back and see what it is doing to people.  These are Irish contractors but instead the Government brings in contractors from the UK or anywhere else in the world; it does not look at Irish contractors.  The situation needs to be sorted.</p></speech>

It is important to clarify that.</p> <p>  The situation is unacceptable.  The hardest thing today is to hear the stories of the witnesses and the reality of what is happening to our own people who have done the work.  My biggest issue is the fact that the witnesses are here crying and looking for something they deserve, that they have worked for.  They are coming to beg from the Government today for something they have done.  That is unacceptable in the sense that they are now all under pressure.  Families are feeling it.  We have heard the stories today.  I commend the witnesses on their bravery.  They should not have to come here.</p> <p>  Mr. Miley referred to me.  I addressed the Minister for Education and Skills twice on this in the Seanad and I got nowhere.  I sent the replies back to the contractors with whom I was dealing in Carlow.  The Minister led us all to believe that this was not in his remit and that he could not interfere.  That is unacceptable.  The Government must step in and address the issue because we need to make sure the subcontractors are paid.  We need to make sure that their family lives are brought back to normal.</p><p>It is like what previous speakers said.  When someone hears of a PPP and it is Government, they feel they are guaranteed their funding.  That has always been the way.  One will be paid if it is a Government contract but that has not happened here.  Have the witnesses set up a group because I know there have been different meetings?  I know we had the meetings in Carlow.  Before we meet again, and we need to meet again, the witnesses should get a proper group together.  They know the old saying.  The more they stand together, the more meetings subcontractors hold and the more they get a group together to fight this, the better.  They cannot do without this money and it is unacceptable.  The witnesses should get a group together from here and work through this committee and all of us because I am here to give them 100% support.  I think it is unacceptable in 2018.  I have to say this because every day in the Seanad, we hear about how funding is there, the country is on track and building is back but if we cannot pay our own subcontractors, what are we doing?  We need to address this.  The Minister needs to be brought here.  He would not have a meeting.  I think he needs to have a meeting with the witnesses.  Perhaps we could arrange it either through the Seanad or D&aacute;il.  We need to get the Minister in.  The Minister needs to be accountable.  Funding needs to be set up for subcontractors so that they get their money and their lives get back on track.  </p><p> Regarding certification, the witnesses know that if they apply for another job, they must pay their taxes and have their certificate.  How can they do it when they are not getting money from the Government, yet it wants them to pay taxes to Revenue?  This does not add up.  I am asking for a meeting with the Minister and that the subcontractors get together and form a proper group.  Whatever road we have to take to fight this, I will give them 100% support.  I thank the witnesses for coming before us today because it was very brave to come in here to a finance committee and tell it what is happening; this is the reality and the Minister and Government need to hear it and wake up.  </p></speech>

Correct me if I am wrong but Mr. Cahillane told us that they could certify it because they had someone on the ground on all of the sites examining the work as it was being done.  Is that right or wrong?</p></speech>

It clearly states that in the code of practice for the certifier.  It is not the certifier's role to be on site.  It is the role of the subcontractor through the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, system.</p></speech>

What the Chairman said was accurate because that is what they told us in the committee last week.  Mr. Hennebry is also accurate because I have seen the role and regulation 3.5, which states very clearly that the role of the certifier is not to supervise the job.  We have since heard a different line from the NDFA, which is that it will not use the independent certifier but will use new subcontractors to complete and certify Mr. Hennebry's work, which does not rectify the situation as that is still not allowed under the regulations.</p></speech>

In respect of what the Chairman touched on, in its defence, the NDFA was happy to believe Carillion and KPMG to defend why it decided to go for this PPP decision.  It is now happy that its certification is being carried out by what it says is an independent certifier who is employed to correlate.  I have spoken to this certifier personally and he has been given extra money to carry out certifications as well as to just correlate so how is this guy independent if he is being given extra money to do our certifications?  Those were his own words to me over the phone.  How is this guy independent?  I have to challenge that.  If the NDFA is saying that KPMG and Carillion are not independent because of the investigation yet in its defence, it is saying this guy is independent but he is being paid, surely that is just hypocritical?</p></speech>

Nobody else could come in.  If I did a job for the Chairman, he did not pay me and got Senator Murnane O'Connor to come in and do it and I was not paid, that would not be right.  I would have to be the one certifying the work that I did.</p></speech>

It states that a summary of the legal position as it understands it is outlined in the correspondence.  It states that in signing its part of the certificate of compliance and completion, the assigned certifier will rely upon a number of ancillary certificates from others involved in the work.  It states that while the majority of those ancillary certificates are available for the project, some are not.  It states that for those work elements where the ancillary certificate is not available, the replacement main contractor will engage new third party subcontractors to complete any outstanding works for the relevant elements and to provide ancillary certificates covering both their own work and the work carried out by previous subcontractors from whom ancillary certificates are not available.  This is from the deputy director, Mr. Cahillane.  I find that totally unacceptable.  Mr. Miley spoke about bypassing the subcontractors.  The very purpose of this meeting is to ensure that subcontractors are not bypassed.  It is to ensure that this type of legal position is not adopted.  We want a very basic position to be adopted, which is to pay the contractors the outstanding amount of money they are due.</p></speech>

It must be mixed and applied properly.  We have to certify that so how on earth can a third party contractor, even if they know our trade or are specialists in the trade, know that my guys on site have mixed and applied products correctly?  The contracts manager and quantity surveyor from my company know that my guys have mixed and applied products correctly.  How on earth is that correct?  It is completely wrong.</p></speech>

That letter did not happen by itself.  Somebody at the head of some table somewhere has given an instruction to find new certifiers, independent or otherwise, to get this thing rolling, get the three schools open, get good vibes back into the people and children and get completion at whoever's cost - it does not really matter.  I think that is written proof of everything that has been said here today.  It is so deliberate, it is-----</p></speech>

That is the question.  As a committee, we would not want to give some subcontractors leaving here today a false sense of security that they are going to get paid in a week's or a month's time.  This committee must work out how best to get the money for them as quickly as possible.  We could bring the NDFA back next week or we could bring in the Minister or this person or that person but that is only an engagement with a process.  How to get them the money they are owed is the question.  Does it require a legal process?  That is the question I will be asking.  As Deputy Burton mentioned earlier on, do we require legal advice?  Is that the only road that can be travelled to secure the money they are owed?</p></speech>

While we are making no commitment except that we will do our best within our remit to satisfy the subcontractors because that is as much as we can do today, we will not let them down.  Deputy Deering asked about the way to resolve this.</p><p>The way to resolve this is simple.  It is to apply a bit of common sense to the work that was done and to acknowledge it.  The Government should set aside a sum to pay the contractors.  It is &euro;14 million out of a spend in excess of &euro;5.5 billion.  As such, it is a small amount of money by comparison to what is being spent, but it is a significant amount to the contractors.  We will be pursuing that course also.</p></speech>

This is a significant level of public works and we want the children, parents and teachers in the town get their school.  However, we would also like the contractors to be paid.  The responsibility is shared across government.  The solution is to bring a memorandum to Cabinet to indicate that there is a recognition.  I am not a lawyer, but the subcontractors as a group need good legal advice as to whether they can consider the courts as an option.  This is possible for the Government, however, notwithstanding that it says it cannot touch the PPP process.  We know that is not completely true from the UK experience, although it is a very strong legal mechanism.  One of the responsible Ministers or the Government collectively could bring to Cabinet a memorandum to say the subcontractors' issues will be addressed.  While they might not get 100%, they might get some contingency payments during the examination of what has happened to the various amounts that have been paid out but in respect of which they are at a loss and in danger of going under.  The Government should act on a humanitarian basis but also on a reputational basis in circumstances in which providers should not be left out of pocket where the State is contracting for important services.  That is the other issue the committee might put to the Government in a report.</p></speech>

I noted to Ms Kelly that it is not an easy thing because we are in this room and other people are watching.  I am sure the NDFA is watching.  The Chairman talked about a number of options for the committee, albeit we cannot instruct.  There is a terrible mess here and the consequences are clearly wider than issues of hard cash.  There are risks of job losses and risks to family businesses.  We have heard the personal testimonies.  The solution is simple.  The NDFA must be assured that the works carried out meet the requirements of building control legislation.  There is no way it can assure itself of that without the subcontractors certifying those works.  The NDFA needs to revisit this and make it clear to Woodvale that the only way this can be done is by re-engaging with the subcontractors, having the works completed if they are not completed and getting the certification from the subcontractors.  That will mean every subcontractor gets paid which will, in turn, bring an end to their financial and personal misery.  It will take us until next week to put all this together, but if the NDFA is listening now, I urge it to waste no time engaging with Woodvale on that course of action.</p></speech>

As such, I repeat my thanks and that of the committee to the witnesses for attending to deal with some of the personal issues that face their businesses and families.  It is not easy.  I am from a small business background and understand full well how board meetings take place on the pillow at night and that is the way it is done.  To suffer a setback like this is not easy to recover from.  We will do everything in our power to assist the witnesses in every way we can.  I suggest that when we meet next Tuesday at 2 p.m., we prioritise our consideration of this matter and, in the meantime, set in train all of the suggestions which have been made here.  That will determine what steps we need to take as a committee and the steps the witnesses need to take.  If it is necessary to come back to the witnesses again, we will.  That is with the agreement of the commitment.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank the witnesses again and those who travelled to be here in the Public Gallery.</p></speech>
