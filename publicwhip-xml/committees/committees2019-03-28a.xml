He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  </p><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p><p>The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 7 March.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  They will be published.  As I cannot see anything arising that will not be dealt with when we deal with correspondence and other items, we will move on. </p><p>The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first category is category A - briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 2076 and 2077, dated 26 and 27 March, are a briefing note and the opening statement for today's meeting from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will note and publish them. </p><p>The next category is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and their Ministers following previous meetings of the committee.  The first item is No. 2031, correspondence, dated 11 March 2019, received from Mr. Tom Grady, chief executive of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, on governance standards, the internal audit function, the finance committee and internal controls.  The ETB acknowledges the shortcomings in 2017 which were highlighted.  Corrective action has been taken to improve compliance.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We have seen a general improvement in the ETB sector, but there are still problems throughout with internal audit.  We will keep an eye on the matter. </p><p>The next item is No. 2032, correspondence received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing outstanding information requested by the committee on the Irish Prison Service.  It relates to the level of compensation paid in cases involving an injury to a prisoner.  The issues involved were not dealt with in previous correspondence.  The correspondence provides details of the compensation paid in cases in which prisoners had harmed themselves and a note on cases which involved protected disclosures and non-disclosure agreements, including where payments were made.  We will note the correspondence, but I want to highlight one or two issues in that regard.  </p><p>The fourth letter highlights a very sad situation.  It reads:</p><blockquote>I can advise the Committee that payments for self-injurious behaviour for the years 2016 and 2017 were &euro;50,000 and &euro;51,737 respectively.  The payments were made to the families of prisoners who had died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody.</blockquote> <p>I would like to write back to ask for an update on cases involving prisoners who died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody since 2017.  I do not know if it was mentioned at our last meeting, but before we meet the Secretary General again, we will need to receive a note on potential claims or claims that have already been lodged as a result of an outbreak of tuberculosis in a prison.  There are some cases in the system.  I understand there is a significant issue in one institution.  </p><p>We return to the State Claims Agency and will have to address the issue in our periodic report.  There is a demarcation line.  When an issue arises, it is referred to the State Claims Agency and, as far as the Irish Prison Service is concerned, that is the end of it.  The agency is required under legislation to process and manage cases.  However, we asked about confidentiality agreements.  In the last paragraph Mr. O'Driscoll writes:</p><blockquote>The State Claims Agency considers and treats all settlements as confidential as between the State Claims Agency and the Plaintiff.  The State Claims Agency does not routinely request confidentiality agreements in relation to claims' settlements but does so from time-to-time as it deems it necessary and appropriate.  In some instances, confidentiality agreements are sought by Plaintiffs.</blockquote> <p>Officials of the State Claims Agency will come before the committee again to deal with the handling of confidentiality agreements and claims against the State.  We were told that they were almost unique.  This indicates something slightly different.  We will, therefore, need to verify the matter.  We need to examine the TB outbreak and receive an update on cases in which people died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody.  We will note and publish the correspondence. </p><p>The next item is No. 2033, correspondence received from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, providing information requested by the committee on the internal audit function.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It makes for sad reading from a public accounts point of view.  Essentially, the ETB had one internal auditor who retired in December 2016.  There were communications between the ETB and the Department on what grade the internal auditor should be, whether he or she should be an assistant principal officer or at a higher grade.  One body said &quot;Yes&quot;, the other said &quot;No&quot;.  They then changed their minds and changed them back again.  They tried to recruit but could not find anybody.  They tried again but still could not find anybody.  We are now told that the internal auditor should be recruited through the national ETB internal audit function.  This is a great example of the parcel being passed around for years, sheets of paper being issued from one Department to another and nothing being done.  I know that there are difficulties in recruitment, but the correspondence states that in the period from September to December 2017 the ETB internal audit function carried out one audit of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It is utterly and totally unsatisfactory that there is no evidence of any internal audit having been carried out of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It is not fair to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to answer off the top of his head, but what turnover does the organisation have?</p></speech>

This is an organisation through which &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money passes each year and the correspondence appears to show that no internal audit reports have been carried out in at least the last year and a half.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

It is up to the Department to get a handle on the issue.  The solution is not in the hands of individual ETBs.  It is obviously a departmental issue.   I will pass on the concerns that have been expressed.  The Department must come up with a detailed plan to resolve the issue.  To do our work, the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General need to rely on the internal audit function, but there is a big gap in the system.  It is just not on that an organisation with a turnover of &euro;500 million has no internal audit function.  I have made my point.  We will ask for a detailed timetable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#B01200"><p>Tangentially, last week I met representatives of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, with other Deputies.  This does not concern the internal audit function, but I note that the implementation of shared services is moving very slowly.  The GRETB representatives said the technology was not fit for purpose.  They highlighted payroll and finance operations.  They said it openly, which is the problem.  I must say it is in spite of their best efforts.</p></speech>

The ETB's representatives explained to us the issues related to payroll.  I am trying to get my head around the finance aspect.  I do not know how far behind we are in the roll-out, but the people who are speaking to us identified it as a risk.</p></speech>

I would appreciate that.  This will be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It follows on from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB.  I believe that the Galway and Mayo situation is replicated in many places around the State.</p><p>No. 2041B from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health, provides information requested by the committee as follows: a breakdown of the cost of services provided by laboratories in respect of CervicalCheck and further details in on the provision of out-of-cycle smear tests.  Both of these are in line with what was said at the meeting here on the out-of-cycle tests and the costs of approximately &euro;10 million for the services provided by the laboratories.  Mr. Breslin has outlined in the correspondence that it is &euro;9.6 million and he gives a small breakdown of those costs.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>No. 2044B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman, Office of Public Works, provides information requested by the committee on the negotiations on the rent for Miesian Plaza and the basis of measurement to determine the rent.  This matter is still under discussion.  Mr. Buckley said that the matter has not been concluded.  The committee will note and publish this and will ask for an update on that by a maximum of three months' time.We will give him a little bit of time.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>No.  2045B is from Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach, and provides information requested by the committee on the costs of commissions of investigation, which we received subsequently from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That was a very detailed and comprehensive note that we discussed at this committee.</p><p>The correspondence from Mr. Fraser also includes a breakdown of figures on the Office of Government Information Services staffing and a copy of the Government's 2018 national risk assessment is also enclosed in No. 2045B(2).  This risk assessment is an 87-page document that has been signed off by the Taoiseach.  Mr. Fraser, in his letter, says that each Department looks after its own risk.  The committee will write back to him because we had asked specifically about the national risk register, which he has given to us, but in his correspondence he refers back to the Department's risk register.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>The Department's Risk Register includes five categories of risks including Reputational Risks described as Risks to the public reputation of the Department, alongside Strategic, Operational, Financial and Legal &amp;amp; Regulatory Risks.  The National Risk Assessment is in place to highlight national risks so for the Department a significant proportion of the risks are in the corporate and operational sphere.</blockquote> <p>The committee will ask Mr. Fraser to give us a note on what I would call a whole-of-Government approach.  When we put the question to him, I thought we would get a  response with the report such as a short observation on the whole-of-Government approach.  He has come back with only the implications relating to his Department.  This is produced by the Taoiseach's Department and signed off by him, but I would ask Mr. Fraser to give an observation from a whole-of-Government approach, to give us a similar overview to that which has highlighted at departmental level on the national risk register.  I assume that he is the most appropriate Secretary General to answer that question.  We will come back to see where that is.  It is as if each Department has its own risk register, and this report is a compilation, but this committee always likes to see a whole-of-Government approach.  That is what we are about.  We will ask for that and will await a response on it.  It is not an extensive document.</p></speech>

They can be taken up with the respective line Department's committees if there is a risk register for each Department.  That job should be dealt with by the respective sectoral committees from their own points of view.  This correspondence has been produced for the Committee of Public Accounts, and it was overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach, but we would like an overall whole-of-Government comment on that.</p></speech>

The correspondence states:</p><blockquote>The Human Resources Division contacted Mr. Conor Hannaway who was involved in the process, and he has advised that the intervention was an organisation development initiative which resulted in a briefing (set of presentation slides, which were provided to the Committee) which was shared with management and staff to help address the particular situation in 2006 at the Estates Office in Kilmainham. No formal report or minutes was required or prepared as a result of the intervention. </blockquote> <p>While there was a briefing, I do not recall what the presentation in Kilmainham was called.  Mr. Mitchell has given us the best information he has.  He has said that there was no formal report, minutes or documents from that presentation.  We will note and publish this.  If anyone here would like to take it up directly, he or she is free to do so.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 2047 from Mr. David Feeney, chief operations officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provides information requested by the committee on Project Ireland 2040.  This correspondence was noted and published at the last meeting but it was not in time for our normal correspondence list.  We had it at the previous meeting.  We are formally noting and publishing it now.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 2050 from Ms Rosalind Carroll, director at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is on the single public service pension scheme.  This is a follow-up letter.  Members will be pleased to know that when the committee does its periodic report, if staff see there is a gap in the information we have not been provided with, they go back to get an update.  This correspondence deals with the single public service pension scheme and the cost to the RTB.  The committee dealt with those issues specifically in our report and we had a chart on it.  That was fully dealt with in the report we published two weeks ago.  This will be noted and published.</p><p>No. 2051 is from Dr. Mary Lee Rhodes, head of regulation with the interim regulatory committee at the Housing Agency.  This regulation office is a voluntary body - not statutory - that is not established yet.  The correspondence covers the overall staffing levels in approved housing bodies, AHBs, including the numbers of staff dealing with housing and accommodation and those providing support services; details regarding how many of the 260 AHBs who have signed up to the voluntary code have ensured their financial statements are published and audited within nine months of year end; and the number of AHBs that do not meet the Companies Registration Office requirement for the publication of accounts.</p><p>We will discuss the next correspondence with this because it is on the same issue.  No. 2052 from Dr. Donal McManus, chief executive officer with the Irish Council for Social Housing, provides details regarding security of tenure for clients in AHBs, including life tenure and any reduction in tenure in properties acquired under the NAMA scheme; overall staffing levels; details on the payment and availability scheme; information on local property tax paid by AHBs, paid at the minimum rate of &euro;90 or thereabouts, which is the first step on the ladder; and a note on the number of new builds delivered by the sector.  There are a few points here.  We had the Irish Council for Social Housing before the committee because we are dealing with housing.  We have had three meetings on the housing issue and we will bring it to a conclusion soon.  With regard to the staffing numbers in AHBs, I am having trouble reconciling the two letters, one of which is from the regulatory office stating there are 10,067 staff and the other stating 1,236 staff are employed directly in the provision of housing.  This implies that the other staff are either involved in administration or in providing care and support services for people in that area.</p><p>The letter from the Irish Council for Social Housing, if I am reading it right, suggests that the overall number of staff is 4,600 and the number of volunteers is 5,922.  I am just not sure how these two letters gel.</p></speech>

I have exactly the same conundrum as the Deputy.  I am trying to figure out what they would be doing and what their function would be.  Most approved housing bodies, as far as I am aware, allocate houses.  There would be a degree of administration but I am not aware that there are care services provided in most cases.  I cannot figure out where they would have a requirement for 10,000 people.  How does that end up being factored into the cost of that housing?</p></speech>

That is the letter from the regulation office and the Irish Council for Social Housing gives a staff figure of 4,600 and mentions almost 6,000 volunteers.  Maybe the other letter should have referred to staffing, including volunteers.  I do not know.  It is not clear so we need clarification from both bodies.  I do not follow the two letters.  They seem to be saying different things.  It is amazing if there are 10,000 employees involved in the sector.  We need to know how many houses are under the control of approved housing bodies.  We are going to ask the Department for the housing stock of all the local authorities.</p></speech>

In that same paragraph, just before the chart, it is stated that the Irish Council for Social Housing does not have a breakdown available of the split between staff engaged in housing functions and those engaged in care and support services.  They should have that.  It is a big area.  We are dealing with a housing crisis and the approved housing bodies, which are the ones dealing with a lot of the housing nowadays, cannot even give us this breakdown.  It is a basic bit of information.  I think we will also have to write to the Secretary General.  He is ultimately the person who is handing out all this money on taxpayers' behalf.  We should ask him to respond to these two letters as well.</p></speech>

It was always my understanding that people had security of tenure for life, subject to complying with the tenancy agreement, and that there was no difference between being housed under a voluntary body and a local authority except that tenants could never buy the house outright.  That is what I understood.  Over the last few years, I have seen voluntary bodies acquire housing and it is not clear what security of tenure the tenants have.  It is not clear whether they are on four, five or ten year leases.  That is what I was asking.  What the ICSH has done in reply is quote the legislation back to us referring to Part 4 tenancies and so on.  It was very kind of it to clarify the RTB and the legislation.  However, what I asked was what security of tenure is in place in those almost 30,000 units.  Are they offering life tenure or five-year leases?  My question applies particularly to the last few years when accommodation was acquired from NAMA and so on.  It is an important question.</p></speech>

We are also going to write to the Department and will include all these items of correspondence.  We want the Department to respond to the issues in these two letters and the issues we are raising.  It is all well and good getting something from a voluntary regulatory office.  It is fine getting something from the Irish Council of Social Housing.  However, we need something from the Department on this.</p></speech>

There have been figures bandied about and disputed, on which we got some clarification only in the last few weeks.  It is primarily going to be a factual report so that we can also look at it from the point of view of value for money.  In simple terms, that is what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#D04400"><p>We probably will not be able to do a report on leasing versus ownership because that is a long-term thing and we have not done enough.  However, there are lots of things such as the HAP and various other matters that we have covered in our three meetings.  When we get these clarifications, we will be able to do a report on the areas we have covered, exactly as the Deputy has said.  There are other issues in housing for other people to address.  In respect of what we have done, we have enough information gathered or in the process of being assembled for us to do a project ourselves directly in the very near future.  I said to the secretariat before the meeting started that there are two issues.</p><p>I am just throwing that out; I am not asking for members' views.  There are two issues which are more time sensitive rather than waiting for a periodic report.  The first one is the broadband issue.  There is no point in the matter being concluded and this committee issuing a report two months later.  The second is housing on which I believe we have most of our work assembled as far as we are going with that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's audit this year might throw up something else which we will come back to on another day but we might bring those two issues together.  I am just asking members to think about it and we will decide on it the next day.  I believe there are two issues.  We have had three or four meetings on housing and at least three meetings on broadband.  They are the two bigger projects that we have and I believe we should work on producing a report just covering those two items as soon as possible.  It is advance work.  It will not be in our next periodic report.  There seems to be a general logic in that approach so we will follow up on this one and come back to that.  I thank the members.  We understand what is required.  The Department has to come in on all of this as well because we will be issuing a report as soon as we get all our information back.</p><p> The next item is No. 2053B from Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 12 March 2019, providing information requested by the committee as follows: a copy of the capital works management framework; a note on the required delivery timeline for the national paediatric hospital; and a copy of the minutes and attendance list for the meeting of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction when the request for a derogation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the standard forms of contracts was considered and agreed.  We will note and publish that.</p><p> There is a second item of correspondence relative to that on the list which I will skip down to.  It is No. 2075B, which we will put on the screen, from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, specifically on the children's hospital.  It is dated 25 March 2019 regarding our invitation for a second meeting.  It states that given that the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report will not be discussed by the board until 1 May, it has asked that the meeting be scheduled after that.  I want to look at the correspondence.  There is quite a time gap in respect of No. 2075B.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board states that PwC is currently targeting to complete its review on 5 April and the report will then be issued to the HSE, which commissioned the report, and not to the hospital board, and other relevant stakeholders for consideration.  The board will not have its subsequent board meeting until 1 May so it is suggesting that it would be premature to come in on 18 April, which we accept.  We will not have had an opportunity to discuss it.  I will call Deputy Cullinane on that shortly.  It is asking us to agree an alternative date after it has had an opportunity to consider the report.  No. 2075B states that the board would like to invite members of the committee to visit the construction site of the new children's hospital to hear more about the project and view the work to date.  They kindly ask that we would progress this invite with the members, and it suggests some date, one of which is this week.  I will ask members for their views on that.  Deputy Cullinane has commented on that.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy O'Brien because it is the HSE which commissioned the report.  We will put it on notice that we request that as well.  We will come back to the other issue about the capital works management framework and the Government contracts committee at that meeting.  We will hold over all the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board correspondence to that meeting.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2054B from Ms Geraldine Larkin, chief executive officer, National Standards Authority of Ireland, again relating to the single public service pension scheme.  The NSAI had a potential liability of &euro;395,375 for the years 2013-2018 but we covered that topic in our interim report.  We will just note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2058B<b></b>from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing information on a number of matters related to the national broadband plan and the metropolitan area networks.  We will note and publish that and discuss it in our meeting with Mr. Griffin after this session.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2059B from the chief executive of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, which again is in connection with the single public service pension scheme.  That topic was covered in our periodic report, which we published recently.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2060B from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 13 March 2019, providing information requested by the committee for a bi-monthly update from the Tax Appeals Commission regarding 17 high value appeals.  We will note and publish that but I want to remark that some very big cases are concluded and we intend to ask about them, without identifying any of the people involved.  In one case the quantum of the appeal was &euro;138 million.  These are the biggest ones.  It is to be reviewed at the end of the second quarter but there is a case for &euro;119 million, which is an appeal against a refusal of a corporation tax deduction in the cumulative amount of &euro;120 million.  That case was closed in January 2019.  If that case is closed, we want information on the agreed figure, the amount for the taxpayer, if it has been paid since or had it been paid in advance.  There was another case for &euro;103 million against a refusal of a corporation tax deduction.  That case was closed very recently, in February 2019.  There was another case of &euro;68 million which was an appeal against refusal of a corporation tax deduction.  That was also closed last month.  There are cases relating to corporation tax deductions worth &euro;370 million that were closed in recent weeks.  We want a report on the outcome of those cases.  The taxpayer need not be identified but we want to know the final agreed figure, if it has been paid and, if not, when it will be paid.</p><p>Most of the other cases are scheduled for hearing.  There was another case of &euro;23 million relating to corporation tax, which was closed in October.  Another one of &euro;19 million was also closed in October.  Another case of &euro;10 million was closed in October.  It is the same issue.  We will ask for an update on the financial issue of all the closed cases in terms of the outcome of those cases and the payment to the taxpayer.  It is a great schedule.  We will ask the Tax Appeals Commission to continue to provide us with a list of the top ten current cases from now on.  A good few have gone off the list.  We want to make it a manageable list from our point of view.</p><p>There was another case, an income tax appeal, involving a sum of &euro;19 million, that was closed in January.  A number of cases have been settled in recent weeks to a figure of as much as &euro;400 million and we would like to know the outcome for the taxpayer in each of them.  We will change our format.  We will ask the Tax Appeals Commissioner to give us every two months the top ten cases in terms of the quantum of money involved and indicate how they are progressing.  That will help us to make sure there is a resolution of these matters.  There were appeal cases, in respect of which the quantum of money involved was &euro;1.6 billion.  I know that the amount of tax to be paid was probably about &euro;1.1 billion.  It is in our interests to make sure tax due to the State is collected as speedily and efficiently as possible.

It explains that the Bill "provides for a replacement of the Court Poor Box by the establishment of a statutory Reparation Fund.  These funds will be allocated to ... victims of crime and for compensation payments payable by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  The reparation fund ... will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General".  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General aware of this?</p></speech>

At least the position is being regularised, which is probably the key point because the practice varies in the District Court throughout the country.  We understand the money in the poor box is accounted for through the Courts Service, but there may still be a gap.  We will ask the Minister to clarify what is meant by the phrase "the replacement of the Court Poor Box by the establishment of a statutory Reparation Fund".  We also want to clarify what is meant when a judge says in the District Court that someone must pay so much into the Garda Benevolent Fund or to the local homeless charity.  That money does not go into the poor box.</p></speech>

The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has produced a report on the governance of intellectual property, which we welcome.  It is a national overview and a review of policy.  We also received a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which was published and we discussed with Professor Donnelly.  It looked specifically at the company FeedHenry and its disposal only.  That was one part of the issue at Waterford Instituted of Technology.  We then received a separate report from the HEA, which cannot be published for the reasons we were given in correspondence received from the Department and the HEA.  The difficulty is I received correspondence from a number of individuals who were part of that process.  They are very upset at the letter sent by the HEA, which is very similar to the letter we received.  Essentially, the HEA states we cannot publish the report for legal reasons, that it has carried out a global review of intellectual property, that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report also looked at the issue and that that is the end of the matter.  The problem is that the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at it very narrowly in the sense that he looked at one specific issue.  The HEA's report looked at the issue more broadly and raised a number of issues.  The former head of the HEA has confirmed to us that it raised substantial issues.  Simply, it seems that the HEA did not have the power to produce the type of report that it did produce.  Essentially, we are being asked to forget about it as if it never happened and simply accept that the national review of policy and the Comptroller and Auditor's report which looked at one narrow element are sufficient.  I do not believe they are sufficient and that it is fair to all those who took part in the process, especially those who have concerns who I imagine might also write to the committee about the issue.  </p><p>Essentially, the letter from the Department states there are a number of questions that it has put to the board, which is fair enough.  However, the questions arise from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report only.  As i said, that report is very narrow.  Again, the Department seems to be stating that is at what we are looking.  We are looking at it through the prism of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, not the wider examination of the issues involved undertaken by the HEA.  That concerns me.  The Department can do that in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  My concerns are that there was a substantial report produced over the course of many months, for which a lot of people were consulted, including in the institute who were also defending their positions.  A comprehensive report was compiled.  At no time in our hearings or discussions were allegations made of wrongdoing by individuals.  Again, the report looked at the process.  It seems, both from the HEA's letter and that of the Department, that they think it is sufficient that the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a report and that we can now move on.  </p><p>I welcome the response from Professor Donnelly because it is good that an Accounting Officer takes an interest in the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, but there is a lot of correcting what Members said and statements made.  I am concerned about that memo we sought to have released has been redacted.  The response from the Accounting Officer is as follows: </p><blockquote>With regard to the &quot;Memo&quot;, as outlined in our letter dated 20<sup>th</sup>February 2019, we reiterate that the Institute has received legal challenges to the release of the Memo.  Subsequent to our previous letter, a third person, who is a current WIT employee, also challenged the release of the Memo on the same basis and also on the basis that the Institute has a duty of care to them.  As the Institute is duty-bound to protect itself against legal and financial exposure, and as it is of the opinion that providing even a redacted copy of the Memo would not provide such protection, we must respectfully decline to provide a copy of said Memo. </blockquote> <p>I find it extraordinary that even a redacted version cannot be given to us.  I am not saying the institute has not received legal advice, but it is a memo that was cited in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Interestingly, the Accounting Officer has no difficulty in referencing the memo and, in fact, corrected the committee in its interpretation of the memo.  However, we cannot be given a copy of it to adjudicate for ourselves and decide what the issues are.</p><p>I have a concern about page 2 of the Accounting Officer's letter where he takes exception to one of the members who had raised concerns about the memo.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General quickly remind us what the memo was and what the observations in his report were on that memo?</p></speech>

The Accounting Officer states:</p><blockquote>It was also stated: &quot;... somebody in the research office had written to Professor Donnelly, who was the vice president, raising concerns about the process and asking that the memorandum be circulated higher up.

The January document was not given to anybody else that we know of.  It was a different document but the different document was never produced to us.</p></speech>

It is a memo that is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We have sought a redacted version, which I imagine would block out the names of the individuals, and they are saying that they still cannot give us this memo, yet they can still cite the memo in a lengthy letter taking the Committee of Public Accounts to task.  In fact, it is inaccurate in terms of taking us to task on it and also then asking us to remove it, which I would have no problem with if there was inaccurate information that we had published.  We should do so in that case.  We have done good work on this and I commend the institute on accepting the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  My broader point is that the bigger issue is that through our work we have ensured that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, did a more global review of intellectual property and we have come a long way on this.  However, I have a concern about a HEA report which was done very comprehensively and cannot be published for legal reasons so then we just park it.  I have a real concern about that because it examined issues beyond FeedHenry.  The problem is that we will never know what those issues were and these are people on opposing sides with different views of the process and different interpretations of how the process worked.  Professor Donnelly was very clear in making that point as well.  It was the case that 50 people or more took part in the process, some of whom would have been management, some of whom would have been researchers and staff and there were different opinions but the point is that an independent process heard from all sides and then produced a report that outlined the facts and all we want are the facts and yet it seems now that we will not get them.</p></speech>

If the HEA cannot do the report, what was discussed at the last meeting with the Department, when it was in with the HEA, was that it can appoint a statutory inspector to do the exact same work that the author of the HEA report, which cannot now be published, carried out.  We have to make a decision as a committee whether we are satisfied or content with leaving the process go and saying that it cannot be published for legal reasons.  That is fair enough and we accept that if they stepped outside their remit but the issues have not changed.  That is the point.  None of the concerns and the issues that have been raised by individuals or by those who have a different interpretation of what was raised will be tested or independently examined if it is just left as the Department and the HEA seem to be advocating.</p></speech>

It has to be specifically for a purpose.  We looked at the document.  It was relevant to the examination of the development and the disposal of the interest in FeedHenry because in 2009, Aceno Mobile Services was a shareholder in FeedHenry but it ceased to be a shareholder at some point in late 2008 or early 2009.  That was why it was relevant to us to look at it but it was looking at a broader relationship between the company and the institute of technology.  I had set a scope for the examination, which was to look at the development and disposal of FeedHenry, so it was not appropriate for me to throw a wider net just as it happened.  I would have had to commence a whole separate piece of work on it.  We looked at the memo and the issues that were raised and we identified what we felt were the risks that the memo spoke to about the relationship between an institute of technology and a campus company and we examined those issues in relation to FeedHenry in chapter 4 of the examination.  I formed no definitive view on the relationship between Aceno Mobile Services and the institute of technology.  That is a matter that is dealt with in the memo and, as the Deputy said, there are different views to be taken into account on that.  Different interests might take different views on that but that is where the matter rests.</p><p>I needed to complete the work on FeedHenry and I have done that.  Whether there is a case for further examination might be judged when the institute comes back to the Department on the questions about how the system deals with the matters going forward.</p></speech>

This raises questions beyond WIT.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General cited a memo which we looked for but which we were told we could not get for legal reasons, even in a redacted form.  I do not know what the legal basis is for why we cannot get the document.  It was said that legal advice was taken but the memo was shared by people who worked in the institute.</p></speech>

Somebody was concerned and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General analysed it in a limited way.  The president said he would do the same tomorrow but that is where we come in.  When risks are brought to someone's attention there is an extra burden on that person but he is clearly saying that he dealt with this in the right way.</p></speech>

It may be possible for the legal team to give us a synopsis of the memo, if not the memo itself, redacted or otherwise.  If somebody could give us the key facts of the memo we could be satisfied that we had its content.  There has to be a halfway house for this.  I accept that some people do not want to be named and the college has to protect itself if there is a legal challenge.  It is the content that is important, not the individuals.  Is there a halfway house in which the Committee of Public Accounts and the college could be happy?</p></speech>

While I propose publishing the letter and lease agreement enclosed, I do not propose that we publish the communication in relation to the property leases as it includes details of names of individual staff, phone numbers etc.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2071 is from Mr. Kevin McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Rural and Community Development, and provides information requested by the committee on the My Open Library service, which is a staffless library.  He says there will be no reduction in staff and an improvement to services.  It is an issue in several local authorities.  We will note and publish this item and members are free to follow it up themselves.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2073 is from Dr. Deirdre Keyes, chief executive of Kildare and Wicklow ETB, providing a response to information requested by the committee including notes on: independent valuations; meetings of the board held in hotels; leasing of property by KWETB that was previously owned by it; and details of the rent-free period for Bray Civic Centre.  Dr. Keyes also refers to a review of all KWETB leases and the difficulties collating the documentation.  We will note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The matter does not fall within the remit of the committee.  Can we note the item?

The individual is seeking an update.  It is good to see that our reports are being examined carefully by members of the public.  I propose we forward the queries to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a response.  We will note that item and look forward to receiving a response.</p> <p>  No. 2042 is a note prepared by the liaison officer on non-competitive procurement.  We will note that and deal with it as part of our next periodic report.</p> <p>  No. 2043, dated 6 March, is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer, CEO, of Nursing Homes Ireland, and requests that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General provide an update to the committee regarding its proposed report relating to an examination of the nursing home support scheme.

We will take it on board as part of our meeting with the Department on broadband.  We will publish it because representatives of Enet appeared before the committee and this is a follow-on from that public meeting.</p> <p>  No. 2049 is from Mr. John O'Dwyer, head of regulation at BT Ireland, and provides information requested by the committee in regard to the Analysys Mason report, outlining recommendations.  It was discussed at a meeting of the committee and we will take the correspondence on board as part of our forthcoming discussion.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It is a follow-on from a previous public meeting of the committee.</p> <p>  No. 2055, dated 5 March, is from an individual and is in regard to a proposed new Garda station in Schull.  The individual alleges that &euro;300,000 of repairs was carried out on a building that was less than one year old and that the original contractor may not have been held to account.  I propose that we write to the Office of Public Works for a note on the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2056, dated 6 March, is from an individual who has a concern that nurses at KDoc, Kildare and west Wicklow, are being paid in excess of agreed pay scales.  I do not think that KDoc falls under the remit of the committee.  These GP practice groups do not fall under our remit.  The individual states that nurses at the group are being paid in excess of agreed pay scales.  If they were being paid less than agreed pay scales, I would be very worried.  Mr. McCarthy has not dealt with the funding of out-of-hours GP practice groups.</p></speech>

From that point of view, it is an entirely voluntary process by groups of GPs in a region.  Some GPs are involved and others choose not to be.  It is a matter for them.  We will forward the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Health.  It is a matter for that committee.  It is a voluntary affair and does not involve public funds.  We will forward the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Health for any action it considers appropriate.  I do not wish to ignore the correspondence but it would be very much stretching our brief to address it.</p> <p>  The next item is from Mr. Sean Bolger, the CEO and chairman of Imagine Communications Group, and provides information regarding 5G.  It will be considered as part of our proceedings today.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2070 is from an individual and relates to the operation of the Irish election observation roster and a response received from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The individual believes that the selection process was flawed.  The individual was not granted a place on the roster and has taken an appeal to the High Court.  The committee previously dealt with matters involving another individual in respect of this matter and decided that we would not pursue it any further.  I propose that we note the matter.  We should not become involved, particularly if a case has been taken to the High Court.</p></speech>

It is not off our desk completely in that regard.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  We will move through this relatively quickly.  I want to get these issues dealt with because if they are not, there will be a build-up for next week, the following week and every other week.  The statements and accounts are before the committee.  There is nothing major therein for discussion, apart from one unusual item.  The first item is the National Library of Ireland, which has been given a clear audit opinion.  The Royal Irish Academy of Music has also been given a clear audit opinion, as has the Cork Institute of Technology.  Sligo Institute of Technology has been given a clear audit opinion but attention is again drawn to a severance payment which we dealt with in our most recent report.</p></speech>

This is occurring across the board.  It is being highlighted by ETBs. The need for internal audit has been recognised in that sector.</p> <p>  The next item is the Educational Research Centre, which receives a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to the recognition of deferred pensions.  It is a new organisation in its second year of existence.  It has not yet formally adopted a code of practice of governance and the board did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of internal systems of internal control.  We will note that.</p></speech>

There is no turnover.  It is a fund established a number of years ago to receive donations from long-stay patients or their estates arising out of the overpayment of charges.</p> <p>  The next item is a special account established for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act.  There is no turnover and a clear audit opinion.  The Environmental Protection Agency received a clear audit opinion.  It is on the work programme of the committee.</p> <p>  The HSE received a clear audit opinion, apart from the inadequate monitoring of grants and the issue of the surplus on capital income and expenditure account brought forward.  We examined the financial statements for 2017 last year.  For some reason, the HSE was late in lodging them with the Oireachtas but the committee has already examined them.</p> <p>  The next item is the University of Limerick, which received a clear audit opinion.  The Economic and Social Research Institute also received a clear audit opinion.  The HSE patient and private property accounts, clear audit opinion.  The HSE disclosed some inadequate controls of private property accounts in 2017, which was dealt with by the committee as part of our discussion of the 2017 accounts with the HSE.</p></speech>

A deferred pension issue again arises.  Dundalk Institute of Technology has also been given a clear audit opinion.  Again, however, internal control is an issue.</p><p>At least with the ETBs, we have gone from a situation where they were not producing accounts to a situation where they are now producing accounts.  We now know they have an internal audit function.  We are getting there with them.  That is all I will say.</p></speech>

When people from Dundalk were in here, their significant problems were well aired and discussed.  At the same time, we should note that they are coming through with a clear audit opinion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to certain aspects of that.  They have gone through a period of considerable change at their campus.  That is to be welcomed as well.</p></speech>

It was bad planning by the Government to set up organisations.  I have seen three or four cases.  We might have to deal with that.  Three years after they passed the legislation, they did not know which public bodies should be included under the public service pension scheme.  Where were they going?  There was a lack of planning when they drafted the legislation.</p></speech>

We can see where there was a lack of thought or planning in some of the amalgamations and things like that.  We are seeing where computer systems might not be compatible and that kind of stuff.

There were approximately 30 old bodies - I am not sure how many of them there were - and each of them had a different accounting system.  All of this was foreseeable.</p></speech>

In the case of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which specifies and monitors standards for the delivery of pre-hospital treatment, there was a clear audit opinion.

In the case of Sport Ireland, there was a clear audit opinion.  Other people are dealing with that organisation at the moment.  In the case of the Loughs Agency, there was a clear audit opinion.  In the case of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, there was a clear audit opinion.  Like all health bodies, it has its own accounting standards when it comes to superannuation.  In the case of Louth-Meath ETB, there was a clear audit opinion, although there was some non-compliant expenditure and the internal audit function was raised again.  We will move on.  The point about learning lessons in advance is the most important issue we have covered there.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  We will be very brief with the work programme now.  One or two changes have had to be made since we were last here, solely for logistical reasons.  Next week, representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality will be back to deal with the Vote of that Department.  There might be outstanding questions from the previous meeting.  On 11 April, we will be joined by representatives of the Central Statistics Office and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I assume that means the Comptroller and Auditor General's Accounting Officer will be here instead of the Comptroller and Auditor General that day.</p></speech>

It had been scheduled that the paediatric board would be here that day, but we did not want to do that.  We felt that we could slot in these two groups at relatively short notice.  The Central Statistics Office was meant to come here at an earlier date.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had already been provisionally mentioned.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be here the following week.  Then there will be two non-sitting weeks.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be back on 9 May.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report on the report and accounts to the public service on the management of overtime expenditure in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On 16 May, representatives of the paediatric hospital board will be here as part of their financial statements.  The Courts Service will be here on 23 May.  On 30 May, officials from the Department of Finance will be here.  A lot of Votes come under that Department.  On 13 June, we will consider the appropriation accounts of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We have said that we will deal with the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer.  There might be a little variation in our plans for some of the dates that are a little further way.</p></speech>

I said I felt we needed a substantial hearing with them to cover a lot of issues, including the surveillance issue.  The Chairman will recall one particular answer they gave.  They confirmed that private companies were procured for surveillance, but they were not in a position to state whether they were surveilling staff.  I felt that was an unreasonable response given that there is documentation in circulation that seems to prove, or certainly to strongly suggest, that such surveillance was taking place.  The answers to do with the mess committees, tuck shops, cash, money and a load of things certainly require more work.  I would certainly like to have them in.</p></speech>

I imagine that members would like to revisit some issues relating to the Prison Service.  I am certainly not comfortable with the mess committees.  I have been wrongly accused, externally, by the Prison Officers Association, of being interested in closing down the mess committees.  That is not the issue at all, but the concern is that they are functioning correctly with regard to cash management, oversight and auditing.  I am not happy that they are.  I believe there are also issues with the tuck shop and general governance of certain issues within prisons, and the level of knowledge that might pass between individual prisons and management in Longford.  I am not certain that the appropriate level of communication and oversight is taking place.</p></speech>

I have no idea of the answer to one point that Deputy MacSharry raises.  I would like to know how many of the senior management of the Prison Service in Longford have been governors or assistant governors.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there are senior garda&iacute; at the most senior level as well as civilians.  Do we have several governors and people who know how to run prisons, none of whom is at a senior level in the organisation?  Is it effectively a Civil Service approach at a national level from people who may not have any knowledge of what is involved in running a prison?  How many of the senior management have been directly involved in the prisons?  It would be helpful to know.  There should be a mix of people in the headquarters who have direct experience at senior levels on management committees in prisons, as well as maybe those who are not former governors or assistant governors.  I think Deputy MacSharry's suggestion that we come back to that separately is probably the best approach.  We raised one or two issues earlier this morning that we need to follow up too.</p></speech>

Following our previous meeting with the Department, we met the following broadband service providers and representative organisations to inform members of the committee in respect of the topic: BT, Eir, Imagine, Enet and the Regional Internet Service Providers Association.  Members found it to be a useful exercise and this meeting will provide us with an opportunity to discuss the matter in further detail.  I apologise to Mr. Griffin and his colleagues for the late start.  Due to the celebrations for St. Patrick's week, the D&aacute;il did met for a week or two and there was a build-up of correspondence, which took a little longer to process.  We wanted to address that before we began this part of the meeting.</p><p>For context, broadband is an issue under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The topic of the previous meeting was the national children's hospital and we examined the major items of capital expenditure under the Government's capital plan, and broadband is one of the major projects in that regard.  Across the board, rather than just in the case of broadband or the children's hospital, the Committee of Public Accounts is examining the processes, procedures, governance and procurement in place in respect of such projects.  We have not been impressed to date but that is a matter for another day.  The committee has decided that, following our earlier meeting with the broadband provider and today's meeting, we will issue a report on broadband and housing, on which we have held a few meetings, as soon as practicable rather than waiting to include them in our periodic report, which is some months away.  As a result of today's meeting, we ask that witnesses revert with any information requested as soon as practicable because we want to complete our involvement in the project as soon as possible.</p><p>From the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we are joined by Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, Ms Finola Rossi, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, Mr. Patrick Neary and Ms Orla Ryan.  We are also joined by Mr. Brendan Ellison from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off or switched to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent mode can nonetheless interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions under Standing Orders to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I understand that Mr. Griffin's opening statement will be short as it follows on from our previous meetings.  I invite him to make it now.</p></speech>

The benefit of the meeting is that it will give the committee the opportunity to follow up on some of the matters we discussed on 6 December and the detailed presentation it had from the telecommunications companies on 14 February, which we have studied.  In addition to the colleagues the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Ms Catherine McGinty, Ms Ciara Kennedy and Mr. Bernie Kiely.  We will deal with the national broadband plan, NBP, and I understand that there may be some follow-up questions on the metropolitan area networks, MANs, which we will be in a position to address.</p> <p>  As the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, the national broadband plan is a key Government commitment and a core component of Project Ireland 2040.  The State intervention under the NBP takes place against the backdrop of significant and rampant transformation of technology and digitalisation, which, in turn, is driving exponential growth in the demand for high-quality, reliable high-speed broadband.  Continued commercial investment, in parallel with the progression of the State&rsquo;s intervention, is important and the recent announcements by industry are welcomed.</p> <p>  Given the pace of developments, it is clear that the NBP network needs to be future proofed and capable of meeting increasing data demands, supporting new ways of working and new technologies.  In relation to data demand, it is notable that in quarter 4 of 2018, an average fixed broadband subscriber used 170 GB of data per month, which was a 17% increase on the same quarter in 2017 and more than double the volume of data used when compared with quarter 4 of 2015, when the procurement process for the NBP was commenced, which illustrates the exponential growth in data.  I did not include in my written statement one point that is notable when looking back over time, namely, that the last big State intervention we undertook, the national broadband scheme, was in 2008.  The maximum download speed under that scheme was 2.3 Mbps.  The state aid guidelines under which we ran the procurement process had a minimum download speed of 30 Mbps.  As we have indicated in the briefing note we sent to the committee, the Commission subsequently updated its outlook in relation to the future technology needs at an EU level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#M00800"><p>The European Commission.  It updated its perspective on what the future infrastructure requirements should be and stated that by 2025, the infrastructure should be capable of providing a download speed of 100 Mbps, while for schools, businesses and transport hubs, it should be capable of a download speed of 1 GB/s, which is a significant change, even over the past two years.</p> <p>  With the NBP, we are trying to provide the foundation for Ireland to meet Europe's 2025 targets for the creation of a gigabit society.  Widespread access to such connectivity, underpinned by a scalable, responsive and reliable digital infrastructure, is fundamental to maintaining and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness at this critical juncture, and will allow all citizens to embrace digital transformation to innovate, be creative and thrive, resulting in sustainable economic growth and positive social dividends.</p> <p>  Since I last appeared before the committee on 6 December, my Department has continued with the assessment of the final tender, and the Minister updated the Oireachtas on that yesterday.  That process is now reaching a conclusion and, as the Minister has indicated, he intends to bring a recommendation to the Government shortly.  The technology solution proposed by the bidder is predominantly fibre to the premises, FTTP, which is the same technology being rolled out by commercial companies in urban areas.</p><p>While the procurement did not specify the technology to be used, all three bidders proposed similar FTTP solutions.  As a result of the choice of fibre technology, the basic NBP wholesale entry product will be 150 Mbps download speed, with speeds of up to 1 GB available to businesses.  The FTTP solution ensures additional capacity can be added over time to meet future needs at low incremental cost.  The bid involves maximising reuse of existing pole and duct infrastructure across the country.  A wireless solution will likely be used for a small percentage of premises which are the most remote and difficult to reach.</p><p> The State-owned MANs infrastructure continue to play an important role in the regional telecommunications market.  The creation of the MANs as an exclusive fibre network facilitates service providers, large and small, in responding to the ongoing growth in demand for bandwidth capacity.  Some 70 service operators are using the MANs infrastructure in connection with the provision of fixed and mobile broadband services to over 1 million citizens and business customers, which include domestic fixed and mobile customers, State entities, educational institutions, SMEs, industrial estates and multinationals.  The MANs are an important element of the intervention area solution.</p><p> I am accompanied by officials who are experts on the technology issues, have been involved in the procurement process and understand the evolution of the project in recent years.  I will be deferring to some of them during the course of the meeting.  Rather than me acting as the voice for some of the expertise around the table, I believe the committee will get more value from these experts.  Looking back on the meeting of 14 February, there were issues around technology such as would 4G or 5G suffice.  We will share the workload to the extent we can.</p></speech>

I do not want to implicate any of my colleagues and I am not on the interview board.</p> <p>  At our meeting with service providers and representative organisations, BT suggested that it had first become aware of the fact that the MANs were prepared to be extended to the 2030 date from Parliamentary Questions Nos. 604 and 607 of 23 May 2017.  It highlighted that there was a process and that the Minister was considering extending it.  On the basis of that, BT wrote to express its interest in participating in that process and to formally register its interest as a bidder.  In correspondence, Mr. Brendan Whelan, a principal officer, wrote back on 4 August - the original letter was dated 15 June and the parliamentary questions were tabled in May - stating that it had effectively already extended this, that it was within its rights to extend it and that it was a case of "Thanks anyway".  BT further wrote back indicating that it was very disappointed with this and that it might have to go to the European Commission with some of its concerns on the matter.</p> <p>  Was there a parliamentary question from which BT could reasonably have been led to believe that a process was going to commence in which it could register its interest as a bidder?  As it alleged that the decision had already been made at the date of the response being given to the parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il, it would not seem transparent if the Minister was going to commence a process, or consider a process, when at that time the extension had already been granted.  That is the implication of the correspondence from Mr. Brendan Whelan on the Department&rsquo;s side and from Mr. John O&rsquo;Dwyer on the BT side.</p></speech>

If I look at the parliamentary question, to which the Deputy referred, there is a line in it which states, "I recently finalised decisions relating to the management of the MANs to provide that the current concession agreements co-terminate in 2030, in line with the relevant contractual provisions."  Effectively, the Minister stated that the decision had been taken to extend, as was provided for in the concession agreement.  As the Deputy knows, the concession agreement provided for an initial term of 15 years, extendable by a further ten years in the case of both lots of MANs, one which was commissioned in 2004 and the second which was commissioned in 2009.  Effectively, the termination date for the first was 2020 and the second was 2024.</p> <p>  We carried out a review and, as the Deputy will have heard me say back in December, the conclusion was that it was preferable for the State for a number of reasons that it would extend rather than retender.  That review was based on our internal analysis and it was supplemented by a report we commissioned from Norcontel which further reinforced the preliminary view to which we had come.</p> <p>  There was a consultation earlier in regard to how effective the MANs were, whether it was delivering services in rural Ireland in the manner which had been hoped and whether it was achieving the objectives in terms of providing service to the 70 or so service operators which use the MANs.  We consulted with several parties.  We did not consult the 70 or so but we consulted BT as part of that consultation process.  The view back from the process was that the MANs were performing, that they were working well as a concession agreement and that the State should not sell them, one of the options put on the table.</p> <p>  We had gone through an extensive process to consider the provision in the concession agreement which was whether to extend by a further ten years as provided for.  In the interests of transparency, it probably would have been preferable if at the time we had issued a press release to say we had done this.  The individual service operators would have understood it by virtue of their interaction with MANs as the concessionaire.  On reflection, it probably would have been preferable if, in May 2017 or a little bit earlier when we had concluded the decision-making process, we had issued a press release.  There was no good reason we did not do so but, on reflection, it would have been a sensible thing to do at that time to bring clarity to the wider stakeholder group.</p></speech>

It would have had a very good understanding of the market and would have looked at market conditions in detail.  It would have looked at the state of evolution of the fibre market at that time.  It would have looked at developments in the private sector and a range of other things that were on the telecoms landscape in Ireland at that time, and it would have factored that into its analysis.  Indirectly, therefore, we consulted the market.  We consulted earlier on its perspective on the MANs as a piece of State infrastructure.</p></speech>

All right.  The BT letter to us states:</p><blockquote>A key point we would like to make not addressed in the Analysys Mason report is that the European Commission State Aid Approval precluded the MSE (Managed Service Entity running the MANSs) from being owned or controlled by an authorised electronic communications operator.  This approach was adopted so that the provider of the MANs had the function of infrastructure provider to assist competition in the market rather than to directly compete with the market, which is what has happened.</blockquote></speech>

The decision that was taken in seeking an MSE was that existing operators were precluded from that competition.  The ambition was to get a new operator into the market in Ireland to strengthen competition and introduce more competition into the market.</p> <p>  Any operator or anybody providing electronic communications services in Ireland must be an authorised communications operator and must register with ComReg as such.  The only fair interpretation of this paragraph is that it is a statement that, at the outset of this process when seeking an MSE, the entity that would come forward to be an MSE could not at that time be an operator, but once it became an MSE, it could not operate the MANs without being an operator and it would so register with ComReg.  That is how that should be interpreted and I am not quite sure what BT's analysis around it would be because no entity could operate the MANs without being registered with ComReg.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at the list of MANs, there are some that are more commercial.  I think we have circulated the list previously to the Committee of Public Accounts secretariat.  I have a copy, myself.  The MANs were broken into phase 1 and phase 2.  Phase 1 covers more commercial areas where it was more likely that the MSE would be in a position to commercialise the business on the phase 1 MANs.  The phase 2 MANs, which were a further 60, were in areas that were deemed to be far less commercial.  For example - I will put my hands on the list in a minute - one of the last MANs on the phase 2 list was lit recently and that was in Knock.  It kind of gives the Deputy an idea of the scale of location being dealt with in phase 2.  There was a payment made for phase 2 of &euro;1.2 million per annum.</p></speech>

I cannot comment on the extent to which the deep dive was done on the individual budget lines by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important to say all of this was done by way of public procurement.  We have extended the contracts on one or two occasions in line with public procurement rules but we extended them on the basis of the original rates proposed in 2014.  That is of significant advantage to the Department.</p> <p>  The other important element on which to comment is the extent of internal management within the Department in governing those costs.  Much rigour is applied by colleagues sitting around the table here and by a big team we have in the Department to manage the budget, time sheets, requests for additional work, formal change control procedures and approvals of the quality of work delivered by the various consultancy teams.  I am happy the necessary due diligence within the Department is being done, given the levels of expenditure involved.  All the invoices are carefully scrutinised by the team and we require detailed narrative work to be carried out, including billable hours and all of that.  There is much rigour in place in the Department.</p></speech>

We went through public procurement and although it has been extended, we got legal advice on our authority to do it.  We have particularly put the squeeze on the consultants at each stage and one of the big benefits for us is the level of control we expect in terms of what they will deliver.  We are also working off 2014 rates and if anybody knows the consultancy business, the rates over the past number of years have gone through the roof.  That is helpful.  Nobody likes spending &euro;25 million but it is a big project.</p></speech>

On 27 February, the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that the cost of the national broadband scheme would be "many multiples" of what was originally anticipated.  He indicated, as Mr. Griffin did in his opening statement, that he expected the decision would be made before Easter.  The original indication in 2012 was that &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million would be the spread of anticipated expenditure.  That was to connect 800,000 homes and premises generally.  The Taoiseach has indicated it will be many multiples of those costs and we are now talking about 540,000 homes and premises.  Will Mr. Griffin shed some light on that?</p></speech>

He has been grappling with this at the coalface for the past three years.  The initial cost estimate cited of &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million was for a scheme of much narrower scope.  That scheme was announced in 2014 by the then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and it primarily took in providing fibre backhaul to approximately 1,100 areas, primarily villages, in rural Ireland, with the assumption being that the commercial sector would deal with what we termed the last mile.  That is a loose term as the distance could be much further or less than a mile.  It was a different scope and it was predominantly focused on fibre backhaul to these 1,100 locations.  It did not make provision for connection costs to individual premises.</p> <p>  As our own intervention strategy developed and we did further work on this, and again in consultation with the market, the view was that the scheme was not fit for purpose.  It was felt that a scheme that would provide a connection to individual premises in rural Ireland was absolutely critical.  I will not get into the cost estimates, if the Deputy allows me that latitude, because we are still in the procurement process.  The first cost estimate that was based on a high-level desktop analysis and it was a higher figure than the &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million estimate that was mooted.</p> <p>  There is another aspect and the Deputy might have heard reports from the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the media this morning.  We are talking about a bespoke project.  It is not like a road, where one could say a project would cost &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million per kilometre or a school where we might know the specification is for a particular size or number of classrooms.  This is a project which had no national comparators until Eir did its 300,000 premises, and there were very few international comparators.  As the chairman of the NTA said before a committee yesterday, it would not be able to put a cost on MetroLink until the final design is completed, and we have had the same experience.</p> <p>  We have used the competitive dialogue process as it allows us to engage directly with bidding parties.  It is used where projects are particularly complex and the target solution is not known at the outset.  It allows engagement with these parties' understanding of what the requirements are, as well as their market knowledge and experience of projects both nationally and internationally.  The cost framework has been complicated to an extent by Eir's 300,000 premises taking a chunk of homes from the intervention area but as part of that evolutionary process, our understanding of the likely subsidy levels, the technology, construction and operation costs, demand, revenue projection, risks and so on all evolve.  We are now satisfied that we know the figure.</p><p>We have constantly updated our models.  Will I let the expert who is in the bowels of this-----</p></speech>

During the questioning Mr. Griffin can tease out what he is going to say.  My final question arises from the debacle of the national children's hospital.  Would he be prepared to give a ballpark figure for how many multiples the Taoiseach might have been talking about, notwithstanding that he cannot give us details of the tender or the like?  A ballpark figure to the nearest couple of hundred million of euro might give us an indication.</p> <p>  Second, taking the example of the national children's hospital, there appears to be a crisis in accountability to the extent that even though Mazars did a report we now need another one from PwC to find out whose fault it was that prices went up exponentially.  Where does the buck stop on the NBP?  Let us say, hypothetically, somebody is before the committee two years hence and the programme goes over budget by 70%.  Will a PwC report be required then or is there a structure in place, given what one hopes is the lesson of the national children's hospital, where Mr. Griffin is in absolute control?  Who is the chief executive over this?  In the case of the national children's hospital, it appears that neither the Minister, the chairman of the board, the development board, the HSE or anybody else had an executive role.  Everybody seems to have been non-executive and there was a blurring of the lines of responsibility.  We know the outcome, but we do not know who is responsible.  Does the Department have a structure in place whereby if the wheels come off this project it is Mr. Griffin's, John's, Mary's or the Minister's fault?</p></speech>

We have the leadership role.  There is no secondary entity involved at a level below where we can say it is that entity.

The money will come directly from the Department's Vote.  We have looked at governance arrangements to be put in place after the contract award and we are still at the early stages of that.  The last programme for Government referred to setting up an agency that would pull together the NBP, the MANs, ECAS and perhaps some other State infrastructure of a broadband nature under a single State entity so it could be managed by the right people who have the right commercial skills and can generate maximum value for the State.  All of that will require legislation.  However, as things stand, the responsibility for this project rests with the Department.</p></speech>

As part of that assessment - and the Department is overseeing that work - has the option of not proceeding with the plan been examined and is it one of the options that was contained in the overall assessment that will then go to the Government?

The primary operator is Eir which has a vast number of poles and ducts which are available.  The vast majority of the Eir network in rural Ireland is overhead and carried on poles.  As part of our tender, we have encouraged bidders to use existing infrastructure and it is very likely that any deployment of fibre to homes in rural areas will primarily use the overhead poles for telecommunications infrastructure.</p></speech>

I do not think I am breaching any confidences in saying we are talking here about approximately 14,000 km of duct being used and approximately 1.2 million poles.  That gives one an idea of the scale of the roll-out.  On the maps we circulated with the briefing to the committee, when one looks at the areas we are trying to get to, most if not all are remote and not being served by the commercial sector.  There are no plans to have them served by the commercial sector.  We will reuse very substantial chunks of existing infrastructure and there will be new build by the bidder also.</p></speech>

The rules that apply at both national and EU level require providers of major infrastructure to allow their infrastructure to be used in certain circumstances.  The whole thesis of the national broadband plan intervention area is that we reuse as much as we can.  In some places, that may involve the reuse of ESB infrastructure.  We have approximately 1,000 different deployment areas of approximately 5,000 premises each.  When we get to the low-level design for each area, we will discuss with the contractor what is the most economical way to roll out broadband in that particular area.</p></speech>

I hope I am right in answering the question, but if I am not, I will get others to correct me.  It will not be the first time it has done so.  Under state aid rules, we are obliged to go through a public procurement process, which we did.  Indirectly through SIRO, its joint venture with Vodafone, the ESB was one of the original bidders.  Its focus was primarily on using its own network and it might well have used existing Eir infrastructure.  As such, the ESB was on the pitch.  For reasons it set out publicly at a later stage, it decided to withdraw from the process.  There has been some public commentary in the media and in the Oireachtas about simply assigning this function to a State undertaking.  That cannot be done under state aid or EU procurement rules.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin is right when he says this is a bespoke and unique project.  At the same time, there are very few households in the country that are not connected to the ESB.  From a layman's perspective, it would have made sense, given that it will be difficult to create a new layer of infrastructure, to use the ESB.  Most observers would say the ESB's bid was not a serious one.  That is just an opinion that is offered up by some analysts.  Am I oversimplifying matters by saying that if the vast majority, if not all, homes have access to the ESB, there is obviously infrastructure there which it would have made sense to use to ensure broadband could be rolled out to every home and property in the country?  The difficulty is that we need to get to that position but are now creating a whole new set of infrastructure which is creating problems.  Into the mix also come the 300,000 homes Eir took out of the original plan which has complicated matters even more and potentially rendered the proposition non-viable.  That is why we are down, potentially, to one bidder.</p></speech>

Under EU state aid rules, one cannot simply assign a contract which may involve significant state aid support to a commercial economic undertaking without a procurement process.  We took that step and SIRO withdrew from the process.</p></speech>

As such, there is still nothing going forward under any solution that prevents anybody from using the ESB.  Its door is open as is ours.  Eir is regulated and the ESB Networks company has products, etc., available.  In the context of the understanding that everyone has an ESB connection, most people also have a copper connection from Eircom.  There are two infrastructure networks in place that were traditionally serving very different purposes, namely electricity supply and the old landline phone.  Both infrastructures remain in place.  In June or July 2016, the bidders started on the road of procurement after they qualified.  We have had major engagement with one particular entity since Eircom left.  When we had three bidders in the process, we spent over 800 hours in dialogue with each bid team.  Between July 2016 and September 2017, when SIRO left, the Vodafone and ESB team involved in the bid spent 150 to 200 hours going through how to use the ESB network.  With the Eir bid team, the discussion was on how to use the Eir network.  With the other consortium, it was about whatever network they chose to use.  Obviously, each bidder had a bias towards its own network.</p><p>We learned through all that process whether one could use it, whether it was cost-effective to do so and what represented the best value to the State.  As we know, Eircom's pole network goes along the road and the ESB's network goes across country.</p><p> We can come to this later but the most important thing in any capital project is to find out first how one designs it.  If one chooses a particular design, that will dictate which cable one is going to use to get into the house.  If one goes along the road with the Eircom pole network, and one is going up a laneway to a farm, it may not be possible to use the ESB network, if it is coming in behind the farm.  One just cannot jump from the road over to the field to get onto the ESB network.  It is not quite as simple, technically, as using the ESB connection to the house to do the last mile.  These are the issues about which we have had dialogue to find this out.  There are some homes that have the ESB network going along the road as well, and if during the build - if the current bidder is successful in getting the bid and is building it - it may have the opportunity to get to that farm using the ESB network, if there is not an Eircom pole network there already.  That will be its choice, depending on what is the most cost-effective solution.  All of these issues are on the table at the moment.</p></speech>

It agrees with very few, where they have been implemented.  I refer to a couple of examples.  Number two was that Enet should update its assumptions used in preparing the desktop survey.  It states that it has no visibility of this activity.  Number four states that Enet and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should discuss price changes for dark fibre sub-duct and duct, which will ensure that wholesale customers will not find it more expensive.  It states that it has no visibility on these discussions.  It further states that Enet should make single strands of dark fibre available.  It notes the introduction of this.  Number six states that Enet should document all its discounting schemes to ensure that it offers the same type and level of discounts to all requesting customers.  It states that it has no visibility of this documentation.  Again, right down through all of these it states that there is no visibility of the evidence of this or of the activity.  In a detailed reading of this, we can see that it does not accept that the implementations which it states have been made have actually been made.  Can Mr. Griffin respond to these issues or has he given us a response?</p></speech>

To return to an issue that just occurred to me when Mr. Griffin was dealing with last issue, on the ESB infrastructure, I understand what Mr. Mulligan said about the direction that the infrastructure would come from.  He gave the example of some premises that might be some distance away from the actual poles.  Would 4G or wireless technology not be a solution in instances where that might have been a problem?</p></speech>

I am a mere accountant and not an engineer.  My simple answer to that is that it very much depends on where one is in Waterford, Wicklow or Kerry.  Is one in line-of-sight to a mast on the nearest hill?  Again, that is something that has been looked at in detail across every townland in this country.</p></speech>

There may be poles on the road or the ESB network may be behind it farm, but it may still not be cost-effective to get a fibre to that farm and a wireless solution may be used if there is a base station somewhere in the proximity that gives it the service quality that we are saying is required, which is at least 30 Mbps.</p></speech>

I am going to look at metropolitan area networks, MANs, and the national broadband plan.  I will turn to MANS first.  Back in 2008, the Comptroller and Auditor General did a report with which the witnesses are probably familiar.  Whoever the Comptroller and Auditor General was at that time talked about slow uptake and he pointed out certain things that he discovered.  The Department was on notice that there were issues with MANs.  I want an update on the uptake of MANs.  If the Department does not have it to hand, I would like to receive it in writing later.</p> <p>  On the report we received, this is all about accountability.  I am not here to ask about fibre or dark fibre, but to ask about value for money and the processes.  When we had a meeting on 14 February, the Analysys Mason report was handed to us.  That report was from March 2018.  Why, for openness and accountability, was this not published quickly in March 2018 and not in February 2019?  On that day, there was a certain cynicism because prices had reduced significantly when this was published.  Why was this not published immediately, given the seriousness of the complaints made and what was stated in this report?  Can I have a simple answer as to why this was not published?  Does the fault lie with Department, the Government or the Minister?  Who does it lie with?</p></speech>

Some 70 service operators are using the MANs.

Within the Department's processes, would what subsequently emerged in the Mason report not have been clear?  It raised serious issues.  It mentions a number of options and recommends one.

The view that came back was that the MANs were operating effectively and performing well so, by extension, one could conclude from that the concessionaire itself was doing a good job on the MANs.  It met all its annual investment obligations to extend the MANs and met all its key performance indicators, KPIs.  We had three complaints out of a pool of 70 service operators.  At that stage, we flagged our intention to undertake a detailed review which we had commissioned Analysys Mason to do, to look at pricing issues.  It is important when looking at the Analysys Mason report to look closely at what it says.</p></speech>

There was difficulty with separation between two sister companies.  There are four options.  One is to separate them completely and it does not go down that road.  There were very clear issues.  They are not just minor issues or areas for improvement.  They are all about transparency and accountability, and giving maximum information.</p></speech>

When one looks at the detail of the report, it was only in exceptional circumstances, because of competition in the market, that Enet used that maximum price.  To respond to the point that the Deputy is trying to make, we recognise that there are deficiencies.  There are 13 recommendations with 11 implemented.  The key bit is what the Minister has referred to ComReg to look at, which is that if there is an issue with regard to transfer pricing arrangements between Enet and ETNL-----</p></speech>

It will be published in due course.  The reason it has not been published yet is because since 2015, which is four years ago, there have been six versions of that because every time the map changed, from 757,000 initially, to 540,000 now, we needed to change it.  The main reason is because there is substantial information in there with regard to the cost of fibre, ducting, subcontractor prices and so on which are highly sensitive to the market.  We would eventually publish the much fuller details if a Government decision is made.</p><p>The analysis is going through a final iteration with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is a concluding process; it is not finished yet.  When the Government decision is made, that is the conclusion of the CBA process.</p></speech>

There are many other cost benefit analyses because clearly, that is right.  Things change and the map reduces as somebody pulls out.  There is no cost benefit analysis for us or the public to see, however.  I am going to park that for the moment.  When the cost benefit analysis was done, was it on the basis of 800,000 premises?</p></speech>

We hear every day of the week that companies cannot get contracts from public bodies in Ireland because their turnover in the previous few years was not at a certain level.  The officials will be familiar with that.  It is a very basic question.</p><p>The Department is proposing to sign a contract with a company which does not even exist yet but will be incorporated in some solicitor's firm which, by definition, will have no previous business or turnover by which it can be judged.  It may be judged based on who its shareholders are, but the company, if it has no turnover, would not be eligible to apply to build a single local authority house in Ireland because it would not meet the previous turnover requirement.  That is a basic thing that public bodies do.  How is it that a company that does not exist is likely to get this award with no previous turnover?  The witnesses may think that a strange question but it is one the public will ask.  I will park that question and the witnesses can come back to it.</p></speech>

Ireland has one of the most expensive State-owned broadband networks in Europe.  The Minister issued a press statement after the Analysys Mason report was produced.  The headline issue identified in that statement was that there was a 50% reduction to &euro;2.60 per metre.  We saw the response from BT to some of the points in the Analysys Mason report.  The Minister referred that issue of pricing to ComReg and it was an issue on which it had no responsibility previously.  I subsequently met a number of providers that are wholesale entities, so to speak.  I asked if the reduction was of benefit to them and they said they had got quotes after the announcement of the reduction and, lo and behold, those quotes contained increases, rather than reductions, in price.  There is something fairly serious happening here because the end user will pay for this.  I continue to be dissatisfied with the lack of transparency and whether there is a real effort to get to grips with price here because one of the determinants for the take-up of the service will be price.  We need to look at what is happening with the MANs.  The witnesses might comment on that to begin with.</p></speech>

There is a remark on page 20 of the Analysys Mason report, referring to dark fibre, that states that the analysis shows that price per metre is strongly affected by the term of the contract and the proportion of the MAN distance used.  I do not know if the providers who approached the Deputy are comparing like with like in terms of offers and if the project is the same as was originally costed.</p></speech>

I will suggest that they make a complaint because that seems to be needed to trigger someone to take a look at it.  There is a real issue with cost here because we are out of line.</p></speech>

There is a company called Enet in Limerick which employs 100 people and I want to ensure that the engagement on both sides of the table reflects the factual position as well as possible.  The Analysys Mason report made comparisons between the price of dark fibre for Enet and ComReg and used international comparators.  It stated that benchmarks of dark fibre prices are not widely available.  Dark fibre wholesale offers are not common, and those that are available do not have published prices.  Analysys Mason had to go to Sweden because of the absence of good national comparators and said that the prices vary according to different areas of the country.</p></speech>

The total that the State has spent on MANs so far is &euro;176 million.  That was a piece of information given to us by the chief executive officer of Enet.  The revenue share represents about 5% of a return over the past 15 years.  When we discussed this previously, one of the reasons for not going to tender was because investments were being made by Enet and there was a return to the State which represents about 5% over 15 years, which is not a sizeable return.</p> <p>  The State was paid &euro;8.8 million in revenue from 2004.  It is not a huge amount of money.  Looking at that and listening to Eir, which I accept is a commercial entity with a parallel fibre network, it was fully expecting to see a competitive process for the concession contracts and they were done earlier than anticipated.  In hindsight, has the return to the State been sufficient that a competitive process was not required?  Is it a question of how the Department handled the communication or is there something more than that?</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Connolly, it would have been preferable if we had been clearer around the outcome of the extend versus retender issue.  One must look at why the MANs were set up because they are a unique offering.  Some 84 or 85 are rings within towns, some of them large and some of them small.</p><p>It can be because the take-up was low or having to operate on a commercial basis to generate additional take-up.  The reason we went to look at the extend versus retender option was not to do with their having invested &euro;30 million.  We did a very detailed analysis around performance but also on what would be the right thing for the market in terms of whether we would extend or retender.  The Norcontel report covers some of that.  It is clear that, leaving aside the financial aspects, several qualitative and quantitative outcomes were identified which would give greater certainty to telecoms operators on the availability of the MANs infrastructure.  That would allow them to draft their own investment plans.  We were entering a time where there was very substantial change, which can be seen both from the private sector investment and our own work in the period under review. </p></speech>

There were entities that were interested in quoting and expected an announcement.  I am surprised that it happened as early as it did because there was some time to run.  I expect people need a lead-in time to make investments and so on.  What would have been the downside to going to tender and making sure there was a testing in the marketplace?</p></speech>

Second, if one goes to a retender and does not emerge with a successful solution, the only option is to return to the existing incumbent who will have one over a barrel because he will know the tender process has failed.  Therefore, the prospect of being able to negotiate what had been negotiated originally, which was a &euro;21 million extra return to the Exchequer, would be absolutely and utterly off the table.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the national procurement framework.  Contracts and agreements are written in a particular way.  This was written in, crystal clear, that after the first 15 years of the contract, it was open to the contract authority to secure an extension of up to ten further years.  That was there from 2004 when we had the first concession agreement.  It was replicated in 2009 for the other MANs.  To be honest, if I came before the Committee of Public Accounts in 12 months, or even now, and I said I had a report from Norcontel stating this was the most preferable option, we had done some preliminary desk work which found we would accrue &euro;21 million in extra benefit and we would provide greater certainty to the telecom operators and the sector, but we decided to go in another direction-----</p></speech>

The report is written in a very balanced way.  It does not say that prices at reduced or reasonable levels were not available to service operators.  The criticism is primarily, as I read it, that it needs to be better documented.  It appears that perhaps there is an issue about the transfer pricing arrangements between Enet and ETNL.  We need to bottom out on that.  We will look at that but ComReg has been commissioned to undertake that work by the Minister and will produce a report.  As I said, the Deputy should not take the set of recommendations that issued on foot of the report as the last word.  We will constantly evaluate whether the recommendations are being implemented.  We will take further feedback from BT, which is a customer and a competitor of Enet, and from other entities.  We will review this on an ongoing basis.  The Analysys Mason report refers to the need for a further review within a two-year period.</p></speech>

The lack of a competitive process is highly problematic.  I appreciate that this is a bespoke process that we will not undertake a second time.  However, the process has the same feel to it as that of the national children's hospital.  What specific safeguards can be put in place to ensure delivery?  It is not just a question of awarding the tender.  The plan must be delivered within a timeframe.</p> <p>  When the natural gas network was being established, if, for argument's sake, 20 households in a housing estate wished to avail of gas, that would be sufficient to warrant putting a gas pipeline through the estate.  Other households could then join the network at a later point.  I appreciate that it is possible for people to connect to a network subsequently.</p><p>What timeline is allowed for people to connect up to it?  Will that be specified in any tendering process?  The original suggestion of the amount of money it would cost being a fraction of what it will cost is an issue of serious concern given that the number of households that require to be connected is fewer now than the number talked about when that original amount, albeit a desktop exercise, was suggested.  If there are 300,000 fewer households that require to be connected but it will still cost multiples more, how could the desktop exercise have got it so wrong?  Mr. Griffin might talk us through that.</p></speech>

When we look at procurement processes, it is not unusual for certain projects to find oneself in a situation where one only has a single bidder at the end.  If we look at the equivalent of the UK in terms of its national broadband plan, it received only one bid at the end.  It was from BT, the final company that was participating in the process.  Fujitsu pulled out before submitting a final bid.  It is not unusual and it is not ideal.  We will be perfectly upfront on that.</p> <p>  Going back to the value for money point, we have used a competitive dialogue process which allows us do a helicopter move and circle in and reiterate as more evidence becomes available.  We have done significant market engagement.  We have interrogated various proposals from the three bidders.  It has allowed us deepen our understanding of likely subsidy levels, technology, construction operation costs and demand revenue projections.</p> <p>  The other important point to bear in mind, and this is very useful to us from a comparison perspective, is that at the penultimate stage before receipt of final bids and before Eir withdrew from the proposal, which is known as the invitation, submit, detailed submissions, ISDS, stage, we had two bidders submit proposals which included their financial estimates of the cost of the project.  That was very helpful to us in terms of the comparisons to be made.</p> <p>  We have got modelling expertise from ComReg.  We have looked at international models.  We have got a separate report from KPMG which looks at how to engage, based on national and international best practice, and value for money in the context of a single bidder assessment.  That will form part of the valuation that will be submitted to Government.</p> <p>  The other point-----</p></speech>

As we pointed out, fibre to the home or fibre to business is fantastic but fibre to cabinet or a wireless solution can be equally as good depending on one's proximity to that network, the quality of that network and the price of it.  All those things are factored in.  In terms of any hotel or business, depending where it is in any part of Ireland, outside the intervention area, that is the competitive environment we are in.  In the blue and light blue areas people have a raft of choices.  It is the amber area in which the issue resides and that is what we are trying to address.</p></speech>

From my short studies on it, it only works where there is not clogging up of the system, the weather is good, the leaves are not on the trees and the wind is blowing in the right direction.  I know there are businesses that it suits.  Many businesses in Dublin fall into that category where they have wireless masts on the side of buildings to ramp up the speed.</p> <p>  In terms of what we are trying to achieve here, and the Chairman spoke about people at home watching these proceedings, I believe it is something monumental.  We are trying to put down fixed cable infrastructure to serve the country into the future but it is a bit like the gas analogy.  People may not want or require it in their homes today but they may want it as technology advances, our fridges start talking to us and we have all these advances that apparently will happen.  My understanding is that once the proper cable broadband infrastructure is laid down or up, as the case may be, they may not need it today but in 15 years' time the capacity exists to expand for those requirements.  Mr. Griffin might explain that to the committee because much of it has been lost in the idea that we are trying to provide Netflix for everyone.  We are not trying to provide Netflix for everyone.  We are trying to provide an infrastructure that leaves people in Carlow, Ballyferriter and Tyrrellspass as connected as people in Dublin.  My understanding is that regional development can happen and not be in any way inhibited by lack of access to proper cable and that we will not have a company coming in and telling people their broadband will work perfectly fine once there are no leaves on the trees, they are on flat ground and the wind is blowing in the right direction.  Mr. Griffin might outline that for the committee.</p></speech>

The comparison I like to make and with which all of us are familiar is that we built the M50 with two lanes.  There are now four lanes on each side and it is still massively congested.  The N7 is a disaster zone because we are putting on additional capacity.</p> <p>  One can take a short-term or a long-term perspective on this.  We have taken a long-term perspective over a 25-year period.  One of the fundamental issues for us is the technology we can put in place that will guarantee that in 25 years' time, irrespective of what happens between now and then, and we know there will be massive developments in terms of the ask of the public and businesses, including virtual and augmented reality, automated driving, remote surgery, artificial intelligence and precision farming, we will have a technology to cater for that.</p><p>We will not have to go back in a second time.  We sometimes have a particular problem in the provision of infrastructure.  In 2008, we thought that download speeds of 2.3 Mbps under the national broadband scheme were cutting edge, but by the time we started, it was out of date.  However, this project will endure.</p><p> It is interesting to see the assessment that was made as to what one does in rural areas.  One must look to what is happening in urban areas and the decision by Eir in the past few weeks to have a fibre overlay in all major cities and towns across the country.  That will involve fibre to the home, not a cabinet.  Siro, which has been assisted through the NBP process by virtue of the fact that the State brought forward legislation, is bringing fibre to the home.  The question we must ask ourselves as administrators and politicians is whether we want to put something in place in rural Ireland that is sub-optimal and will simply further exacerbate the urban-rural digital divide.  Even though we were technology neutral, we are clear that the fibre to the premises technology proposed by the bidder - interestingly, by all bidders - is the right direction to allow future proofing to be guaranteed.</p><p> There is a further statistic that may be of interest.  The European Union did some work when it was scoping out the direction of travel up to 2025.  Some 59% of respondents think they will need fixed download speeds of 1 Gbps in 2025, with only 8% of respondents saying they will need download speeds below 100 Mbps.  It is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

One does not expect those 300,000 people to need it today, but they may need it in the future.  As such, it is a pointless analysis.</p></speech>

That leads to a reduction in commutes and the associated frustrations and difficulties for families and children.  One must consider the social dividend of that.</p></speech>

On the bidder, the team he has coalesced around him - all of whom are Irish apart from one individual - and who have taken part in the bid process have massive experience across the telecoms sector in Ireland.  They have had significant responsibilities in rolling out national telecoms networks in various countries, delivered 170,000 km of fibre across 56 private projects and managed or delivered &euro;30 billion in contracts business values.  These are big hitters.  We would not be comfortable as a Department in putting forward a solution unless we had faith in the entity.  The other thing it is important to say is that the evaluation process as part of the final bid assessment looks at all of these issues, including the capacity of the bidder and its technical ability to deliver a project on this scale.</p></speech>

We have spent 800 or 900 hours working with the engineers.  I am back to the issue of who can deliver this project.  On our side, there have been ten or 20 experts in attendance at each meeting with the opposition - the three bidders - with ten or 20 commercial, technical and legal experts.  The technical experts with whom we dealt across all the bidders, including the remaining bidder, are people who worked for 30 or 40 years on the Eircom network or a Vodafone network.  They are all Irish-based engineers with 20, 30 or 40 years of experience.  One of the head experts on the side of the bidder with whom I deal every day started off in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and built the Eircom network.  That is the type of person on the current bid team.  Obviously, people moved around in various companies.  We are not dealing with people who have just flown in from New York and are telling us how to build a network here.  They are indigenous, home-based people who have worked on the Irish networks, mobile and fixed, for the past 30 years.</p></speech>

How will that work when a contract has been awarded?  I would consider these things, such as scope for movement on certain issues, to be a nightmare for investors.   At the end of the day, investors want a return on their money.  How do these penalties and so on fit into a contract?  The witnesses may respond after we break for lunch.  I am concerned about a contract being signed with this company that obviously has lots of expertise and, based on the evidence that has been given, seems to be capable of doing the job, but that when we say we want clawback and penalties it will respond, "On your bike.  You need us."  What protection exists in that regard?</p></speech>

At that time, the draft contract was based on the best available contracts we could get from the UK, where it has run broadband contracts, and the initial broadband scheme contract.  After nearly two and a half years of negotiating with almost every senior legal house in Dublin and across the water, the contract currently runs to 1,500 pages.  Within it is the governance of this for 25 years.  That includes the requirement that the operator must pass and connect every home in the intervention area.  It is very much a contract that requires connections.  The subsidy includes connecting every home in the intervention area where a consumer seeks a connection, be it in year 1 or year 25.  That is the contract.  It is based on when people want it, to go back to the gas analogy.  When people will want to connect to the network is a critical issue.  When will Mary Murphy or Jimmy Doherty want a connection?  It might be in 2020 or 2025.  We predict that in our modelling and the bidder is predicting it in its modelling.  That demand may occur sooner or later than expected, but we know generally that people will connect to this network because it will probably be the only network available in the next 25 years.  People may have a choice.  If demand exceeds our expectations, the clawback would kick in.  In the event that the scheme is hugely successful, there may be far more profit in the contract than we ever envisaged.  In that context, the contract has within it specific percentages regarding exactly how much would be clawed back and recouped by the State.  That has been agreed with the existing bidder as we are concluding the tender process,  There are three clawback mechanisms.  There is one for any cost savings, whereby we recoup any money the operator expected to spend but did not spend.</p><p>Second, there is a mechanism if they make more profits than they ever thought they would.  Third, there is a mechanism for us to find out at the end of the contract whether the business has a value.  There are significant clawbacks to the State within the contract.  They apply to all bidders.  Again, all of this was subject to huge negotiation over the past two or three years.  The point has been made that if we look for too much clawback, they will look for too much money.  All of that has been concluded.  It is significant.  By the time the contract is signed, there is no change to that.  They are locked into that and they must do it whenever those accounts are ready.</p></speech>

I apologise if I ask questions that go back over ground that has already been covered.  We are all asking questions about competition.  According to the old saying, competition is the life of trade.  We started out with five or six companies that were supposed to be interested in the national broadband plan, but that number dwindled down to four, three, two and eventually one.  Is the Secretary General happy that we are down to one?  As I have said, competition is the life of trade.  Would it be better if there were two or three bidders and the Department could use one against the others to try to get the best value for taxpayers' money?  I would like Mr. Griffin to comment on that.  I know this question has probably been asked several times already.</p></speech>

There have been cases in this country and overseas in which just one bidder remained at the final stage of a project.  For example, there was just one final bidder at the end of the UK equivalent of the national broadband plan.  The other bidder dropped out at the last moment.  We had to figure out what to do in the circumstances we found ourselves in.  We looked at what we did over the course of the procurement process to ensure value for money was guaranteed.  The procurement process we had engaged in involved competitive dialogue.  This kind of process is used for bespoke projects when the technical scope of the project - what the final network design will look like - is not fully known.  It allows one to engage with the bidders in the process in looking at things like subsidy levels, technology, construction and operating costs, demand and revenue projections.  It was helpful for us that there are a number of different stages in the competitive dialogue process.  During the penultimate stage, which was the ISDS stage, we got two bids - one from the final bidder and one from Eir.  This gave us a chance to compare the bids and the factors taken into account, etc.  We had something to compare against.  The other useful thing from our perspective is that we did a great deal of financial and technical modelling during the procurement process.  We used models that ComReg uses for regulated services.  We looked at models that are used internationally.  A great deal of financial modelling was done by the Department and its advisers, KPMG.  At the final stage of the process, we asked KPMG to compile a report which would assess the position with regard to value for money, for want of a better term, when there is just one bidder.  The other important component is making sure we have robust post-contract governance arrangements, the suite of protections Mr. Mulligan and I have mentioned, the performance indicators, the penalties, the oversight arrangements, the checkpoint reviews, the clawback provisions, the stand-alone board which is responsible for the-----</p></speech>

The winning bidder who is successful will have to design, build and manage the network.  That means it will all be built in the first stage, whatever number of years that takes.  We know that people will iteratively and incrementally connect to the network.  People will connect as each area is built from the top of the country to the bottom.  It is inevitable that many new homes will be built over the coming 15 or 20 years.  We are requiring the winning bidder to honour the contract for 25 years so that this company is required to connect someone who builds a new house, someone who does not get a broadband service until the tenth year, for whatever reason, or someone who moves house.  It will be a contracted connection.</p></speech>

We expect that whoever is building this network will use the most cost-efficient solution to get maximum value for money.  At the moment, the proposition is that the best and most cost-effective solution involves the use of Eircom poles.  Those poles are fully regulated by ComReg, which oversees how they are used, as well as the monthly or yearly charges that Eircom is allowed to charge for poles and ducts.  They are fully regulated and will continue to be.</p></speech>

That bidder will have many subcontracts with infrastructure providers, including Eircom.  If it decides to use the ESB in certain instances, it will have a contract with the ESB.  It will have contracts with Enet and others.  If it uses towers and masts, it will have contracts in respect of them.  They have been in discussions with many providers, including Eircom, for the past two years.  There are very substantial subcontract agreements and rental agreements in place for 25 years.

It has set out the requirement to bring a high-quality, reliable broadband service to rural people, with a minimum download speed of 30 Mbps and a minimum upload speed of 6 Mbps.  We set that out and we want it to be future-proofed so it is fit for purpose over 25 years.  At the table, during the process of procurement, three large consortia of experts came forward with their proposals.  Through that engagement and with our own advice and expertise, we have examined all technologies.  We have examined fibre to the home, wireless technology, satellite technologies and how they could be deployed in the most efficient manner in the areas we are talking about.  That has taken probably two years, end to end.  Throughout that period, however, the bidders have concluded the best solution is predominantly fibre to the home.</p></speech>

The representative said that if there are good copper lines &ndash; many of them are old &ndash; up to 80 Mbps or 100 Mbps could be achieved.  Are these lines all to be replaced with the fibre-optic lines?  It sounds phenomenal to me.  It involves an awful lot of money.</p></speech>

The line from the cabinet out to the house is copper.  That is the solution Eir has deployed in the cities and suburban areas.

They are the main builders of fibre connections to homes.  SIRO, Eir and all other operators provide the information for the regulator.  We have the Eir information.  What we have seen, without giving the committee exact numbers, is that uptake has been very good and it is getting stronger and bigger every month.  Why it was slow in the initial year - 2017 - was that Eir Retail, the retail arm of Eir - it is Eir Wholesale that is building the network - was the only one selling it.  Eventually Eir Wholesale started to bring in Sky and Vodafone.  The Deputy might have noticed lately that there is an ad featuring Dermot Bannon on RT&Eacute; for high-speed fibre broadband.  The number of people looking for high-speed broadband has grown substantially since.</p></speech>

That is an additional revenue share that was negotiated.  There is a further reduction in the State's potential liability at the end of the contract.  That is a clawback mechanism in place that amounts to approximately &euro;6.4 million.  The assessment also demonstrated that by extending rather than retendering, we could add to the value of the asset under different scenarios.  If we retendered, the additional value to the asset would be &euro;14 million but if we extended, it would be approximately &euro;35 million.  That is a different benefit arising out of it.  Those are the financial benefits.  As I said earlier, there is a range of non-financial benefits that we see as being as important, if not more important, than those.</p></speech>

We are not here to speak about providers as we deal with value for money.  However, providers have said they can do more and technology is changing.

On the map on the screen we can look at the west of Ireland, Galway or anywhere else.  The blue and light blue areas show what commercial operators will serve and the rest is amber.  Whether the amber areas change by a premise here or there because of the intervention of a commercial operator, our intervention will still be required.  When we looked at this in 2015 and 2016, there were choices and there are still choices today.  We looked at them in 2015 and we consistently look at them; we reappraised the project in 2018 after Eir left.  We continue to do it because we do not want to do the wrong thing.  If we want to cover 100% of every townland in Galway, taking in every family, we must do it.  If a commercial company connects some of them along the way, the issue does not change.</p></speech>

Our intention will be to be as open as possible.  We believe we have done a huge amount of positive work.  We have a proposal here that is sound, but that still has to go through some due diligence.

The Department has essentially fulfilled the role of the regulator because ComReg was not regulating prices.  The Department got Norcontel to carry out an analysis and following that, the MANs concessionary contracts were extended.  Then there was the Analysys Mason report.  I cannot remember whether the report or the extension came first.  Is it fair to say that the Department was regulating or monitoring the MANs?</p></speech>

The basic thesis is for entities other than those that have significant market power or are in an effective monopoly situation.  The only one that has SMP is Eir at present.  The market will dictate the price and if one pitches a price at a level that is not acceptable to service operators one will not make a living.</p></speech>

We went through that this morning.  I have my views on it but that is neither here nor there.  I will move on.  I do not know if Mr. Mulligan can give us the information but he mentioned the connection cost being &euro;100 per household, irrespective of where it is in the country.  I do not dispute that everybody should have access to broadband.  How it is delivered is the point at issue, including how it is delivered quickly, effectively and sustainably into the future in terms of bandwidths and so forth.  However, there is clearly a sizeable difference in the actual cost when one gets to the final 15% of hard to reach households that are not commercial.  Does he have a general figure for that?  A household on a hillside is very different from a terraced house on a housing estate.  Is there a general figure for that or is that in the cost-benefit analysis?</p></speech>

I will not give exact numbers because, again, that is commercial.  I will outline how we arrived at our numbers and how all the bidders arrived at theirs in the context of the models one does to arrive at the best estimate.  Of course, one does not know the actual cost until one gets to the driveway, farm or wherever because one has to count the number of poles and so forth.  We have spent two or three years at it in conjunction with the consultation with bidders since 2016 and everybody has their best estimates of cost.  Through the technical data we have now and the CSO data we have every Eircode postcode in the country mapped.  We have worked with ComReg on that as it has that for its own regulatory reasons.  We have every road in the country mapped through GeoDirectory and all the mapping tools we have these days.  We have every metre in the country covered in terms of how much road network there is, which is approximately 100,000 km.  We know how many poles would be needed, how many new poles would be needed and how many poles will be needed to get from the curtilage of a road to a house.  That is all mapped and modelled.  That gives us the route length, how many metres of fibre are needed, how many poles are needed and what is likely to be underground and over ground.  They are the best estimates we have.  We have numbers - the numbers by house and the average numbers by 500,000 houses.  We know what the likely most expensive home will be and we know what the cheapest home will be.  We have all that information internally.</p></speech>

We are going to intervene in the market that is 96% of the landmass of Ireland.  A network must be built to connect all of the 750,000 premises in that area.  The number of premises to be served has been reduced, but they are still scattered throughout the landmass.  A provider will have to use as much fibre as is needed to connect the premises on a certain road.  It might connect 40 houses whereas previously it would have connected 60.  It requires the same number of kilometres of fibre, but the revenue decreases to reflect the fact that 20 houses not covered.  The reduced number of premises impacts on revenue without much of a change in operating costs.</p></speech>

As can be seen on the map, the network we are building will use existing infrastructure.  The infrastructure we are using is owned by Eir, the ESB or other concerns.  The only thing we are purchasing is the cable which will be connected to poles owned by other concerns.  The network will run to the most remote areas throughout the country where the business case is never good.  That is why we are doing it.  The 25-year business case will be impacted on by the fact that there are fewer premises.</p></speech>

The headline was an expected reduction in cost per metre.  We all saw it as very good news because if the wholesale cost is reduced, the retail cost will be reduced.  The Minister then referred a review of pricing to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  What role does ComReg have in looking at the analysis and ensuring the commitments are kept?  Is it a role of the Department or of ComReg and the Department jointly?</p></speech>

Of the 13 recommendations, 11 have been implemented.  BT has raised issues and we have committed to taking them up with BT and Enet.  The Minister has referred a specific issue concerning transfer pricing between Enet and ETNL to ComReg to confirm that the inter-company transfer pricing arrangements are in compliance with the code of practice.  While examining this issue, ComReg will provide another layer of due diligence by confirming that the 13 recommendations have been fully implemented.  It will be another chance to address residual concerns.  The findings will then be reviewed for possible further recommendations to the Minister.</p></speech>

For aesthetic reasons, people may not want to have a couple of poles along the side of their garden and may want to have the whole place dug up.  In that situation we say to consumers that they should have to make a contribution towards the cost.  It is cheaper to place the poles along the side of a ditch, for example, rather than have an underground duct right up to the front door.  We have catered for all of this within the contract to make sure we will not spend money in a situation where the consumer chooses to have the cable run underground.</p></speech>

Is it correct to say any cost benefit analysis only presents the picture at a moment in time?</p></speech>

When one tries to make a cost benefit analysis for a piece of infrastructure, in respect of which one is looking forward over a 25 year period and in a sector where the transformation is so dramatic, it is very hard to apply the normal rules of play, as set out in the public spending code.  In the cost benefit analysis we have set out a range of quantitative benefits that are aligned perfectly with the public spending code, but we have also looked at a range of elements that are not easily quantifiable such as education, e-commerce and e-health, which involves a more qualitative assessment.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, when he was at the committee, he referred to the fact that when one built this kind of future-proofed network, one could not rely solely on the typical things that applied to a bog standard - my term - cost benefit analysis.</p></speech>

It frustrates me a lot when I travel around the country and see massive advertisements for companies that will sort all of this out.  On the figure of 757,000 premises, minus 300,000 plus another 80,000, the only amount we can take from the 757,000 is 300,000 because it is a like for like substitution.  Eir was providing the same.  Therefore, it is 757,000 minus 300,000 because anyone else will only offer an alternative.</p></speech>

I see it as infrastructure for the future as opposed to providing home services.  Any figure means that we are back to the moment in time issue.  We do not know if there will be a massive growth spurt in some part of the State.  The figures are all fluid, but, essentially, we are building infrastructure similar to the electrification programme back in the day.  It is for the future and there is only one way to go about it - putting the best possible structures in place for development.  No one is coming forth with better options than fibre optic cable and closed lines.</p></speech>

We had our own internal analysis carried out by Analysys Mason, which made it clear that at international and at national level, and we have seen this in the SIRO and Eir proposals in particular, the horse being backed is fibre to the premises and this is what gives the absolute guarantee on future proofing.</p></speech>

What is the nature of the contract?  I do not want to conflate the two but when we discussed the national children's hospital, we were told it was a one-off specific issue and not like building a motorway.  The witnesses today are saying the exact same - that it is a one-off and there is nothing else like it.  They are not in the same space but they could be.  The children's hospital had a two-phase contract.  What is the nature or type of the broadband contract?  I am not looking for commercial details.  Is it design, build, operate and finance?  Does it have one stage or two stages?  What are the review processes?  What is the nature of the contract being worked on?</p></speech>

This was after we made a decision that this was an infrastructure for the future and it needed to be future-proofed.  During the consultation we received more than 100 responses from the public and operators.  In December, before we went through the procurement process, we made the decision this would be a gap-funded model to design, build, operate and finance for 25 years.</p></speech>

In this instance, we went to the market and at the time it was &euro;757,000.  We never published any figure on how much the State might put into the project because we did not want to lead the bidders.  We simply went to the market and stated we wanted high-speed broadband of at least 30 Mbps, we did not name a technology, and we stated we wanted the market to tell us how design, build and operate it and to tell us how much money the operators might want from the State to do this and live by the contract for 25 years, knowing they might have 300,000 or 400,000 customers over that 25 year period at &euro;30 or &euro;40 a head.  This was the task put forward to the bidders that qualified, three of whom were at the table.  They told us they believed the predominant technology should be fibre and they told us how they would design it.  All three gave us very different designs but similar operations because they would be selling the same services and all three gave us very different financial models of how it would be financed.  At the invitation to submit detailed solutions stage in September 2017, we got a number from two operators on how much money they thought the State would have to put into the project and how much they would put into it.  That was called a dummy run of the bid.  We had two numbers at that point.  This is where we are today.  The contract, which has 1,500 pages, has strict obligations for them to show us their designs for each of the 100 areas of 5,000 premises throughout every part of the country and that must be proven before it is built.</p></speech>

Copper cables have been used in all countries for the last 40 years.  They have a finite life.  The plan of incumbents across Europe, as the Secretary General has said, is to replace copper with fibre.  Fibre does everything copper did in the past.  One can use it for one's existing landline telephone, security system and television and much more.  Fibre allows one to carry that massive data copper could not.  The regulator's plan in Ireland, as with Ofcom in the UK and others internationally, is to bring in a regulatory regime where there will be a transition from copper to fibre.  That will be overseen by regulators in every member state because there is currently a universal service obligation attached to it.  It is BT in the UK while in Ireland Eircom is the universal service provider for voice.  Therefore, it has to maintain the copper network nationally on those poles and can only remove it with the approval of the regulator.  That is a process they are currently looking at with a view to establishing a transitional arrangement.</p></speech>

There will always be installation with new properties and development over the period but, really, it will be just maintain, upgrade and repair the service.  The year 2025 and how Eir fell behind due to Storm Emma were mentioned.  Is it correct to say that every time there is a bad storm the deadline is pushed out by three months?  It is a<i>force majeure</i>so one cannot be held accountable.  Obviously the contract is going to build in <i>force majeure </i>measures not to meet the milestone.  It has been mentioned that two storms have resulted in Eir not having its 300,000 premises done by last Christmas.  I can only take it that if that is what happens in the industry then that will happen with this contract.  A couple of bad storms will result in everything being moved out.</p></speech>

I wish to ask some straightforward questions.  Will people in rural areas have to apply for the service or will a fibre cable be run up every boreen whether the houses want it?  Will it be a question of supplying the cable after it is sought by people in the area?  What is the plan?  It would be dreadful if there are people crying out for and willing to pay for the service next year but the Department says: "No, we are going to do this halfway up the mountain".  We know that there may be one house up there and the inhabitants might not want the service.  How can one prioritise getting the service?  This is a consumer business.  How can we get the service to the customers who want it early?  We all acknowledge that there will be some customers who might never want the service.  Is the Department going to spend money passing their doors?  How can one prioritise?  One needs a system in place where people can request the service and customer demand is recognised like it is with any other business.  If there is not a strong demand then the company will get to people later on.  Where demand exists and the public wants the service in their houses then there should be a bias towards facilitating requests.</p></speech>

There is no point in bringing a fibre cable to that house if they never want it, the premises is a holiday home or the premises is dormant or vacant.  There are contractual conditions in the contract that if a consumer does order, in that house that is far away or whatever, the contract with this company requires it to connect the consumer within a certain amount of time, and I think it is a number of weeks.  So, we do not waste money building the fibre if it may never be needed.  If they do need it then there is a contractual condition that they must connect it within a certain period of time.</p></speech>

When the chief executive of Eir was here she said that if she goes to her board and gets another &euro;100 million she will be able to roll out the scheme to another 80,000 premises.  Obviously that has not progressed.  She said it was possible, and it was not a commitment.  She has not gone to the Department with that commitment since but maybe she is waiting to see what happens here first.  I do not know.  All I am saying is that she made htat remark.</p> <p>  I know the Department might not want to answer my next few questions today.  Has the Secretary General any concept, and he must have based on the information his Department has received, of how much it is going to cost to deal with the 540,000 houses?  How was the total cost of the project versus the amount of the subsidy liable to be paid by the taxpayer calculated?  Let us say something costs &euro;100.  How does one decide how much must be paid by taxpayers?  What is the decision-making process in terms of how much taxpayers must pay?  Have the bidders outlined what they want?  Please tell me the percentage but I do not think the Secretary General will want to do so.  How does the Department decide the percentage of the subsidy for the project that the taxpayer is going to carry?  What is the process? </p></speech>

A lot of the assessment around the level of subsidy required is based on projections really around demand and revenue.  Different views emerged on that at different stages, as Mr. Mulligan has indicated.  If there is a more benign outcome on the level of demand and level of revenue than the bidder had anticipated then there are clawback mechanisms built into the project to allow some of that come back to the State.  We know at this point what the level of subsidy is likely to look like.  We have set out or we have available in our own material and assessment of what the optimistic scenario is, what the central scenario is and what the more pessimistic scenario is.  So we know then, taking account of each of those scenarios, what the level of subsidy requirement from the State will be.  If it turns out to be the more central or more optimistic scenario, well then mechanisms arise within the contract to allow us to recoup costs and to ensure that the subsidy levels are driven down.</p></speech>

The expectation is that we will have a substantial team in the Department from day one that will oversee everything that the bidders are doing in terms of what they are spending because they have to prove what they need before they get it and the contract cheques will be signed off in the Department on the basis of money spent.  So we will have full visibility of what they are spending versus what they budgeted to spend.  At the end of each year we will then know how much money they either have spent or did not spend and then they do not need it.  Again, we will not have given them the money in the first place.</p></speech>

Those are things like the Department being allowed to review, scrutinise and monitor the planned network build from final tender through to completion of detailed designs and monitoring; testing and verifying the actual network build and build costs on a transparent, open book basis; the payment of satisfactory achievement of clearly defined deployment milestones, which Mr. Mulligan mentioned-----</p></speech>

We looked, as did KPMG and our technical people, at international models around things like connection costs.  They looked at the average connection cost in rural deployments in Spain and other member states.  We have that benchmark to allow us to make that sort of assessment.  We are still going through some of that work and we are quite comfortable with what KPMG put forth as a single bidder solution assessment methodology.  The cost-benefit analysis is still positive, notwithstanding the changes to the map that have occurred over the past couple of years.  We will be going to Government in the next number of weeks and we will be required to give those assurances about value for money in a single bidder situation.</p></speech>

The witnesses said that all the people dealing with this have done projects in America, Spain and all over the world and are highly skilled.  They know the finances and technical issues and have done this in big countries.  My worry is that if all that financial and technical ability is on their side of the table, it is not possible for us to have an equivalent level of experience in the field to match it on the State side.  As Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I always get worried when we enter negotiations that the entire worldwide expertise for the industry is on the other side of the table because this is just another country to some of these people.  It would be our first time to sit down with these types of people and consider contracts like this, whereas they may have done it several times in other countries and they know how to get the best out of negotiations.</p></speech>

We have marshalled an expert team, some of whom the committee has seen today, some who have spoken and some who have not.  We have also been supported by expert advisers like KPMG and PwC who are well known in corporate finance.  Analysys Mason is probably one of the best known international telecommunication companies when it comes to its understanding of the technology.</p><p>We worked very closely with ComReg on aspects of the national broadband plan and received a great deal of useful advice from it.  The teams we have in place from the external expert advisers are Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran's legal advice.  The teams we have in place from the external legal advisers are highly competent, available to us as needed and working with us in large numbers, in many cases on site in the Department.  Mr. Mulligan has any numbers of experience in telecoms companies, while Mr. Neary has worked in telecoms companies in the private sector.  We have a lot of experience which has stood to us extremely well in the procurement process to date.  The big challenge for us, and we are extremely conscious of this, is how we equip the organisation to face off, which may or may not be the wrong term, in a post-contract governance situation.  We see as part of the next phase of the process, assuming that in the event that a positive decision is taken, that we will gear up immediately to ensure that we have the right commercial, financial, technical, corporate and management advice available to the Department.  The programme for Government refers to the establishment, for want of a better term, of a telecommunications management agency, which would probably be a non-commercial body but with a commercial mandate.  It would have the capacity to hire in people with the expertise that we need.  It would be responsible for the administration and oversight of the national broadband plan, the metropolitan area networks, MANs, emergency call answer centre, and a range of other telecoms functions within the State system.  In truth, the success or failure of this probably hinges on a lot of things but the biggest one is to ensure that we have the most robust governance available to us after the contract award and when people come in to report something to us, whether it is commercial, financial, technical or whatever it is, we have the right people who can face off against them, talk to them, negotiate with them and come up with a resolution on whatever issue that is to the best advantage of the State.</p></speech>

I assume that whatever price subsidy is in the contract will be the price on the day that the contract is signed.  We know that construction inflation is added in to any construction contract and there will be construction involved in getting this network up over a couple of years.  There may be some delays, perhaps for regulatory reasons or caused by different local authorities, which will result in a compensatory claim.  I presume these are all part of the contract.  When we get a contract it is based on the price on the day if it was all delivered today but that will not be the price of the contract if it takes three years and construction inflation must be built in.</p></speech>

Things such as construction inflation have been built into the calculation.  As far as we are concerned, a subsidy cap is a subsidy cap, full stop.</p></speech>

In the area marked dark blue high-speed broadband of 30 Mbps is available today.  The light blue area is where Eir has committed to deliver high-speed broadband and complete the roll-out by the middle of this year.  In the amber area, following state aid rules, we have identified where market failure exists so that no operator intends to deliver high-speed broadband.  That has been the subject of our procurement since we made the change in April 2017 regarding 540,000 premises.</p></speech>

There is some approximation in that because of the level of information available from operators.

We are monitoring that very closely.  The change we made back in 2017 was where we had identified 84,500 premises for which we were confident no operator would serve in the short term.  We brought those back into the amber area.  We continually monitor the progression of developments in the dark blue area from operators.  As the committee will have heard from a number of operators recently, they are continually upgrading and developing the services in cities and towns.</p></speech>

People call us all the time and say Eir is providing broadband down the road from them.  When they call Eir and quote the code, they are told they are in an amber area.  It is up to the Department to provide for them.  Eir is passing the buck to the Department.</p> <p>  Eir knows that there will be a subsidy to provide broadband to that house.  If it provides a connection now, it will be making its own commercial investment.  Why would Eir spend its own money when it knows that there will be a State subsidy, some of which accrues to it for providing the network?  Some people have been in the amber area for a considerable time.  They are seriously disadvantaged by this.  Commercial operators are not going into these areas.  They are letting the customer wait, knowing that whichever provider goes in there in due course will get a subsidy to do so.  Operators are hanging back.  Does Mr. Neary follow my point?</p></speech>

However, the map indicates where there is not much competition for an operator that builds a new network.  If an operator goes into that area, it is likely to be the main operator there.  There is the counterargument.  I refer to Eir's roll-out of broadband to 300,000 premises.  That firm moved into an area where it felt there would not be much competition, if any.  One can look at this both ways.  The map would indicate to operators that there is not a high-speed broadband provider in that area of 84,500 premises.</p></speech>

I call on the Department to make sure that Eir pays well for getting upgraded fibre to its network.  It must not be let off the hook.  Do the witnesses take my point?  Some tens of thousands of people are being connected every year.  Eir's representatives said that the firm could do more.  It was not a commitment, but it might do so.  That company has connected 300,000 premises.  There is no reason it would not do more.  We all know that a point will eventually be reached at which it is not commercially viable for any operator.  Given that the Department started with a figure 757,000 and after a couple of short years it has reached a figure of 543,000, is it possible that this figure could reach 350,000 in another two or three years without any State support?</p></speech>

Some 1.9 million properties have been connected by the private sector without any subsidy.  We probably did not think it would connect that many five years ago.  I am playing the devil's advocate.  The private sector has connected 1.9 million without a penny from the State.  It now sees that the State is going to sign a massive cheque.  Of course commercial firms will hang back, knowing that the taxpayer is going to subsidise the rest of it.  They were never going to complete the 2.3 million, but they could certainly have gone further than they have up to now.  That figure of 1.9 million could be 2.1 million or 2.2 million.  At this point 80% of the work has been done commercially.  Why is 20% the magic figure at which there is no more scope for commercial operations?  I am worried that the existence of  this plan will bring the cost onto the taxpayer.  I am being the devil's advocate by saying that if this subsidy was not there, some of these people would be getting commercial connections.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulligan or someone else mentioned 500 m as the length of a cable.  I cannot recall the exact sentence but at present, in rural areas there may be a box at one point and then another box at another point up the road but the distance to reach the house in between could be another 700 m or 800 m, by the time one gets to it via the driveway, laneway, or farm.  Such rural dwellers probably would have to incur a heavy cost to get this service to their house if they are not in the amber area.  If they are in the amber area, does this plan bring the service to the house or to the edge of the public roadway?  What is going to happen?  The State cannot be expected to pay to get services into everybody's private house.  I hate to say it but when one comes to the edge of my property, it should be my job to take it from there.  Regardless of how I wish to bring it into my house, the taxpayer should not have to pay for it.</p></speech>

If one wishes to keep the comparative wholesale price as it is in other regions, will it be necessary to have an ongoing subsidy after it has all been installed to keep the price down?</p></speech>

In the initial years, this will be part of that cost but over the 25 years it will be the majority of the capital cost.  The model is such that the operating company will stand on its own two feet and will be profitable by virtue of the revenue it will get from consumers.</p></speech>

There is no loss of conductivity and is a totally different product.  It has larger capacity with little or negligible loss of information over distance versus other forms such as wireless which we have had in the past.  This will run along a network like EirGrid - as in the picture essentially - except with cables and spurs then will come off it to go up boreens and to villages, or whatever.  If one does not want to cut down one's trees or for them to be obstructed, one pays an additional fee for aesthetics.</p> <p>  What we are undertaking here is a national broadband plan, which is the infrastructure and the cable, that is, the capital investment.  Thereafter, once the cable is laid one pays one's bill to the companies - the equivalent of Bord G&aacute;is or whatever - which provide the service.  There is therefore a competitive element after the infrastructure has been laid down.</p> <p>  Returning to the 25-year contract, and the additional ten years, will this company have to retender for the additional period?  If there is a preferred bidder with a signed contract, after 25 years will this company have the capacity to extend by another ten years if it wants-----</p></speech>

What we achieved through the contract negotiations dialogue was that as we do not want a cliff edge at year 25, where it might turn off some customers if they are not profitable, we said that we wanted the company to honour that contract for another ten years-----</p></speech>

In year 26, for example, if some person's wire is cut or severed by a shotgun or some such event, the company still will be required to fix it under an extra ten years of the contract.  Consequently, that house or farm will continue to get service at no cost to us.  We achieved that through negotiations.  On the 1,500 pages, it is a 25-year contract, with an extra ten years to honour a service to every customer it has connected at year 25 for another ten years.  That is not relevant to a retendering process, it was just an add-on we had to the existing contract.</p></speech>

One wants a dedicated team of people whose sole job is management of the national broadband plan, the metropolitan area networks, the emergency call answer centre, and the Galway-Mayo duct that we run as well.  There also is a lot of telecoms infrastructure in other bodies like the OPW, for example, where, for the purpose of maximising the value to the State, one would look to bundling that in under one agency.  This would be a small and tight group of people but with all of the skills and the capacity to face off commercial entities, and that can spend money in buying in the best and brightest.  We need to be in a position in the State to ensure that the people who are managing the contract have the necessary skills and it will be a full-time job for them.</p></speech>

Our offshore community has seen the evidence of climate change in a very real and frightening way.  I thank the committee for inviting us here to speak today and I thank the committee members for their work on combatting climate change.  They are taking the first steps in the right direction.</p> <p>  The unfortunate truth, however, is that even though progress is being made and even though Irish politicians have largely been supportive of the climate strikes, we are still not doing enough.  The committee's report is definitely a step in the right direction but we cannot afford to only take steps anymore, we need to make a leap.  Even if every one of the recommendations outlined by the committee were to be implemented by the Government, we would still fall short of our targets.</p><p>Perhaps not our official, internationally agreed-upon ones, but our moral and ethical ones.  </p><p> Ireland is a prosperous developed nation which is heralded throughout Europe as an example of how globalisation can benefit peripheral states in the 21st century.  In recent years, Ireland has undergone progressive social change.  I am proud to call myself Irish because of this.  However, what use is a more progressive, fairer society, if society itself ceases to exist?  This is not an over-dramatisation of the facts.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report from last year is quite clear.  If we do not act now, my generation and the generations to come will suffer.  </p><p> Additionally, I find the repeated appeals by this committee to highlight the positive benefits of climate action, rather than the negative consequences of inaction to be quite surprising and indeed dispiriting.  Climate action does indeed have benefits, benefits which will doubtlessly exceed the cost.  It is vital that we do not forget why we need climate action.  </p><p> One of the main reasons we are in the desperate situation that we are in now is because of the apathy and a general lack of awareness surrounding the issue.  Do not for a second think that we are not in a desperate situation.  It is vital that we communicate this to the public.  Trying to obscure this fact is not only deceptive, it is downright irresponsible.  Today our generation is saying that we demand politicians stop taking baby steps.  Take a leap instead.  Lead us to the future we deserve.  Ireland and the planet cannot afford to wait.  It is time to stop playing politics with our future.</p></speech>

I am 12 years old and a first year student in Cork Educate Together secondary school.</p> <p>  I am not in any way capable of representing more than 15,000 students in the Republic of Ireland and I am not a professional speaker.  I am not here to bore my listeners with my life story.  The politicians present grew up worrying about what jobs they would get, how they would do in exams and who they would fall in love with.  We grow up worrying about the same things, but on top of that, we have the worry about how long we have left to live.  We, as students here, should be enjoying life, having carefree thoughts and not worrying about the future of the world.  Yet we are here telling politicians how to do their job.  </p> <p>  The root of the problem is greed and money being allowed to rule.  We know that Earth has already warmed by 1.1&deg;C since the industrial revolution.  Politicians continue to look at us and say that they are proud of us, but the moment they walk out of this room, the fact that they do not do anything makes us wonder if they are thinking of their image more than they are thinking of us.  To the D&aacute;il and all of the politicians, we say we are beyond furious.  We should not have to be doing this and giving up one of our basic human rights, education, in order to clean up the politicians' mess.  It should not come down to just having 11 years to drastically change what is happening to the earth.  Politicians give us compliments on how amazing it is that schoolchildren are standing up for their futures and said that they were inspired and enthused.  Their compliments are worthless to us without actions.  We signed up to the Paris Agreement, which by the looks of it, everyone has forgotten.</p> <p>  We are Europe's laggards and it should not be that way.  Those politicians who have children love them more than anything else.  Like Greta Thunberg said, these politicians are stealing their futures right in front of their very eyes.  They are stealing my future and have absolutely no right to do that.  I am sorry if this gives offence to any of the politicians present here in any way but they must face the reality.  They are not realising that their greed and delay is harming our very existence or that if we fail there is no "undo" button.  If we are capable of changing the climate, then we are definitely capable of fixing this mess.  The IPCC's latest science report in October 2018 said that the next ten years will be the most important years in history.  I hope the politicians make that count.</p></speech>

I am here to talk about what climate change means to us, as students, and about what needs to be done.  My future and that of my children and my grandchildren depend entirely on what is done now, not what is said, promised or proposed, as empty promises do not change anything.  The only thing that changes the world is action.  The Earth cannot hear one's words.  It cannot tell one what to do or feel one's confusion or denial on the topic.</p> <p>  I will be a voter soon like many other young people so the politicians need to listen to their electorate.  There is such a blindness when it comes to climate change.  People have this mentality that if it is not affecting them it does not matter.  I hope it does not come down to another global disaster like the recent cyclone in Mozambique for actions to take place.  This is only one example of the consequences of climate change.  Our actions have affected the lives of 1.85 million Mozambicans, caused the death of more than 500 vulnerable people, destroyed more than 33,000 houses, damaged 500,000 ha of crops, and devastated families.  Yet nothing is being done and we only have 11 and a half years before climate change becomes irreversible.</p> <p>  Climate change is not just a problem or issue for politicians or adults to tackle.  It is not a problem that young people should be stuck with dealing with alone.  We need every single human on earth to recognise that this is an emergency, and to do that we need to declare one.  We are told that action is taking place, and even paper straws come in plastic packaging.  Agriculture, energy and transport industries accounted for 72.5% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2015.  For 2020, Ireland was given a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below what they were in 2005.  We are currently on target to reduce emissions by less than 1% come 2020.  This is going to result in over &euro;600 million in fines.  </p> <p>  One may think that hope is lost, that we pushed it aside for too long, but that only makes the problem worse.  We must accept that this is happening and we need to do something about it now.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am 16 years of age and from Muff in County Donegal.  My brother Se&aacute;n and I made the journey from Donegal to be here this week.  We needed to cross the Border twice and there is uncertainty as to what that Border is going to look like.  It is not the change of accent, or even the Union Jack colours painted on the kerbs, that lets one know to that one is in Northern Ireland.  It is the solar panels, the windmills and the progressive infrastructure that really lets one know where one is.</p> <p>  Some 30 years ago it would not have been possible to travel with such ease.  Now, as Brexit looms, we are hoping that what we are saying today is not drowned out by the terms - backstop, common travel area or trade union.  We hear enough about that where we live in Muff.  In the past number of years it seems that everything has been about Brexit and nothing has been about climate change, which I can tell all those present is far more important than Brexit.  </p> <p>  The reality is that there is no progressive infrastructure in the north west that I can see and I am sure this is a reflection on the rest of the country.  We want this progressive infrastructure which is physical and eye-catching.  We want windmills, solar panels, houses to be retrofitted, and to see an Ireland that will be carbon neutral by 2030.</p> <p>  We need more free public transport.  I saw a picture on Twitter recently that showed the train systems of the world's major cities: Paris, New York and London with of all the lines that zigzagged each other; it was impossible to keep up with it.  There was then a diagram of Dublin.  It showed one green line and one red line, with a black dotted line in between them saying: "you can walk yourself".</p><p>I know that is a bit outdated but I am sure the committee understands the point I am trying to make. </p><p> About six years ago I was at the Red Cross centre in Muff, which was previously a customs post, when a Red Cross leader, Mr. Bernie Rutherford, told us that children who were then three years old were the last generation who could do anything before it was out of human hands.  My brother was that age at that time and he is nine years old today.  Bernie's message has stayed with me through him.  We hope the message sent on 15 March by more than 10,000 young people on Molesworth Street, more than 15,000 people nationwide and 1.3 million people around the world has come through the thick walls of Leinster House.  It would be naive of me to believe that one protest will be enough to save the world and that is why the protests will continue.  The children are doing all they can to make sure that men and women in positions of power, like the committee members, can hear us.  We cannot vote but that does not mean that our voices will be silenced.  A wave is coming and this is the beginning of a climate action revolution.  In time the people in the Gallery, those sitting behind me and I will all be able to vote, and we will be able to rock the system to the core.  When we do, politicians will know about it. </p></speech>

The reason Greta Thunberg inspired 15,000 people in Ireland and 1.3 million students globally to strike from school in what was probably the biggest school students' strike in history was that she did not sugar-coat things.  She did not say everything is going to be okay because we are going to sort it out by agreeing to something at this conference or that committee.  She said we are doing catastrophic damage to our climate and our ecosystems and we are in big trouble.  It is also worth remembering that on the day of the strike, our Taoiseach said he found the school strikers inspiring.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment attended the march on the day.  However, I think I can say that all of us here were extremely disappointed when the Government hypocritically voted against the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018.  If we are to stay below 2&deg;C degrees of warming we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground.  I would like those present who voted against that Bill to give us a good explanation of why they did so.</p></speech>

Their timing is very important as we sign off on this cross-party report, which I hope and feel will meet their expectations.  They want action and that is what we are providing on a cross-party basis, not just for the lifetime of this Government but for future Governments, in order to reach our climate targets.  I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  They spoke so articulately.  One could hear a pin drop in the room.  It was the most silent session we have had throughout our seven months of meetings.  We look forward to engaging with them in the future.  This standing committee will continue and we will hold the Oireachtas and the Government to account on the implementation of these actions.  Our witnesses deserve a big round of applause.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 46 is in the name of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and seeks to inserts  new recommendation on free public transport.  Amendment No. 35 is also in the name of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and seeks to inserts a new recommendation on taxing agrifood producers.</p><p>On the question, "That Recommendation No. 45 stand part of the report", a division has been challenged and, pursuant to Standing Orders, the division will now be taken by the clerk to the committee.

From Fianna F&aacute;il's and my perspective we were deeply concerned there was no clear methodology to ensure the funds that would be raised by any carbon tax would go back into the greening of our economy.  To that end, it was also vitally important that people who would be affected by an increase in the costs to their home heating and fuel - those who might be referred to as vulnerable to fuel poverty - were catered for, and that they would not feel any economic impact through the introduction of carbon pricing.</p> <p>  I am pleased enough with a compromise text, which is now being circulated.  This ensures and agrees that the proceeds from carbon pricing should be ring-fenced in legislation to ensure that any moneys from a carbon pricing regime would not go into the general Exchequer funding.  A fund would be created, the moneys from which would be used to assist people in making the transition away from fossil fuels and towards our objective to have a carbon neutral society.  In addition, the implementation of a carbon pricing trajectory should only be implemented when an evidence-based plan is in place to increase supports and incentives for climate action measures, including the protection of those vulnerable to fuel poverty.  The wording of the proposed amendment is now in the circulated text.  I am prepared to answer any questions on this.</p></speech>

While we are talking technically about amendments that are on the table to be agreed or voted upon, the Labour Party has two very specific amendments Nos. 26 and 27.  On the basis of the agreed text that has now come forward - agreed by the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, we are now happy to withdraw our amendments.  We feel that the proposal of the compromise for mechanisms to be put in place to look at how carbon taxes would affect those people in fuel impoverished houses - and that a mechanism is put in place so the most vulnerable people are protected - means we can sign up to this.  At this stage, I am quite happy to withdraw amendments No. 26 and 27.</p></speech>

I remind people again that carbon pricing increasing over time to 2030 is not a revenue-raising measure.  It is designed to change all of our behaviour and how we live.  We have plenty of carrot, but some measures need an element of stick also.  We hope that this would change how people make decisions, knowing the trajectory is there, and it would give them certainty so they can plan accordingly.  This is why we see that as so important.  Carbon pricing is only one element of a suite of measures to address those areas.</p> <p>  Another key priority for Fine Gael has been the area of consultation.  It is important for us to have key engagement across all sectors including: town hall meetings, Tidy Towns groups, local branch and county executives of farming organisations and environmental organisations.  We want as much consultation and engagement as possible in a short, sharp period in order that we get buy-in on how any increased revenue is best used in order to have the impact we want.  It is also important to us that the ring-fencing element makes sure that this funding is all for climate action measures.</p> <p>  When we started out on this journey last July, we were acutely aware that 21 politicians from different backgrounds across a variety of views were very unlikely to agree on everything but I believe there is an acceptance among a lot of us - although I will just speak on behalf of my own colleagues - that without a shadow of a doubt this is the issue of our generation.  A solution to this issue will take a lot more than the electoral cycle of four to five years.  In that regard, consensus is very important to us.  This is why we are willing to agree to this.  We are not happy about every little thing, as nobody will be.  There are elements of certain things one would like a little more of but the art of compromise is absolutely key in politics.  For an issue of this importance, the consequences of which go far beyond the electoral cycle and beyond the next general election and others, it is very important to have that general consensus as far as possible across the political divide.  This is why we agree to this amendment here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#J01900"><p>I agree with the two previous speakers.  It is very important and significant and it is a good day for Irish climate policy when there is clear agreement, but I acknowledge that among certain parties there are different views, which is perfectly valid.  Among a number of parties, however, there is agreement that we will accept the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council to raise the carbon price to &euro;80 per tonne, at least, by 2030.</p> <p>  There is real importance in the clear commitment that we are ring-fencing any such revenue.</p><p>We still have to decide whether it is for hypothecation or whether it is a dividend that is returned to the citizens.  There is real advantage in that latter option in regard to protecting those on lower incomes in particular.  It has real advantages in that if people are saving energy, they are getting more net cash gain from it.  If there are proposals on how hypothecation would work better, that is what we need to work out in the next few months in a plan, and we should be open to different options.  If someone else comes up with a brilliant version of what we could do with the money, that should not be ruled out.  This is significant in that it is cast-iron.  If this consensus makes its way into the decision not just of this Government but probably of a future Government, although it depends who gets elected, that is a significant gain for environmental policy.  The revenue is not a tax to raise money.  It is a tax to give a signal and to help the climate action we need to take.<br/><br/>Third, with regard to the new amendments, tying this to an evidence-based plan makes rational and obvious sense.  We have to prepare that plan under law.  The European governance package that was agreed sets out that we have to have a national energy and climate action plan by the end of the year.  That will be a plan that has to direct what we are going to do over the next ten years to 2030, so of course we have to do this.  The work of this committee from now until the end of the year is to assist the Government in the development of that plan and to open up that process as the EU governance system encourages.  What we have done in this committee is probably one of the exemplar models within the EU, if one talks to European Commission officials about how parliaments should engage in that process.  We have started well by having a Citizens' Assembly, by going into committee in public session and by going into our own private sessions, so that is a good process.  Those three gains are very good and significant.<br/><br/>The one risk I fear is that this is such a politically contentious issue.  It is the issue the media will talk about above anything else.  They will never talk about governance, climate systems or retrofitting, which is not that sexy, or about changing land use or peatlands restoration, which is where we could make the big carbon savings but which are hard to get on the six o'clock news.  We do not need carbon tax to become a political football, bouncing around for the next ten years and certainly not for the next six months.  We all know there is a risk in the next six months as we go into a potentially tough budget and I do not want carbon tax to be in the middle of that.  We have a chance here to give certainty, and to get it out from the political game and into policy would help.  It is not the key measure.  It will do 10% to 15% of what we need to do but given we have a 70% gap, 10% is significant.<br/><br/>I have one further amendment to put.  The second page of the draft recommendations as presented states:</p><blockquote>In view of the above:<br /><br />That the Minister for Finance should set out a carbon price trajectory that rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030...</blockquote><p>My amendment proposes the wording: &quot;That the Minister for Finance should set out a compromise price trajectory that, starting in 2020, rises to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030&quot;.  I believe there is agreement on this, although those who do not agree with a carbon tax do not agree with it starting in any year.  However, among those of us who have been arguing in favour of this, my understanding throughout our negotiations and deliberations is that there has been common agreement that this is something that will start this year.  Having heard the call from the students, some of whom are still in the Visitors Gallery, I believe we should act now.  We should start this year and not wait 12 years.  If we do not start next year, we all know that, in politics, the year after that is not going to be any easier.  In fact, this is probably the moment in time more than any other moment because of those climate strikes putting pressure on us to get this over the line.  I put forward that amendment to make sure we are clear that this would start in 2020.  Other than that, our party backs the proposal.</p></speech>

For the past eight months the committee has operated in a collaborative way and, overnight, how the committee operates has changed in that we are suddenly told a substantial cross-party amendment has been submitted and this is the first sight we have of it.  That flies in the face of how things have worked to date.  As the Vice Chairman of the committee, I want to express my disappointment with that.</p> <p>  The amendment in front of us is obviously to give some cover to Fianna F&aacute;il in regard to what is happening here.  We have set out our case in this regard.  There is now a proposal for another amendment to an amendment.  Sinn F&eacute;in has an amendment that we want to put here today, if these amendments are going to be allowed to go before the committee.  I propose that these amendments be allowed.</p> <p>  This decision to increase is going ahead.  We want to change how things are done and we want to change the volume of carbon emissions being pumped into the atmosphere.  We have heard the evidence over the past eight months and, before that, the evidence was heard by the committee of the previous D&aacute;il, which dealt with legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in sought stronger legislation that had binding sectoral targets, although, unfortunately, we did not achieve that.  The fact is that what we are doing here today is giving the green light to further increase carbon tax after the increase a few years ago.  In effect, with VAT and everything else on top, what we are talking about is &euro;2.50 on a bale of briquettes and in the region of &euro;12 on a bag of fuel.</p> <p>  We want to move away from fossil fuels and we have spoken at length about this.  There is a lot of good stuff in the report, which we have backed.  There are nine chapters in the report and we made proposals that fed into that in a constructive and collaborative way, and there is much in it to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to act in a more sustainable way-----</p></speech>

There is also the issue of the Border.  If carbon taxes are being increased on one side of the Border and not increased on the other side, that needs to be considered.  It was said this revenue will be ring-fenced.  I listened carefully to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about the sugar tax and whether it could be ring-fenced and used for health purposes.  Those who took the time to listen to him will have heard the answer clearly, although perhaps a member of the Government party will want to challenge that.  The fact is that, as we sit here to discuss this, the poorest of households are not insulated and do not have the means to retrofit.  We have a weak public transport system, particularly beyond the M50.  Businesses are struggling day to day with higher costs upon costs, including rates and energy costs.  I remind the committee that energy costs have risen by an average of 24% in the past few years and over 10% since last August, which needs to be considered.  The people who are renting over 300,000 homes in the State are in the most poorly insulated houses with the most inefficient and expensive means of heating.</p><p>What happens to those people?  Where is the protection for them in the report?  We propose amending chapter 6, page 43, to delete all references to carbon taxes in the document and to recommend no increases to carbon tax.</p></speech>

At the beginning of the meeting, however, when I entered the room, I learned that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party and the Green Party have connived because it is not a cross-party amendment but rather one created by those four parties in an attempt to alienate the Sinn F&eacute;in members and perhaps one or two other members.  I am comfortable with alienation and I do not mind it because it just goes over my head.  I am not comfortable, however, with the alienation of the people we represent, whom we have widely consulted, or that we were not consulted in respect of this amendment.  We are present to ensure social justice.  One cannot say that we as a party are not doing our environmental patriotic duty or that we are somehow against the greening of our economy, nation and all our lives.</p> <p>  I second Deputy Stanley's amendment.  Carbon pricing or carbon tax - whatever name one wants to use - is not progressive; it is regressive, and it hurts the people we most need to protect and the people who will protect our country and planet, but we are punishing and blaming them and making them feel guilty.  The Government needs to take that on board.  It is disappointing and socially unjustifiable to introduce a carbon tax, which is why I am passionate about the matter.  I thank the committee for including us in the collaborative, cross-party discussions.  I am very upset.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#L00300"><p>I have listened to the discussion on the matter again and I reiterate that it is similar to Henry Ford saying the customer can have a car in any colour he or she wants as long as it is black.  No matter how one rephrases or restructures the mechanism in the document, it will still say ordinary people will be subject to an increase in carbon tax and that their personal and individual behaviour will be addressed by taxing it, but that the Government refuses to consider the behaviour or recklessness of agribusiness and the fossil fuel industry.  I presume that many members read the reports in the newspapers in respect of two matters, the first of which was the IEA telling us that global emissions hit record levels in the second half of last year, rising by 1.7%.  As was strikingly outlined to us by the young people, we need to take leaps, not baby steps, yet all we are doing by increasing carbon tax for ordinary people is a baby step, not a leap.</p> <p>  The other report in the paper is probably even more interesting in respect of my argument.  Several leading Irish companies have been named and shamed for not reporting their greenhouse gas emissions to CDP, a not-for-profit organisation which measures companies' impact on the environment.  It highlighted prominent names, including Paddy Power Betfair, Ryanair, Permanent TSB, Total Produce and Applegreen, for not responding to its mission survey.  We are concerned about the individual behaviour of people who are rightly identified in some of the paragraphs as suffering from fuel poverty, although one does not need to qualify for fuel allowance to suffer from fuel poverty, as we have argued time and again.  We want to conduct surveys and national reports on the subject, which is correct, but we do not want to deal with the glaringly obvious issue, namely, that industry and agribusiness, on a large scale, have more to answer for than the individual behaviour of my constituents or the Chairperson's constituents, yet they are all we seem to have in our sights.</p> <p>  I was gobsmacked that after the committee had heard all its evidence, a report was dropped in to it to justify carbon tax.  I strongly disagree with the report, however, and, as I noted earlier, it was drafted and assembled by economists - not by environmentalists or scientists - to justify wrongly why carbon tax works, even though evidence exists to counter that claim.  There have been many global and international reports which show that carbon tax does not reduce emissions by more than 1% or 2%.  Carbon tax fails in the reduction of emissions and the reduction it yields is limited compared with the reduction there would be from the other measures we recommend.  Members have stated it is not a revenue-raising measure but then they discuss how we can spend it.  If it is about changing behaviour, why are we not examining changing the behaviour of those who commit the worst mortal sins in respect of emissions internationally?  We will not deal with that because it is too controversial.  It would be a leap rather than a step but it is a political leap that members of the committee seem unwilling to take.  </p> <p>  I request an adjournment to allow us to read the report.  I want to take it seriously but it has just landed in front of me.  I have not had time to scrutinise it and would like an adjournment to consider it.  I would also like to draw the committee's attention to a measure in the penultimate paragraph, namely, that the Government should conduct a fuel poverty survey of of all cohorts and should show the short, medium and long-term impact of carbon tax on fuel poverty and the options to increase the tax.  I tabled a comprehensive amendment that was removed from the body of the text and inserted into the section relating to carbon tax.  It puts me, as an opponent of carbon tax on ordinary people, into the position of voting against the entire amendment, including my amendment, which is grossly unfair.  That amendment on fuel poverty, which I introduced to the committee, should stand alone, it should be decoupled from carbon tax, and we should be allowed to vote on it separately.  I will certainly not be compromised nor be put in the position of voting against my own amendment after weeks of debate.</p></speech>

They seem to be satisfied with inserting an amendment that calls on the Government at some future date to increase supports and incentives for climate action measures.  It is utterly contradictory within a 24-hour period, given that the Government has had ample opportunity to propose help or provide alternatives.  It is crystal clear that people want to reduce emissions and it is our job to make it feasible for them to do so, but to drive that behavioural change we must provide alternatives.  The Government has not done that to date and there is no indication that it will.  If we are serious about the issue, we will have to invest in retrofitting homes, providing fuel alternatives, and improving and providing a sustainable public transport network throughout the State, but in every such aspect the Government has failed dismally.  I do not know how Fianna F&aacute;il believes the matter will provide it cover, or perhaps the Government has indicated when it will provide the investment and retrofitting of houses.</p><p>Let us take, for example, a family which lives in rural Ireland and has a poorly insulated house.  One person must drive an old car to work each day and bring the children to and from school.  Is it seriously being suggested that increasing carbon tax by a factor of four will assist that family?  I would have thought we would be progressive enough to insist the Government act in advance of any additional charges.</p></speech>

It states that it should only be implemented when an evidence-based plan is in place to increase supports and incentives for climate action measures, including the protection of those vulnerable to fuel poverty.  The Deputy talked about the necessity for evidence but it is catered for in that section.  Given the trajectory between now and 2030, it would be 63 cent on a bag of coal, 13 cent on a bale of briquettes and 1.5 cent on a litre of diesel.  Those of us who drive petrol or diesel cars will have noticed the fluctuation in the fuel price over the past number of months.  It has gone from a low in the past six months of &euro;1.05 or &euro;1.06 per litre to approximately &euro;1.40 at the moment.</p> <p>  We can all find ways to be against the issues at the heart of this or we can try to reach a consensus on putting in place an appropriate response to a crisis which young people begged us to address by taking leaps.  Some people are suggesting we should leap to solve the problem by putting it on somebody else's shoulders.  Large emitters of carbon and greenhouse gases will suffer most under this kind of progressive approach to pricing carbon.  The big business against which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith rails, which also happen to be significant employers in the agrifood sector, will have to pay more as a result of this.  They will have to pay more in the cost of their inputs, which will assist them in transitioning from being heavy polluters of the atmosphere with carbon.  The knock-on effect will be to ensure that there is a move away from the harmful products of Exxon Mobil and the other exploration companies, which the Deputy rightly identified as problematic.  By changing behaviour, it will achieve what she wants, which is to put these companies out of business.</p></speech>

Carbon tax is in existence and yields approximately &euro;400 million but that &euro;400 million goes to the Exchequer.  This committee is seeking to ring-fence moneys collected from the tax so that retrofitting can be done and we can transition from carbon to meet our targets.</p> <p>  If we agree to this amendment the Government would conduct a review, to be completed by June 2019, of what may be the most appropriate measure and what is the nature and extent of fuel poverty across all cohorts.  We are building into the amendment a set of measures that seeks to protect the most vulnerable but ensures that we do not move until the review has been done.  June 2019 may be too short a timeframe and it may need to be pushed out to July.  It is important that we study what is in the amendment first, before we draw any conclusions.</p></speech>

Many people came before us but when the Climate Change Action Advisory Council came before us and Professor Fitzgerald made his professional evidence known, we saw where we needed to go as regards carbon tax.  The council's advice was clear that the carbon tax needed to go to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, meaning that over the next 11 years, we will raise carbon tax by &euro;20 per tonne to &euro;80.  We sat here listened to the professional advice that was given, we questioned it and we took it on board.

He articulated an interesting thesis that sounds plausible.  It would be great if companies such as Glanbia, the Goodman companies and Exxon Mobile and all of the global corporations would have to pay more towards carbon emissions, which would be ring-fenced to help poor people change their behaviour.  It is a great thesis, but there is no empirical evidence for it anywhere in the world.  My problem is that the committee allowed an ESRI-Climate Action report on why carbon tax must be increased to &euro;80 a tonne - it is quoted in the amendment - to be dropped into the middle of the proceedings and did not allow time for counter evidence.  There is no evidence to back up Deputy Dooley's claim that this tax would be passed on to the global emissions of the dirtiest industries in the world.  This tax will be passed on to ordinary people, end of story.  That is why I say that one can have any colour car one wants as long as it is black.</p><p>I want my motion decoupled.  I will go back to the original text that I proposed in paragraph 4 in the original chapter on financing climate change.</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the Government conduct a review to be completed by June 2019 into the most appropriate measure of, extent and nature of fuel poverty across all cohorts and to include in this review the short, medium and long-term impact of increasing the carbon tax.</blockquote> <p>I do not believe this amendment goes anywhere near it.

That is very smart, but I do not swallow it.  I hope that nobody in the Gallery or among the public swallows it either.  It is the one measure that the committee will be renowned for.  The message is we should not think of touching the global corporations or about free public transport; one would be nuts to think about it; we should not think of increasing the amount we spend on public transport; we should not go near agri-business or Larry Goodman or Glanbia, but we should go after every man, woman and child in the country and put more tax on them.  That is what Deputy Dooley is doing.</p></speech>

There is nothing concrete in it and he should know better than to rely on the Government when the Government has not done anything so far.  The Government has had ample time since the committee was set up to propose alternative ways of assisting people to drive that behavioural change.  Deputy Dooley's amendment is that when an evidence-based plan is in place, supports and incentives should be increased.  It is a little cosy amendment that is well worded in the sense that is says everything and nothing, but at the same time all it does is endorse the carbon tax for all the reasons that Fianna F&aacute;il opposed it 24 hours ago.</p> <p>  Overall this report is very good and we are supportive of the majority of the recommendations.  One has to provide alternatives to drive behavioural changes.  We could not support the proposals on carbon tax in chapter 6, but we fully support the majority of the chapters.  Yesterday, the Fianna F&aacute;il members made the same case as we in Sinn Fein did, so perhaps they would like to support our amendment, which deletes chapter 6 and any references to carbon tax in the report.  We would have a fine report, which  incorporates all of the other recommendations that the majority support.  We should omit the carbon tax proposals until such time as we get a solid commitment to a plan, timeframe, scale and date from the Government as to when it will offer alternatives to drive that behavioural change.</p></speech>

The figures published by the Department of Finance on 19 December 2018, which were reported by the national broadcaster that day, stated that there would be a &euro;10.50 carbon tax increase on a bag of fuel and an increase of &euro;2.25 on a bail of briquettes.  We tabled a parliamentary question about those carbon tax figures earlier this week and the reply stated that the figures do not include VAT.  One is, therefore, talking about an increase in the region of &euro;12 on a bag of fuel and &euro;2.60 on a bail of briquettes.</p></speech>

This decision has been taken without looking at all the international evidence or even a cross section of it.  It was based on selective information.  We have examined what has happened in other countries which have a carbon tax and some that do not.  We have had a carbon tax since 2010, and apart from the recession between 2010 and 2015 when the country almost closed down and there was a slight reduction in emissions, there has been no decrease in emissions.</p><p>We brought forward a document last year, Powering Ireland 2030, which was based on a year's research carried out by people working for us, talking to experts and anybody to whom we could talk in the industry.  It set out a way of powering the 32 counties of Ireland by 2030.  It would have meant an 80% switch to renewable energy sources.  Members will note that in the report - we have fought hard to get it in - there would be a 70% switch to renewable energy sources by 2030.  It is good that it is included.  We obviously argued for a figure of 80%.  There is a lot of good stuff in the report which contains nine chapters.  We are very happy with the measures across them, but we must change the way we generate power because, more and more, heating systems will be electrified.  Therefore, we will need more electricity.  More and more transport services will be electrified also, but we cannot simply think we can drive around in what look like nice eco-friendly electric vehicles powered by electricity supplied from fossil fuel or nuclear power plants in England via a cable across the Irish Sea.  We are in favour of the interconnector, but we need to generate power on this island from clean sources of energy.  Many expert groups have set out a vision for how this can be done.  We have tapped into it and believe the committee's document would go some way towards doing so, which is welcome, but we cannot simply put a carbon tax on people without a shift in the way of how we generate power, heat our homes and move about and without making it easier to cycle and use public transport and having a good network of charging points, including in rural Ireland, to enable people to use electric vehicles.  If the Government simply levies this tax, all that it will do is crucify middle and low income households and particularly small businesses.</p></speech>

We had before us professionals to whom we all listened and some of them told us that a carbon tax might prove useful.  We also carried out our own research and the jury is still out on the issue which we have spent eight or nine months discussing.  Regardless, the professionals gave us their scientific opinion in their areas of expertise, but what was not taken into account was the impact on ordinary families and individuals, on whom such a tax would place the heaviest burden.  Senator Lombard accused me of playing to the electorate.  I am not; I am representing it.  That is what I am doing.  I do not play to the electorate; rather, I represent the people who are terrified about from where the next washing machine will come because they do not have the cash to buy it.</p></speech>

They are about accepting the necessity for a price trajectory in carbon pricing, from &euro;20 per tonne to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  That is where we need clarity.  The amendment reads: "And this should only be implemented when an evidenced-based plan is in place".  To me, the words "in place" mean that it is available.  The amendment goes on to state: "To increase supports and incentives for climate action measures, including the protection of those vulnerable to fuel poverty".  If there is any doubt about the meaning of the term "in place" or further qualification is needed, it is in the second paragraph which reads: "The Government should, prior to the introduction of any increase in carbon taxation, examine the impacts [etc.]... introduce specific policy measures to assist those who may not be in a position to immediately transition from fossil fuels, including the potential use of social protection mechanisms, such as tax credits and welfare payments".</p> <p>  It is worth remembering that this is a committee of the Houses.  It is not the Cabinet room.  Having heard the evidence, we are collectively making suggestions and recommendations etc. to this and future Governments.  It is not for us to take a decision and set the budget which we are not deciding today.  We are not deciding specific policies.  We will have other opportunities to do so as we have all been fortunate to be elected as Members of the Houses.  This is an effort, on a cross-party basis, to make recommendations to the Government.  We were very strongly of the view that our suggestions needed to be in sequence.  The strong recommendation from the party I represent is adamant that we not progress with an increase in carbon charges until such time as recommendations had been made and a plan and incentives had been put in place.  That is very clear in the language used.  I do not know how we could be more helpful because I accept that Deputies Stanley and Munster and Senator Devine have engaged fully and proactively in the campaign.  We largely agree on all aspects of it, but I am not surprised that they have an issue because they have flagged it on a few occasions with the idea of increases in carbon pricing.  That is a fact and there is no issue for me.</p> <p>  Let us not try to indicate that any of us has greater care than others for those on lower incomes.  We are all mindful of them and trying to ensure that, as we transition from fossil fuels, we will protect the people who are most vulnerable to fuel poverty.  That is inherent in the recommendation.  Can we direct the Government to do it from here?  No, we cannot because we are not sitting at the Cabinet table, but, as a collective, we have an opportunity to put it forward.  I am clear that if the Government was to follow the advice of the committee and its expressed opinion and if it was true to the report, it would have to put appropriate measures in place to protect those who, as Senator Devine rightly identified, are not in a position to change a car that is ten years old or older, to undertake a deep retrofit of their home or to pay the additional &euro;0.63 on a bag of coal that would have an impact on them on a yearly basis.  It is hardwired in the report that the moneys that would be collected would be ring-fenced by a legislative provision in order that they could be used to assist people in making the behavioural change required.  The wording is very clear.</p> <p>  We are all concerned that this or a future Government might seek to cherry-pick elements of the report and state, for example, that as it recommended an increase in tax, we should grab it, include it in the bottom line and use it to fill a hole in the Exchequer figure.  The report states the Government should not do that.  It states it has to identify the appropriate supports and mechanisms to assist those who will be impacted on negatively by an increase in carbon taxes, that plans and schemes need to be put in place and available before charging starts or there are increases in the charges already made.  That is why the party I represent, Fianna F&aacute;il, is happy to proceed with it.</p><p>We did not have a change of heart.  We were always very clear, both within these walls and publicly, that we supported carbon pricing as part of the climate change agenda.  It was not the be-all and end-all but a component in shifting behaviour.  The carbon pricing set out would not be limited to individuals.  It would impact on businesses also.  I have to reiterate the point to my good friend Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that it is about assisting and encouraging bigger companies, in particular, because they are the ones that use the largest amounts of fossil fuels and contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions.  It is in their financial interests to migrate from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.  This would be a progressive way of assisting them in doing so.</p><p> There is a wider debate, in which the Deputy and I differ significantly, about the role of big business in an economy, etc. but the ideological debates are for elsewhere.  This is about responding to the chaos and crisis we face in addressing climate change within the next 12 to 13 years.  This would be a contribution.  We must be careful and mindful in introducing measures that we do not leave people behind or make their lives even more difficult and intolerable.</p><p> I want to return to the numbers which were raised earlier.  Based on my calculations, a bag of coal which in today's money costs &euro;17 would see an increase of 63 cent year on year.  VAT, if added, would another 7 cent, giving a total increase of 70 cent a year.  The current price of a bale of briquettes is &euro;4.50, to which 13 cent would be added.  VAT would add about another 1 cent.  Diesel was the source of Deputy Munster's greatest concern.  Coming from a rural constituency and representing people in rural Ireland, both in the agriculture sector and those who have to commute on a daily basis, I share that concern.  As I have rightly identified, the fluctuation in the price of diesel has been in the region of 30 to 35 cent in the past six months.  The increase in carbon pricing, year on year, would be about 1.5 cent.  That is what would be washed into it, so to speak.</p></speech>

I like the idea of there being a trajectory because it would provide certainty.  It would tell people who were planning for the future and in the automotive industry that diesel and petrol would become more expensive such that I hope they would take action to meet the demands of society.  However, there would be a requirement for the State to provide additional revenue from Exchequer resources to assist in the massive effort that has to be made to undertake a deep retrofit of homes.  Resources will have to be provided from the broader Exchequer, not just those raised from the carbon tax.</p></speech>

I am looking at my original request which was taken out by the advisers, not by a vote of this committee.  The sentence did not finish with "to include in this review the short, medium and long-term impact of increasing the carbon tax."  It read: "that would be taken into consideration for all cohorts prior to any decision being taken to increase carbon tax."  Those last words are important.</p></speech>

It is a qualification within a recommendation.  If the Government goes down the carbon tax route, we suggest that should be done in a certain way.  I do not profess to be a scholar of English, but it makes absolute sense to me that it remains as it is.  We are only talking about the positioning of the text here.

It is amendment No. 29 on page 49.  We have already discussed this.  It reads:</p><blockquote>The committee recommends that the Department of Finance commission an inquiry into the revenue that could be realised through the introduction of a carbon tax on the profits of corporations and firms directly linked to the production and sale of gas, oil, coal and other fossil fuels.  That inquiry should also look at the revenue that could be realised from the imposition of a carbon tax and the profits of other corporations and firms linked to high usage of fossil fuels, including aviation, shipping etc.</blockquote> <p>We discussed this matter earlier, and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith made-----</p></speech>

We have spent days, if not weeks, agonising about a carbon tax on the population but only a tiny amount of time really analysing what could be done.  This could be the leap forward or the magnanimous step that we need to take to realise what is going on according to the IPCC, the United Nations and the International Energy Agency.  However, we have hardly looked at it.</p></speech>

As I said in the discussion last night, we introduced such a tax in our time in government.  Unfortunately, there was a problem at the Supreme Court.  I believe we should go back and look at that experience.  The problem was a technicality in the courts, as I recall it.  I agree that such a report or inquiry would be useful.  If that mechanism is not possible then we should look at some other way.  I support it.</p></speech>

I am jumping ahead a little but I am keen to conclude our work - we are nearly done.  After this there are two textual amendments.  Recommendations Nos. 1 and 15 relate to the text in the chapters.  If there are votes to be called, they should be called at the same time as this recommendation and the two textual amendments so that we are not calling eight minute votes every time.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We have to suspend while there is a vote in the D&aacute;il.  We will come back after the D&aacute;il vote and go straight into these votes and finalise the report.</p></speech>

I understand the sensitivity attached to agriculture for many Deputies, but the amendment relates to fossil fuel production.  It goes to the heart of the global problem and the notion of keeping fossil fuels in the ground so as not to burn carbon.  I argue as well and as often as I can for this movement.  I can do so again, but, with due respect to the nature of this discussion and discourse, I would like to hear the arguments against the amendment.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 15 are in the name of Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  Amendment No. 1 proposes, on page 6, line 166, to delete the word "poor" and replace it with "appalling".  Amendment No. 15 proposes, on page 39, line 1367, after "shall arise from continued climate change" to insert "Meanwhile, corporations are being allowed to accrue vast profits from the production and extraction of fossil fuels without reference to the long-term costs being imposed on society".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#AA00300"><p>I will say a quick word about the amendments.  The replacement of the word "poor" with "appalling" is significant because it is in chapter 1 which is the preamble in the whole context in which we are having this long debate and scrutiny of what is going on and how we adjust to climate change.  If we are to be really honest and show leadership, to young people in particular, we have to say we are not just poor but awful in dealing with carbon emissions.  Use of the word "appalling" is appropriate in that context.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 15 is much more appropriate now that the amendment providing for an investigation into the taxes paid by and the profits of the fossil fuels industry has been carried.  It is very appropriate that amendment No. 15 be made to the text considering this change which I was not expecting and which was due to Fianna F&aacute;il supporting the earlier amendment.</p></speech>

However, there is also a recognition that we need fossil fuels as part of the transition.  I am a little concerned that there is over-demonisation.  I know where we need to get to and how we should get there, but I do not think this language would add anything.  It was suggested we were appealing to the kids, but actually we are not.</p></speech>

I could not care less whether the word "poor" or "appalling" is used.  On to whom or what we are sending a signal, this is a report that will go to the Government from Members of the Oireachtas who are seeking to have stuff done.  That may be the reason the report has been allowed to become too broad, but I do not have a view on the matter one way or the other.  I just think we should try to wrap it up.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 15 seems to suggest there is a conspiracy in the use of the phrase "being allowed to accrue".  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith might believe there is.</p></speech>

For that reason, I am content in saying we need to fix and change the system in place.  Creating bogeymen in the form of the big oil companies is not necessarily the way to go.  We need to show the pathway to change.  I am more interested in looking at how we can get from where we are to where we need to be.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith was not prepared to accept some of the other measures proposed.</p></speech>

I accepted lots of measures.  I have accepted so many it is unbelievable.  A lot of the stuff I wanted was changed by way of the advisers meeting each other and saying, "Get that out and put that in."  I am coming back to it now and asking for contextual changes.</p></speech>

I want to be very clear that they have played an extremely beneficial role.  Had it not been for my own, Anja Murray, I would have been at a serious loss in the work the committee has done.</p><p>I do not want people to have the impression that the advisers were anything less than courteous and professional and that they sought to work together even when there were significant differences of opinion in respect of policy issues.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Heydon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#BB00400"><p>I concur with Deputy Sherlock.  With the exception of yesterday, this is the first time we have been in public session since January.  The public would not be aware of the detailed work of every member of the committee, greatly assisted by our advisers because it is so technical and because of the range of issues involved.  I record our appreciation of all the advisers.  Just as we have done, they have worked across party divides as far possible in an attempt to reach consensus.</p> <p>  The point Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is making about large corporations just feeds into the narrative of those who are opposed to any increase in carbon pricing needing a bogeyman.  I have heard the phrase "ordinary people" many times and it jars with me every time.  It is as if I did not represent ordinary people, as if every member of this committee did not represent ordinary people and as if some people had a monopoly on caring for the poor, vulnerable and weak.  We are all in politics to help people.  We might have a different approach to how we do that.  In order to have the view that there is no need for carbon taxes, they need to claim there are rich people or there is a pot of money somewhere so that ordinary people do not have to make any contribution along the way.  That narrative is just not true.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#BB00500"><p>We have gone through a unique process, involving the advisers giving input at a very early stage.  We have all learned much from the advisers and any criticism of the advisers at this stage is unfortunate.  Other committees should look at the process and how we got essential technical input to make these decisions.</p> <p>  We are trying to ensure we have fair play across the board and I do not believe the amendment has any standing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1638" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019032800002#BB00600"><p>I publicly apologise for the impression given to the advisers that I somehow disrespect them; I do not at all.  My intent was to show that the advisers are there to reflect what those whom they are advising want in the report.  I do not think any of them would disagree with that.  They have to reflect what the parties on whose behalf they are working want in the report, as my adviser has attempted to do for me.  This is the reference to "poor" was a political decision by those they represent to minimise the language used and make Ireland not look so bad when it comes to climate change.  Our record is appalling but if members want to use the word "poor" that is fair enough.  In Deputy Heydon's contribution, I have had an answer as to why there is opposition to putting a tax on the profits of the fossil fuel companies.  I tried to get that answer earlier on, but I am very grateful to get that answer now.</p> <p>  I have no disrespect whatsoever for the advisers and all the work they have done.  I disrespect the political views of some of the people around the table, but that is life.</p></speech>

I know we were in public session today and yesterday, but we have worked very well together.  I also thank the members of the secretariat, led by Mr. Ted McEnery, who have done fantastic work.  All of this work goes unnoticed under the radar.  I also thank all the advisers sitting in the Gallery who have done Trojan work.  They have put in hours of work behind the scenes and have worked with us constructively - all parties and none.  I also thank all the witnesses who appeared before the committee and in particular the members of the Citizens' Assembly, without whose work we would not be completing this cross-party report.  This is a unique report, the first of its kind on climate change by the Oireachtas.  It is a first but important step.  I look forward to working with members on the standing committee.</p></speech>

On 19 December 2018, the D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimates for Public Services in respect of the following Votes be referred to this committee for consideration.  They are Vote 27 - International Co-operation and Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Today's meeting will consider the Revised Estimates for both Votes and report back to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  On behalf of the select committee, I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Cannon.  I also welcome officials from the Department and thank them for the briefing provided in advance of the meeting.  The proposed format is that the committee will deal with the Votes on a programme-by-programme basis, the T&aacute;naiste will give a brief overview of Vote 28, and, at the outset of the consideration of each programme, he will give an overview of the programme, including outlining any pressures likely to impact on his Department's performance or expenditure relating to the programme in 2019.  The floor will then be open for questions from members.  I ask that they put their questions on the specific programme so that we can progress in as orderly and efficient a manner as possible.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They can also adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  Members received briefing documents on the Revised Estimates.  I invite the T&aacute;naiste to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#E00500"><p>I am pleased to present to the committee the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2019.  I will focus on Vote 28, which is the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, while the Minister of State will address the committee afterwards regarding Vote 27, which deals with international co-operation, which is the bulk of the expenditure for which my Department is responsible.</p> <p>  Last month, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and I launched, A Better World, Ireland's new policy for international development, and reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to making progress on delivering the UN 0.7 % target by 2030.  A Better World sets out our vision for Ireland's contribution to international development looking forward to 2030 and is a statement of Ireland's commitment to global citizenship.  Expanding our development co-operation is an investment in a better, safer and more sustainable planet.  </p> <p>  Members will have seen the advance briefing notes provided by my Department on the two Votes, which summarise the main activities and priorities under each expenditure programme corresponding with my Department's high-level goals.</p><p>For 2019, the overall gross Estimate for the foreign affairs and trade group of Votes, namely Votes 27 and 28, is &euro;802 million compared with &euro;754 million in 2018,  This is an overall increase of &euro;48 million, or 6.4%.  The Vote 28 allocation sees an overall increase of &euro;19 million, or 8%.  The Vote 28 priorities for 2019 include, as one might expect Brexit, the passport reform programme and the operational side of a passport service dealing with a significant increase in the number of applications, Northern Ireland, the expansion of the overseas mission network under the Global Ireland 2025 initiative, provision for urgent capital building and security works at our missions abroad, continuing investment in the Department&rsquo;s global ICT network and addressing increased operating cost pressures abroad across the mission network.</p><p> Understandably, budget 2019 had a particular focus on Brexit readiness measures and further initiatives and information have been rolled-out since then.  I secured additional funding for my Department to increase staffing and capacity at headquarters and in key Irish embassies and for the Brexit preparedness communications team, which has been active.  Under Global Ireland 2025, I am pleased that we have been able in recent months to open new embassies and consulates general in Vancouver, Wellington, Santiago, Bogota, Mumbai and Amman with openings to follow this year in Cardiff, Frankfurt and Los Angeles.  The Government's overarching ambition under this initiative is to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to secure our national interests, particularly economic interests, globally.  Our expanded network will enhance Ireland's visibility globally, extend our influence and position us for trade and investment growth in new and existing markets.  It will also benefit our citizens travelling overseas and will involve reaching out to our diaspora and exploring new platforms for engagement.</p><p> The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department's strategy statement 2017 to 2020 and mirrors the priorities as set out in our foreign policy document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World, which sets out the Department&rsquo;s work in five priority areas: supporting our people, engaging actively in the EU, promoting our values, advancing our prosperity and strengthening our influence.  These correspond directly with expenditure programmes At to E in the 2019 Revised Estimates Volume, which the committee is considering.</p><p> As has been proposed, I will make some short introductory comments on programme A to open the discussion.  Once we complete our discussion of this programme, I will then take each of the programmes in sequence.  I ask for the committee's forbearance in speaking in a little greater detail on programme A as it covers so many key policy areas for my Department, including Northern Ireland, consular services and assistance, our emigrant support programme, ESP, and diaspora funding, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon has primary responsibility, and the passport service, including the passport reform programme.  I wish to quickly update the committee on developments in all these important areas in service of Our People, the aptly chosen title for the programme.</p><p> Work under programme A includes the effective delivery of passport and consular services for our citizens; supporting our emigrants and deepening engagement with our diaspora; sustaining peace and enhancing reconciliation and political progress in Northern Ireland, and increasing North-South and British-Irish co-operation, which is certainly needed these days.  The amount allocated for current expenditure under this programme in 2019 is &euro;77.7 million compared to &euro;73.4 million in 2017, an increase of 5.8%.  This programme is about Our People, namely Irish citizens at home and abroad and it covers a number of key priority areas for the Department.  Together with the passport service, the provision of consular services and assistance lies at the heart of the Department's engagement with citizens.  As Irish people continue to travel in greater numbers than ever before and to ever more remote and exotic locations, the demand for consular assistance has increased significantly.  In 2018, my Department provided assistance to Irish citizens in more than 2,343 serious consular cases.  Regrettably, this included assistance in over 292 cases where Irish citizens died abroad.  A new consular strategy has been developed to address the growing and often complex demand for information and assistance.  The strategy outlines how the Department will prioritise modernising and improving the service provided to Irish citizens in distress abroad.  Our crisis planning and preparedness team continually reviews the Department's travel advice and works closely with our embassies abroad and external organisations to prepare for major events.  For example, planning is currently underway for the rugby World Cup in Japan in 2019.</p><p> The Passport Service issued some 860,000 passports in 2018, which was the highest number ever issued in a single year.  This represented an increase of more than 10% on the previous year.  We expect the number of passport applications to continue increasing throughout 2019.  I announced on 16 March that more than 230,000 applications had been received so far in the year, representing an extraordinary increase of 30% on the same period in 2018, which was a record in itself.  Target turnaround times for applications depend on the category of application.  Online applications, which now represent over 70% of all applications, are being processed in under than two weeks.  In fact, over 50% are being processed in less than a week.  First-time applications, of necessity, take longer because of required entitlement and identity checks.  We have taken on board the lessons learned from recent peak seasons and are implementing enhanced measures to provide quality customer service processes and, in particular, to manage our overall demand and the seasonal application increases.  This is being done by the recruitment of additional staff, the re-organisation of production processes and administrative arrangements and the continuous implementation of service improvements through the passport reform programme.  We learned a lot of lessons last year from pressures in the passport system which arose partly because of a period of extremely bad weather when the system had to be shut down for a couple of days as well as on foot of the sheer volume of applications.  We have anticipated those pressures again this year and responded pretty well so far.</p><p> My Department works closely with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to seek to ensure the passport service is adequately resourced with sufficient permanent staff throughout the year.  More than 80 new permanent staff have been assigned across all the offices since the end of 2018.  In addition and in response to the general increase in applications during the busy peak season, sanction has been received to recruit 230 temporary clerical officers, TCOs, to assist in passport processing.  In excess of 160 TCOs have already been assigned, with the remainder due to be in place in the coming weeks.  A further response by the passport service has been the establishment of a new, dedicated customer service hub.  The hub is resourced to deliver an effective service to members of the public who contact the office with queries by telephone or webchat.  More than 70 staff are in place with a further 30 staff due to commence by early May.  We have had a significant recruitment process under way for a number of months.</p><p> As part of the passport reform programme, the second phase of the online passport renewal service was rolled out in November 2018.  This facility is now extended to the renewal of children's passports and has introduced a passport card for children.  It has also expanded the cohort of adults eligible to renew online.  The online service, which is available 24-7, 365 days a year to applicants renewing their passports anywhere in the world, brings significant benefits with faster turnaround times and greater customer satisfaction.  The online service has been instrumental in the management of overall passport operations and in allowing the passport service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand.  Further developments planned in the reform programme for 2019 include an automated mailing project, a business process automation project, additional work on the online renewal service and the ongoing improvement to customer systems.</p><p>Further developments planned in the reform programme for 2019 include an automated mailing project, a business process automation project, additional work on the online renewal service and the ongoing improvement to customer systems.<br/><br/>The 2019 allocation includes a capital allocation of &euro;5.5 million in respect of the passport reform programme.<br/><br/><b></b>Regarding emigrant support and diaspora issues<b>, </b>through the ESP budget of &euro;12.575 million - an increase of &euro;1 million from last year - the Government provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support our most vulnerable emigrants abroad, strengthen global Irish communities, and facilitate the development of closer and more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  This important budget supports the Government&rsquo;s vision of a vibrant, diverse global Irish community, connected to Ireland and to each other.<br/><br/>I am aware of increased concerns among some members of our Irish communities abroad given uncertainty arising from the British vote to exit the European Union and challenges facing the undocumented Irish in the United States.  The ESP is an important tool for the Government as we continue to work with Irish community groups and immigration centres to address current needs and concerns, and to ensure appropriate support is offered to Irish citizens everywhere.<br/><br/>A separate diaspora affairs budget line of &euro;600,000 is managed by the Irish abroad unit.  This diaspora affairs expenditure will be targeted at strategic projects relating to the diaspora that support the work of the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad and existing Government strategies, in particular Ireland Connected; the International Education Strategy for Ireland; Creative Ireland; and the national tourism strategy.<br/><br/>I commend the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in this important area in his role as Minister for the diaspora.  He will take any questions members have on that area.<br/><br/>This programme also deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland.  In the context of the current political challenges within Northern Ireland and the potential impact of Brexit, it will be no surprise that this area of work is a particular focus of my Department.  From the outset, protecting the peace process, and the Good Friday Agreement, has been a key priority.  Throughout the negotiations on Brexit, as members know well, there has been a strong understanding from our EU partners of the need to address the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2018, the reconciliation fund made grants to cover 100 projects, supporting organisations across the community and voluntary sector, mostly based in Northern Ireland.  These groups are building meaningful links across communities, addressing the issues that are impacting on their lives, including sectarianism, and working to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.<br/><br/>Clearly, there is still vital reconciliation work to be done and that work may yet take generations.  I believe civil society has a very important role to play in this, including by shaping a more reconciled and cohesive society. The reconciliation fund is an important expression of our support for this work.  In recognition of that, I announced in May last year that the fund's budget would increase by &euro;1 million to more than &euro;3.7 million for 2019.  In percentage terms it is a significant increase even though it is only &euro;1 million in the context of the overall budget.<br/><br/>I welcome any comments or questions from committee members on programme A.  I suspect this particular Estimates session is probably less about the money and more about the policy, which is often the case in the Department, with the exception of the development aid side where there is a major increase in expenditure from last year compared to this year.  It is hoped that will increase significantly as the years pass between now and 2030 when we want to try to reach the target of 0.7% of GNI.</p></speech>

The figure gives a different impression.</p> <p>  On requests for embassy admissions and the way in which the T&aacute;naiste has decided on the particular number, I am aware there are some who are disappointed by that.  Will he consider more as time goes on?</p> <p>  On the reconciliation work that is still to be done and the work that may take generations, the Government is putting money into reconciliation yet it has not addressed the legacy issues.

I thought the debate had some depth.  Members of different political parties gave different perspectives.  I thought we need to have more of the approach taken to that debate on the issue of legacy and reconciliation to ensure that victims and their families from all sides and all communities can get the truth they seek and, if it is possible, the justice for that.</p> <p>  We are active on both the reconciliation and legacy agenda working with the British Government but also passing our own legislation.  For example, the families of the Kingsmill victims will have concerns about accusations of collusion on this side of the Border and they want questions asked and answered.  We are in the process of passing legislation being brought forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to allow for inquests that are taking place in Northern Ireland to have hearings in a court in Dublin where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could give evidence or answer questions, if that was appropriate to do, in the context of some of the legacy inquests currently happening or may happen in the future.  That involves both Governments passing new legislation.  We will insist on the full suite of measures and commitments that were committed to in the Stormont House Agreement and we need legislation passed in Westminster to make that happen.  We will continue to advocate for that.</p> <p>  There are other cases as well, including the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, on which the Government continues to have a clear perspective and this is consistent with motions passed in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  We will continue to advocate accordingly.  Some of the recent decisions relating to Bloody Sunday and so on heighten the focus on legacy.  I also refer to the Ballymurphy killing.  We are very much in tune with that and are part of that debate.  I hope we can achieve the kind of language but also the structures we need to be able to move many of these processes forward.</p> <p>  On new missions, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has never expanded at the pace we are expanding at right now.  As I said earlier, new embassies are opening in Bogota, Colombia and Santiago, Chile.  I am glad a new embassy has opened in Wellington, considering what happened in recent weeks in New Zealand, about which Ireland wants to show as much solidarity as it can.  There is a new mission in Vancouver for the obvious reasons.  It is physically so far away from the embassy in eastern Canada and that there is a strong Irish community in Vancouver.  We are opening a new embassy in Amman, Jordan, because Ireland is taking an increasing political interest in the Middle East peace process and also funnelling a lot of aid money into many of the humanitarian operations across the Middle East in respect of Syrian refugees and so on.</p> <p>  I have outlined the position on Vancouver, Wellington, Santiago, Bogota, Mumbai, Amman, Cardiff, Frankfurt and Los Angeles in terms of what has happened in the past six months and what will happen in the coming six months.</p><p>We are also going beyond that.  We have committed to opening a new embassy in Morocco and in Kiev in Ukraine.  We are also opening an embassy in Liberia and will probably increase our presence further in west Africa.  We can only do this at a pace that allows us to do it efficiently and cost effectively.  Increased staff numbers are needed as well.  I think we are doing this as quickly as we can and targeting the right places.  I refer to both political and economic interests. </p><p> The EU already has trade agreements in place with most of the countries where we are investing.  For example, we will be investing very heavily in capital infrastructure in Tokyo.  We are building a new Ireland House there.  That will be the biggest capital expenditure ever in a facility like this.  It is not a coincidence that the EU has just signed a trade deal with Japan.  Likewise, we have increased our emphasis on Canada because the EU has a trade agreement in place, as it has also with both Chile and Colombia.  This is Ireland growing and expanding globally.  We will continue to do that, but the process needs to be planned and structured.  There needs to be a proper strategy and thought process behind it.  </p><p> Finally, regarding A Better World, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and I agree on this.  One of the things both of us really wanted to do while in this Department was to modernise our approach to development.  It is already good but we can take it to a new level.  We deliberately made that policy document a relatively short read, but there is much significant content.  There is also a major financial commitment behind it.  I hope future Governments will honour that because it is going to put great pressure on whatever parties are in government over the next ten years to find an increase of more than &euro;100 million each year for our development strategy.  It is a big ask.  I hope we will be able maintain an economy that can fund it.  That is, however, where we are going.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will speak more about that later.                     </p></speech>

A great deal is done online now but there is still a demand for a passport office, in the consular service or elsewhere.  I know some of the difficulties people face in emergencies etc.  If the Department is making &euro;60 million, that would lend weight to an argument for approaching the Minister for Finance and stating some of that money could be ring-fenced to staff an office in Belfast, Derry or somewhere in the Six Counties to accommodate the need there.</p> <p>  Turning to the increase in the numbers using emergency consular assistance, it is great to see so many more people being helped.  The Minister mentioned that 292 people died abroad and help being provided by the consular services.  The Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust, KBRT, does tremendous work in that area.  I do not know if the Department funds or helps it in any way, given the work it and others do in repatriating those who have passed away abroad.  Those stuck abroad are also sometimes in need of medical transfer back home.  It is good to see a new consular strategy since so many more people are travelling and working abroad.  There might, however, need to be additional funding to provide help.  I refer to cases of distress or where there is no insurance, or not enough insurance, to help families cope in distressing circumstances.  </p> <p>  Regarding North-South co-operation, I again have no problem in welcoming the additional &euro;1 million allocated to the reconciliation fund.  Much more could be spent in that area.  Overall, it is about &euro;6.5 million, not including money for the diaspora and other similar uses.  I am referring to programme A, taking headings A6 and A7 together.   We need to ensure the appropriate funds are available given the demands we are facing in the future.  That includes demands for truth and reconciliation from both communities, as the Minister rightly recognised.  </p> <p>  The Minister yesterday, or perhaps before that, also met the family of Mr. Patsy Kelly, an independent councillor murdered in Tyrone by the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR.  Families like that are seeking proper investigations.  They are not always looking for financial support in trying to get to the truth.  Sometimes, however, they do come up against logjams and then they need the support of the Minister and his Department.  On occasion, that can involve legal costs because not every family has the wherewithal to get solicitors and other legal professionals on board.  The Pat Finucane Centre has done tremendous work in this area in the past.  It has helped represent some families who have achieved progress in seeking truth.  There is, however, great frustration for families in other cases.  I think that is nearly everything.  </p></speech>

The vast majority of applications received by the passport service from applicants residing on the island of Ireland, however, are submitted through Passport Express and Northern Ireland Passport Express.  Northern Ireland Passport Express allows applicants living in Northern Ireland to apply for their passport through more than 70 post offices.  We are now seeing a big shift online as well.  Some 70% of renewals, and rising, are now happening online.  A person only needs to go into a passport office if he or she is travelling for emergency reasons and his or her passport is not in date etc.  That is a relatively small number of people.</p> <p>  People come to the passport offices in Dublin or Cork for that.  It can be a long journey whether people are living in the west or north west of Ireland.  That does not mean that we should be opening passport offices all over the country or the island.  I will, however, keep this under review.  At the moment, however, all of the trends point toward a shift online or to having a fairly efficient express postal system.  That will allow us to focus resources on turnaround times and keeping people informed about their applications.</p><p> On the repatriation of a person's remains when he or she has died abroad, this is something with which I am currently not so happy.  While there is a fund available and we provide some financial resources to the fund, there is a question as to whether the State should do more to help families to bring a loved one home after he or she has passed away.  We have had discussions within the Department on the issue and will continue to examine it.  There is a constant discussion we need to have about encouraging people to take out insurance when they go abroad and cover themselves for the cost of an accident or fatality.  If we make policy decisions to the effect that the State will pick up the tab, people will not take out travel insurance in some cases.  There is a competing issue, therefore, because there are some tragic cases in which the State should intervene directly where families cannot afford to bring the deceased home.  The approach thus far has been to support a charity that helps to fund the cost for families, which has been the recommendation to me for the reasons I have outlined.  In respect of the significant numbers I outlined earlier, some of the cases will be different and will put families under a great deal of financial pressure.</p></speech>

We need to keep that issue under constant review.  On the reconciliation fund, we have increased it by &euro;1 million, which is an increase of almost 25%.  I would like to see us continuing to increase it.  I hate to say it but politics in Northern Ireland and the relationship between communities is quite fragile.  We may well have to invest much more time and financial resources to try to work with UK authorities to ensure that regardless of what decisions are made in respect of Brexit, we will maintain a calm and supportive position, in particular through community leaders who reach out in a responsible way through many of the programmes we fund.  While I accept that the sum of &euro;1 million may seem to be small, in the context of increasing the fund from &euro;2.7 million to &euro;3.7 million, it is a considerable increase in percentage terms.</p></speech>

On Brexit preparedness, additional staff have been hired but is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied that the level is adequate to cater for what is coming down the line?  While we do not yet know what the final outcome will be, is he satisfied that there are adequate staffing levels in the Department's headquarters and the Irish embassies in the areas we are discussing?  I welcome that under Global Ireland 2025, the Department will open additional embassies and consuls in various places and there are a number of other areas we could and will consider in the near future.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the wonderful work that is being done in consular assistance.  I have been approached in respect of a number of cases in recent years, particularly in recent months, where there were serious accidents involving persons without insurance as well as one fatal accident.  The work that was carried out by the Department's consular staff is to be commended and I am sure that I speak for many of the families when I say the Department and the other group which the T&aacute;naiste mentioned have done exceptional work.  It is important because families tell me that at a time such as that, when they are far away and might not understand all the information they receive, people are on the ground to help and assist them in the event of a sad occasion.</p> <p>  On passports, each of us as a public representative is inundated daily in respect of additional passports.  The passport service did phenomenal work in issuing 860,000 passports in 2018, which is the highest ever, but the number continues to rise.  It is only right and proper that we would acknowledge the work of people in this service.  I was often asked about a location in the north west but the online facilities for passports will remove many of the problems for people.  It is a successful and important development.</p> <p>  On the Minister of State's comments about diaspora issues, we are making significant progress in various parts of the world where we previously did not.  I acknowledge his presence and commitment to the work he is doing in that regard.</p> <p>  We have spoken about Brexit and the future of Northern Ireland.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which I am a member, has met a number of groups who have benefited from the reconciliation fund.  The fund has been well supported and it is only right and proper that we continue in that regard because various groups have benefited from it.</p></speech>

We have a communications unit dedicated to Brexit and, in sheer numbers, there has been a significant increase in the numbers we have taken on to ensure we will have an efficient passport delivery service.  The other areas across Departments that have taken on significantly more staff in the context of Brexit are those such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners, and agencies linked to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  As would be expected, more people have been taken on by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia as well as in local enterprise offices and so on in some cases.  Sufficient resources are in place across Government but we will have to keep that under review.</p> <p>  If there is a no-deal Brexit, it will put a much greater strain on the system.  If we have to manage the competing challenge of trying to protect the integrity of the Single Market while at the same time preventing physical border infrastructure on the Border, it will involve more resources and a plan to be worked out with the European Commission, which we would have to do unilaterally with the Commission.  We hope that such a plan will not be needed, but in case it is, we are planning for it.  If there is a no-deal Brexit, the expenditure on multiple areas, especially such as support programmes in vulnerable economic sectors including that of agriculture, will be significant, which the Minister for Public Expenditure, Deputy Donohoe, will take into account.</p> <p>  From our Department's perspective, we play a co-ordinating role, as opposed to taking on hundreds of people to work in Dublin Port, Rosslare, Dublin Airport or somewhere else.</p><p> In terms of co-ordination and communication, we have more staff and bigger teams in some embassies, London, Paris and Berlin being the obvious examples.  I am satisfied that we have put in place sufficient staff resources, but in a no-deal scenario everything will change and we have to gear up for it.  As of today, I am happy that we are in a reasonably good place.</p></speech>

A person living at the far end of County Donegal, never mind someone living in Derry or elsewhere in the Six Counties, has a long way to travel to Dublin, especially if it is an emergency.  These are the cases with which I have dealt.  In fairness to the Minister's office, it has been very helpful in the past in dealing with emergencies.  It is a good facility to be able to contact somebody who can give advice.  There will always be a cohort who will not be able to make online applications and in practice there will be strange or emergency cases who will need some access to a person.  It might be that it would be rolled out more, rather than just Passport Express.  It would help to have someone to check when people are doing it because often the delay is caused when people send in material and have forgotten to do this, that or the other.</p> <p>  Are there plans to reopen the embassy in Iran that was closed due to financial constraints?  I welcome the opening of the other consular services.  We had the advantage when the group travelled from here to Washington of seeing the great work done there.  The consular service and the ambassador explained what would be rolled out and how while it might cost money, it would be cost-effective in terms of the benefits Ireland would get and investment in the country.  I encourage more of the same, as the Minister outlined.</p></speech>

Even if someone goes into the Passport Office in Cork to see someone at the desk, the passport cannot be printed there and then.  Many people who need passports quickly fly out of Dublin which is by miles the busiest airport.  We are trying to move the process to a place where we can have a lot more interaction online as the technology allows us to do more and more.  The geographical location where passports are printed will become less relevant, but I take the point and we will keep the matter under review.</p> <p>  We are reopening the consular service in Cardiff next month.  There are no plans to reopen an embassy in Iran, but the issue has been raised on several occasions.</p></speech>

The last time the Minister was here he did not indicate any optimism about when the necessary progress would be achieved.</p> <p>  For relatively little money, the reconciliation fund has been very successful.  Officials in the Department have done and still do a great job in working with communities throughout Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  While the programme is beneficial, if we do not deal with the legacy issues, there will still be much hurt and anxiety.  It is decades since many of the atrocities were committed.  Families who have not heard the truth and seen justice are getting older and fear their lives will end before they get the truth about how they lost a loved one.  I know this from dealing with the families of victims in the Monaghan and Dublin bombings, people in Belturbet and others in the Border area.  They are becoming increasingly anxious and understandably angry that we are making no progress in dealing with the legacy issues.  We cannot emphasise enough the need to get the message across that it is a priority for all of us in public life.  At times these families can understandably think the issues have gone off the agenda.  It is very important, therefore, that we send the message from the Oireachtas and the Government that we continue to pursue them with the British Government and the Northern Ireland authorities.  Far too often people say to me they know who committed a crime and who murdered someone, but, unfortunately, that person has never been brought to justice.  I know that the framework is in place in the Stormont House Agreement and the Fresh Start agreement to make progress in that respect.  The Minister mentioned the legislation being progressed here, but it is an issue of concern, regardless of political pressures on many fronts.  Naturally, we will not achieve progress until the Assembly and Executive are restored.  Similarly, the North-South Ministerial Council is important.  It is often written out of the political agenda, but it would have been extremely important and beneficial if it had been functioning in the past two years, whether at plenary or sectoral level.  Are there plans for talks to resume between the Minister, the Secretary of State, Ms Bradley, and the political parties represented at Stormont?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1701" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#K00500"><p>We did have an exploratory meeting with the leaders of all the political parties a few weeks ago in Belfast.  They outlined their positions and all said they wanted to get back into devolved government structures in Northern Ireland.  There was, however, a fairly direct conversation about the expectations of different parties about what was required to do this.  It is very difficult to create the platform or political environment for compromise where parties will accommodate each other's concerns while the Brexit cloud hangs over Northern Ireland.  Political parties are focused very much on decisions being made in London, even though many of them are not represented there.  I have regular conversations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on assessing when is the right time to bring parties together.  We cannot force the holding of those meetings and have another failure on our hands as that would be very damaging.  The public has grown increasingly cynical about, and disillusioned with, the political system in Northern Ireland and we will all have to work hard to try to re-establish trust that Stormont can work and make the right decisions for people, regardless of from where they come and who they are.  Unfortunately, Brexit has had a desperately polarising effect, not just on political parties but also on communities.  The focus of discussion on Brexit is back on identity, constitutional issues, tribal debates and at the same time the tension in dealing with many of the legacy cases, reinforced, for example, by the Finucane family who continue to ask for a full public inquiry, in which we support them, and the decision on a prosecution in connection with the events of Bloody Sunday.</p><p>The position is similar with the inquest into Ballymurphy and the ongoing inquest into Kingsmill.  This has created difficult political debates without an Assembly or Executive in Northern Ireland to give political leadership to help communities get through a difficult process when it comes to reconciliation.  That is why I said earlier that Northern Ireland is in a rather fragile and difficult place and we need to be careful with the language we use and the decisions we make.  However, if we can find a way of creating some certainty around the Brexit process - I hope this can happen in the coming days and weeks - then I believe there will be a window.  This is because I believe all parties in Northern Ireland recognise the need for more localised leadership coming from Stormont.  Certainly, we will work hard with the British Government to try to make that happen.</p></speech>

The increases in the non-pay elements relate to Brexit information, campaigning and communications primarily.  The pay elements relate largely to pay restoration decisions.  The other areas relate to actions around EU engagement and other actions linked to our membership of the European Union.  There are no real budget increases of note in those areas.  If people want me to go into the matter in detail I can do so, but I do not think there is any controversy here.  It is a relatively small amount of money and reflects playing our part as a member of the European Union.</p></speech>

I attended two of the Common Foreign and Security Policy meetings, including the most recent one in Bucharest.  I have real concerns over the increasing talk about European armies, etc.  There are few voices at that level talking about other ways of dealing with issues besides a European army.</p></speech>

Every time there is that kind of discussion, an Irish voice normally intervenes to remind people of what our Constitution says and our policy on military neutrality.  Of course we are absolutely committed to the European Union and its future but there are different perspectives.  The complexity of Common Foreign and Security Policy aims to try to accommodate those perspectives in different ways.  Ireland, through our triple lock system, will decide if and when Irish troops travel to different parts of the world.  That will not be decided by someone else.  That is something we remind people of on a regular basis.</p></speech>

The other figures relate to contributions to international organisations.  A 2019 allocation of &euro;34 million is essentially at the same level as the revised figure for 2018.  It reflects the best estimate of mandatory contributions to international organisations in 2019.  The Department is committed, on behalf of the State, to paying assessed contributions to international organisations.  This includes peace, security and human rights contributions to the UN, which is the largest single contribution.  This is in accordance with a rolling three-year schedule negotiated by the UN.  The contributions are based on a percentage of Ireland's GNP.  Again, this is a non-controversial area linked to commitments we have made.  It is rolled over a three-year cycle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1709" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#L00800"><p>As with the last allocation the funds seem to be staying the same.  One of the international organisations to which we contribute is the UN.  We seem to be paying in less, although in miniscule amounts.  This seems to fly in the face of our commitments in terms of the UN and environmental degradation around the world.  Will we expect to have to make larger increases to these international organisations in future?  I have in mind the UN in particular, because the world seems to be becoming more volatile again and the UN may be needed to address peace and stability in some areas as well as the environment.</p> <p>  A separate question arises on human rights and the protection of human rights internationally.  Again, the committee has done much work in this area.  Is this an area where we should be increasing our contributions?  Is it simply demand-led?  Do we grant whatever the UN asks of us rather than looking to increase contributions specifically?  Businesses and corporations that do not respect human rights need to be held to account for abuses of human rights, violations and environmental degradation.  Should we be supporting international organisations that seek to tackle those problems?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#L00900"><p>This figure is not our total contribution to the UN.  This is a contribution to UN organisations that is subject to calculations made at a UN level under commitments made as part of a three-year cyclical process.  We make a series of other contributions to UN agencies separately, including the World Food Programme, UNHCR and environmental NGOs.  I imagine the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will discuss these when it comes to his Vote.  We are increasingly investing through UN organisations in what is entirely untied aid.  That is as it should be.  We are looking to sit on the decision-making body, the UN Security Council, in some years' time.  Ireland's foreign policy is very much shaped by EU membership and UN membership.  Most of the expenditure in programme C relates to Ireland's mandatory contributions to international organisations of which we are members, including the UN.  The 2019 Estimate reflects the best estimate at the time of mandatory contributions due this year.  It should be noted, however, that the challenge of forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget in particular, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is not an easy one.  It is difficult to estimate this in advance as the existing peacekeeping contribution might be expanded or reduced depending on the circumstances or a new one might be established.  Also UN contributions are invoiced in US dollars and, therefore, are subject to currency fluctuations.  The complexity of the UN budget process and the negotiations of contribution rates for all UN participants make this budget difficult to quantify at any stage of the year.  This estimate may go slightly up or down depending on several factors, including whether new peace-keeping missions are required or whether exchange rates change.  Anyway, this is our best guess at this point.</p></speech>

Again, there are no increases in the other areas but under the heading of promoting Ireland the published allocation is at the same level as at 2018.  Funding under this programme enables the Department and its mission network to raise Ireland's profile internationally and support local and regional trade and economic initiatives as well as organising cultural activities.</p> <p>  Subhead D4 relates to contributions to national and international organisations.

As we see a significant increase in the number of our missions, I suspect the budget line will have to be increased in years ahead.  For this year it is more or less the same budget as for last, with a difference of only some &euro;1,000.</p></speech>

Given the year we have had with Brexit, not to mention the years to come dealing with the same issue, I would encourage greater funding for such programmes.  I have found that investment in promoting Ireland abroad pays huge dividends, even if it does not come back directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Our international standing is helped by investment so it is a pity that it is only increasing by &euro;1,000.  There may be other programmes related to this one but it is logical to increase it.</p></speech>

Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, for example, have quite a lot of funding here and I would not like to suggest that we are not spending more money promoting Ireland through our embassy networks.  We are doing that and we have just had comfortably the largest ever St. Patrick's Day programme, with 56 countries visited in total.  Each Minister's Department pays for its travel programme.  This subhead funds our team to co-ordinate things and there is a lot more joined-up thinking in the area of promoting Ireland.

We took the embassy staff away from other work they could have been doing and we appreciate the huge level of work the staff in embassies and consulates do.

The programme also covers communication by the Department of its policies, objectives and activities to citizens at home and abroad.</p> <p>  Pay has increased for the reasons I outlined earlier and the other two budgets are more or less as they were.  Capital expenditure is linked to this for new missions.  This programme also includes a capital allocation of &euro;9 million under subhead E2, which is non-pay expenditure.  A big chunk is for Tokyo but, as I outlined, other new missions are opening and they have to be leased or purchased.  Most are leased for the short term, until we can be satisfied we can get good value by buying the right properties in the right places.  We need human resources to do this in the shape of property teams to go to places like Santiago, Bogot&aacute; and Oman.</p></speech>

The total income under appropriations-in-aid in 2019 is estimated at almost &euro;45 million, a marginal decrease on 2018.  The primary source of income, which accrues directly to the Exchequer from my Department, comes from passport application fees and accounts for over 90% of all appropriations-in-aid receipts.  Passport, citizenship, visa and other consular fees are set by way of statutory instrument issued under section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993.  The figure may be higher but &euro;45 million is the figure agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The figure was higher last year and it will probably be higher again this year but it is the figure that has been recommended.</p></speech>

Vote 27 funds about two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department&rsquo;s high-level goal to work for a more just, secure and sustainable world.</p> <p>  For this year, I am proud to announce that we have allocated almost &euro;817 million to official development assistance, the highest increase in funding in over a decade.  This represents an increase of approximately &euro;110 million, or 16% on the 2018 budget announced.  Some &euro;544 million will be managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through Vote 27 - International Co-operation, an increase of &euro;44 million, or almost 9%, on last year&rsquo;s allocation.</p><p>A further estimated &euro;272 million will be managed through other Departments and Ireland's share of the EU development co-operation budget.  By far, the largest component of this element of ODA is our share of the EU development co-operation budget, which has grown significantly over the past few years.  Significant ODA contributions also flow through the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Finance and Justice and Equality.  The 2019 allocation is a significant budgetary commitment by the Government to international development and is an important statement of who we are as a people and a clear reflection of Ireland's values and interests.  We all have a stake in making a better world and expanding our development co-operation programme is an investment in a better, safer and, ultimately, more sustainable world.  It provides Ireland with an opportunity to expand its influence and strengthen its partnerships today and for tomorrow.<br/><br/>Last year, when we published Global Ireland, the Government committed to delivering on the United Nations target of allocating 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, to official development assistance by 2030.  Global Ireland also committed the Government to publishing a new White Paper on international development.  Last month, we delivered on that commitment.Along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I launched the Government's new policy for international development - A Better World<i>.  </i>This new policy document provides the framework for the expansion of our ODA and for reaching the 0.7% target by 2030.  Sustained, managed increments in ODA will be required to deliver on this commitment.  Careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders will also be needed to ensure it is done effectively.  We are adopting a steady and phased approach, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and recognising that to deliver on this ambition will mean making difficult choices between competing priorities.  We are, however, making progress, increasing allocations to ODA by some 32% since 2014 and 16% in this year alone.<br/><br/>I thank this committee in particular for its work in 2017 in reviewing Ireland's aid programme.  The recommendations from that work informed our thinking in developing our new international development policy.  In particular, the committee's recommendations on putting the sustainable development goals, SDGs to the fore, on prioritising gender equality, education and agriculture were of particular benefit along with those related to strengthening our capacity to deliver an effective international development co-operation programme and to maintain Ireland's reputation for quality, untied aid and delivering results for those most in need.  Our new policy, A Better World,<i></i>sets out our vision for Ireland's contribution to international development looking forward to 2030.  It is a clear statement of Ireland's commitment to global citizenship, to helping make our planet a better place to live for others and for ourselves.  It focuses on reaching the furthest behind first, wherever they might be, in a least developed country, a small island state vulnerable to climate change, or a victim of conflict or a humanitarian crisis.  <br/><br/>A Better World<i></i>builds on Ireland's strengths as a donor and the strong international reputation we have maintained since the establishment of our official development programme.  It is a bold statement of what Ireland will do to contribute to a more peaceful, equal and sustainable world, in response to the underlying message of the SDGs to leave no one behind.  It commits Ireland to scaling up resources and capacity across four policy priorities, namely, gender equality, including a strengthened focus on education for girls; reducing humanitarian need; climate action and strengthening governance in developing countries.  Our new policy also draws from Ireland's own history and our development journey, committing Ireland to intensifying our work in three clusters of interventions where we have proven expertise, namely, protection, food and people.  This policy is a whole-of-government policy and commits us to both intensifying our contribution to development co-operation and to changing how we work.  We are committed to working more effectively across all Departments with civil society, research and education institutions and the private sector.  Importantly, we will increase our investment in public engagement and outreach, which was a significant part of arriving the policy we have arrived at.<br/><br/>Ireland does development well.  We have a well-earned reputation for the quality of our aid programme and for being highly effective at reaching those in extreme poverty, which, again, has been recognised internationally.  What we do works and has real impact.  Ireland, and we as Irish people, can be proud of our international development co-operation policy and programme.  We are reducing inequality, poverty and hunger.  We bring our authentic experience to this work, delivering a world-class programme, helping to save lives, to build livelihoods and to bring life-saving humanitarian assistance to those most in need and in times of crisis. <br/><br/>I welcome comments and questions from members. </p></speech>

We all welcome the substantial increase for funding in the 2019 allocation.  I am sure it will be put to good use in some of the most deprived parts of the world.  I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister of State's conclusion that we have a well-earned reputation.  It comes from the fact that our aid is untied and poverty focused and from the way in which it is delivered.  We know this through our contact with our ambassadors, embassies and NGOs and missionaries.  It is important that we hold on to that reputation.  The threats to it come from policy incoherence in the tax area, climate change and workers' rights areas, which I have spoken about previously.  However, the positive has to be acknowledged today.</p> <p>  I know that with our partner countries the focus is on Africa but given the increase in funding, can we look further?  I ask that question wearing my hat as Chair of the Ireland-Nepal Parliamentary Friendship Group.  As chair of that group I have met a number of the Nepalese community here, as well as Irish groups and organisations involved in projects in education and health particularly.  Nepal ticks a lot of the boxes in terms of an area that we could consider working with.  I am not suggesting that we should take on another partner but I ask that consideration to given to working with Nepal because of the extent of the work that is going on there now. </p> <p>  I also have concerns about the EU trust fund.  Only today we learned of another issue in regard to Libya.  In the Mediterranean, migrants rescued have taken over the rescued tanker.  It tried to land in Italy and it was pushed back.  We know that the migrants do not want to go back to Libya because of what is happening in the centres there.  </p></speech>

The Deputy is also correct that there is a question of policy incoherence particularly in the area of climate change.  Hopefully, the work undertaken by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Oireachtas committee on climate change will produce positive results.  We need consensus, in terms of political consensus nationally, on how we are going to address this particular challenge, particularly in the relationships we are now trying to develop with small island developing states around the world, and amplify our collective voice in advocating for the kind of policy development that needs to happen internationally.  We cannot stand on that stage without being able to show that we have a far-seeing and progressive approach to that policy in Ireland.</p> <p>  In regard to Nepal, we are already working with through a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with the Health Service Executive, HSE, around standards in healthcare.  I am sure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is aware of that MOU.  There is no reason why we cannot explore additional opportunities in the future.</p></speech>

It is for this reason we have the reputation around of the world of being a charitable people.  The Minister of State will not hear any criticism from me on the issue of untied aid.  I am around long enough to remember the commitments that were made around reaching the development goals of 0.7%.  We are still far behind where we should be in that regard.  There is no point reiterating the criticisms in regard to our not reaching that goal.  It is laudable that once again we have set out a target.  Hopefully, we will reach it.  It is a big commitment for Ireland.</p><p>Based on the figures presented by the Minister of State, this would entail moving from the more than &euro;800 million we give at present to nearly &euro;2 billion.  My view has always been that it should be more than that but that is the minimum.</p><p> The argument I have relates to some of the tied aid, specifically to the European Development Fund and to where some of the European Union's development and co-operation budget goes.  The amount this year from us has been increased by 12%.  Where it is spent well and in line with our own commitments and funding, it is laudable, but there are questions in this regard.  I know my colleague, Deputy Crowe, has raised concerns about the accountability and transparency of the European Development Fund in particular, and there is a particular concern about the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.  It is the main financial instrument for the EU's political engagement with African partners and of late it has become very focused on migration rather than development, although the two are tied.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned the position in Libya, with people fleeing horrendous wars or humanitarian disasters in Africa ending up drowning in the Mediterranean.  If they do not drown, they are sent back to Libya.  Some of the money that should be spent on development in the countries that these people are fleeing is being spent on a humanitarian crisis in some ways in Libya, as well as in propping up a crazy regime that is guilty of mass human rights abuses.</p><p> Deputy Crowe also asked me to speak to subhead A5, relating to voluntary contributions to the UN and other development assistance.  There was a presentation in the audiovisual room yesterday by Financial Justice Ireland, which had a speaker from Jubilee Caribbean, pointing out that the vast majority of countries that have been devastated by disasters caused by climate change are heavily indebted.  These countries are not the cause of climate change but are suffering the consequences at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.  These countries, which are already heavily indebted, must go further into debt because they are forced to borrow more.  The question is how we can help countries that are so indebted.  Will we help with additional aid or could we call for a moratorium on debt or debt forgiveness for the countries affected by climate change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1740" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#O00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for supporting the work we are doing in the Department and outlining that, ultimately, we are a charitable people.  We have that collective national memory of an extraordinarily difficult time in our history and that resonates with us to this day; it will probably do so for many generations to come.  Whenever we have the discussion in this room of that 0.7% target, there is absolute political consensus that it is what we need to do.  In a recent discussion in Seattle, I presented Ireland's new Irish Aid policy to a number of academics involved with international development worldwide, and they were immensely surprised to hear that we have absolute political consensus, with nobody arguing about heading in the opposite direction with our financial commitment.</p> <p>  With regard to the funds we channel through the European Union, I have always believed that if we are to have the maximum possible impact in trying to reach those furthest behind and effecting global change, we need to partner with countries sharing values and an ethos.  All our European Union partner countries very much share Ireland's ambition to reduce poverty and injustice while addressing humanitarian needs across the world.  We can have a far bigger impact with the resources we spend if we channel a significant amount through the European Union.  We also have recently put in place additional resources within the Department.  There are two different units in the Department overseeing the funds dispersed through the United Nations and the European Union to ensure there is proper scrutiny in place.  As our commitment increases, we must ensure we have the resources to ensure moneys are spent as well as possible.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the nations affected by climate change.  I met the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, a small island state in the Pacific, in New York last September.  He told me that if the current level of sea level rises continues, his country will cease to exist in 30 years.  There is a very real impact being felt right now, specifically in developing Pacific small island states.  We are very anxious to work with those states to mitigate the work effects of climate change.  We are involved right now in the development of a specific fund to which Ireland will contribute to allow such countries to mitigate the very worst effects of climate change on their people and economies as they become increasingly subject to such challenges.  It is something of which we are very aware and we are working on that issue.  We will make a financial contribution to that in a very short period.</p></speech>

I see where priority has been given to committing Ireland to scaling up resources to fight gender equality, reducing humanitarian need, climate action and strengthening governance in developing countries.  What type of funding are we talking about or what resources are being spoken about in helping under those various headings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2019032800002#O00400"><p>With respect to governance, we always describe the countries we work with in terms of our overseas development aid as partner countries.  That is how we perceive them and we want to partner with them in embarking on a journey that is very similar to the one experienced by Ireland over the past 50 years.  While we are anxious to continue to commit funds to healthcare, education and gender equality matters in all these locations, it is incredibly important that they have strong governance structures in place in order that ultimately, having made these commitments with funds, they would have the maximum possible impact.  We work with governments in developing their health and education systems, as well as their expertise to be able to use these funds with the maximum possible impact.</p> <p>  For example, we work with a number of African governments in developing a social welfare system that we would perceive to be absolutely normal in this country.  We have vast experience that we can share with those countries.  Governments are now using what are called social cash transfer models, transferring cash directly to women at the heads of households across Africa, which has a very significant impact in lifting those families out of poverty.  We are also focusing on girls in education.  Ultimately, the long-term solution for gender inequality internationally would have girls in education as a key element.  We are investing very heavily in putting girls in education.  In many countries young girls drop out of education in their early teens, never to return, and consequently we have some really powerful programmes to support such girls to remain in education.</p> <p>  These are the primary areas in which we invest.  Governance is a major element.  We can continue to disperse funds but if the partner countries does not have the required expertise at government and civil society level to use those funds effectively and create a legacy impact long after the funds are gone, we would be on a hiding to nothing.  That is ultimately why we work on strengthening those areas.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I take this opportunity to thank the many Irish people and their international colleagues who work in some of the most difficult areas in the world.</p><p>We have given some of the practitioners who have been working in those crisis-hit areas, including nurses, doctors and other workers, the opportunity to make presentations to this committee.  It is important that we record our appreciation for their work in very difficult circumstances and dangerous places.  I attended a seminar on the need for climate action in Athlone Institute of Technology last Thursday night.  It was organised by my colleagues, Deputies Eugene Murphy, Troy and Cowen.  At that meeting, which was very well attended by people from all age groups, I made the point that Irish people have shown have great empathy with the poorest in the world over the centuries as a result of our history of famine, poverty and hunger.  In the debate about climate change, the need for climate action, and the need to protect the environment, if we were able to make the point more clearly that the biggest victims of climate change are the poorest in the world, it might help us to create a greater awareness among us all that we need to do more and that doing more would benefit the poorest and the regions that are hardest hit.  If work was done to bring about greater awareness of that point, that message could resonate with the public.</p><p> At that meeting in Athlone Institute of Technology last week I made the point that only days previously we had seen huge devastation in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, particularly in the Beira region of Mozambique.  There was huge loss of life and areas were literally wiped out.  When we visited Mozambique and Malawi, the issue of rising water levels and the people's insecure future was brought home to us forcefully.  We need to see determination to get the message across that these people will continue to be the biggest victims in the world and will continue to be kept in poverty because of climate change.</p><p> I appreciate the Minister of State's kind and generous remarks regarding the report the committee drew up.  We focused on a number of specific areas, including the area of gender equality and the need to ensure that women and girls are kept in education.  During our trip to Malawi, we met agronomists who were teaching the skills to grow potatoes, manage crops and so on.  One of the officers told us that it was their ambition to get women to come to the classes in the school because they will listen and pass on the knowledge.  That emphasised to me the importance of ensuring that girls and women get that educational opportunity.</p><p> Professor Gerry Boyle, the director of Teagasc, was before the committee.  Teagasc is playing a role in the area of knowledge transfer.  Is further progress being made in ensuring that the private sector is more generous in participating in programmes in developing countries?  Perhaps such companies could ensure that some of their relatively young retired staff would put their skills, experience and knowledge to good use in those countries for short periods.  Many of those big international Irish corporations have the capacity to spend money in those countries.  As we all know, what they see as relatively little money would do a lot in developing countries.  The area of knowledge transfer and interchangeability could deliver a great deal of benefit at very little cost to the Exchequer.  It would do so much good on the development side.</p></speech>

I would love to hear more about that meeting in Athlone because Athlone itself has experienced the worst excesses of climate change.  It was under water for most of early 2016.  There is an emerging public consensus that we need to do something urgently.  That public consensus needs to be reflected in the words of the people who sit in this building, the representatives who represent that public.  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh earlier, we need to show consistency in the policies we espouse worldwide and those we implement on the ground in Ireland.  In arriving at our new international development policy, we found that the public engagement meetings we held throughout the country were very helpful and informative.  I mentioned that there is absolute consensus in this room on the 0.7% contribution.  We found that the exact same was true in every conversation we had in Dublin, Cork, Sligo, Limerick, and Galway.  We need to engage in a similar exercise in respect of climate change.</p> <p>  I told a story a few minutes ago of an island in the Pacific that will not be around in 30 years.  I saw a map created by the geography department of one of our third level institutions - I cannot remember which one - that mapped out Ireland in 2100 if the current level of rise in sea levels continues.  I contemplated moving a little bit further inland when I saw it because a significant impact is waiting for us if we do not act on this urgently.  Very good work is being done in the committee chaired by my colleague, Deputy Naughton.  Equally good work is being done by all colleagues across the Oireachtas.  Those of us who share these concerns need to be a little more vocal and a little more courageous in the things we say in the public domain.  We need to point out the seriousness and urgency with which we need to treat this issue.</p> <p>  I also agree completely with the Chairman in respect of Ireland's internationally renowned expertise in agriculture and in respect of how that can be used to assist people in our partner countries.  I was very happy to launch a programme of collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our Department with the Minister, Deputy Creed, last year.  This collaboration supports Irish agritech companies in establishing their first presence in Africa.  One of the main reasons that most innovative agritech companies are afraid to invest in Africa is simply the risk associated with it.  This was discussed in Seattle last week by many people who are involved in agritech internationally.  Companies do not know what they are getting into as regards national government policy and are worried about the ground moving beneath their feet.  Governments internationally, including our own, are trying to remove some of that risk or to insure those companies against it.  We are supporting them and letting them know that we have their back as they make their presence felt in these economies for the first time and as they collaborate with emerging and very impressive African agriscience and agritech companies.  The Department also has a memorandum of understanding with Teagasc.</p> <p>  With regard to seeing that science implemented on the ground, NGOs like Self Help Africa are doing extraordinary work in assisting farmers to increase their production, to make it more efficient, and to seek out and secure new markets for their produce.  The Chairman mentioned that the private sector has a role to play.  We have a consultancy looking at private sector engagement in the development of a more efficient and more scientifically underpinned agricultural economy across the whole of Africa.  That work is happening as a result of our new policy, A Better World.</p></speech>

Science Foundation Ireland also has a role to play in carrying out research that will have an impact on how we plan for the future of Ireland, but which will also have a significant impact across our partner countries.

The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.</p> <p>  This is not the first time the capital carryover figures have been disclosed as they were first published in the Revised Estimates Volume in December and subsequently set out in Schedule 2 of the Appropriation Act 2018 which was signed into law by the President on 20 December 2018.  The total level of carryover sought from 2018 into 2019 is slightly more than &euro;93 million, which is 1.5% of the total gross voted capital allocation of &euro;6.007 billion for 2018.  The carryover amounts provided by the Appropriation Act are required to be confirmed by an order made by 31 March of the following year, after approval by the D&aacute;il, to allow for the expenditure to take place.  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys which would otherwise be returned to the Exchequer under the annual system of allocating capital to be made available for spending and programme priorities in the subsequent year.</p> <p>  The provision of the capital carryover facility recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that, for any number of reasons, capital projects may be subject to delays.  This type of approach of managing infrastructure expenditure makes sense and has thus far been very successful.</p><p>It helps to ensure better project management and avoid uncertainty in the context of delivery.  The multi-annual system also gives more certainty to contractors that they will be paid for the work they do.  It has also helped to improve value for money and eliminate the potential for wasteful spending on non-essential works to ensure that full capital allocations are spent before the end of the year.</p><p> The total gross capital allocation for 2019 amounts to &euro;7.34 billion.  The capital carryover of &euro;93 billion will bring the total Exchequer capital available for spending in 2019 to &euro;7.435 billion.  The &euro;93 million relates to 12 Departments and various capital projects and programmes that did not conclude at the pace anticipated in 2018.  These are Vote 18, the National Shared Services Office, for which the figure is &euro;1.168 million; Vote 20, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, &euro;3.581 million; Vote 22, the Courts Service, &euro;2.5 million; Vote 23, the Property Registration Authority, &euro;56,000; Vote 24, Justice and Equality, &euro;942,000; Vote 29, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, &euro;15 million; Vote 30, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, &euro;22 million; Vote 31, Transport, Tourism and Sport, &euro;18.366 million; Vote 32, Business, Enterprise  and Innovation, &euro;27.6 million; Vote 33, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, &euro;700,000; Vote 37, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, &euro;1 million; and Vote 39, Office of Government Procurement, &euro;96,000.  Departments and agencies have delegated responsibility to manage their capital projects and programmes within the terms of the delegated capital sanction set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The availability of the capital carryover will assist in meeting their ongoing procurement and expenditure requirements.</p><p> To support Departments as they work to achieve value for money in investment in capital infrastructure, key reforms have been introduced.  The Land Development Agency has been set up by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure optimal use of State land.  Four new funds have been set up focused on urban and rural investment, climate action and disruptive technology to prioritise funding to the best projects.  They are being managed by the relevant line Department.  A construction sector group has been established to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector.  A Project Ireland 2040 delivery board of Secretaries General meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation process.  The investment projects and programmes office, IPPO, has been established in my Department to co-ordinate reporting on Project Ireland 2040 and drive reforms, including strengthened business case and project appraisal.  A capital projects tracker is published on the Department's website to inform citizens of the variety of projects being rolled out in their area and to give a greater overview to the construction and infrastructure sectors.  The tracker is currently being updated.  A capacity and capability review of public sector bodies is being commenced by the Department in order to ensure that the State's delivery practices are to the highest standard.  As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland's capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.</p></speech>

I did not see the note about salaries but I assume it involves salaries relating to the projects where the money has not been spent currently so there is work to be done.  It is not all just bricks and mortar.  A significant part involves relates to salary so that would make up the salaries portion highlighted by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State explain the rationale underpinning the cap?  How was the figure of &euro;8 billion arrived at?  The amendment provides that the Minister shall have the option of bringing a proposal to the D&aacute;il and that it may authorise a change in the amount.  What I have in mind is that it could be increased or reduced.  Giving the House a say in some degree of flexibility regarding the quantum and the cap relating to that fund would be very useful.  Could the Minister of State indicate why he arrived at the figure of &euro;8 billion?  I hope he will accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In our current interest rate environment, we can expect a near zero rate return or a small carry cost for holding the fund as near cash as is practicable.  However, the fund is unlikely to reach the &euro;8 billion cap for some years and it is to be expected that the interest rate environment will normalise over that period.  While the current interest rate is zero or almost zero, we think it prudent to make an &euro;8 billion amount cap available toward some external shock that is unanticipated.</p><p>We do not want to go beyond that.  A sum of &euro;8 billion is large.  It is not earning money and is not working on behalf of taxpayers.  We think that is a sufficient amount and we do not want to go beyond that.  There is also a capital surplus.  I refer to a cash amount of approximately &euro;15 billion.  If the fund gets to &euro;8 billion, in addition to that current &euro;15 billion, that will be a large amount not working and not earning.  We are satisfied to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister of State to set out the amount being transferred in from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  It was stated that it can be up to &euro;2 billion.  As set out on Second Stage, however, it is &euro;1.5 billion.  What is the procedural position?  When is that due to happen?  It has been stated that each year from 2019 to 2023, &euro;500 million will be set aside.  That has been given statutory affect.  When will that happen in 2019?  I would also like the Minster of State to comment on the "what if" situation of Brexit going badly wrong.  I refer to making a decision not to proceed with the rainy day fund at this time if it is deemed to be not prudent because we need the money to support the agriculture sector, etc.  Can such a decision be made?  What flexibility is there in regarding the execution of this fund in the context of the current challenges?</p></speech>

I do not have a date for when that transfer will be made during the year.  That will depend on the legislation being passed and signed by the President, and when that happens.  The objective, initially, is to transfer a single tranche of &euro;1.5 billion.  There will be subsequent annual transfers of &euro;500 million from 2019 to 2023, which will be put on a statutory footing.  It is then a matter for the Oireachtas to continue the process to bring the fund up to the maximum of &euro;8 billion, as we just discussed.  There is flexibility to go beyond that figure or reduce it, depending on circumstances.  As will be seen in later sections, there is also flexibility to not put in all of the &euro;500 million.  We recognise there are potential headwinds and not all may be related to Brexit.  There is sufficient flexibility on that basis.</p></speech>

One concerns the reasons why money could be put into the fund and another is to remove the provision that would see the &euro;500 million transferred annually from 2019 to 2023.  We are doing this because later in the legislation, there are certain limitations on how money can be withdrawn from the fund.  We tabled a number of amendments to expand the reasons money could be withdrawn.  They have been ruled out of order by the Chair or the Bills Office, or at least someone has ruled them out of order.  On that basis, we have some concerns on the money going into the fund and what the fund can be used for.  The Minister of State mentioned &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.My reading of the legislation is that it is only possible to withdraw the funding in three scenarios.  One is to recapitalise banks and another is in these &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.  Will he define what that means?</p></speech>

That is not what this pot of money is for.  This was stated to the Deputy and his colleagues on Second Stage.  It is clear they are not, however, accepting that.

I cannot state that any more frankly than that.  We have done much in the past decade.  As a nation, we have recapitalised the Irish banks.  A core objective of the EU banking union is to separate the sovereign fund from the banks and prevent the use of State funds to bail out banks.  The EU banking union provides for a single prudential supervisor through the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, a single rule book and a Single Resolution Mechanism.  This aims to improve coordination and militate against negative spillover in the future.</p> <p>  The bank recovery and resolution directive is designed to impose the cost of bank failures on the banks, their shareholders and the holders of their eligible liabilities for bailing in.  Based on these and wider banking union changes, and the more intrusive and assertive regulatory regime, I do not ever expect the contingency reserve fund to be required to bail out banks.  That is because the structures have been designed for the past decade so that the shareholders and those who have eligible liabilities are designed to bail in.  That is the correct procedure to recapitalise banks.  The regulatory landscape has also been overhauled at national level since the financial crisis with the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  In addition, the Central Bank is now acknowledged as being one of the most robust and challenging institutions in Europe.  The era of light-touch regulation is over.</p> <p>  Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, "exceptional circumstances" are defined as either a "period of severe economic downturn" or "a period during which an unusual event outside of the control of the State has a major impact on the financial position of the Government".  This fund is not, therefore, for what the Deputy is suggesting it is for.  I can only state that so many times and in so many ways.  It is not to bail out banks.  Other structures have been designed in recent years for that purpose.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Jonathan O'Brien were involved in that process, as were the Chairman and other Deputies.  It was to ensure that bailing out no longer occurs and the structures are designed so that shareholders and other eligible liabilities are there to bail in. </p></speech>

The answer was that, while the Minister did not expect the rainy day fund to be required to bail out banks, he would caution against closing off future uses of the rainy day fund at that time.  While the Government does not expect the fund to be used to bail out banks, it can be.  Does the Minister of State accept that?</p></speech>

According to the note in question, the fund cannot be used for Brexit or capital projects under the national development plan even though the latter would be the sensible thing to do in an economic downturn, given that it would create employment.  Nor can it be used to deal with the greatest crisis facing the State, that being, the housing crisis.  However, it may be used, if the Oireachtas decides so, to bail out banks.

For example, it cannot be invested in public services, be used to build houses, etc.  It requires an external shock, which will in reality look like another wave of global economic crises.  There are some indications that a new financial crisis is on the way.  There will then be another bank bailout.  In whatever number of years' time, people will look back at the video and transcripts of this meeting and the debates in the D&aacute;il and say that the Government tried to suggest that this fund would not be used for a bank bailout.  It would be wiped out by a bank bailout, as the requirement would be multiples of what will be in the rainy day fund.  The fund's moneys will not be substantial compared with what would be involved in a bailout.  That is the reality of what is happening, although I presume the Minister of State will not agree.</p></speech>

It cost the Irish Exchequer in the territory of &euro;33 billion or &euro;34 billion.  The entire architecture of banking has been changed, evolved, moved or whatever term the Deputy wants to use.  This fund is not intended for that purpose.  The structures under the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, and the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, are Europe-wide and regulate the 200 largest banks within the eurozone.  This small pot of money is for an external shock, something that we have not considered and for which we are not prepared.

It is a matter for the Oireachtas to trigger this if it is required and if the Minister presents it to the Oireachtas.  That is what it is for.  It is not to bail out banks.  It is a disservice to say that it is to bail out banks.  There is a structure there for the banks to be bailed-in, via depositors, investors and the new structures that are in place.  I cannot keep saying this.</p></speech>

It supports a rainy day fund.  The context of Brexit has been raised, understandably.  It is pretty clear under section 6 of the Bill that if Brexit goes badly wrong over the coming weeks, then the money is not going to be paid into the fund.  That is the reality.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has made that clear.  If we are in an emergency situation, then there is provision under section 6 of the Bill not to pay the money into any the rainy day fund.  Any public money can be used for a bank bailout.  Any tax one pays, be it corporation tax, VAT or income tax, or any money can be potentially used for a bailout to support a financial system, whatever way one wants to phrase it.  The circumstances in which these funds can be used are clearly set out in section 7 of the Bill, which we will come to in a moment, one of which is set out in section 1(a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, which reads "a period during which an unusual event outside of the control of the State, has a major impact on the financial position of the general government or a period of severe economic downturn."</p> <p>  The suggestion that Ireland will suffer infringement proceedings from the European Union for drawing down the resources in the fund is not realistic.  The EU, the OECD and all the major international organisations support having a fund of this nature to cater for the potential of things that could go wrong.</p></speech>

The section relates to the transfer of assets.  We tabled a number of amendments on the use of the money.  It is clear that we cannot use the money to deal with the crises we face today.  In one of our amendments we sought to provide for increased levels of capital investment, which would have a direct, long-term, positive effect on society and the economy, to increase capital investment in social and affordable housing and to remedy or mitigate the impact of climate change and Brexit.  However, all of our amendments been ruled out of order, presumably because either the Government does not want to use the fund for these purposes or it cannot be used for these purposes, something the Minister of State might clarify.  We speak about exceptional circumstances, but surely Brexit, if it goes ahead, will be an exceptional circumstance.  Surely the fact that the number of homeless persons has exceeded 10,000 is an exceptional circumstance.  While it might not be an exceptional circumstance as defined by the Stability and Growth Pact, as a national crisis, it must be an exceptional circumstance, yet the Government will not allow us to use the fund for these purposes.</p></speech>

A higher sum on housing provision has never been spent previously in the State.  We do not yet know what form Brexit will take, but we hope and expect the withdrawal agreement to be agreed to, as it has been by 27 Governments in the Council, as well as by the European Parliament.  We expect it to be passed by the British Parliament, too, which will bring to 30 the number of bodies that will haved passed it.  The only body which has not yet passed it is the House of Commons, but that is a matter for it to conclude, which we hope it will do within the next few days or weeks.  We do not yet know that Brexit will be an exceptional circumstance and do not hope or anticipate there will be a no-deal Brexit, but it remains to be seen.</p> <p>  The largest part of the Rebuilding Ireland 2040 plan relates to climate change.  We are dealing with circumstances as they arise on the basis of the voted amount in budget 2019 which was published in October 2018.  The Deputy stated it was not enough, but I do not want the level of investment to spiral upwards either, as happened before the recession, when we spent more than we had, thus creating a situation where we had to bring in workers to build houses and then had to house those workers.  That was a mistake.  If we spend more capital in the construction sector, we will have to bring in more workers because currently we do not have enough.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge the Deputy's points.  Nobody and no political party is not moved by the fact that there are more than 10,000 people in the country who are homeless.</p></speech>

I do not understand the Minister of State's objection.  We can argue about whether we are investing enough in housing provision.  The Minister of State says we are, but I say we are not.  By refusing to include in legislation that the money could be used to deal with a housing crisis, we are cutting off that option next year, the following year and the year after that.  It is not just a matter of the here and now.  The Minister of State is of the opinion that enough is being invested.  I disagree, but by not allowing the amendments to be included in the Bill, we are cutting off the option forever and restricting ourselves to the three circumstances outlined, which is not prudent.</p></speech>

The benefit of having a representative democracy is that a future Oireachtas will have the opportunity to decide on the course it wishes to take in respect of this matter.  If Sinn F&eacute;in forms part of the next Government and if the latter has a majority in both Houses and decides to change this legislation, that will be a matter for it.  The Government believes that the correct and prudent thing to do is to allocate funding of &euro;1.5 billion from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  We are not currently spending that on housing.  I do not hear the Deputy calling for that money to be spent on housing.  If Sinn F&eacute;in goes into government in the future, it will be able to change the legislation if it has a majority in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  That would be a matter for it to decide.  The Government believes this is the right and prudent thing to do and is in line with what is happening other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

This relates to the drawdown of funds.  Three of Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments were ruled out of order and we have gone over that argument so I will not repeat it.  It is a proviso for a drawdown that the Minister must get the permission of the Oireachtas to do so.  That is not the case, as Deputy Paul Murphy outlined earlier.  There is a clause to the effect that, if the Oireachtas is not sitting, the Minister can withdraw the money if he believes it is necessary to do so and then lay a report before the Oireachtas.  We do not agree with that and think that any money being withdrawn from the fund should be a matter for the Oireachtas and if that means recalling the D&aacute;il and doing it overnight there should not be an issue with that.  We oppose that provision.</p></speech>

A responsible Government cannot focus all of its resources on one challenge as that would only exacerbate the other challenges.  The establishment of the rainy day fund is a longer term decision which represents part of a wider policy commitment to ensure sound public finances and, in this context, should not be seen as an either-or choice with other policy issues.  Sinn F&eacute;in's approach in amendment Nos. 18 and 21 is incorrect in seeking to delete sections 4 and 5, which the Government sees as necessary to provide for a situation where the funds need to be accessed while the D&aacute;il is in recess, or is effectively prevented from sitting because of an extreme crisis.  Section 9 contains a modification to the procedure set out in subsection (4) for cases of serious urgency.  The Government's approach is that if the Minister believes, based upon reasonable grounds, that a payment into the Exchequer is urgently necessary before the next sitting of the D&aacute;il, and the Government approves it, he or she may make the payment into the Exchequer.  He or she must then report to the D&aacute;il on the payment and reasons for it at its next sitting.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment to section 7 has deleted the reference to the financial system and maintaining financial stability as the party is opposed to the fund being used for a future bank bailout.  I am happy to clarify that, where the fund is drawn down, it will be to the Exchequer only and where it goes thereafter will be determined by the D&aacute;il or by the Minister in an unforeseen circumstance.  Direct payment to any person or organisation is neither contemplated nor permitted.</p></speech>

The Minister of State referred to cases in which the D&aacute;il may not be able to sit.  What is an example of that?  We have spoken about weather events.</p></speech>

This fund is for unforeseen circumstances so I do not know what that circumstance would be but this gives the flexibility for it to happen if it is required but it must be based upon reasonable grounds which will not be flippant or glib.</p></speech>

Being in recess is not an extreme circumstance.  The D&aacute;il can be recalled within 24 hours.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1919" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the clerk to the committee for allocating time for detailed scrutiny of the Urban Regeneration and Housing (Amendment) Bill 2018.  The Bill was introduced on First Stage in June 2018 and passed Second Stage in July 2018 where it was supported by all Opposition parties and Independents.  The Government did not oppose it at that time.</p> <p>  I also thank both Professor Drudy and Mr. Reynolds for agreeing to act as stakeholders and I look forward to their presentations.  I also thank Mr. Oonan, who wrote the Bill.  The Bill amends the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, which I will hereafter refer to as the 2015 Act, which introduced the concepts of the vacant site levy and vacant site register to deal with the problem of land hoarding.  At the time, the introduction of a levy and a register for vacant sites was encouraging, however the subsequent legislation to enact the levy was inadequate and full of loopholes.  This amendment Bill seeks to plug some of these holes. </p> <p>  Overvalued development land has been having a detrimental effect on how we supply housing in Ireland for over half a century and I have experienced it at first hand.  I set up my own building company in 1989 and began purchasing land in the mid-1990s.  To give the committee an example of the land increases we saw during the Celtic tiger, in 1997 I bought a fifth of an acre site in Dublin for &pound;150,000.  In 2004, I bought another fifth of an acre site in Dublin for &euro;4.8 million.  In seven years, the price of development land in our capital city had increased more than thirtyfold and, unfortunately, land prices are getting back to similarly exaggerated levels.  The site I bought in 1997 was in a so-called better area than the one for which I later paid &euro;4.8 million.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to disincentivise landbanking and land hoarding with a view to addressing the overall problem of the price of development land in Ireland and the effect it has on the property market.  The main provisions of the Bill provide stricter definitions for what constitutes a vacant or idle site, increase the vacant site levy and remove certain exemptions in relation to the levy, remove three of the four appeals allowed under the 2015 Act and provide an option for the owner of the site deemed vacant to enter into negotiations with the relevant local authority or State agency to sell the site for a percentage of its value.  We received correspondence to the effect that we may be subject to a money message because of that last provision.  That was included to ease the pain for people who are sitting on sites so that, rather than pauperise them, they are given an out that is financially fair if they find themselves in financial difficulty.</p> <p>  Section 4 of the Bill amends section 5 of the 2015 Act and provides for stricter definitions for what constitutes a vacant or idle site.  Sites will now be deemed vacant if they meet the following criteria: a site where planning permission for a development has exceeded 12 months and no commencement notice for development has been issued; a site where a commencement notice for a development has been issued and 36 months have elapsed without the completion of the site in question; a site where any unauthorised use or unauthorised development is occurring; and a site which is being utilised on an authorised temporary basis for an activity other than development.  </p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il pointed out in the Chamber that the criterion for a site where a commencement notice for a development had been issued and 36 months have elapsed without the completion of the site in question might cause a difficulty because a development could genuinely take more than 36 months to complete.  The phrase "substantial completion" could be inserted to capture a situation whereby people start a site but make no effort to finish it because they do not want to build out that site at that particular time.  We want to catch those in the net because that is, obviously, a form of land hoarding.</p> <p>  Section 4 is the most important section of the Bill.  The 2015 Act states that a site is vacant if the majority of the site is vacant or idle.  It sounds almost Kafkaesque.  This broad definition has been taken advantage by site owners and has made it difficult for both the local authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to determine vacancy and I will give two examples of this at a later stage. </p> <p>  Section 11 amends section 16 of the principal Act and provides that the vacant site levy shall be 25% of the market value of the vacant site.  The exemptions in section 16 of the principal Act have all been removed.  Those state that where the value of the mortgage or other security on the site is greater than the market value of the site - in other words a negative equity situation - a zero rate of levy shall apply, or where the outstanding amount of the site loan is between 75% and 100% of the market value of the vacant site on the date of its determination, a reduced rate of 0.75% levy shall apply, or where the outstanding amount of the site loan is between 50% and 75% of the market value of the vacant site on the date of its determination, a 1.5% rate of levy shall apply.  The levy of 25% is applied regardless of whether there is a loan, mortgage or security on the site in question.</p><p>The first point to note is that following the enactment of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018, on 19 July 2018, these exemptions relating to a loan or mortgage have been removed.  That is a welcome action by the Government.  Perhaps they listen to us sometimes after all.  At the time the 2015 Act was debated, I repeatedly told the Government that no good business person has a site that is not in some way mortgaged or used as security, and worse still, there is anecdotal evidence that site owners availed of these exemptions by using different companies under their control, in essence, to loan themselves money, thus becoming exempt from the levy and this has come to fruition through the sparse numbers on the vacant sites register, something that Mr. Mel Reynolds might touch on during his submission.  <br/><br/>This means that the main amendment now to section 11 is the increase of the levy to 25%.  The levy currently sits at 3% and will move to 7% in 2020.  Some may consider that 25% is too high a levy, but the goal of this legislation is to disincentivise, and 3% or even 7% will not force land hoarders to make use of their land.<br/><br/>As well as increasing the levy to 7% in 2020, the Government has also introduced a clause giving the Minister power to vary the levy rate by way of regulations having regard to increases or decreases in the CSO property price index and such regulations must be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, any increase in the levy rate above 7% must be subject to further primary legislation.  This basically means the Minister can lower the levy but not increase it.  If this Bill were to reach Committee Stage, an amendment allowing the Minister to vary the levy of 25%, by either by decreasing or increasing it, having regard to the current state of the economy, should alleviate some concerns about the rate of the levy. <br/><br/>Section 12 inserts a new section, which provides that where a site has been deemed vacant, the owner or owners of the site in question, prior to paying the 25% levy, may enter into negotiations with the relevant local authority or State public body, to sell the site for up to 60% of its value, as determined by section 12, if the relevant local authority or State public body deems the site viable for the supply of housing within its remit.  The owner or owners of the site in question, after paying the 25% levy for year one, may again seek to enter into negotiations with the relevant local authority or State public body to sell the site for up to 40% of its value. <br/><br/>On Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, appeared to put this option in the category of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, but that is not the case.  It is merely an option for a site owner to explore selling their site to a local authority or a State body, but importantly, both parties must agree.<br/><br/>In terms of examples, as I have stated, a key problem of the 2015 Act related to what constituted a vacant site.  The definition simply said a site is vacant if the majority of it is vacant.  This has allowed both public and private site owners to be creative when they met with a request by a local authority with regard to a site in their possession.  I will give two examples of this, one in public ownership and one in private.  <br/><br/>A site adjacent to Central Bank currency centre in Sandyford and owned by the bank was placed on the vacant sites register by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2018.  The site is described as being irregular in configuration and relatively flat, it covers an area of 4.67 ha and is valued at &euro;22.5 million.  The site is bounded to the north by sports pitches and to the south by the M50 slip road.  To the west, the site is adjoined by existing residential development and to the east by the main complex of the currency centre.  There are no structures on the site and it is zoned objective A to protect and-or to improve residential amenity in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Development Plan 2016-2022.  The Central Bank appealed its inclusion on the register to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and argued that: &quot;The site creates a security buffer enabling surveillance particularly of adjoining public roads and therefore are not vacant or idle but serve a very clear and critically important purpose and rationale for treating this part of the holding in a different manner to other undeveloped parts of the landholding which also form security buffers is unclear.&quot;  Unfortunately, An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepted this argument, indicating it was bound to interpret a vacant site under section 5 of the 2015 Act.  If stricter definitions were to apply to what constituted a vacant site, an argument such as this would not be successful.  Making the argument that the site is used as a security buffer would fall under the category of &quot;unauthorised use&quot; in our Bill under section 4.  This example also highlights the worrying approach of a State entity to land under their control in the midst of a housing crisis.  <br/><br/>With respect to the Irish Province of the Order of the Carmelites, the second example relates to a site owned by the Carmelites, valued at &euro;21.5 million, approximately 3.46 ha in size, located to the east of Ballinteer Road.  The site is largely flat with level changes to the north and is adjacent to and to the rear of the property known as Gort Mhuire, which comprises a large period property.  The Order of the Carmelites argued that it had planning permission for a car park on the site and it was, therefore, not vacant.  The car park in question is currently not in use and does not cover the majority of the site.  Although it was accepted by An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the car park was not in regular use, it stated it still had planning permission, and added that due to the inclusion of a permitted car park area within the boundary of the vacant site, the board considered that it was appropriate that a notice be issued to the planning authority to cancel the entry on the vacant sites register.  Under our Bill, the car park would fall into the category of &quot;authority temporary basis for an activity other than development&quot; under section 4.  <br/><br/>These two sites, which continue to lie vacant in a housing crisis, highlight the problems with the 2015 Act.  Arguing that a site is in use because it acts as a security buffer or contending that an unused car park means a site is in use illuminates the current loopholes available to site owners with a bit of imagination and it does not require much.<br/><br/>As always with legislation concerning private property, constitutional issues arise.  This is due to the prominent place private property holds within our Constitution under Articles 40.3.3<sup>0</sup>.  Unfortunately, the Government constantly hides behind both articles when legislation concerning property rights is presented by Opposition Deputies.  During Second Stage, both the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, stated: &quot;Previous legal advice received, indicates there are significant concerns about the constitutionality of specific provisions of the Deputy's Bill, which propose to dramatically increase the levy from 3% to 25% of the market value of a site, remove the important and fair appeals provisions in particular circumstances...&quot;.  This statement would appear to show that the Ministers of State are using previous legal advice to interpret my Bill, which is never a good idea, and I note neither specifically referred as to whether advice was received from the Attorney General. <br/><br/>We have secured legal advice with respect to the Bill from Mr. Paul McGarry, SC, former chairperson of the Bar Council, which I have shared with committee members.  I will not attempt to bring them through the advice, but the basic premise of it is that none of the provisions could be labelled as unconstitutional, and with regard to the imposition of a 25% tax on site value, Mr. McGarry states:</p><blockquote>It seems to me that the issue is not about whether the provisions constitute an unjust attack on the right to private property.  This is because the issue of valuation is linked, not to ownership, but to the concept of &quot;development&quot;.  Permission for development is granted by a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la<br /><br />...that value has already arguably been inflated by the grant by the State of the permission to develop or possibility to develop.  Any infringement argument has to be seen in this context.  Since the authorities state that licences or permissions come with the proviso that they may be interfered with in the common good (and subject to the principle of proportionality), there should in my view be no difficulty in justifying the measure.</blockquote><p>We are all aware of the infamous money message, which under D&aacute;il Standing Order 179(2) provides that if a Bill involves the appropriation or revenue or other public moneys, &quot;Committee Stage ... shall not be taken unless the purpose of the appropriation has been recommended to the D&aacute;il by a Message from the Government.&quot;  It appears the Ceann Comhairle has determined this Bill requires a money message, due to the provisions of section 12.  As I have outlined, the section is entirely optional and can only be exercised with the agreement of both the site owner and local authority.  I ask the committee to examine this ruling by the Ceann Comhairle, as it would be unfortunate if the Bill were not to progress due to this one element, as the key provisions of the Bill - stricter definitions of what a vacant site is, removing the multiple appeals, and increasing the levy - must be implemented if the vacant sites levy is to achieve its goal of putting an end to land hoarding. <br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and the members for their attention and I will gladly answer any questions they have.</p></speech>

Drudy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#F00100"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me.  I think the Bill is a good one and an important element if we are to increase the supply of land and, hence, housing.  If we increase the supply of land and housing, we will actually reduce house prices and rents.  I know that may not appeal in some quarters, but I it is a very important goal for everybody to try to achieve because house prices and rents are too high.</p> <p>  I am not telling members anything they do not already know, but we have a crisis.  To put it mildly, some ownership is difficult for people.  It is beyond the reach of many young and not so young people.  The housing market is not working in many ways.  Supply and demand are the two critical issues.  Supply is not coming on-stream fast enough.  There is remarkable volatility in the market, as members will see in the table on page 1 of my submission.  In 1975, 18,000 homes were built by the private sector.  In 2005 that number shot up to 75,000, with many of those houses being in areas where they were not required.  There were far too many, resulting in ghost estates, etc.  In 2018 the number was down to 13,800.  There is something radically wrong with a market where there is significant demand for housing and only a small number of houses are being built.  The market is failing.  There is remarkable volatility in the private sector.  I am not here to criticise that sector, but the message I would like to get across is that reliance on it alone is inadequate.  I have heard many Deputies and Senators say this during the years.</p> <p>  The data on the right hand side of the table indicate that local authority and approved housing body provision has not been much better.  In fact, it has been very bad.  It has dropped dramatically, from almost 9,000 homes in 1975 to 4,251.  Those 4,251 homes include Part V and turnkey homes purchased by the local authorities from the private sector.  The local authorities are building small numbers.  The end product is that house prices have increased significantly and are badly out of line with general inflation, the cost of building and average earnings.  I have a diagram on page 2 which shows how new apartment and house prices have changed.  Prices are way above what they were at the peak in 2007, which is problematic.  Some 30 years ago, a mortgage could be taken out by one person and on that one modest salary one could buy a house.  Nowadays, that is out of the question for many young people.  Something is radically wrong with this.  Working couples with childcare costs struggle with the equivalent of two mortgages.</p> <p>  Supply is critical, but demand is also an issue.  It should be obvious from Table 1 that the local authorities are purchasing turnkey homes.  This was alluded to by Deputy Darragh O'Brien in the newspaper recently.  It is a problem.  If the local authorities are purchasing homes, they are in competition with young people, which is a problem.  Approved housing bodies and other non-housing bodies are also purchasing homes.  There is a problem with young and not so young people having to compete with those who should not be purchasing houses.  I know that it has been the practice for many years, but the local authorities and approved housing bodies should really build rather than purchase houses.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  The private rented sector is equally problematic.  The committee knows all of the problems, including increasing and unaffordable rents, insecurity of tenure and poor standards.  In fairness to the Government, the introduction of rent regulation was a very important element in trying to solve the problem.  It was much criticised at the time and there was significant lobbying against it by major international companies.  I am pleased that at the time the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Government stuck it out and went along with it.  Ideally, rent regulation should be extended throughout the country, as opposed to simply having pressure zones, but it was a good initiative, for which I certainly argued strongly a few years ago at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The other problem in the private rented sector is that a range of multinational and property developers have purchased and now control a high proportion of the houses and apartments available.  They buy in blocks, which is a real problem and I am not quite sure how we should deal with it.  I have no doubt that the Government is aware of it, as is the Chairman of this important committee.  It certainly requires some action, although I do not know how it would be done.</p> <p>  There are negative consequences related to high house prices and rents which we know are completely out of line with the consumer price index, average earnings and the cost of building.  They are bad for the economy, which is a central point.  A high proportion of disposable income is tied up in repaying mortgage debt or rents for an extended period and the result is less disposable income to be spent on employment creating activities.  There is something radically wrong with a situation where substantial amounts of people's incomes have to be spent on housing.  There are very few people here who are older than me, but some young people would not understand that long ago one could quite easily have bought a house with one salary.  Some people benefit.  Some homeowners think they are sitting on a gold mine and very happy, but I think they are very foolish.  They should think of their children and grandchildren.</p> <p>  Apart from the economic reasons to try to keep house prices and rents down, there are reasons of social equity and ethical reasons housing should not be expensive.  It should be a home, rather than a commodity.  The commodification of housing is a serious problem.  Financialisation is a global issue where large finance companies and funds purchase housing which they see as a fantastic, sound asset to purchase, but they are not thinking of young people.</p> <p>  The other problem apart from the private sector is that there has been a dramatic decline in the construction of homes by the local authorities, housing associations and other non-profit organisations, as members saw in the table.  I am sorry to say it is not good enough.  We have to return to a situation where the Government has a policy of ensuring the local authorities, approved housing bodies and so on will build houses.  I remember writing about this issue 15 or 16 years ago.  Since 2004 successive Governments have turned to and relied unduly on the private rented sector to provide social housing.  The cost is enormous, at more than &euro;900 million.  Mr. Mel Reynolds has just given me a figure for 2018 of &euro;934 million spent on a combination of homelessness services, rent supplement, the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment scheme and so on.  I have no doubt that it is well intentioned, but not one single extra long-term home is available as a result of this enormous expenditure.  We should think again.  It is essential that we reverse the alarming reduction in the provision for public housing.  We should also move away from reliance on the private rented sector.  I know that it is well intentioned, but it is foolish.</p><p>The key point is that the State can compete with the private sector if it becomes involved in a serious way, for example, by building a lot of social housing and cost rental housing.  I will not go into detail.  That involves building homes for the cost of construction, maintenance and so on.  They are let not only to social housing tenants but to a range of tenants who are above the threshold of social housing.  Social housing and cost rental can be integrated.  The State owns the land and the State can do this.  It would save money on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, because rents would be lower for all.  Subsidies would be much lower and rents would be lower for those above the threshold.  I would argue very strongly for action on the part of the State.  In fairness to the Government, it has accepted the idea of cost rental.  The Chair will be aware of one fine scheme on the Enniskerry Road under the remit of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Another scheme is under way in Inchicore, also accepted by the Government.  There is no doubt that the Government and the Minister are amenable to this.  We simply have to move ahead on it rather rapidly.</p><p> I have referred to the importance of supply as well as demand.  I will not bore the committee with the figures I have provided on land availability.  Mr. Reynolds has the same information.  A lot of land is available.  The land availability survey of 2004 illustrated that very clearly.  Various vacant site surveys undertaken by the local authorities and so on clearly show that land is a key element.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, accept that land is a key issue.  We must have the land or we cannot do anything.  The land is capable of producing enormous amounts of housing.  I will not go into the figures again, but 2,600 ha, sufficient for 116,000 homes, are available to the Dublin local authorities alone.  That is a lot of houses.  They are needed.  We need around 30,000 homes per annum, not just 18,000 as was produced last year.  There are tremendous possibilities.</p><p> I thank the committee members for their patience.  It is important to acknowledge that genuine efforts have been made to date.  It is no use criticising and saying that nothing has been done.  That would be unfair.  However, more needs to be done.  Urgent action on unused land is required.  As such, the purpose of this Bill is to bring forward residential development.  It seems to me that land is being hoarded.  Houses are being drip-fed onto the market to keep prices high.  I feel very much that this Bill has the potential to make a dramatic change.  There is great interest on the part of the Government.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, already introduced various changes.  There seems to be agreement across the political spectrum that this is very important.  That is all I want to say at this stage.  I will answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1924" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mel Reynolds" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#G00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a presentation.  There are three sections to my presentation.  Some of my remarks will touch on areas that Professor Drudy has mentioned.</p> <p>  In the past 20 years wages have increased by 22% while house prices in the Dublin commuter belt have increased by about 150%.  House prices are increasing at about seven times the rate of wages.  This 20-year trend has had a significant impact on affordability for first-time buyers and society as a whole.  Higher rents mean that it takes longer to save for deposits.  Buyers are older, must work for longer, and require two-full time salaries, and significant equity from parents or both to buy a home.  Increased construction costs and building standards are not the problem.</p> <p>  As an overview of housing supply, in 2017 the Housing Agency suggested that to meet demand a minimum of 16,000 new homes were required in urban areas every year until 2020.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, a little over 13,000 scheme homes and apartments, excluding single homes, were for sale out of a total of 18,000 completed last year.  Contrary to a lot of commentary, the State is very active in the new build sector but in very particular ways.  In 2018, local authorities and approved housing bodies purchased or built almost 4,600 dwellings, including Part V units.  Some 64% of these were purchased as new homes from the private sector.  The average price paid for local authority turnkey and new build social housing authority dwellings was less than the affordable threshold of &euro;240,000.  On the other side, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, funded the construction of 2,500 new homes last year.  Some 40% of the new homes funded by NAMA sold for more than &euro;400,000, and 67% sold for more than &euro;300,000, way above the affordable threshold.</p> <p>  Between these two figures, excluding purpose-built social housing, the State subvented more than half of all private dwellings built for sale last year.  That is a huge number.  Unfortunately, the State is competing with ordinary buyers in the affordable housing market while simultaneously using State funds to build severely unaffordable schemes.  Just one affordable housing scheme is being built nationwide, by &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance in Ballymun.  In partnership with Dublin City Council, that co-operative is building a scheme of more than 30 dwellings, with two-bed units priced at &euro;185,000 and three-bed homes at &euro;219,000 including VAT and developers' profit.  This scheme is privately financed and will be completed this year.</p> <p>  Budget 2018 saw the introduction of an affordable housing fund, which was expanded to &euro;310 million last year.  This fund is a subsidy scheme intended to give a discount of up to 40% on homes built on State land, up to &euro;50,000 per unit.  Ten locations have been selected.  Infrastructure and service works are yet to commence on these sites.  No homes have been delivered to date and the earliest projected completion date is late 2020.  Given that construction price inflation is well over 7% at the moment, a three-year delay in delivery will increase costs by more than 20%, further impacting on affordability.  Homes in these schemes may also be suitable for the help-to-buy scheme, adding a further &euro;20,000 per unit to State costs.  Is this sustainable?</p> <p>  Turning to public housing supply, I note that more than 90% of additional State social housing is sourced from the private sector.  According to Rebuilding Ireland, of the 27,100 social housing solutions delivered nationwide from all sources in 2018, just 1,600 homes, 6%, were built by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  In 2017, 4% were built by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The State is very reliant on the private sector for this.</p> <p>  In 2018, 18,000 new housing assistance payment, HAP, leases were created.  This is a very accurate measure of the distress in the rental sector.  The five-year target under the Rebuilding Ireland action plan is to create 87,500 new HAP tenancies by 2021.  This would equate to one private sector tenancy in four.  Last year the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform estimated that if these targets are achieved, spending on rent assistance will increase from the current spend of more than &euro;1 billion a year to &euro;1.7 billion per annum by 2022.  This is the equivalent of spending the cost of a new children's hospital per year on rents to private landlords.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also noted that it is twice as expensive to engage in rent assistance in areas of high demand like Dublin than it is to build on State land over a 30-year period.  Current policy appears to be at odds with the with the Department's recommendations.  Local authorities are buying and building in areas of low demand while continuing to create new HAP tenancies at scale in County Dublin.  In 2018, just 634 new social homes were built by the four Dublin local authorities, including regeneration units which involve demolition.  Demolitions and sales of existing stock must then be accounted for, leaving a lower net figure of additional stock.</p> <p>  I will comment briefly on land, which Professor Drudy mentioned earlier.  In 2015, the land availability survey confirmed a capacity for about 414,000 dwellings on zoned land nationwide.  In Dublin there is space for about 116,000 dwellings.  We have an abundance of development land.  Unfortunately, much of the current development consists of piecemeal low-density commuter dwellings, increasing urban sprawl and not maximising the potential of centrally located land.</p><p> In regard to State-controlled land, an analysis last year confirmed that, excluding land owned by other semi-State bodies such as the IDA, Coillte, the Housing Agency and CI&Eacute;, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, debtors and local authorities own 17% of residential zoned land nationwide, with the capacity for more than 100,000 dwellings.  Of this, NAMA controls 60% and local authorities own 40%, but that is enough State-owned land for more than 40,000 dwellings nationwide, owned by local authorities.  Densities have subsequently increased from the 2015 figure due to the lifting of the height caps.  In Dublin, between NAMA-controlled debtors and local authorities, almost half of all residential zoned land with capacity for more than 55,000 dwellings is controlled by the State.  In Dublin city alone, almost three out of four vacant sites are controlled by the State, with Dublin City Council owning half of the sites.</p><p> Turning to land values and affordability, land price is a significant issue affecting affordability.  Typically, upwards of 35% of a dwelling's sale price comprises land value and developer&rsquo;s profit, although this can be a lot higher.  Land price is highly volatile.  A 10% increase in a new-home price translates to a 30% increase in land values.  The opposite is also true, however, and land values can fall dramatically when prices soften.  Land trading and speculation is a feature of the Dublin land market, with less than one quarter of residential planning permissions turning into completed units after three years.  </p><p> The residual site value for land is derived from the sale prices less costs and margin.  In some Dublin locations, the residual value is significantly exceeded, which suggests an inflated land market.  When developers overpay for land, developments stall until sale prices increase to a level where it is viable, that is, where it is profitable to build.  Developers will not build where they will make a loss.  Forty years of CSO data since 1975 demonstrates that demand leads supply by approximately 12 months.  The currently stalling sales levels and prices suggest a drop in the number of homes being built in the latter part of last year in certain locations.  When prices fall, supply falls.</p><p> One critical area that has affected prices is the promotion of alternative uses.  We know that planning changes have delayed development and encouraged repeat applications and land speculation.  Analysis by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce of planning applications for new apartments in Dublin suggests recent planning reforms have had a dampening impact on the supply of new apartments, added to which are the inflationary effects of new, more intensive forms of residential development being promoted by policy.  Co-housing, shared-living developments and student housing are short-term, intensive and very profitable uses.  In the midst of a housing shortage, the industry continues to prioritise student housing schemes.  One example of this is the recent sale of a large student housing scheme in Ballymun.  The sale price was &euro;46 million for 364 bed-spaces, equating to &euro;126,000 per bed-space.  In planning terms, a unit with four bed-spaces is the equivalent size of a normal two-bed apartment and, therefore, for residential development to be as profitable as this scheme, it would need to sell for more than &euro;500,000 in Ballymun.  Currently on Daft, however, one can see two-bed properties for sale for between &euro;150,000 and &euro;170,000.  Sites for student housing or new co-living uses are significantly more valuable than normal residential properties in most Dublin locations.  Apartments will not be built unless this trend is addressed.  </p><p> The vacant site levy was proposed in 2016 to penalise owners of vacant land and stimulate activity.  Although introduced in January 2017, the tax is charged only from 2019 onwards for sites included on registers.  The levy had been on a sliding scale, where the larger the loan that was attached to the land, the lower the levy that was due.  The original maximum level was 3%, based on a 2018 land market value.  Last October, to its credit, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government moved to make the levy more effective for owners, removing the sliding scale and increasing the levy to 7%.  Questions, however, continue to surround the effectiveness of the measure in the current market.  To date, just 21 of 31 local authorities have listed sites as vacant on public registers.  Dublin City Council is one of the most proactive of all the local authorities and its register includes approximately 16 ha of land in the ownership of the council itself.  This is a fraction, however, of the 112 ha of vacant zoned residential land owned by the council, which is on the Rebuilding Ireland land availability plan.  Figures for other local authorities that have populated registers are lower again.  Despite the best intentions of the Department, local authorities appear reluctant to implement the site levy and have cited a number of reasons, from lack of resources to low land values.  This inertia worryingly suggests that local authorities have little resources or support from the Government for strategic land management. </p><p> The supply of public housing is heavily reliant on the private sector.  This is an expensive way to meet demand because it involves paying market value for units, high site prices, expensive financing costs and developers' margins.  The National Economic and Social Council and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have recommended that the State directly procure social housing on State land in areas of high demand such as County Dublin, and continue rent supplement in low-demand areas where prices and rents are lower.  In a time of constrained industry output, such over-reliance on the private sector is having an inflationary effect on rents, prices and land values.  Affordable housing schemes, which rely on discounted purchase prices, effectively subvent high prices and are prone to failure in downturns.  Current policy assumes new housing output will continue to increase and has not been risk-assessed to take account of the cyclical nature of development.  When the cycle turns, less money is available, which means that fewer houses will be produced by the private sector, leading to fewer dwellings available for rent or purchase.  This is a high-risk strategy and there have been indications that we are at or close to the peak of the current cycle.  A proper, functioning vacant site levy, implemented in a transparent and consistent manner by all local authorities, should be encouraged.  Once changes are signalled in an unambiguous and timely manner, costs will be transferred back into site values.  Proceeds from any site levy should be ring-fenced to provide finance for affordable housing.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Wallace for introducing the Bill.  The vacant site levy has not worked in the way it was intended.  There has been a lack of engagement by local authorities to take it seriously, there are issues with how the site selection was carried out, and some local authorities are more proactive than others.  There are a great deal of aspects, therefore, that have not clicked or made the levy work in the way it was envisaged.  Furthermore, it contained many get-out clauses, as Mr. Reynolds identified.  Homing in on a few specific aspects, I have wondered what is causing land prices to continue to escalate.  While holding and land banking is a part of that, flipping is another part and it dates back to the planning permission process.  Over a period, I have wondered whether we need to reconsider what the final grant of planning permission is.</p><p>If I am a developer, it is easy and cost effective to obtain planning permission on zoned lands.  A developer will have to invest significant funding to deliver construction drawings before the final grant of planning permission.  The Bill defines a &ldquo;vacant or idle&rdquo; site as one in respect of which the period of planning permission for a development has exceeded 12 months.  By the time a developer has construction drawings made, he or she could easily have exceeded the 12-month limit.  While I do not necessarily disagree with it, it could be another cost for the developer which commits him or her to the site, rather than just obtaining and flipping planning permission.</p><p> The Bill also provides a definition for a &ldquo;vacant or idle&rdquo; site as one in respect of which a commencement notice for a development has been issued and 36 months have elapsed without completion.  Developers get into trouble and various matters can slow down work.  I appreciate that the Deputy has said he will examine this issue.</p><p> Will Deputy Wallace work through the logic of a landowner being able to sell a site to a local authority at 40% of its market price?  However, there will be no onus on the landowner to sell it.  How will that work out?</p><p> The State buying turnkey units and developments is becoming a concern of mine.  Last year the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government gave a commitment that he would stop interfering in the private market and buying private housing units.  He has stopped buying one, two or three units.  Instead, however, the State is buying entire developments.  It has bought one entire development of 40 houses in Wicklow town.  It is buying 75 units in another development of 150 units and 88 units in a development of 100 units in Rathnew.  These were all meant to be houses for people who wanted to get onto the housing ladder.  Now, the State has interfered in the market and taken these houses away from potential first-time buyers and included them in its housing stock.  It comes back to the fundamental principle that the State needs to take control of building its own housing and not depend on the private sector.  It is becoming more evident every year that the Government is relying on turnkey developments to meet its targets.  It is, however, taking houses out of the private market and actually inflating the cost of housing for first-time buyers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1929" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#J00200"><p>When I received planning permission, I would not have had the working drawings made because I was afraid I would not receive planning permission because changes would have had to be made.  Collaboration in advance of seeking planning permission would be a good way of avoiding this issue, but it is not perfect.  With my builder&rsquo;s hat on, insisting on all of the working drawings being made in advance would place a serious expense on the builder or developer.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey asked if a period of 12 months was enough after a developer received planning permission.  In my experience, it was always enough.  I was able to have the working drawings made in a maximum period of about three months.  After receiving planning permission, I never sat on a site for more than 12 months because I was not a landbanker.  I had to buy land from landbankers and paid a lot of money for it.  Accordingly, I had a big incentive to build as quick as possible.  For example, I bought a site of one fifth of an acre on Dominick Street for &euro;4.8 million.  By the time I had designed the site, obtained planning permission and started construction, two years had elapsed.  The interest rate was 6.5% which resulted in a total site purchase cost of &euro;6 million.  It cost me the same amount to build on the site.  I was paying so much money to the banks from the day I had bought the site that I could not get onto it quickly enough to have the work finished quickly enough to stop paying so much money in interest.  When I was about three quarters of the way through the work, I was paying &euro;80,000 a month in interest.  It is nuts, but there is an incentive to start work.  I am confident that developers who genuinely want to build will get onto a site within 12 months.  However, if a developer has problems, for example, with working drawings, and cannot get onto a site for 18 months, there will be an appeals mechanism.  If the problems are genuine, the developer will be listened to and treated fairly.</p> <p>  On the 36-month provision, it is unusual for it to happen with a development.  Building 20 or 100 units can take almost the same length of time.  Rather than provide that a development must be completed within 36 months, it should be substantially completed within that period.  Again, there will be an appeals mechanism.  It will be obvious if a developer is trying to finish the development.  If anyone completes half of the work, I can guarantee that he or she will keep going because of the price of money.  One would be mad to stop because it would just be too expensive to do so.</p> <p>  On selling a site to the State at 40% or 60% of its market price, we have tied down the definition more finely.  For example, Mr. Jones has a site with planning permission to build 100 houses, but he does not feel like building them just yet because he knows that prices are going up, meaning he will make more money if he holds off.  We propose imposing a 25% levy on Mr. Jones which will be a serious disincentive to hold onto a site.  What if he has difficulties in selling the site on the private market?  What if he is in trouble because he owes a lot of money on it and will now have to pay a 25% levy every year?  That will put him to the pin of his collar.</p><p>What we are doing is like a sop to developers or landholders.  We are giving them an out or an opportunity, if it suits them and if it suits the local authority, to sell for 60% of an agreed market value in year one.  If they do not take it up and pay the tax in the first year, we are giving them a chance in the second year to sell it at 40% of the agreed value.  Obviously, it is far more attractive for them not to pay the 25% in the first year and sell it to the local authority at 60%.  Really, this is an opportunity for them to get out without being skint.  It gives them an out if they have problems selling the land or cannot get the funding to build it out.  Some people cannot get funding to build out projects.  </p><p> As Mr. Oonan pointed out to me this morning, Dublin City Council has just prepared a report in its problems with the vacant site levy.  The report points out that 162 sites were found that could have qualified except that they were smaller than the size stipulated in the legislation.  I know that Senator Grace O'Sullivan tried to bring that down when the legislation was being debated.  It was originally set at 0.1 ha but I successfully tabled an amendment to change it to 0.05 ha.  The council has pointed out that there were 162 sites which were just under 0.05 ha, which is actually 500 sq. feet.  There is an argument for bringing it down further to 0.03 ha because one could fit 12 or 13 apartments on sites that are just below 0.05 ha.  Obviously, one cannot build on the entire space because that will pose public space challenges and one must adhere to the rules in that regard.  However, there is an argument for reducing the site size further.  Many of those smaller sites are not owned by big players who do not bother with small sites.  The smaller sites are generally owned by smaller entities and they may struggle to get the funding to build on their sites.  At the moment it is difficult to get funding to build out sites. </p></speech>

Deputy Wallace is talking about the smaller builders, many of whom cannot get finance to build out an entire development.  They are getting funding in a piecemeal fashion so that they build five or ten apartments, pocket that money and then the bank might bankroll the next five or ten apartments.  That is why it is becoming attractive for the State to intervene and buy the entire development site and develop it in one go.  This is about creating opportunities.</p> <p>  My idea with regard to the planning is to try to prevent speculators who just get planning permission.  That is why I was talking about having construction drawings built into the planning application process so at least a commitment to build is being demonstrated.  Deputy Wallace referred to developers who want to develop out a site but there are other developers out there who just want to get planning permission, flip sites and then move on.  That is why I was talking about a two-stage planning process that includes building drawings.  That is all I was talking about there.</p></speech>

If the developer waits for 11 months and then flips the site, does the buyer also get 12 months' grace?  Do they keep flipping the site?  A good, healthy stamp duty comes into play there.  In that context, I paid &euro;500,000 in stamp duty on the Dominick Street site to which I referred earlier.  The Government has seriously reduced stamp duty which actually encourages more flipping of sites.  I will not go into too much detail now but many of the big players avoided paying stamp duty back in the boom times.  A number of different vehicles were used to avoid paying stamp duty and they were legal, unfortunately.  That is a different issue.</p></speech>

Excluding the help-to-buy scheme, which further increases the number of State subvented units, something like 53% of all privately built houses that are estate homes and apartments built for sale were in some way subvented by the State.  They were either funded by the National Asset Management Agency or purchased as turnkey purchases.  Between approved housing bodies and local authorities, more than 2,000 privately built houses were purchased from the private sector last year.  If we were building 50,000 units per year, that level would be fine but only 13,000 units were built last year.  Not only is the cocktail of State policies inflating the private sector market, if one includes the HAP scheme, something like one third of all private sector tenancies are State subvented as well.  An enormous amount of State money is going into housing and is inflating the private sector market.  The State is competing with private sector buyers.  It is very worrying, particularly as we may be heading into a stalled or a downturn period shortly.  Any initiatives that are being considered should be looked at through the filter of what happens when new housing supply drops.  What happens then?</p></speech>

Everything possible must be done to facilitate the building of more housing.  Professor Drudy said that the market is failing us and Mr. Reynolds agrees.  On the legislation, local authorities are telling me that the site levy is not working because they do not have the capacity to collect it.  While I completely support and welcome Deputy Wallace's legislation and hope it passes through the Houses soon, how can we ensure that the levy will be collected and then ring-fenced in order to boost the supply of housing?  We are totally failing at the moment.  It is very depressing to sit here, two and half years into the Rebuilding Ireland programme, and see every facet of it failing.  Reference was made to student housing but everywhere one looks, the system is failing.  I support this legislation but I ask Deputy Wallace what can be done to ensure that the levy, which was increased from a meagre 3% to 7%, will be collected and will have the effect of freeing up land for building.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1940" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#K01100"><p>The Senator's first point on the homeless figures that were published this morning is very relevant.  The fact that land is too dear in Ireland leads to expensive housing.  Expensive housing leads to evictions as people cannot make their repayments because the initial price was beyond their means.  When they are evicted, they become homeless.  Rents are too high because property prices are too high.  We have not managed the rental sector well.  As Professor Drudy said, the introduction of the rent pressure zones and the 4% limit was good but the problem is that we started from a very high base.  While we are only allowing a 4% increase, we did not start out at a common sense or affordable level.  We started at a point when things had already gone mad.  We are only allowing landlords to increase rents by 4% per year above mad levels.  The bar was too high to start out with.</p> <p>  The main reason that residential property is too dear is land-banking.</p><p>That is the truth.  I have made the point on several occasions that 30 km outside the centre of any city on mainland Europe, one will get a three-bedroom house for &euro;160,000, and if one goes 30 km outside Dublin, one will pay double that sum for a three-bedroom house.  That is madness.  It is built into the land price.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not tax the gain on the land that one is sitting on and its price is going up.  It is a free meal for them.  As long as we allow that, we will continue to have expensive land.  It also will go up and down, which is madness as well.  The State should be avoiding situations where things go up and down because it leads to insecurity and to problems.  In the case of housing, it leads to homelessness.</p><p> On the second point about the vacant site levy, local authorities have made it plain that they have struggled with it.  Some of them have no sites on their vacant site levy list for January 2019.  Some of them state that they could not handle it because there were too many loopholes in it.  Our Bill addresses much of that.  We are tightening it up so that it is clearer to the local authority what is and is not a vacant site.  It was so clouded and vague that there were more holes in it than in a sieve and it was too easy for site owners.  I pointed out two simple examples where it was so easy to argue one's way out of it by stating that a site was not really vacant and one was using it for this or that.</p><p> With regard to whether the local authorities have the resources to collect the levy, if they have not, given that it would bring in a great deal of money, how about resourcing the local authorities to be able to do it?  If they do not have enough staff to do it, let us give them to the local authorities.  It would be a good investment for the Government because it would get buckets of money back if it could get this levy up and running, especially at a proper rate, such as 25%.  There is a considerable amount of money to be taken in by the State annually if it taxed land-banking, and the money could be ring-fenced for social housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1942" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mel Reynolds" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#L00200"><p>To drill down into that and put a number on it, in Dublin city centre, which is an area where Dublin City Council is very active, the local authority did its vacant site study in 2015 and knows where all the vacant sites are.  There are 298 ha of zoned residential land.  The value per hectare is approximately &euro;10 million.  That is &euro;3 billion worth of land currently in Dublin city only.  If Deputy Wallace's proposal is correct and it brings more land into this, for example, if half of that land was brought under the levy and the levy was raised to 20%, that would be &euro;300 million a year in Dublin City Council alone which could be ring-fenced for affordable housing.  On the flip side, the value of loans attached to the State's landbank in local authorities to which Professor Michelle Norris referred are approximately &euro;450 million and the counter-cyclical potential for this measure to deliver affordable housing is very strong.  The most compelling aspect about this for me is that this is not merely about beating somebody with a stick.  It is about the State pulling back and stating that the market has gone bananas and we should harvest some of it.  The State has no capital gains.  It has no way to increase revenue.  This is a quick and easy way to harvest some of the gain.  In some locations in Dublin, site prices have gone up fivefold.</p> <p>  Landowners will not like it.  Those involved in land speculation will not like it.  As Deputy Wallace stated, developers and builders have nothing to fear here because if they intend on building, this will have a mitigating effect on price rises.  If any changes to the vacant site levy are introduced in a consistent and clear way and are telegraphed in advance, the market will not mind that because it will be reflected in land values.  Ultimately, what we want is to see the land market calming down.</p> <p>  One could find that the entire loans associated with local authority housing could be extinguished in the first year of operation of this enhanced levy.  That would allow local authorities with landbanks and no loans attached to them to pass on those sites to ordinary buyers at the discounts that we are seeing &Oacute; Cualann provide.  One of the challenges in the affordable housing model is who pays for the site.  If the purchaser pays for the site, it is not affordable and a local authority is left with a hole on its balance sheet, but if the local authority was able to ring-fence the levy for that purpose and pay off the loans, this is a compelling countercyclical measure that would in some way start to unpick what we see going on in the wider housing sector, which was mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

At present, section 18 of the 2015 Act allows the site owner to appeal the demand of payment of the levy, and this is after he or she may already have appealed it.  It is nuts.

I apologise but I had to pop out to do a quick radio interview earlier.  I have a comment and one question.</p> <p>  There is considerable frustration, and Professor Drudy will share this more than most because he will remember this better than some of the allegedly younger people in the room.  Every time we have a housing boom, there is an extensive public debate about the rising cost of land, there is public consternation, there are debates in the Oireachtas, and many sensible proposals are put forward.  Then the crisis ebbs and people forget about it.  In 1972, we had the report of the committee on the price of land.  In the 1980s, we had an Oireachtas committee report on the price of land.  In the 1990s, we had an Oireachtas committee on the constitutional provisions on private property rights and it related to land.  Each one of those reports made recommendations not dissimilar to some of what we are discussing today.  People spend a great deal of time talking about them and then they are just ignored, the cycle then dips and goes again.  We must deal with this.  This Oireachtas has to deal with the issue of land.  As Deputy Wallace will be aware, Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the Bill and believes it is one of the elements of it.</p> <p>  We do not talk enough about land and why land speculation is driving up house prices.  Deputy Wallace correctly states that land hoarding is part of it, but the other big part of it at present is that decisions to change the tax code that were made by Deputy Noonan when he was Minister for Finance have created considerable incentives for new flows of capital into the country to invest in land.  Deputy Wallace has done a considerable amount of work on what those flows of money were doing with NAMA and commercial properties, but now that much of the distressed assets from the commercial property crash have been bought and sold, we are seeing that money wash its way into the residential sector.  Deputy Wallace's Bill relates directly to the United Nation's special rapporteur's letter to the Government and its critique of financialisation, because the reason that money can now wash into the residential sector and invest in secure long-term land is because they pay no tax on their capital gains or on their rent roll, if and when they build.  If they are structured in certain ways, they do not even pay dividend withholding tax to their shareholders if they are non-resident overseas investors.  We have billions of euro entering the residential property market that are completely untaxed.  In the best-case scenario, they are hit with a 20% dividend withholding tax, but they still pay no tax on capital gains or on their rent roll.  The idea that one comes in, buys, builds, rents and then sells and the Exchequer gets nothing should be a cause for alarm.  Of course, what else would this money do but invest in land and drive up the prices.  That is why Deputy Wallace is correct.  The levy must be punitive because that is what we are talking about in the first instance.  That is why we are right to support the Bill.</p> <p>  Like all of the other Bills from the Opposition, bar one or two, that we have passed in this committee, the money message will be the killer.  Deputy Wallace stated that his correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle stated that it was the final section of the Bill that was the one that they felt required the money message.  It would be great if the Deputy would share that correspondence with the committee for our own deliberations.  I wonder if there is a mechanism.  If that section was not in the Bill, does Deputy Wallace as its author think the Bill would still have much of the value?  Is there another mechanism for us as a committee were we to decide in private session to communicate to the Ceann Comhairle that to proceed to Committee Stage, we would lose that part of the Bill that requires a money message?  The Ceann Comhairle might say that is not in accordance with procedure.  I am trying to find a way around the money message obstacle but I do not want to propose something in private session that creates a difficulty for the Bill and Deputy Wallace as its author.  I would like the Deputy's view on that.</p></speech>

The reason we came up with this idea was that it would be more attractive to the Government, which does not want to put people who own land in a possible financial difficulty.  It was actually a sweetener.  Removing it from the Bill is not a problem for us because the intention of the Bill is not just to get people to build on land, it is to disincentivise land banking, which is the source of our expensive housing.  The supply of housing in Ireland has traditionally been dysfunctional.  It is not done in an even or fair fashion and we end up with mad up-down cycles.  Most of the time, housing in Ireland is way too expensive.  Removing the provision would not be a problem for us but I would have thought the Government would like it included.  We will share the money message that will be got.</p></speech>

This is not just about the cost of private housing for purchase.  We now have postcodes in Dublin where even at the discount price for Part V, the local authorities cannot purchase units because they breach the &euro;400,000 cap.  We had a crazy situation a year and a half ago in Dalkey, which Deputy Boyd Barrett will remember, when the land component of Part V units was &euro;90,000.  The State was paying &euro;90,000 just for the land component of those apartments.  We also have an issue in the docks.  I do not know what price was offered to the local authority but it was excess of &euro;400,000, which is why Dublin City Council could not make the purchase.  Brendan Kenny has said if this trend continues, whole swathes of the urban city centre will not be able to access Part V, which will mean we will not get the social mix that is meant to be part of Government policy.  I urge members when we come to deciding in private session how we proceed that even if people think the rate of the levy is too high, we can tease out these issues if we can get to formal Committee Stage.  Any move in the right direction would be welcome.  We will do everything we can to support the Bill and get it through.  Not unlike the Solidarity anti-eviction Bill, there is no point in speaking about these issues here if we are stymied by the money message.  If we can find a way around that, it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The truth is we cannot make the private sector build, and rightly so.  It should not be compelled.  People in the private sector will build when they feel like it.  This is why there is a responsibility on the State to provide housing.  We cannot depend on an entity such as the private construction sector to supply us with housing when in actual fact it is unfair of us to even try to compel it to build.  People will build when they like, as they have always done, and that is fair enough.  That is the private sector.  It emphasises that if we want to control the housing crisis and the supply of housing, the State has to be prepared to supply more of it.  If we want private sector housing to be cheaper, we must stop people banking land.</p></speech>

I completely support the Bill and its objectives.  I also agree with him wholeheartedly that speculation and land hoarding is a major, if not the main, contributory factor to the current housing crisis and the excessive cost of housing.  The point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin is also very important.  It is a point that is not highlighted enough, although we have done so periodically.  The tax breaks available are extraordinary.  When we ask the Minister for Finance to cost them and tell us how much is forgone under those tax loopholes on capital gains and rental income allowed for, he cannot even tell us, which is shocking.  Given the increase in property prices since those tax breaks were put in place, it has to be in the tens of billions of euro, certainly in the billions.  People have no incentive to build.</p> <p>  My next question is for all of the witnesses, given that I agree with every word they have said and the purpose of the Bill.  Do most of the people who bought up this land have any interest in building anything at present?  Mr. Reynolds has said, which is very worrying and alarming when we consider the state we are in, that we are now at the top of the cycle.  Perhaps he will elaborate on this point.  If we are at the top of the cycle and output is pathetically low because it is more profitable for people to sit on land or flip it, we will be in deep trouble in the event that output reduces.  I support the 25% punitive rate but if people do not want to build now and this rate is imposed on them, they will not build either.  Is it not most likely that they will just get out of the market?  That would not be a bad thing if they had to sell it back to the local authorities under section 12.  Is it very likely they will state they have made their money and decide to walk and sell back the land?  Even then the local authorities would have to buy it back at 60% or 40% of current value and that would still mean the State picking up a significant Bill and the people involved walking away with large profits.  Will the witnesses tease this out?</p></speech>

Given land prices and values in the private sector, if some people were to build, would they not almost have to build unaffordable units that are useless to the vast majority of people affected by the housing crisis?  Given the economics the witnesses have described, the only viable units the private sector could build, if it decided to do so, would be ones that nobody could afford.</p></speech>

He states if we apply a 25% levy, people will state they have made enough money out of the land and will flip it.  Somebody will hold it and somebody will pay 25%.  On the point that people will take the 60% offer we have included in the Bill and that provided the purchaser and local authority can agree they can do a deal, I can tell Deputy Boyd Barrett that, more often than not, if people have access to the finance, it will still make more sense for them or somebody to develop the land rather than to allow the local authority to take it for 60% of its value.  I guarantee there would be more money in it if they have access to the finance.  Some people do not have access to the finance but others do.  People with access to the money will build rather than see the land go back to the State for 60% of its value.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second point-----</p></speech>

For example, Hines is sitting on units in Cherrywood that are valued at more than &euro;120,000 but it paid only &euro;27,000 for them.  The Deputy has stated people can only build unaffordable homes on those sites because they cost so much.</p><p>They did not cost a mad amount and the majority of land banked was not bought at the high prices.  In 2007 there were 27 entities which, or people who, owned 95% of the banked development land in county Dublin.  The only people who were actually caught in the situation, such as the one described by Deputy where it is so hard to provide affordable housing, were the builders who bought it from them.  I was one of them and I have spoken previously about the site in Dominick Street for which I paid &euro;4.8 million.  The interest on the money cost me &euro;1.2 million, which put me at &euro;6 million, and it cost me &euro;6 million to build.  Half of the costs for such developments were land and interest costs and only half was for construction costs.  I was caught in a situation where I had to get a minimum of &euro;400,000 per unit to get my money back.</p></speech>

All I can do is see what is in front of me.  With regard to the build costs, it is useful to look at the &Oacute; Cualann housing project.  It has sales prices.  It is building apartments and houses on a site in county Dublin.  If it gets a site, for example, at &euro;1,000 per unit - its infrastructure cost is a little bit high at about &euro;4 million - it can build, make a profit and sell a two bedroom apartment for approximately &euro;185,000.  It can build and sell a three bedroom house at &euro;219,000, including VAT.  With regard to the State, the value of the site in Ballymun is &euro;18,000 but Dublin City Council is giving it to the end user for &euro;1,000.  Each three bedroom house, however, is charging &euro;26,000 in VAT that goes to the Exchequer.  The units are pretty much cost neutral.</p> <p>  Depending on what way the land market goes with regard to site values, if this was brought in and had an adverse effect on site values then it is good because instead of a builder buying a site at &euro;200,000 per unit and having to sell the house at &euro;600,000, the builder might be able to buy a site at &euro;50,000 per unit and sell at &euro;450,000 or lower.  Once there is a margin for a builder to do it, he will do it.  He can buy and sell for &euro;400,000, &euro;600,000 or &euro;250,000 once there is a margin there.  It is all about the land value.  Land values in Dublin city currently are about &euro;10 million per hectare based on an average density of 90 units per hectare.  It is about 110 or 120 units.  Dublin City Council values its land at about 80 units per hectare.  If Dublin City Council was to build out at cost and sell to try to claim back its full land value, it would not be in a position to sell at affordable rates.  The land subsidy is critical to any affordable or rental scheme.  One just cannot do it at the current market rates.</p> <p>  With regard to profits, if a person entered the market in 2012 or 2013 he or she would pay no capital gains tax and would have seen a 400% or 500% increase in the land asset.  If that person gets a hit at the back end, or a slap on the bum on the way out, with a 20% levy he or she will not like it but is still way ahead of the posse.  The next person coming in may be looking at buying the site significantly cheaper.  It is swings and roundabouts, but at the end of the day, one really needs to see land values reduced to a point where they make some sort of sense.  The worrying aspect from the private sector perspective currently, and valuers are telling me, that the standard way of valuing which is the red book value of a sales price and a residual land value is no longer relevant in many locations.  This suggests that the market value is way over where it should be. </p></speech>

On the need for cost rental council housing, with which we all agree, what is Professor Drudy's view on the issue of income thresholds for council housing?  Many of us have argued that the thresholds need to be raised.  Should there be any thresholds?  It drives one group into being social housing people and others are above that.</p> <p>  All witnesses have identified the slowness in the public provision of council housing and affordable housing.  Professor Drudy said that while they are amenable and they are doing some stuff, it is very slow and less than is needed.  Do Deputy Wallace and Mr. Reynolds believe, as I do, that there is a connection between their slowness and an anxiety that if they were to build large amounts of council and affordable housing, available for significantly less than market prices, it would impact on the profitability of the private sector, and that they are worried about this?  If the council built affordable housing on the lands at Shanganagh Castle for &euro;200,000 and the private developer down the road was to sell the more or less the same sort of house for &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000, then there is a big problem for the private developer if the council is putting up affordable housing on a large scale.  I believe the council should do that, but is this the reason the council is not doing it on such a scale?</p></speech>

That is the whole point - the State should be in competition in order to bring down the prices and to bring down rents.  If people can purchase a cost rental home, or if they are in a local authority home, if sufficient homes are provided by the State, then the private sector would have to knuckle down and build at reasonable prices.  I have no doubt it would still make profits.  That is the answer really.  The State has to be seriously involved.  It is no use building 4,500.  I do not believe the State even built 4,500 last year because much of that was built by the private sector.  It is simply insufficient.  The State probably needs to build nearly 10,000 homes per annum.  There could be a combination of cost rental and social housing.  That should be integrated anyway and I would call it "community housing".  As the Deputy said, there is a stigma associated with social housing but people are really all in the same boat - the garda, the teacher, the nurse and perhaps even the D&aacute;il Deputy could be on the cost rental home where the rent may be &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,300 per month compared to the current ask of &euro;1,600 to &euro;2,000 per month.  Then one is in competition with private rentals sector also.  With such competition, the State is playing the market game.  While the State should not play the market game really competition is what it is all about.  The State has to be seriously involved.  Then I believe the problem will be solved.  Prices and rents would be reduced.</p></speech>

There is a reason why most of Europe does not have our housing problems.  Most of Europe does not have such a dysfunctional manner of supplying housing and we should look at those countries more closely to see what they are at.</p> <p>  Land prices will drop dramatically if this legislation is passed.  I guarantee they will immediately drop by more than half.  That would be a start.  Nothing is fixed overnight but it would be the start of things being done better.</p><p>No one is building apartments in this town at the moment because the land is too dear to buy.  We were talking about this earlier.  A developer could not pay more than &euro;35,000 or &euro;30,000 per unit building apartments today and still get his money back or make money.  The construction of apartments is more expensive than housing for several reasons, mostly to do with civil engineering.  What is happening in the city at the moment is that student accommodation is three times the price for the land, if not more, compared with the price for a developer who wants to build apartments.  That is why no apartments are being built.</p><p> I want to know why the city council does not take the view that the land is there but that it wants apartments to be built instead of student housing, hostels or hotels.  That would determine the price of it.  On the other hand, if the city council continues with the view that it will sell land to the highest bidder, then we are simply going to get more student accommodation, which is too expensive for the majority of people in Ireland to avail of.  Of course there is the issue of affordability, as Professor Drudy has highlighted.  It is common sense.  If the State is going to help with the provision of affordable housing, then of course it will bring the price down for someone who is trying to build the same housing close by.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.1977" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mel Reynolds" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#O00300"><p>This is relevant to the policy since 2012.  Most of the housing policies that have come in have inflated the value of either newly built housing or land for different reasons.  On the one hand they have a positive effect in terms of negative equity.  The return for NAMA will improve.  Land values will increase to a point where building is feasible.  However, I do not think anyone has carried out a stress test or risk assessment to see what happens when it is successful or to decide at what point we stop.  The position now is that it has overshot.  When a car is going up a hill, the driver needs to accelerate.  That is fine, but at a certain point he needs someone beside him to tell him that he is at the top of the hill or that he is going down the hill and a corner is coming up.  No one has checked the policy the way that a driver would check when driving a car to see whether we are at that point, whether we are okay or whether we are over it.  Now we have a situation whereby land values are high.  The difficulty is that if we overpay for land today, we have to wait for prices to reach a certain point.  Effectively, it amounts to sterilisation.  If prices continue to rise or even stabilise at current rates, effectively we are sterilising large areas of land from development.  This is because there is a major gap between what a developer pays for it and what he can sell it for.  No one is going to build at a loss.</p> <p>  This is a painful measure and I believe it is well judged.  It is an intriguing countercyclical measure in terms of policy for the reasons mentioned.  Certainly, the provision of affordable housing is challenging.  It is a deceptively simple model.  We can say that the market will cool down and refer to the prices.  However, it leaves a hole in the balance sheets of local authorities that needs to be addressed.  That is the first challenge.  It is probably more of a systemic threat, which is what the question raised earlier was about.  Affordable housing by a private developer is probably more dangerous to another private developer than social housing because of the unconscious bias everyone has towards social or council housing.  If a person can purchase a social house built by a private developer in Shanganagh for &euro;250,000, why would he spend &euro;450,000 buying effectively the same thing two doors down?  There are challenges in the model.  If we want to try to stop the car hitting the corner at 120 km/h, we need to put on the brakes.  This is a brake.  If the driver does not have his seat belt on, he will be in trouble.  That is the first thing.  Then the driver needs to turn the corner and start doing stuff with the local authorities.</p></speech>

Before Deputy Cassells asks the question, I confirm that I was a member of the Government that abolished town councils, which was a mistake.  I have been around these Houses for a long time.  People make mistakes all the time; political parties make mistakes.  As I said in my reasoning, there was an antipathy to politics at the time with people blaming politicians for the economic crisis we were facing.  I believe it was a mistake to remove the really important lowest tier of local government, which is town government.</p> <p>  I spent some time in the Custom House as Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  There was always a certain antipathy to town government in the Custom House.  The officials always felt it should be a county structure.  There was probably an agenda item for a willing Minister to push that at any given juncture.</p> <p>  I couch my proposal in the context of what is going on internationally.  We must have regard to the very serious erosion in people's confidence in politics and political systems.  We certainly need to have a direct connection between politics and the electorate - our citizens.  The most immediate and direct connecting point has been town government.  I have been privileged to serve on Wexford Borough Council and Wexford County Council.  I have been mayor of my own town and I know the direct connection between what used to be Wexford Corporation and the people of the town.</p> <p>  Town government also acts as a driver of economic and social activity in its hinterland.  My honest evaluation is that the structure that replaced it, one of municipal districts, just has not worked.  Even taking it as an honest effort, it has not worked.  In my area, a quarter of the county is now a municipal area.  It has diluted the town focus and many people have disconnected themselves from their local representative.  They would not know them in the immediate sense that would always have been the case in the past.</p> <p>  We have talked to people across the country and introduced this legislation.  It does not replicate exactly what was in place before the abolition of town councils.  We have proposed what might be a better model of having a new town council.  We would not have the three categories that used to exist: the borough councils which were corporations; the town councils; and the town commissions.  We propose one category of town council.  It would be available to every municipal area of 1,000 dwellings and 5,000 people with a recognisable municipal heart.  That would be determined by the local government commission.  It would be available to towns which, for historical reasons, never had town councils in the past even though they had population bases that are much greater than some of the areas that had.  It would not restore town councils to some of the very smaller ones that people often pick out when they are arguing against town councils.  It has often been said 70 votes would get someone elected to certain town councils.  I will not mention which of them, but there are a few that do the rounds periodically.</p> <p>  I believe this is a robust suggestion.  The idea would be to restore to town councils all the powers that existed in the old town councils.  It would be a rock of sense and would be a good democratic thing to do.  It certainly would not be particularly expensive because the administration is happening in any event.  The only additionality would be the very modest cost of an additional small number of councillors.  We are suggesting nine councillors for towns with populations below 25,000 and 15 where the population is above 25,000.</p> <p>  I have set out the proposal in great detail.  I would be very happy to provide the committee with other documentation on European norms.  Our level of local democracy is very much out of sync with European norms.  More worryingly, we are very much out of sync in the level of money we spend through local authorities.  Most of the big financial decisions that impact on local communities are determined centrally.  People might think that, as a former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I would like to cling onto that, but that is not the case.</p><p>It is important that we consider the models of the best performing countries, particularly the Nordic countries, where up to one third of resources are expended at local level.  We are at the other end of that extreme and I will be happy to provide the documentation to the committee to show that.</p><p> I hope I will be able to answer any questions from members.  At the committee's request, I have asked others to accompany me to this meeting.  Two of them are practitioners who wish to advocate for their areas.  Ms Marie Moloney is from Killarney, which had the strongest lobby immediately after the abolition.  People felt that Killarney was a place that needed local representation and considered it very important.  Mr. Pio Smith is from Drogheda, which is an ancient borough with an extraordinarily long tradition.  It was a great mistake to abolish that town council.  Dr. Aodh Quinlivan is a lecturer in governance in University College Cork, UCC, and an expert on local government matters.</p></speech>

I will go through my statement quickly.  I submitted some other documentation to the committee and it is available to the members.<br/><br/>My position is quite straightforward.  I was a strong critic of the decision in 2014 to abolish the town councils so I favour the reintroduction of a sub-county tier of local government.  When I worked in Cork County Council and did my postgraduate studies by night I was heavily influenced by the former Limerick county manager, Mr. Dick Haslam, who was my main lecturer and my mentor.  At that time 25 years ago I frequently heard people throw out the phrase: &quot;In Ireland we do not have local government, we have local administration&quot;.  The focus was always on the second word, &quot;administration&quot;, versus government.  When I teach now I prefer to focus on the neglected first word, &quot;government&quot;.<br/><br/>If local government is not local it is nothing.  Local government exists for two primary reasons, as a provider of local public services and as an instrument of local democracy to give expression to community self-government.  This is based on the principle of subsidiarity which states that as many powers and functions as possible should be devolved to the level closest to the citizen.  Ireland has signed up to that principle under the Council of Europe's European Charter of Local Self-Government, the EU's treaty of Amsterdam and under Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  However, as the Council of Europe pointed out in 2013, we are hypocrites.  We use the rhetoric of subsidiarity, power to the people and putting people first, but our public policies go in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>As members know, local government in Ireland is extremely weak.  Staggeringly, it lacks constitutional protection and, accordingly, a tier of directly elected institutions, the town councils, was abolished in 2014 without reference to the people by way of a referendum, unlike for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In terms of the numbers of local authorities and local councillors, we have the most disconnected model in Europe.  This year we celebrate the 120th anniversary of the first local elections, which brought the current system of local government into being.  At that time we had over 600 local authorities and we gradually whittled that down to 114.  Now we have 31, which is soon to be 30 if Galway City Council and Galway County Council merge.  The international local autonomy index places Ireland in 38th place out of 39.  Ireland is not only more centralised than developed democracies such as Austria, Finland and Germany, it is also more centralised than Macedonia and Albania.  Only Moldova ranks below us.<br/><br/>This is relevant to any discussion on town councils.  We have blindly followed an appealing but fundamentally incorrect narrative which is that big is better, cheaper, means improved services and is more efficient.  The problem is that the international research evidence refutes that narrative.  The evidence informs us that a smaller number of larger local authorities does not yield improvements, savings and efficiencies.  To paraphrase Professor Howard Elcock, the amalgamation and abolition of local authorities is an addiction suffered by central governments.<br/><br/>The knock-on effects are serious.  The council elected in May 2019 in Cork city will have a ratio of one councillor for 6,800 citizens.  This is a massive number in comparison with one to 120 in France, one to 210 in Austria and one to 350 in Germany.  It is leading to a political fallout.  Almost one third of the current members of Cork City Council are not standing for election in May, three of the young newly elected councillors in 2014 are bowing out and half of the female elected members are leaving.  Many of these councillors have cited the fact that their jurisdictions are too large and require them to be full-time councillors, yet they are not being rewarded with a full-time salary and find it next to impossible to balance their council roles with their daily working lives and family commitments.  We are moving in the wrong direction but the members here have the opportunity to reverse that trend.<br/><br/>I will turn to a few specific arguments in favour of re-establishing a town council tier.  First, town councils were the most efficient element within the local government system in terms of being self-financing and maintaining commercial rates at a lower level than their county council counterparts.  Killarney has been mentioned.  At the time of its abolition Killarney Town Council had the highest rate take in Kerry with the lowest rate in euro, so there is an efficiency argument to be made.<br/><br/>Second, on democratic grounds and to cite evidence, as opposed to rhetoric or an appealing narrative, the wealth of evidence suggests that there is a negative relationship between the size of a local government unit and the political trust which citizens have in local elected members - in other words, the smaller the unit and the closer it is to us, the more trust we have in it.  We are invested in how the town is run and how money is spent.  &quot;Putting People First&quot; was a lovely slogan to attach to the policy document of October 2012, which proposed to abolish the town councils.  The truth is that we have removed people from the equation.  We are asking them to participate through <i>fixyourstreet.ie</i>in the absence of the town council.  The citizen was barely mentioned in &quot;Putting People First&quot;.  She was kidnapped and replaced by the consumer.  We opted to champion efficiency over democracy and we have achieved neither.<br/><br/>Third, it is important to point out that more women were elected to town councils than to any other level of government in Ireland.  Election to one's town council was in reach for many people because if one was organised and availed of a network of family and friends one could win a seat with a few hundred votes.  Town councils were a useful entry point into politics for young people generally, women, people from different ethnic backgrounds, people with disabilities and so forth.  In removing that political entry point we have narrowed the pool of people who are willing or able to contest elections for city and county councils.  The result is councils that are dominated by middle aged and elderly grey haired men who can afford to be full-time local public representatives.<br/><br/>I have deliberately not spoken to the specifics of the Bill.  I believe that there must be a tier of sub-county government in Ireland, and it is up to the elected representatives to tie down the specifics.  There is no doubt that, as Deputy Howlin indicated, the old town council model was severely flawed.  The councils covered only 15% of the population and the population range went from 298 to 30,000.  We need a new model, but powers and finance must be devolved downwards to give it meaning.<br/><br/>The municipal districts are now in place and have been reasonably successful, but in a very narrow way.  I have spoken to councillors and the effectiveness of the districts varies enormously between and within local authorities.  They have played a role, partly because they are comprehensive and more or less cover the entire country.  However, let us be honest about the fact that they are glorified area committees of the county councils.  Let nobody pretend that they are an elected tier of local government.<br/><br/>At the overall level we must relax the vice-like grip of centralisation which is suffocating local autonomy.  Paulo Coelho wrote that &quot;a mistake repeated more than once is a decision&quot;.  Since 1922 we have been making decisions in favour of centralisation.  Now we must start making decisions in favour of local democracy and local self-government.  Town or municipal councils should be at the heart of our local government system.  The nature of local government is that civic society is up close and personal.  Local councils and the services they provide have a far more immediate, continuous and comprehensive impact on our daily lives than many issues which dominate nationally.<br/><br/>Local councils and councillors must deal with a range of issues and factors that are not of their making and for which they may, in some cases, have no formal responsibility.  These issues include migration, multiculturalism, homelessness, social exclusion and other social problems such as drug addiction and petty crime.  Many of the social problems faced by Irish communities today are most sharply evident in urban settings and towns.</p><p>In 1924 the D&aacute;il debated the abolition of rural district councils in the name of efficiency and cost savings.  What was really meant was centralisation.  During the debate, Deputy John Daly from Cork asked, "what would a man from Bantry Bay know about affairs in Araglen?"  The world is a smaller place today and we have a continuous 24-7 new cycle and social media, but John Daly knew what he was talking about.  He ended his contribution by saying that local representatives know their area best of all and should be given the power to tackle local problems appropriately.  It really is as simple as that.  Local government must be local.</p></speech>

I come from Killarney, a major tourism town that is steeped in history.  Killarney Town Council was an important link with the local chamber of commerce and with local retail and industries and most important of all, with the people of Killarney town and its hinterland.  A major benefit of town councils is to encourage the role of the town as a hub for the local economy.</p> <p>  I must acknowledge that there is now a Killarney municipal district which is a sub-committee of Kerry County Council.  However there is a huge demand on the members of the municipal districts to give a service to their constituents as they have a huge rural area to cover in addition to the urban areas.  Killarney municipal district has a population of around 38,000 people and it covers a much wider area than the town itself, which has a population of slightly fewer than 15,000 people.  The members of the municipal district have to attend to a lot of county-wide policy, activities, and meetings, whereas the town councillors could focus exclusively on the needs of the town as an urban district area.</p> <p>  Killarney is really the tourism capital of Ireland that constantly wins prizes in the tourism industry and from all guides and tourism reviewers.  The brand name, "Killarney", is huge abroad.  Tourism is a major part of the economy in Killarney and there are a number of ways in which a town council and a dedicated town mayor would benefit tourism.  For example, Killarney is noted for its festivals and events in the town, where a town mayor plays an important ceremonial role.  There are also meetings with delegations, including tour operators.  The role of mayor of a town the size of Killarney is certainly demanding and is practically full time.  The chairpersons of the municipal districts have a range of other important duties and many rural events and festivals to attend where they represent the district and Kerry County Council.</p> <p>  Killarney town is twinned with five towns in Europe and has a sister city agreement with four cities in the USA.  These are vital links for Killarney as they promote the town abroad and are responsible for a huge influx of tourists to Killarney and subsequently to County Kerry as a whole.  It is imperative that when officials from our twin towns in Europe and sister cities in the US visit Killarney that they are greeted by a town mayor along with our twinning committee, a mayor who can dedicate his or her time to assisting and accompanying these officials during their visit.  It is also imperative that Killarney reciprocate the visits by travelling to these twinned towns and cities, to promote Killarney and Kerry abroad, but to be able to do this a mayor must have a dedicated allowance as they cannot be expected to finance the visits themselves.</p> <p>  As Killarney is heavily reliant on the tourism sector for employment, with few or no new industrial jobs or manufacturing companies coming to this area, it is imperative that we nurture and enhance our tourism industry.  The more tourists that visit Killarney and Kerry as a whole, the better the knock-on effect for the accommodation sector, the small and medium retail outlets, restaurants and bars along with the entertainment sector, all of which provide employment in the area.  A Killarney tourism economic impact report revealed that tourism in the town generates &euro;410 million annually.  Killarney welcomes 1.1 million visitors annually, which support over 3,000 local jobs.  </p> <p>  As I am a candidate to contest the county council elections, I have been spending a lot of time knocking on doors in the Killarney area and time and time again the people have asked me about reinstating the town council.  Many of them feel a little disconnected from the members of the municipal district, feeling they have too big an area to cover to give dedicated time to the town.  They felt when the town councillors were in place they could solely apply their time to servicing the town and ensuring that things like footpaths, roads and housing estates were up to scratch and this was not their only function, as they assisted people with their personal needs such as housing, planning, and the upkeep of local authority houses among other things.  It was a major mistake to dissolve the town councils and if we recognise that a mistake has been made we must be prepared to admit it and do something to rectify the mistake and that is what Deputy Howlin is doing by introducing this important Bill.  We must reinstate town councils as statutory bodies with full autonomy.  Town councils were an integral part of local democracy which has now been diminished.  How can we in Ireland be such defenders of local governance and differ in this aspect from every town in Europe?  Yesterday, trade unions representing more than 30,000 local council workers launched a campaign for substantially increased revenue and funding powers for local authorities and published research that showed Irish councils have less autonomy than their counterparts in 39 European countries.  Their More Power to You campaign also calls for legislative changes to facilitate directly-elected mayors and restore and expand town councils.  While I have spoken predominantly about Killarney town, what I have outlined can apply to many towns around the country, therefore I trust that Deputy Howlin will get support from all parties and none for this Bill, because town councils have been an important part of Irish democracy for hundreds of years. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2004" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pio Smith" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#R00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for the invitation to come here today and give this presentation.  I am glad to see Deputy O'Dowd here, a colleague from Drogheda.  He works hard for the town.  One interesting aspect of the 2011 general election campaign was the extent to which questions of political reform came to the fore as in no previous general election.</p> <p>All the political parties advocated the view in their manifestos that political reform was central to the economic recovery of the State.  All three of Ireland's main political parties at that time did point to local government as needing significant reform.</p> <p>  The subsequent reform that took place resulted in a reduction of local authority members from 1,627 to 950 and a significant reduction in local authorities from 114 to 31.  The new arrangements and structures were supposed to improve democratic responsibility and accountability, community identity, responsiveness to local issues, subsidiarity, coherence and efficiency.  They were meant to yield cost savings and better value for money and generally strengthen local government.  At the time, the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, argued the "whole tenet of my policy is to make sure there is a rebalancing of power to the democratically elected local councillor and away from the management system".</p> <p>  The result of the local government reform of 2014 is that the county has become the dominant political entity in regard to decision making at local level.  As a consequence, the stated aims of Phil Hogan and the principles contained within the Putting People First document have not been fulfilled.  The outcome could have been different if the reform had not eliminated the powers of the town and borough councils.</p> <p>  I speak today about my home town of Drogheda and how the changes resulting from the 2014 local government reform have impacted on the local citizenry.  Drogheda is the largest town in the country with a population of approximately 42,000 people living within the urban network.  When the rural areas of Tullyallen, Monasterboice, Termonfeckin etc. are taken in to account, the population rises to approximately 56,000.  There are ten councillors, two Labour, two Fine Gael, one Fianna F&aacute;il, two Independent and three Sinn F&eacute;in on Drogheda borough municipal district and they represent very well the views of Drogheda people on Louth County Council.</p> <p>  In terms of accountability and responsibility, the old Drogheda Borough Council was a local authority in its own right, with all the statutory powers that go with it, for example, planning, roads, environmental etc.  Democratic responsibility was evident and meaningful because the decisions that were taken at local level by councillors could be traceable to factors within their control.  In contrast, under the current local government set-up, decisions can be made by Louth County Council that can have a negative impact on Drogheda, and the councillors who vote in favour of these decisions will not be accountable to Drogheda citizens.  For example, it is within the remit of Drogheda borough municipal district to set parking rates for the town and seek to ring-fence a portion of this revenue for spending exclusively within the borough district boundary.</p><p>At that meeting the chief executive of Louth County Council said that if Drogheda councillors agreed to the proposal, she would bring a new parking by-law proposal to the county council meeting to overturn the one set by the municipal district.  What happened is that at one of the municipal district meetings councillors reduced the parking rate to &euro;1 but then at the annual county council budget meeting a parking charge by-law was introduced to bring it back up to &euro;1.20, thereby overturning the decision at municipal district level.  That is evidence of how a decision taken at municipal district level can be overturned at county council level against the wishes of Drogheda councillors, if a majority of county councillors vote to do so.  In other words, the citizens of the town might wish their councillors to increase taxation in order that money could be spent, for example, in the improvement of heritage structures, but that might not happen because councillors in Ardee and Dundalk object to the proposal and outvote Drogheda councillors at the county council meeting.  The example also highlights how responsiveness to local issues can be lost at county council level.</p><p> It could be argued that community identity has been diluted in that the role of mayor of Drogheda is now a secondary function to that of chair of Louth County Council.  The 2014 local government reform document stated the chair of the county council was the first citizen of a county.  This has caused much angst among people in Drogheda and their politicians.  Furthermore, while many people can have a negative view of politicians, the role of mayor was "owned" by the people of the town.  Because of the reforms a perception was created that the political status of the town was being further downgraded.</p><p> Since the reform of local government the number of local authority staff allocated to Drogheda and their role have changed considerably.  The post of town clerk is gone and we have a town engineer who cannot make decisions without referring to a higher authority at county council level.  That can result in bad decision making.  For example, in 2018 there was a significant demand in Drogheda from social housing tenants for maintenance works to be carried out in their homes.  A large portion of the housing stock is more than 30 years old.  Housing staff from the borough council days had built an extensive knowledge base of council tenants and could, therefore, make accurate decisions on the prioritisation of maintenance work requests.  However, in 2018 decisions on such issues in Drogheda were made in Dundalk.  The lack of local knowledge resulted in some minor maintenance work requests being sanctioned, while requests for more serious works to be carried out were left waiting.  This caused considerable annoyance to tenants, some of whom had to wait until after Christmas for works to be carried out, which further strengthened the perception in the minds of citizens in Drogheda that they were being governed from Dundalk.  In essence, the town is being managed remotely.  There is no meaningful council presence in Drogheda.  Furthermore, there is no specific Drogheda town development plan.  The old plan was devised by the then Drogheda Borough Council for the period 2011 to 2017.  It covered conservation, heritage, infrastructure, tourism, the environment, recreation and amenities, housing and communities and much more, all of which were specific and meaningful to the people of the town.  There was no review of whether the aims and objectives of the plan were achieved.  That, in itself, is a staggering indictment of the failure of the 2014 reforms and highlighted the need to reintroduce town councils.  It is further evidence that the reforms led to a dilution of community identity and distrust of the political system.</p><p> A stated aim of the 2014 reforms was to develop and expand the concept of subsidiarity.  The general aim of the principle of subsidiarity is to guarantee a degree of independence for a lower authority relative to a higher body or for a local authority relative to central government.  It, therefore, involves the sharing of power between several levels of authority, a principle which forms the institutional basis of federal states.  I suggest the local government reforms of 2014 went against the principle of subsidiarity in Drogheda.  Power and resources, for example, decisions on roads and planning applications, among other matters, were taken from local governmente and devolved to central government.  Local democratic structures, consumers and communities were politically disenfranchised.  Political representatives at local level, that is, Drogheda, had their power to make decisions diluted and, in some cases, eliminated.  Furthermore, civic groups such as the Drogheda City Status Group and business groups such as Drogheda Chamber of Commerce advocate for a return of the town council to Drogheda.  The reforms failed to bring local government and decision makers closer to the citizen and to enable citizens to participate more effectively in shaping the public policy decisions and service outcomes that impact on their lives.</p><p> On rebalancing powers, the power of the chief executive greatly exceeds that of elected representatives.  For example, Louth County Council is the leading shareholder in Drogheda Port Company.  However, councillors in Louth County Council, across parties, had a preference for Louth County Council to take control of Drogheda Port Company as an administrative unit, rather than as a shareholder.  Councillors voted unanimously in favour of the administrative option.  However, the chief executive decided on the shareholder option and negotiated accordingly, which was within her rights.  The recommendation of 29 councillors had no impact on the final decision taken.  There is no meaningful rebalancing of powers in the chief executive and councillors relationship.</p><p> While the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was well intentioned, it failed in its primary purpose to bring meaningful local government closer to the citizen.  In contrast, focusing on political and local government reforms that can plan and account for urban-led growth of towns and their environs holds greater promise for a positive, closer citizen and local government relationship.</p></speech>

The point was well made by Deputy Howlin in respect of the serious issue of housing being relegated in the discussion.  I welcome all of the delegates to the debate.  I am well used to listening to Councillor Pio Smith on my local radio station, LMFM, with Deputy O'Dowd.  I am familiar with many of the issues about which he spoke such as councillors being outvoted on the issue of parking charges or the status of the relationship with Drogheda Port Company.</p> <p>  Like Deputy Howlin, I am proud to have been mayor of my town.  It is almost 20 years since I was first elected to Navan Town Council in the 1999 local elections.  I believe passionately in the process and the proposals made.  I have also formally made proposals.  In 2017 Fianna F&aacute;il introduced a Bill to seek to have town councils restored.  The progress of the Bill was frustratingly slow after Second Stage and the Bill was eventually killed by the Cabinet last week.  It will be interesting to see the reaction to the proposals we heard this morning.  I believe in the rebalancing of democracy, as outlined by Dr. Quinlivan.  I was troubled by the manner in which the Government had killed the Bill and especially the attempts of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to frame the debate.  He believes giving a citizen two votes, one in electing a town council and one in electing a county council, would in some way be undemocratic.  I do not believe it would be.  Nothing is more undemocratic than what happened in the abolition of the councils in the first place.  It is wrong to frame my proposals and those of Deputy Howlin as undemocratic.  It is flawed and misses the point that, as Councillor Smith outlined, large towns are unique spaces which require special management, budgets and development plans.  As Dr. Quinlivan said, the over-centralisation is inexcusable.  In effect, we are bottom of the table across Europe.  I agree with Deputy Howlin's assertion that we have diluted the focus on towns by virtue of what has happened.  They have been left the poorer as a result of the shift from their statutory basis to the flawed municipal district model.</p> <p>  Ms Moloney referred to the launch by the three unions, namely, F&oacute;rsa, SIPTU and Connect, wh6ich I attended.  A welcome debate has been instigated.  The campaign is entitled, More Power to You, and there is a five point plan, the first of which is democracy and the call for the reinstatement of the town council system.  When Councillor Dermot Lacey was present, we discussed funding powers.  Ms Moloney's contribution was focused on Killarney and the rates base in the town.  I have a very good friend on Killarney Municipal District Council, Councillor Niall Kelleher, who is also vice president of the chamber of commerce.  It is interesting that Dr. Quinlivan mentioned the rates take in Killarney and efficiency.  Councillor Kelleher explained to me the current situation in the town.  The income from rates in the Killarney municipal district is approximately &euro;10.9 million, of which &euro;7.3 million comes from the very small centre of the town.</p><p>Since the abolition of Killarney Town Council the money raised in the town has to be redistributed.  That is infuriating the business community because it is raising the lion's share of the rates base and it is not being reinvested, as had been the case, in the town core.  That is a fundamental issue on which Deputy Howlin and I agree.  What is Deputy Howlin's view of the retention of the rates base and the examination of the boundary which has been a key bugbear for decades for directors of finance and county managers?  We went through a boundary extension in Navan when John Gormley was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and in the proposals, a loop was drawn around Tara Mines, which would have a huge rates base, to make sure it was kept outside the potential town boundary.  Deputy Howlin said this would be a different model, that the town boundaries from an administrative and financial point of view would reflect the true town and boundaries would not be divvied up to ensure the lucrative rates were retained by the county and not the town.</p><p> I presume the Deputy would seek to reinstate the development plan process on a statutory basis within the town council system.  Councillor Smith mentioned the role of the mayor in respect of the Drogheda Port Company.  If the Government will give us any information, there may be a pilot plebiscite for Cork, Limerick and Waterford for the city bases.  Has the Deputy thought about the impact of that on large town council bases such as Drogheda, Navan or Wexford and their role?  That is an important point for the rebalancing of powers.   </p><p> Will Dr. Quinlivan talk about the role of the directly-elected mayor in a town council system? I know from engagements with town twinning processes in Europe that the role and power of the mayor there is quite distinctive.  There is a mini-cabinet as well in the town authorities.  </p><p> My proposals set a threshold slightly higher than the 5,000 Deputy Howlin proposes.  It is an issue of debate in all parties because Deputies will want the threshold set for their towns.  I believe we should go first for the larger towns such as Drogheda, Navan, Wexford and Killarney to give them the sense of autonomy in respect of budgetary and planning powers to achieve substantial things.  Does Deputy Howlin believe that if Drogheda gets it Ardee should get it.  Similarly, if Navan and Wexford get it, then should Kells and New Ross also get it?  The figure of 5,000 is arbitrary but could the Deputy explain the beliefs behind that figure? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2009" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019032800002#T00200"><p>I apologise for being late.  I did not hear Deputy Howlin's comments but I did listen with great interest to the other commentaries.  Somewhat like Deputy Howlin I have been involved in local government for a long time.  I served on the local council for 26 years, including as mayor.  I fully support the comments made by Councillor Smith.  He is absolutely right that an appalling vista has been visited on the town of Drogheda because it is not in control of its own destiny.  It does not have local accountability.  It does not have a town manager and has absolutely no relevance when the debate moves from the municipal to the county level.  I fully support the implicit changes.</p><p>I have argued for, and fully support, the city status of a town such as Drogheda to give it control of its destiny.  It is time for the county manager, the Minister and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to appoint a manager to the town with the status at least of deputy city manager, to plan and negotiate with Louth County Council and Meath County Council the proper, fair and appropriate development of the town and the adjoining portions of County Meath without infringing on the Meath jersey, as Deputy Cassells knows.  For that to happen would need somebody with a lot of skill.  That is what we need to manage the growth of Drogheda, which is a city.  It will reach the population benchmark of 50,000 citizens, which the Central Statistics Office uses to define an urban conurbation by 2023 or 2024.  That is what the CSO tells me.  To prepare for that change we need it to be led professionally by a full-time executive who has the power to make all those decisions, together with the local council.  That is what I am pushing for.  I have met the Taoiseach and the Chamber of Commerce and we are all <i>ad idem</i>on this.  It must happen.</p><p>One of the issues in County Louth is a dysfunction between the members of the local authority and the administration.  Without wishing to personalise this, it is unacceptable that meetings of the municipal council or functions in the town of Drogheda are not attended at the very highest level by the chief executive of the council.  There is an obligation on them to attend those meetings.  That has not happened for some years.  When I was on the council, and I am sure when Deputy Howlin was on the council in Wexford, the manager had a mandatory attendance at least twice a month with his full management team in the town, in public, to be accountable, to answer questions, not just about fixing the streets but to plan the future development.  That is missing and I fully support Deputy Howlin in that.  The door is wide open for change.</p><p>Urban regeneration in Drogheda has not been met by funding from the Department as yet.  It is under appeal and due process has to take place but to be denied the urban development that it needs and the money to plan and restore the town centre is also unacceptable.  As regards Drogheda Port, I am not on the county council, I do not know what happened but I presume if it is accountable to the county council it has to produce an annual report and it can be required to attend at the council meeting to discuss that report and any other issues that arise from it.  If there are issues of concern that is the way to manage them.</p><p>The big question, which Dr. Quinlivan mentioned, is the lack of interest in local government.  I do not know how many people in Drogheda could name even five or six of the local councillors.  I am not sure I could name them all.  I know the ones I talk to regularly.  Years ago, there was fire and brimstone at every council meeting and I could not walk down town without having an argument with somebody or other.  The vibrancy, the liveliness and the dynamic has gone from local government.  There is absolutely no doubt about that.  Its restoration may not happen right now.  I have a feeling that the coming local government elections will have a low poll.  I do not want that.  Accountability has moved to Facebook and other media from the local press.  The presence of local government on social media needs to be improved.  I would like to fix my street, provided it is fixed, but it often is not.</p><p>Many changes are taking place and the witnesses' positions are in the vanguard of that change.</p><p> My last point is one I make as somebody who has grey hair.  I cannot change my age, but I can change my grey hair.  However, I choose to leave my hair as it is and I am very proud of it.  Many more people would have grey hair if they did not use the bottles.  Incidentally, I am talking about men.  With age comes wisdom, knowledge, experience and, thankfully, a good sense of humour.  I appreciate the witnesses' points.</p></speech>

Anybody who has had experience of local government at that level appreciates its value.  We should strive to restore it.  If, as Deputy Cassells says, there is pushback in this D&aacute;il for whatever number of months and if we advance this Bill, whoever forms a future Government would put this back on the agenda and it is important for that reason.</p> <p>  There were a number of specific questions.  The structure of the Bill is simple.  It repeals the abolition and restores the powers that used to exist in the old town councils.  The council would be a rating authority, a planning authority and so forth.  It is not necessary to specify that because it simply does away with the abolition.  That is what the Bill does.</p> <p>  In terms of who sets the boundaries, I am conscious of how fraught such an issue can be, and not only in Drogheda between Louth and Meath.  There have been significant court cases between members of the same party in respect of Waterford and Kilkenny, for example.  Perhaps it is to do with the hurling tradition, but there are fierce protectors of Rosbercon, which is genuinely part of New Ross but is on the other side of the River Barrow.  The closer one gets to a county boundary, the more definitive the protection will be.  I was going to tell a joke about the boundary of Wexford and Kilkenny, but I had better not.  They are real issues and I suggest that we give that role to the local government commission.  We all have seen situations where odd decisions were made for particular reasons that were pushed by an executive.  Deputy Cassells talked about Tara Mines.  I recall that when Wexford borough was extended, the main industrial base on the south side of it was excluded, in an irrational way, because it was said that it would impoverish the county council to lose the industrial estate.  We need to remove that and make rational developmental decisions for the natural hinterland of a town to grow.</p> <p>  Regarding whether 5,000 should be the threshold, that is entirely a matter of debate and I am open to suggestions.  The Deputy referred to New Ross.  New Ross is one of the oldest existing urban towns in Ireland.  It was established by the Normans when they arrived and first settled in this country 800 years ago.  The Ros Tapestry depicts the establishment of the municipal boundary.</p></speech>

Some towns historically have had town councils.  Kells in Meath would be the same, but Ashbourne, which is one of the fastest growing towns, is now the second biggest town in Meath but had no town council previously.  That is the reason I was asking for the Deputy's rationale.</p></speech>

It would capture most of the historical ones.  I intended to avoid mentioning others but I do not believe one could justify it for places such as Lismore, which traditionally had a town council.  There must be a critical mass.  Whether 5,000 is a high enough threshold is a matter of debate.  My position on it is not fixed in stone but it is what I advocate in the Bill.</p></speech>

It is a two-page list of towns starting with Arklow and ending with Youghal that would meet the threshold.  One would not exclude any town in it.  That is the reasoning behind it.</p> <p>  On the other questions, the directly elected mayor is not encompassed in my proposal.  I do not have a fixed view on it and I would be interested to hear other people's views.  If a town such as Wexford, Drogheda or Navan has a directly elected mayor, how does that impact on the other councillors in the area?  If there is a five-year term and there is a powerful single individual, it diminishes the others.  I do not have a fixed view on whether that is necessarily a good or bad thing.  That is why it is not part of this, although I tabled a parliamentary question this week to the Minister to ask if that is intended.  These plebiscites will take place in the major cities and I have received a great deal of correspondence asking if they will be rolled out to the larger towns.  I do not know whether that is a good or a bad thing.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dowd is always a great advocate for Drogheda, and rightly so, and I do not disagree with anything he said.  A big issue that we must get our heads around is the power between the executive and the elected members.  That is very difficult when there is such a disparity of capacity in terms of people who are part-time, not full-time-----</p></speech>

I examined this many years ago and I produced a document entitled Better Local Government.  My suggestion at that stage, which I believe is the genesis of a good idea but it has never been implemented in the way I envisaged, was that the strategic policy committee, SPC, be chaired by an elected councillor.  For example, in housing, the SPC would be chaired by a councillor who would be the effective minister for housing for the locality.  It would not be the housing officer making the presentation at the monthly meeting but the chair of the SPC.  The housing officer would be-----</p></speech>

The corporate policy group would be, in effect, the Cabinet.  That was my idea but it did not work out.  It has not been driven.  Part of it is due to resources because one cannot expect part-time people to be on top of a matter in the way that full-time administrators are.  There is a job of work to be done and Deputy O'Dowd is correct in that regard.</p> <p>  My final point is in my full contribution but I did not mention it in my opening statement.  There is an argument for participation in democracy at town council level.  There are people who have been traditionally members of town councils who would never stand for election for even the county council.  They are just part of their town and community.  For the reason that Dr. Quinlivan suggested, there were far more women, ethnically different people and people with disabilities involved.  It is very good to get those people involved.  One of the reasons for that is that when I was a member of Wexford Borough Council, virtually all the meetings were in the evenings.  People could do their job and attend the meetings.  They were always at 7.30 p.m.  People cannot hold down a full-time job and go to monthly or fortnightly meetings during the day.</p></speech>

It comes back to the overall idea behind local government that I mentioned with regard to delivering services and the more democratic benefit.  The model that is always trotted out is France with its 36,000 communes.  When I was an undergraduate 35 years ago, people were talking about France having 36,000 communes, and it still has them.  In most countries the pressure has been to merge and abolish local authorities.  If one tried to abolish the local town council in France, there would be war.  The French are very happy to work together to deliver services but they need their own council and mayor.</p><p>I was in a place two summers ago with 27 inhabitants that had a mayor, a town hall and a guide with a sash.

It was based on the idea of democracy, that one devolves to the bottom.  It involves a bottom-up approach whereby as many powers and functions as possible are left at the lowest level, what cannot be done at this level is passed up to a higher tier, and what that tier cannot do is passed up to the state.  National government should do a few things well, not a lot of things badly.  It has too much going on.</p> <p>  We possibly look at things in a piecemeal fashion.  We need to look at local government reform as a total piece in terms of devolving powers and functions.  We are looking at town councils here.  Plebiscites to introduce directly elected mayors will take place.  We have seen no proposals for local government reform generally.  As has been acknowledged, perhaps housing has dominated the Department's agenda.  Regarding town councils, a very simple point is that the towns with town councils were better in my opinion when it came to libraries, swimming pools and the sense of civic community.  Mr. Smith spoke about the support of the chambers of commerce because, unfortunately, that certainly was not the case in 2014.  They generally bought into the idea of efficiency and abolishing town councils, so it is good that they might be turning around and appreciating things.</p></speech>

I accept completely the point about age and wisdom.  The point also concerns town councils being an avenue for younger people and different generations to come through.  Ideally, perhaps the town council should be as apolitical as possible.  We could have a long argument about the balance of powers between chief executives and councillors.  We probably need a rebalancing.  It is probably also fair to say that some elected members abdicate their powers.  While many of them would say that they should have more powers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the chief executive, some of them would run a mile if they got those powers, but that is a slightly separate issue.</p></speech>

This relates to directly elected mayors.  I appreciate the question arises as to whether it should be a town over a certain size.  It is not just the major cities that would take that responsibility and insist on that change.  That is at the heart of what is happening in Drogheda.  We do not have somebody who is accountable because he or she does not live in the town or come to it in terms of the meetings, yet he or she makes all the decisions whereas a directly elected mayor is on the spot and would be fired if he or she did not do his or her job.</p></speech>

Such situations arise where a working relationship is misclassified as a contract for services or commercial agreement when it should, according to common law, be considered a contract of service or a contract of employment.  False self-employment can arise in a variety of contexts.  It can arise where a commercial agreement between parties develops over time and what started as a genuine case of self-employment has morphed into an employment relationship.  It sometimes arises where a de facto employer wishes to avoid the rigours of the employment rights legislation.  It can also arise where a highly qualified individual whose skills are much sought after in a buoyant jobs market insists on being treated as self-employed for his or her own purposes, often for the personal freedom it allows the individual and for favourable tax treatment.  It is important to make one thing clear: it is not always an act perpetrated by business against individual workers, which is the common subtext to discussions on the subject.  IBEC is manifestly opposed to the practice of false self-employment.</p><p>It provides a competitive advantage to those who would flout the law at the expense of the majority of compliant individuals and businesses who observe existing laws.  Individuals who are falsely described as self-employed may be at greater risk of exploitation and left vulnerable when the working relationship is ended.  However, based on evidence referred to as follows, the practice of false self-employment is not as widespread a problem as has been suggested before this committee, and where it does arise, there is an existing legal framework to address it, provided it is invoked.</p><p> IBEC is concerned that a narrative is developing in relation to self-employment, even genuine cases of self-employment, to suggest that it is somehow an inferior form of work.  This is a persistent narrative which has the potential to become very damaging to the Irish economy.  It is vital both for the business community and for individuals that Ireland has a legislative framework that facilitates and encourages entrepreneurship.  The reality is, despite assertions from some interest groups to the contrary, that not everyone wants to be an employee.  There is a risk of creating of a framework which removes for all practical purposes genuine self-employment as an option for individuals.  Oversimplified legislation with draconian penalties, such as have been proposed in the recent past, will cause clients and customers to flee from self-employed service providers for fear that they will find themselves captured by the proposed new laws.  It will damage small indigenous businesses most and drive consumers of goods and services towards large well-established companies in respect of which no consumer could be accused of being the employer.</p><p> Despite assertions to the contrary, the prevalence of false self-employment cannot be as widespread a problem in Ireland as some assert.  This is because the number of self-employed in Ireland amounted to 14% of the total working population in 2018.  This represents a decrease in those described as self-employed from the 15.3% measure published the previous year.  Within that figure, many of those working people will be genuinely self-employed in professional activities, such as barristers, chartered accountants and GPs, as well as those involved in trades.</p><p> It is vital that we reflect on the fact that the scale of the issue cannot be as large as is suggested.  It is also vital that we acknowledge that many of those who form that 14% are willingly self-employed, some of whom took time and trouble to establish businesses on their own account.  Some self-employed people will have left positions within companies, where they were retained as employees on contracts of employment, deliberately to avail of the flexibility and autonomy, as well as the opportunity to grow their earnings, that self-employment provides.</p><p> It is also important to assess properly the figures referred to above, as within that group, a significant proportion are self-employed but also employers in their own right, which means they are even less likely to be falsely self-employed.  In fact, the number of individual self-employed persons, described in the 2018 report as "own account" workers, is smaller, at 10.8% of the total workforce in 2017.  This has now dropped further to 9.8% in late 2018.  Among this number will be included those referred to above as deliberately and willingly self-employed.</p><p> IBEC notes the call for increased regulation of the employment relationship &ndash; a desire to adopt a simple statutory definition of what constitutes a contract of employment or a brief definition of "employee".  IBEC acknowledges that it is important that there is a legal framework in place to allow us to identify false self-employment correctly where it arises and to operate as a deterrent.  The current legal framework comprises several common law tests, which are outlined in my presentation and which I will not go through in detail.  These are probably familiar to many in the room.</p><p> All employment rights legislation in Ireland provides an opportunity for an incorrectly designated person to challenge his or her status and have it corrected as a preliminary issue in proceedings.  We have seen many cases of this happening in the employment rights bodies.  For example, an individual can issue proceedings under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and assert his or her rights as an employee under that legislation.  The issue of the person's employment status is likely to be addressed at the outset of the proceedings, but both Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, adjudicators and the Labour Court have jurisdiction to apply the legal tests to which I referred and issue a binding enforceable decision that the individual is an employee, if the evidence supports that conclusion.</p><p> It has been suggested that existing remedies are insufficient, as there exists the fear of possible retribution from the employer in certain instances.  Powerful anti-penalisation provisions are contained within the employment rights legislation, including the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which provide remedies where such instances arise.  It is also possible to invoke the Unfair Dismissals Acts and the remedies available to the complainant include re-instatement in his or her role.</p><p> IBEC submits that there is no higher protection or remedy that can be conferred over and above the remedies already on the Statute Book.  Therefore, calls for additional regulation of the contract of employment are misplaced.  This committee will have heard the submissions made by Professor Michael Doherty of NUI Maynooth last month where he stated that the default status of an individual before the WRC is almost always that of employee.  Contrary to the view often promoted as to how employment rights legislation is enforced, that default position has also been the experience of IBEC.</p><p> It is also open to those who believe they are falsely self-employed to make an application to the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and have the insurability of their employment determined by a deciding officer.  At no time has any stakeholder advanced an argument that there was a specific element missing from the common law tests which prevented decision-makers from reaching a decision on the status of an individual or caused them to reach an incorrect conclusion.</p><p> IBEC understands that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection intends to establish a stand-alone body with enhanced resources to investigate false self-employment more efficiently.  Initiatives such as these are likely to be of assistance in reducing instances of false self-employment where they arise.  As previous submissions to the committee have noted, the consistency of approach will be critical to ensuring the success of this measure.</p><p> The complexity sometimes associated with identifying a contract of employment appears to be a source of frustration to some who are eager to adopt short and unambiguous definitions of what constitutes an employee.  The difficulty with adopting such an approach is that it risks capturing a range of activities which neither party to the contract ever envisaged to be an employment relationship.  Throughout these debates before the committee, no one has suggested a specific proposed change to the current legal framework that would not have a significant distorting impact on the Irish economy.  Such changes may result in people who carry out work piecemeal for private individuals, such as window cleaners and sole practitioner professionals, being considered the employees of their customers.  This may arise even in circumstances where the customers themselves are full-time employees of other organisations.  We need to consider very carefully the implications of changing the basic components of an employment relationship.</p><p> As part of its role in the collection of taxes and duties, the Office of the Revenue Commissioner is motivated to identify false self-employment.  In the joint report referred to earlier, however, the Department of Finance noted that there is no evidence that there has been any significant change in the level of self-employment in the economy in recent years.  From the report, it is clear that even during the recession the share of employment that was accounted for by self-employment was relatively stable.  The Department noted that the overall share of own account self-employment was at the time of the report at a relatively low level and, in fact, lower than it was in 1999.  This is contrary to the narrative that self-employment is rapidly increasing.  Own account self-employment fell from 12.6% to 10.5% between 1999 and 2007, increased again to 12.4% during the recession before falling back again to 10.8% at the start of 2017, and is now at 9.8%.</p><p> The report does not offer specific reasons for this slight increase in self-employment during the recession.  It is likely, however, that some individuals who lost contracts of employment through redundancy were in a position to take on work on the basis of a commercial agreement.  In an economy where very few employers were hiring, those who had skills that lent themselves to doing work on a self-employment basis did so, perhaps, rather than emigrate or endure the wasting of their skills and experience following the termination of their employment.  It likely meant also that when the economy recovered, the individuals in question were in a better position to access new contracts of employment as they could demonstrate recent work experience in their chosen field.  IBEC respectfully submits that it is positive that Ireland's employment law facilitates individuals adapting to changing economic circumstances in this way.</p><p> It has been suggested that the reform of the taxation system might reduce the incentive for individuals to be classified as self-employed.  IBEC believes that there is an absence of specific evidence as to why and where instances of false self-employment arise.  There are no hard data to support the contention that the motivation to become self-employed is mainly tax avoidance.  While, no doubt, within cohorts of contracts that are misclassified there are those who wish to benefit from the favourable tax treatment, IBEC believes that this is just one of a range of possible incentives.  In other cases, incentives such as the freedom to set one's own working hours or a desire on the part of some businesses to avoid the legal responsibilities otherwise associated with being an employer are also possible incentives.  Before IBEC could endorse tax reform that might operate as a disincentive to utilise the services of someone self-employed in favour of a larger corporation, we would need to be sure that the move was evidence based and would, in fact, operate to reduce the number of misclassified contracts.</p><p> An extensive media awareness campaign was organised by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in 2018.  The assistant secretary of that Department shared the outcome with this committee and noted that if individuals are reluctant to come forward for any reason, inspection is an alternative method of identifying and correcting misclassification of employment.  IBEC agrees with this approach and is happy to support the co-operation of the business community in facilitating such inspections.  IBEC notes that negative inferences were drawn by some Deputies who participated in the November 2018 meeting of this committee, suggesting that a website that attracted thousands of contacts should have resulted in more outcomes from the scope section.</p><p>The low rate of progression from accessing the website to forming a complaint should not automatically be ascribed to a negative culture associated with the making of such complaints, of which there is no hard evidence.  It may well be that those who sought clarification as to the structure of a true contract of employment confirmed for themselves that they were, in fact, correctly classified as self-employed.</p><p> IBEC notes some of the other proposed policy changes to address the issue of misclassification of status.  These include introducing a third category of worker which would attract some, but not all, of the statutory entitlements and protections available to employees.  IBEC notes the view of Professor Michael Doherty that the introduction of this new status risks introducing more complexity and litigation, which IBEC believes would not be of advantage to any of the stakeholders in this issue.  IBEC also notes suggestions to introduce chain liability, where the legal responsibility for incorrect application of employment law may be visited on a client or customer in certain circumstances.  IBEC's concern is that such measures would allow non-compliant individuals and businesses to escape legal responsibility, which is visited instead on compliant organisations.  IBEC is also aware of concerns that such measures risk making it more difficult for a complainant to identify who, in fact, is responsible for the vindication of their employment rights.  We cannot support such a proposal. </p><p> At this point in time, the response to the issue of false self-employment has to be stronger enforcement of existing laws and remedies.  IBEC does not believe that a case has been made to change the law in a way that would reduce the number of falsely self-employed individuals.  Even if fear of retribution is dissuading people from invoking existing laws, more severe sanctions than those that already exist will not necessarily fix that issue, to the extent that it exists.  However, inspection and enforcement will.</p><p> IBEC notes the concerns expressed about practices of false self-employment arising and that it is localised in specific sectors.  We are of the view that the existing legal framework is appropriate and robust enough to address any such instances.  Rather than propose a full-scale shift in the determining factors of the contract of employment, IBEC suggests that a better approach would be to: continue with a balanced and impartial awareness campaign on what constitutes a contract of employment; ensure existing inspection mechanisms and facilities are adequately resourced; and support the genuinely self-employed by reducing and removing the disadvantages of self-employment through access to maternity benefit and other benefits, some of which is already in train or in place.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s economic success is in part based on how we regulate our labour market.  We need flexibility in our working practices - flexibility to engage whether directly or collectively - and we must be able to attract the talent needed to sustain strong economic growth.  None of this should come at the expense of employment rights, but before we regulate an already heavily regulated labour market further we must at least come from a position of being able to identify the nature and scale of the challenge we are trying to fix.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend and to contribute to the discussion on bogus self-employment.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Conor O'Connell, who is the regional director of CIF.</p> <p>  The construction industry comprises a number of subsectors - general contracting, civil engineering, mechanical and electrical contracting, house building and specialist subcontracting.  Contractors operate in the public and private sectors in the industrial, commercial and residential and domestic markets.  The industry is based on a system of tendering and contracting.  In general, a main contractor tenders for and is awarded a contract and the various elements of the contract are subcontracted to specialists to complete.  In the domestic market, contractors or specialist subcontractors are frequently engaged directly by the consumer.  The industry currently employs approximately 144,000 workers, including professionals such as architects, engineers, quantity surveyors, project managers and site supervisors, and site workers such as foremen, craft persons, general operatives and apprentices.  Workers in the industry are mobile by nature and must travel from site to site in accordance with the needs of the industry.</p> <p>  CIF is the representative body for contractors and employers in the construction industry.  Our members employ substantial numbers of construction workers and we have a strong focus on training apprentices and general operatives to ensure that employees have the necessary skills and expertise to deliver a quality product.  Workers in the industry are covered by the sectoral employment order, SEO, for the construction sector of 2017.  This SEO, which CIF applied for, sets legally binding hourly rates, pensions and sick pay for workers in the industry.  CIF negotiates terms and conditions for construction workers with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, under the construction industry national joint industrial council, a body which is chaired by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.</p> <p>  The majority of firms in the industry are small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, employing fewer than ten people.  These firms are engaged in general contracting or specialise in a discipline such as groundworks, bricklaying, formwork, plastering, electrical or mechanical work, or painting and decorating.  These workers move around from site to site as work dictates.  Varying numbers and categories of workers will be engaged on any site depending on the size of the contract, the nature of the work and so forth.</p> <p>  CIF is supportive of and promotes the current guidelines on the classification of workers, a document which was drawn up by a Government appointed expert group in 2001 and updated in 2007.  CIF is also supportive of the inspectorate regime implemented by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure the proper classification of workers.  We are also supportive of the work of the WRC with regard to the promotion of and compliance with all relevant employment protective legislation.  Indeed, we recently requested a meeting with the compliance and enforcement division in the WRC to discuss measures to ensure compliance with the SEO.  CIF was also an active participant in the hidden economy monitoring group, which was chaired by the Revenue Commissioners. </p> <p>  The CSO provides data on the total number of workers employed in the construction industry, the number of self-employed with employees and the number of self-employed with no employees.  The latest data confirm that the total number employed in the industry stands at 144,000, of whom the self-employed with employees number 14,600 and the self-employed with no employees number 31,900.</p> <p>  Subcontracting is a feature of the construction industry.  The industry is heavily dependent on subcontractors who specialise in a specific discipline.  The self-employed may require employees depending on the size of the contract, the segment of the market he or she is operating in or the workload at any given time.  Unions in the construction sector have been vocal about their concerns regarding the perceived level of false self-employment in the construction industry.  Recent reports on the misclassification of workers do not bear out the unions' concerns.  In August 2018 the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, published research on "Measuring Contingent Employment in Ireland".  The ESRI looked at the prevalence of self-employed with no employees in several sectors and concluded it remains a relatively minor component of the Irish labour market, accounting for a little over 2% of total employment in 2016.</p> <p>  In January 2018, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, published a report on the implications for social insurance and tax receipts of intermediary employment structures and self-employment arrangements.  The report noted that available data do not indicate that self-employment accounts for any significant increase of the labour force.  It also noted how the available data indicate that the proportion of self-employed people in the workforce generally is decreasing.  In response to submissions received, a construction subgroup was set up to examine issues relating specifically to the construction industry.  The report concludes that the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are actively pursuing non-compliance and are successfully encouraging and enforcing compliance in the cases selected where non-compliance is an issue.</p> <p>  In May 2018 the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection launched a media advertising campaign to highlight the issue of bogus self-employment.  Individuals who believed they were in a false self-employment situation were invited to make an application to the Department for an assessment of their employment status.  It is our understanding that, despite the concerns expressed publicly by the trade unions about the perceived prevalence of false self-employment, the level of direct contact with the Department's scope section from individuals as result of the campaign was low.</p> <p>  Self-employment, on condition that it applies in accordance with all relevant guidelines, provides flexibility to all parties concerned.  It provides an opportunity for an individual to set up in business and to grow and create employment.  It has been one of the key factors supporting employment recovery and growth in the economy.  Current data indicate that the current level of self-employment in the construction industry is at similar levels to that which pertained in 2006 and 2007, before the recession.  There is no evidence to suggest that there is a high level of false self-employment in the construction industry.</p><p>Any new measures in this area, based purely on anecdotal evidence and without concrete data to support their introduction, would introduce undue rigidity into the sector, thereby stifling the industry&rsquo;s ability to grow and to create employment.</p><p> The CIF is supportive of compliance with all statutory provisions, including employment protective legislation.  We support the work undertaken in this area, both jointly and separately, by the various State bodies with powers to enforce compliance.  No data are available to support claims by some unions in the construction industry of high levels of bogus self-employment in the sector.  Any new measures which would unnecessarily introduce rigidity into the industry would be a retrograde step and hinder the industry&rsquo;s ability to grow and create employment.</p></speech>

I will come to Deputy O'Dea shortly.  I want to make a general comment, and the Department made the same comment when its representatives were here, about the number of people who are self-employed declining as a percentage.  Ms Winters is right that the percentage is declining, but there is no decline in the actual number of people because the total workforce is increasing significantly.  Using percentages can sometimes skew the picture a little.</p><p>The committee is interested in the construction industry in particular.  Ms Winters stated:</p><blockquote>In August 2018 the ... ESRI published research on &ldquo;Measuring Contingent Employment in Ireland&rdquo;.  The ESRI looked at the prevalence of self-employed with no employees in several sectors and concluded it remains a relatively minor component of the Irish labour market, accounting for a little over 2% of total employment in 2016.</blockquote> <p>The figure Ms Winters gave for the construction industry was 31,900, or more than 20% of the total, who are classed as self-employed with no employees.  That contrast between the 2% in the ESRI report and the 20% in the construction industry is one of the reasons the committee has concerns.  Ms Winters can come back to this in due course.  It is not that we are making unfounded allegations or anything like that.  It is the fact Ms Winters has clearly demonstrated that 2% is the across the board percentage but her own figures have more than 20% as self-employed.  This is why there is a spotlight on the construction industry in particular.  Ms Winters will have an opportunity to address that in more detail.  I call Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2044" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019032800002#F00300"><p>I apologise as I have to leave to attend another appointment shortly.  I thank both organisations for coming in and for their presentations.  I want to make some general points.  Ms Murphy referred to the narrative that supposedly supports the approach the committee is taking and the various legislation being put forward.  There is a narrative, yes, but there is also a counter-narrative, which is that anybody who wants to do anything about bogus self-employment is in some way motivated to do down genuine self-employed people and to interfere with arrangements that already exist for highly specialised people in the IT area who want to offer their services on the basis that they are self-employed.  That is not my intention and, insofar as I can speak for my colleagues, I do not think it is their intention either.  We are public representatives and we represent the public.  We have to respond as public representatives to issues that are coming to us on the ground.  There is a lot of talk about hard evidence and soft evidence, and we can argue about figures.  However, I am dealing with the blunt reality in my constituency.  Even as we speak, I have complaints on hand from within the construction industry about people being forced to act as self-employed when they are patently not self-employed.  I want to make that point.</p> <p>  The IBEC submission states: "Ibec acknowledges that it is important that there is a legal framework in place to firstly, allow us to correctly identify false self-employment where it arises and secondly to provide a remedy or a sanction to deter people from engaging in this practice."  It goes on to state that "there is already such a framework in place".  Where we differ is that I do not agree that the current framework is working.  My colleagues from People Before Profit have separate legislation on this and, therefore, they do not agree either.  My colleagues from the Labour Party have similar legislation, so they do not agree either.  Of course, we are only members of the Opposition.  More importantly, the Minister does not agree either because she is now proposing legislation.  If she, as Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, felt that everything was hunky-dory and that all we need do is enforce the existing regulations, she would not be busily instructing her civil servants to prepare separate legislation.  As matters stand, there are three pieces of legislation floating around from Fianna F&aacute;il, People Before Profit and the Labour Party, which put forward legislation that should have been voted through the Seanad last night if all of our Fianna F&aacute;il Senators had turned up, but unfortunately they did not and the legislation was narrowly defeated as a result, which is something we have to deal with ourselves.  As I said, the Minister is also preparing legislation.  We will all put on our collective thinking caps and put our heads together to ensure that whatever legislation ultimately emerges will not be, as Ms Murphy described it, blunt, oversimplified or draconian.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2045" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1398" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019032800002#F00400"><p>I have several questions arising from the contribution from Deputy O'Dea.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to remain for the duration of the meeting and I apologise to our guests.  Both the CIF and IBEC representatives expressed their satisfaction with how the current regime operates.  I could not possibly agree with that and I think they know why.  I am long on the public record as expressing my concerns about the operation of the code of practice that was introduced in 2007 and the various other means by which individuals have their employment status defined and determined.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea accepts our legislation should have passed in the Seanad last night but did not for want of support from Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, but that is another day's work. I want to put on record that we on this side of the House are all united in our efforts to have something done about this egregious situation.  We can argue all day about percentages and so on, but it is a very real issue in our society and our economy.  The Minister acknowledges this in that she went so far as to put on the record of the Seanad last night that she intends to introduce legislation to deal with this phenomenon.  One of the things she wishes to do is to put the 2007 code of practice on a statutory footing, so in essence she wants to put that into primary law.  That was also one of the ambitions of the legislation that I brought forward to ensure the inclusion in primary law of the tests for false self-employment, with which the witnesses and the Government are familiar because those tests were first introduced into Irish primary legislation in the context of what was then the Competition (Amendment) Bill in 2016 and into 2017, which has since been enacted.  Those provisions are placed in competition law for the purposes of providing exemption from competition law for certain categories of workers who should have the opportunity to be represented by a trade union for the purpose of collective bargaining.  Our ambition was to take those provisions, insert them into primary law and apply those definitions in terms of tests for false self-employment to the broader population of workers.</p> <p>  The Minister is conscious that there is a problem to the point where she is preparing to legislate, and I would appreciate the views of IBEC and CIF on that approach.  They seem to be satisfied there are sufficient regulations and a sufficiently robust legal framework in place to enable somebody to have their employment status determined with clarity.  We do not believe this is the case.  They also refer to the fact there are protections in place for an individual who is taking a case to the scope section of the Department or indeed to the WRC on separate matters, but the reality is that, for those individuals, even though some would say there is a presumption they are employees, that is not always the case.  Human nature being what it is and given the precarious nature of the situation many of these workers find themselves in, they are inclined not to take cases because they fear that once they put their head above the parapet, it is going to be chopped off and they will be effectively blacklisted in the industry in which they work.</p><p>I know that a form of blacklisting is going on in the construction sector.  That is as clear as the nose on our collective faces.  I have recently learned that there is a form of unofficial blacklisting going on in parts of the pharmaceutical sector and in the information technology sector, sectors in which people are engaged in these kinds of practices.  This needs to be fixed.  There is a difference of opinion as to the extent and nature of the problem and how it should be dealt with.  There would not be three separate Bills before the Oireachtas, and another one coming from the Government, if the political system did not believe this was a problem.  </p><p> In the legislation I produced I was at pains to protect genuine self-employment and entrepreneurship, but looking at the numbers of self-employed individuals with no employees, particularly in the construction sector, it is clear that they are not all entrepreneurs.  I am aware of labourers - not skilled individuals but labourers - on construction sites who have been forced to register as self-employed or who have been unaware that they were so registered because the contractor did the registration for them.  When such people lose their positions they are not entitled to redundancy and have no sick pay or holiday entitlements.  They are left with nothing.  They only become aware that they were self-employed when they go looking for unemployment support.  It is an absolutely outrageous state of affairs and a sad reflection on our society.  We all want to protect genuine self-employment.  </p><p> I value the regulated market economy that we have.  There is no doubt about that.  I value the contribution that decent, genuine, productive businesses and entrepreneurs make to this economy.  We would not have had the increase in employment we have had in recent years if we did not have the people who were prepared to take those risks.  This increase is also thanks to the work of IBEC and others in formulating Government policy.  This is issue will not go away and the Minister intends legislating for it.  I would appreciate the witnesses' views on what the Minister is doing.  They may only be aware of her intentions from media reports.  Has either organisation been consulted by the Minister about the legislation she intends to produce?  She stated in the Seanad last night that she intends to produce this legislation within months.</p></speech>

When Department officials appeared before the committee to discuss this issue it was clear that they had not done enough research and their access to various employment sectors was not sufficient to allow them to tell us how great the problem is.  We are here representing our constituents and we believe the problem is widespread.  I would say that all of us here are members of trade unions and, from data collected by the trade unions, we know there is a deep and growing problem.  The witnesses indicated they do not have enough evidence to identify the scale and nature of the challenge.  They stated there are not enough data available to support claims made about the levels of bogus self-employment in, for example, the construction industry.  We might start by agreeing that we need to look very deeply at this sector and at this problem to find out what is going on.  That will require the co-operation of employers, big contractors on building sites and in industry and the State because it too sometimes uses what we would determine to be bogus self-employment to fill roles.  In many cases, this is not deliberate and the State does not set out to do it but there has been such an increase in contracting out and subcontracting that malpractice often goes under the radar.  We need to get under that radar and examine exactly what is going on.</p><p>As a previous speaker said, we are not making this up.  We do not have Bills on this issue before the House because we have nothing else to do or it amuses us to do so.  There is a real problem here.  I will draw attention to some evidence from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  I hope the witnesses will bear with me as I have a lot of notes in front of me.  A briefing note from the ICTU states:</p><blockquote>The report notes that in 2017 the Joint Investigations Unit [of Revenue] initiated a campaign specifically focussed on the construction sector.  As a result of this activity, &euro;60.2 million was recovered by the Revenue Commissioners and nearly 500 subcontractors reclassified as employees [as a consequence]</blockquote> <p>That is an important fact and one with which the witnesses will not deny.  These facts come from Revenue.  In 2017, one investigation recovered &euro;60 million that was owed to the State, yet the witnesses are telling us that the evidence is anecdotal, there is nothing to see here and we should move on, and we are somehow imagining a problem when there is none.  We should acknowledge that there is a problem but that we have not investigated it properly.  Investigating it yields results and the investigation by Revenue is a serious one.</p><p>The witnesses also suggested there is not problem because self-employment levels are falling.  I will share an interesting point from a study at which they should look because it relates to their industry.  The trade union, Connect, has carried out a seriously good study on bogus self-employment.  It points out that the Central Statistic Office labour force survey shows that the number of employees in self-employment who do not themselves have employees across a range of employment sectors is increasing significantly.  If one takes on a contractor, that contractor is free to take on other people to do work occasionally, permanently or from time to time.  While the number of self-employed people who are hiring others to work for them is declining, the number of self-employed people who do not hire anyone else, that is, people who work for themselves, is rising dramatically.  That gives one an idea of the type of increase we believe is occurring.  In the second quarter of 2018, the percentage of people in construction classified as being in self-employment with no employees was 24.3%, while in the transportation and storage sector it was 14.8%.  That compares with a rate of 3.9% in industry as a whole.  There is, therefore, a problem.  If construction workers are being hired who do not, in turn, hire others, they are defined as having their own contract.</p><p>I ask the witnesses to define what they believe to be bogus self-employment.  I will describe what we generally accept as the definition of a self-employed person.  It is somebody who has control over what is done, how it is done, when and where it is done, and whether he or she does the agreed work personally or hires others to do it.  Labour lawyers call this the independence test.  It should, therefore, be simple enough to tell what the real thing is.  A worker with only the tools of the trade who does not hire or manage other workers or who works when, where and how he or she is told by a boss should always be counted as an employee.  Workers like this can be engaged as subcontractors, but they are then treated as self-employed for the purposes of workers' rights, taxation, PRSI, insurance, pensions and so on.</p><p>I would like to hear the representatives definition of bogus self-employment.  Let us think about the workers in this room.  There are people who work for the Civil Service and people who operate the cameras behind the glass.  We expect that when they show up for work they are told by their employer what to do and that their pay, hours and conditions are determined by their employer.  We do not expect them to provide their own equipment or hire other workers because they are employees.  We expect that they do not make a profit based on how much they do regardless of how efficient they are.  By most people's common sense definition, they are employees.  They turn up and are told up what to do.  The workers behind the glass who film these proceedings are not considered employees.  They are defined as self-employed.  Is that how the witnesses view self-employment?  These workers are not entitled to the protections that employment laws give to other workers, including members who pay into pensions and pay PRSI and so on.  Their contractors deem them to be self-employed.  They sign a contract which states they are a contractor working for the company the State hires to do this job.</p><p>They have no choice but to sign up to it.  They also have no control over their daily work and how they do it.  I make that point because this is a function performed by an arm of the State for the State.  I would define that as bogus self-employment.  I would like the witnesses to define how they define bogus self-employment. </p></speech>

I beg to differ with the remarks made regarding the construction industry.  In 1999, the Committee of Public Accounts instructed Revenue to investigate bogus self-employment in construction.   That investigation found that 20% of people were found to be misclassified as self-employed.  The following year, the Comptroller and Auditor General demanded another review of the area to ensure there had been no misunderstanding in terms of the findings.  That investigated was repeated because he was not satisfied the issue had been resolved.  Revenue was forced to reinvestigate construction and again 20% of people were found to be misclassified as self-employed.  This is not an issue that arose yesterday or today, or last year.  The Committee of Public Accounts-ordered investigation was carried out in 1999 and this practice was happening prior to that.</p> <p>  There is a serious problem with bogus self-employment.  It skews the labour market from the point of view of workers' rights and entitlements, payments to Revenue and employers' responsibilities in terms of PRSI classification and so on.  It also skews the economy and the rights of the worker, which is a really important point.  We know that there are bogus self-employment contracts are operating right across the economy, including in the courier and English language teaching sectors.  Pilots are also operating on contracts under which they are not directly employed by their employer, as are journalists, pharmaceutical and construction workers.  </p> <p>  I received an email recently from a woman who took up a position in CIE Tours on Abbey Street.  She had to engage with the scope section in regard to her working conditions.  The scope section upheld her claim that she was directly employed by CIE Tours, insurable under the Social Welfare Acts under PRSI Class A, but CIE Tours is appealing that decision.  This woman claims that most of the people working in that company are in bogus self-employment.  They are forced to sign contracts that put them in that category and they are afraid to stand up and be counted because of the precarious situations they are in.  This does not lead to an economy from which all workers benefit and in which they are protected under labour court law.</p> <p>  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, I am sure, has a great deal of contact with the scope section.  A number of actions have been proposed in regard to addressing bogus self-employment, including that workers should only be allowed to register as self-employed if they satisfy agreed criteria.  However, it has been said that the new system is not clear in that regard.  It is also proposed that principal contractors be made liable for 10.95% employer PRSI for all subcontractors; that Revenue's capacity for PRSI non-compliance interventions be strengthened; and that the Workplace Relations Commission-Labour Court should replace the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in reviewing and reporting misclassifications, which is important.  Currently, the scope section and the WRC-Labour Court do work in this area but I think only one body should do this work.  People often have to engage with the High Court through the scope section and must jump through numerous hoops to ascertain their classification.  I seek the witnesses' views on the recommended repayment by employers found guilty of the misclassification of workers of all unpaid PRSI payments and on the introduction of legislation to define the term "worker-employee".  What was proposed by Professor Michael Doherty is complicated but it can be done.  It is up to as politicians and employers groups to ascertain what that is.</p></speech>

The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, gave us a breakdown of the numbers of people working in the construction industry and the number of people self-employed with no employees, which at 31,900, stands out.  The witness also made reference to the reports by the ESRI and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on this question.  Has the CIF reached out to the people it reported are identified as self-employed with no employees?  Has it done any research in this area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2051" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019032800002#H00400"><p>Before I call the witnesses, I wish to expand on the final point made by Deputy Carey.  The figures produced from CIF are CSO figures.  Almost 32,000 workers in the construction sector are self-employed with no employees.  That is a very significant number.  As I said earlier, it is much higher than the situation across industry in general.  I accept that the data are not available, but would a person declared to be self-employed who has worked for the same company for 12 months still be deemed to be self-employed?  In other words, at what point would that person be deemed to be not self-employed?  As I said, those data are not available to us.  We know only that there are 32,000 self-employed persons in the construction sector.  I make that point to be transparent and fair.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith made the point that many of us were members of trade unions.  I have never been a member of a trade union.  Prior to my election, I was one of those people who was self-employed with employees who spent 20 years working on construction sites in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I have seen a lot of the actual practices.  I do not want that to influence any of the responses.  I want the figures that are produced in the various reports.  From an industry point of view, it would be well worthwhile if, as mentioned by Deputy Carey, the CIF were to carry out an analysis of the 32,000 people who are deemed to be self-employed with no employees and how long they have been subcontracting to one contractor and so on because that would give an indication of what is going on in the industry.</p></speech>

The first point made by Deputy O'Dea was around the counter-narrative that can emerge and the fact that potentially it is seen as trying to do down individuals within this particular situation.  IBEC understands that this is certainly not the intention in any way but it does highlight the complexity of the situation.  Our challenge is to highlight the complexity of trying to regulate in the framework we are examining here.  Our view is very much that we do have a system and a structure in place that has worked.  It is clear from the questions raised this morning that many of the challenges arising are in regard to utilisation of the framework.  We are not necessarily seeing any specific instance in which the framework itself has not delivered the outcome we would have expected.</p> <p>  In regard to Deputy O'Dea's point that there are a number of individuals of whom he is aware, we believe he should encourage those people to take their action through the WRC, where the cases can be determined.  There is legislation in place.  We put great trust in the independence of the WRC.  It adjudicates on all of our employment rights and it has significant wealth of experience across all industrial relations matters.  Its inspection services are exemplary.  In many ways, we already have a really significant structure in place to deal with those issues.  The WRC has significantly deal with cases.  We are not aware of any major number of cases where those rights have not been addressed or have been the subject of significant appeal.</p><p>In response to the comments of Senator Nash, we are talking here about the ability of people to engage with the protections that exist.  We need to be careful with our use of language and words such as "phenomena".  We do not deny that issues are arising.  In fact, we are very aware that there are compliance issues which is why we are very supportive of the Minister's approach in terms of investigation and ensuring compliance.  We are not necessarily saying that we are satisfied with how the current regime operates.  We acknowledge that there is a problem but it is not necessarily connected to how the regime operates; rather, the problem lies with the utilisation of the regime.  There is adequate legislation in place that can address many of the concerns.  The issue is with managing the enforcement of the legislation in a consistent way.  We must encourage the enforcement of the legislation.  We should have confidence in the systems.  We have confidence in legislation's ability to deal with all other areas of employment rights and this area should not pose any more of a challenge.  Employees, contractors or individuals who feel they have an issue they wish to raise should be able to do so.</p><p> Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised the issue of data and clearly there are lots of challenges in this area.  That said, the ESRI and the Departments of Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection have produced significant volumes of data on this area.  These are independent bodies with a significant interest in determining the right data in respect of independent contractors.  While we recognise that there are challenges in certain sectors, we are talking about only 2% across the board.  When we make regulation, we always need to be cognisant of the fact that it will impact the entirety of labour market and we need to manage any unintended consequences, especially when we have a regime in place.  We would accept the data put forward by ICTU on a previous occasion at this committee.  That showed that the 2017 initiative addressed some of the concerns that are arising and it converted 500 people from self-employed status to employed.  In many ways, that upholds what we are trying to share with the committee, which is our belief that we have a strong regime.  When we address issues through the compliance framework, we find that it works very well.  The supports that underpin that compliance are important.  They provide the opportunity to deliver results without increasing the complexity of our employment legislation or producing any unintended consequences by layering more legislation on top.  Everybody has anecdotal stories but we cannot rely on them.  We must rely on the data and the hard figures and it is important that we do so throughout the entirety of the process.  Just because there has been an increase in the number of self-employed people in our economy does not necessarily mean we have increased bogus or false self-employment across the board.  Naturally, our economy changes, develops and grows.  We were very keen to ensure-----</p></speech>

Frequently witnesses say that the percentage is dropping, which is correct.  I am not talking about bogus self-employment but self-employment.  While the percentage is dropping, the number of people is not dropping.  The number of people in the workforce who are self-employed is not dropping.  I want to make that distinction in case we give the impression that it is diminishing to such an extent that it is not relevant.  There are more than 300,000 people classified as self-employed.  That is the size of the cohort and while I accept what Ms McElwee has said in terms of the percentage diminishing, the number of people involved is sizeable.</p></speech>

I was addressing the point made by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith about the increase in the number of people who are self-employed.  My point is that such an increase is not necessarily indicative of an increase in false or bogus self-employment.  There will be lots of people who are willingly self-employed and who will have chosen that course for their own benefit.  The issue is to manage the narrative.  Rising self-employment does not automatically mean rising false or bogus self-employment.</p> <p>  On the question of definitions, I am not going to comment on the individual circumstances of anybody here, whether at this committee or in the wider environment because I have no background information or details on it.  However, there are common law tests in our legislation regarding integration, mutuality of benefit and control and enterprise tests.  All of these exist.  We have a framework with which we can make a definition and a decision around managing direct employment or self-employment.  It has always been a principle of our systems that we can look beyond a written contract and make a judgment on the operation of that contract.  The structures are there.</p> <p>  The question was asked about the point at which an individual can be determined to have become an employee.  That will vary, depending on the circumstances.  It will change and will depend on the individual, which is part of the complexity of this particular issue.  Everybody's circumstances are different and we expect our legislation to take into account the fact that people are not the same.  I may not want to be judged to be an employee simply because I have had one contract with one employer for a particular period.  I may not want to be converted to employee status against my will.  It is about utilising the frameworks that we have and the legislation that the courts have developed over many years, which have served us well in being able to make these determinations.  They must be done on an individual basis and we have the framework to do that.</p></speech>

In terms of the issue we are trying to fix here, Deputy O'Dea said that he is eager to preserve true self-employment and not to undermine it in any way, which is good to hear.  I accept the Deputy's integrity and bona fides in that regard but the problem is that the definition of "employee" is critical.  The issue is how the common law tests that we have are applied.  They are necessarily nuanced and have developed over time to capture the variety of arrangements that exist.  Those arrangements are very much sought after and wanted by the individual self-employed people to whom they apply.  That is why we have a concern about how any legislation would develop.  When I heard Senator Nash referring to the Competition (Amendment) Act 2017, I was very concerned because he suggested that it consolidated the existing Revenue code into a statutory definition but it did not do so.  It summarised, in a very brief form, what the code says and would likely capture a great many people out there who would not consider themselves by any means to be falsely self-employed or an employee.  The other issue it raises is the question of the dependent contractor which is in the same section of definitions.  In that particular section, the legislation states that a dependent contractor is somebody who has two or fewer clients and who works for another person, whether or not that person is an employer of other people.  That raises a very scary prospect for individuals who might be seeking work to be done only to find that the person that he or she believes is an independent contractor engaged to do the work has no other clients.  Suddenly, the question arises as to his or her rights.  Right now, under the Competition (Amendment) Act, he or she has imited and contained rights for competition law purposes but if we are going to look to sections like that for definitions in any new legislation, that would be a worrying prospect for a lot of self-employed people as well as for business generally.</p></speech>

She started by saying that the definition of "employee"must be flexible to allow it to morph and change as circumstances change but that goes to the heart of the problem.  IBEC wants to have it every way.  It wants to change the definition to suit an employer and then argue that it is to suit the self-employed.  That is the most illogical form of constructive ambiguity that I have heard in a long time.</p><p>Ms Murphy is doing it in order to cover up what really is not about the individual window cleaner, but the widespread practice of forcing workers to define themselves as independent contractors in order to exploit their working conditions, pay and so on.  It leaves them very insecure and also robs the State of social protection funds, taxation and all the other things.  Ms Murphy needs to listen back to what she just said because the workers who provide us with the recordings, provide us with a very valuable piece of evidence.  What she just said makes out that definitions can and must be flexible in order to allow for the flexibility of the labour market to suit IBEC.</p></speech>

Our submissions here are not in any way to encourage a situation where that is allowed to prevail.  It is not good for business competition and is certainly not the intention of IBEC.  It is more around managing the issue in terms of allowing our labour market to work effectively and with some flexibility.  It is not to provide opportunity to employ people falsely in a self-employed capacity.</p></speech>

Would Mr. O'Connell or Ms Winters care to speak?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.2069" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor O'Connell" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019032800002#K00900"><p>Several Deputies have acknowledged the need for greater data on this area before legislation is enacted.  We support such a stance.  I also note all Deputies have acknowledged legitimate self-employment and that the construction sector, by its nature, has a large number of people who are self-employed.  I will explain some of the reasons behind that.  There was a very severe downturn in the construction sector where a situation developed, especially among the craftspeople, such as skilled carpenters, skilled plasterers or skilled bricklayers, who became less reliant on employers for employment and more reliant on themselves.  They could control the flow of work.  Continuity of employment is a significant issue in the construction sector, even now in places where the industry is busy there may be a piece of blockwork to carry out for several weeks and then no more need for bricklayers or blocklayers on the site for several more weeks or months thereafter.  Even when a contractor is busy certain trades or skills may only be needed at certain times.  Therefore, continuity of employment can be an issue so some people go down the route of being self-employed to have greater control of their flow of work.  That is one reason such a large number is self-employed in the sector.  However, as members have said, there is a need for more data on the matter.</p> <p>  There are also structural issues in the industry.  Some years ago one-off houses were able to opt out of the building control amendment regulation system.  We warned at the time that this would not be conducive to a properly regulated industry.  If we are going to examine bogus self-employment we must also examine some of the structural issues in the industry which are not conducive to a properly regulated environment in the construction sector.</p></speech>

The figures speak for themselves.  There is a disproportionately higher number self-employed in construction.  As an industry body, does CIF do any analysis on these figures or any risk assessment on bogus self-employment?</p></speech>

Over the last months and years, the Revenue Commissioners have begun to inspect the industry far more in respect of self-employed versus worker.  Some of the figures mentioned by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith are not insignificant - 500 employees reclassified as workers - nor is the amount of money recovered insignificant at &euro;62 million.  These figures show that proper enforcement in the sector can and does work for the betterment both of contractors and employees working in the industry.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Jean Winters, has recently met with the Workplace Relations Commission and its enforcement section.  We do need greater enforcement in our industry.  It is fine having rules and regulations but they need to be enforced to ensure that contractors that try to go operate in a proper manner are backed up by the State through a proper enforcement regime.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of discussion at this meeting about the official figures, 31,900 self-employed without employees, but the industry is based on a system of contracting and sub-contracting.  Just because approximately 20% of the overall workforce is categorised as self-employed without employees does not mean that is bogus self-employment.</p></speech>

I specifically said that it is a sector that has a substantially higher level and therefore there is greater risk.</p></speech>

Given the nature of the industry, it explains to a large extent why there would be larger numbers of self-employed, either with employees or without, because it is an industry which is based on contracting and sub-contracting.</p> <p>  Senator Nash and Deputy O'Dea, in particular, stated here today that they know of people who have been forced into self-employment.  That is clearly wrong and we categorically state that.  We support the legitimate contractor and in the case of somebody who has been forced into self-employment it is clearly wrong.  The legitimate contractor loses out if this other contractor has a competitive advantage.  That sort of practice is detrimental to the industry.</p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to the campaign in which the Revenue Commissioners were involved in 2017 when more than &euro;60 million was collected.  As Mr. O'Connell said, to us it demonstrates that there are mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with all regulations, guidelines and legislation and we would like to see even more of that.  We are in favour of ensuring that all workers are aware of the guidelines and codes of practice in place and we want inspection and enforcement, and more of it.  As Mr. O'Connell noted, we have been in contact with the Workplace Relations Commission to discuss greater measures to ensure compliance with the sectoral employment order in the construction industry.  It was the CIF which applied for that order.  It sets legally binding rates of pay, pensions and sick pay for workers in the industry.  The CIF applied to the Labour Court in 2016, asking it to conduct an examination of the industry with a view to introducing a sectoral employment order.  At that time, we asked the construction workers unions to come along with us and make a joint application.  They decided for their own reasons not to do that, so we went alone.  A sectoral employment order is in place and we are very much in favour of ensuring that it is complied with and we seek greater measures to ensure compliance.</p> <p>  Deputy Joan Collins spoke of the principal contractor and its responsibilities.  If one looks at the public sector contract currently in place, clause 5 sets out the contractor's obligations to ensure that all workers on site receive all their entitlements under registered employment agreements, sectoral employment orders and various other employment protection legislation.</p><p>It also sets out that all workers on site have a right to be a member of a trade union if they so wish and that if a trade union has concerns about non-compliance, a union official may contact a designated member of the contractor's management team to discuss those concerns with a view to putting the situation right.  Certain obligations are already in place and we believe they should be complied with and enforced.  I am not saying that there is absolutely no incidence of bogus self-employment in the construction industry as that would be a foolish statement to make.  The mechanisms are in place to allow those with the powers to go out and inspect any incidents to so do.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith stated, the Revenue campaign in 2017 bears that out.  We are all in favour of that.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins or Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to the Connect trade union and its report. We work quite closely with Connect.  We work with it on the electrical national joint industrial council which will meet on Monday.  We will meet representatives of Connect tomorrow on the mechanical sector.  We work quite closely with it.  If there are issues that we need to discuss, of course, we will do that.  Our position is that if there are issues - and I accept that there are - we need to tackle them.  We believe the mechanisms are in place to tackle all issues of bogus self-employment and that they should be used.  If we need more inspectors on the ground, that should be facilitated.  There should be more awareness among workers generally of their entitlements and the work of the scope section of the Department.  The measures are there and should be used.  If they need to be enhanced, that is the way this issue can be tackled.</p></speech>

However, Ms Winters did not acknowledge that in 1999 the Committee of Public Accounts instructed Revenue to investigate bogus self-employment in the construction industry.  A level of 20% was identified.  This is not something that only happened in 2017 or 2015; it goes back to 1999.</p> <p>  What I am hearing from the two federations is that there is legislation and that workers should use it and it should be strengthened and so on.  In 1979, I left school and began work in the post office.  I knew exactly what I was going into.  I was employed by An Post.  I had a contract and a probationary period before being given full-time employment.  That is not what is happening now.  In the courier industry, one works for a company but one is given a contract stating that one is self-employed and looks after one's own holiday pay and such things and has no rights.  The situation is similar for Ryanair pilots.   They are on contracts stating that they are not directly employed by Ryanair even though they are working for Ryanair, their rosters come from Ryanair and they must be present at certain times to fly particular planes.  This fundamental change in the industry is the problem.  If thousands of workers such as journalists and those working in the media and film industries, as well as parts of the public sector, are going into these types of situations, we are heading for difficulty unless the current position is changed.  It has reached a point that workers and employers are looking for flexibility in regard to working a 20-hour week or 25-hour week if that suits and to the absolute extreme whereby the only option many workers are given is a self-employed contract.  That is the problem.  The CIF and IBEC must be able to say whether that is right or wrong.  If they think it wrong, they should instruct and encourage employers to recruit directly, rather than utilising self-employment contracts.</p></speech>

He referred to a severe recession and stated that workers became more reliant on themselves and went down the route of seeking jobs on a self-employed basis and that we now have an industry based on that system.  Let us be honest.  The usage of the flexible definition of what is a worker or an employee goes back much further than that.  The notion that workers no longer have a set of entrenched rights regarding their lives and expectations has probably been around since the 1980s.</p> <p>  However, even if I accept what was stated regarding the recession and that construction workers had to redefine themselves because they had to work for themselves more and find odd jobs here, there and yon, why has the phenomenon of self-employment reached its current level at a time when the building industry is booming, building companies are making massive profits and one sees cranes all over the Dublin skyline?  Some building companies have recently been involved in very controversial circumstances related to the national children's hospital, etc., and some are notorious for engaging people on self-employed contracts.  I believe that self-employment is at such a high level because workers will not get a job unless they declare themselves self-employed contractors.  It is the only way they will get a job.  Some people who work in these Houses are in a similar situation.  Regardless of whether it has happened by default, it has happened.  The problem is that the prevailing attitude is there is nothing to see here and we should all move on.  However, many workers can only get a job in their chosen field if they declare or define themselves to be independent contractors.  As a result, they get less pay and have worse conditions and more insecurity.  Workers checking out their entitlements and going to the Workplace Relations Commission or the scope section may mean that they lose their job because they are no longer of use to the contractor.  We need to take this seriously and stop saying there is nothing to see.  This is a real issue.</p></speech>

Move along."  We are saying that there has been significant change in the industry since the 1980s.  There is greater specialisation and more modern technology and the need to employ certain grades of skilled staff on a continuous basis has diminished.  That is a fact.  She referred to the boom.  There is a boom in Dublin in the construction sector, but that is not the case outside the capital.</p></speech>

It is not the case that on leaving school or other education, a person walks into an employer's office and is offered an independent contract.  In fact, such practices are very much in the minority.  We know that from those reports.  For the avoidance of doubt, we are not saying that false self-employment does  not exist.  Rather, we are saying that based on the independent studies we have, the issue is not as large as it is being presented to be, and that there are remedies there of which people may avail.  Apart from Deputy Collins' example of the CI&Eacute; worker who went to the scope section and got the correct outcome, I am not aware of examples of widespread bogus self-employment.  The system is working when it is invoked.  When inspections are made, money is recovered and people's employment status changed.</p><p>The IBEC position is that we have a framework in place.  We may need more work on inspection and enforcement but, beyond that, tinkering with or making wholesale changes to the nature of a contract of employment could have many unintended consequences for businesses as well as for people who left employment to set up a business and who find themselves unwittingly captured by some of the legislation that might come out of that process.</p></speech>

Deputy Joan Collins set out the example of a worker who was just told that the only option was to go as a self-employed person.  We would absolutely not support any kind of a situation such as that; it is  clearly wrong because the regulations are in place.  Someone can either be classified as a self-employed person or he or she should be regarded as directly employed.  We are very supportive of all of the mechanisms that are in place.  There are sufficient mechanisms to ensure compliance and we would support any enhanced measures to make sure that there are inspectors out there on the ground ensuring that the various regulations are adhered to.</p></speech>

The committee is working to look at bogus self-employment.  It is not just the issue of revenue lost to the State, it is also the various entitlements lost to a potential employee - be it holiday pay, sick pay, etc. - and it will become more important in the future as auto-enrolment in the context of pensions will come into play and whereby employers will have a contribution to make.</p> <p>  I want to make one observation on something Ms Winters said.  She was referring to the industry generally and stated that somebody could be abusing the system and gaining an unfair advantage over others in a sector.  That is a very important point and it is very well made.  I was surprised when Deputy Carey indicated that the industry organisations know that the level of self-employment is higher in certain sectors, whether it is couriers, construction or whatever.  While the CSO publishes data, it would probably be worthwhile for the industry bodies themselves to break that data down by company and by sector.  For example, how many of the 30,000 are blocklayers, labourers and so forth?  The risk would then become more apparent.  It would be useful for the industry organisations to look at that.</p> <p>  I again thank our guests for attending.  Their opening statements and their answers to the questions have been very helpful and informative.</p></speech>
