He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  </p><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p><p>The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 7 March.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  They will be published.  As I cannot see anything arising that will not be dealt with when we deal with correspondence and other items, we will move on. </p><p>The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  The first category is category A - briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 2076 and 2077, dated 26 and 27 March, are a briefing note and the opening statement for today's meeting from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We will note and publish them. </p><p>The next category is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and their Ministers following previous meetings of the committee.  The first item is No. 2031, correspondence, dated 11 March 2019, received from Mr. Tom Grady, chief executive of Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, on governance standards, the internal audit function, the finance committee and internal controls.  The ETB acknowledges the shortcomings in 2017 which were highlighted.  Corrective action has been taken to improve compliance.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  We have seen a general improvement in the ETB sector, but there are still problems throughout with internal audit.  We will keep an eye on the matter. </p><p>The next item is No. 2032, correspondence received from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing outstanding information requested by the committee on the Irish Prison Service.  It relates to the level of compensation paid in cases involving an injury to a prisoner.  The issues involved were not dealt with in previous correspondence.  The correspondence provides details of the compensation paid in cases in which prisoners had harmed themselves and a note on cases which involved protected disclosures and non-disclosure agreements, including where payments were made.  We will note the correspondence, but I want to highlight one or two issues in that regard.  </p><p>The fourth letter highlights a very sad situation.  It reads:</p><blockquote>I can advise the Committee that payments for self-injurious behaviour for the years 2016 and 2017 were &euro;50,000 and &euro;51,737 respectively.  The payments were made to the families of prisoners who had died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody.</blockquote> <p>I would like to write back to ask for an update on cases involving prisoners who died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody since 2017.  I do not know if it was mentioned at our last meeting, but before we meet the Secretary General again, we will need to receive a note on potential claims or claims that have already been lodged as a result of an outbreak of tuberculosis in a prison.  There are some cases in the system.  I understand there is a significant issue in one institution.  </p><p>We return to the State Claims Agency and will have to address the issue in our periodic report.  There is a demarcation line.  When an issue arises, it is referred to the State Claims Agency and, as far as the Irish Prison Service is concerned, that is the end of it.  The agency is required under legislation to process and manage cases.  However, we asked about confidentiality agreements.  In the last paragraph Mr. O'Driscoll writes:</p><blockquote>The State Claims Agency considers and treats all settlements as confidential as between the State Claims Agency and the Plaintiff.  The State Claims Agency does not routinely request confidentiality agreements in relation to claims' settlements but does so from time-to-time as it deems it necessary and appropriate.  In some instances, confidentiality agreements are sought by Plaintiffs.</blockquote> <p>Officials of the State Claims Agency will come before the committee again to deal with the handling of confidentiality agreements and claims against the State.  We were told that they were almost unique.  This indicates something slightly different.  We will, therefore, need to verify the matter.  We need to examine the TB outbreak and receive an update on cases in which people died from self-inflicted injuries while in custody.  We will note and publish the correspondence. </p><p>The next item is No. 2033, correspondence received from Ms Carol Hanney, chief executive, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, providing information requested by the committee on the internal audit function.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It makes for sad reading from a public accounts point of view.  Essentially, the ETB had one internal auditor who retired in December 2016.  There were communications between the ETB and the Department on what grade the internal auditor should be, whether he or she should be an assistant principal officer or at a higher grade.  One body said &quot;Yes&quot;, the other said &quot;No&quot;.  They then changed their minds and changed them back again.  They tried to recruit but could not find anybody.  They tried again but still could not find anybody.  We are now told that the internal auditor should be recruited through the national ETB internal audit function.  This is a great example of the parcel being passed around for years, sheets of paper being issued from one Department to another and nothing being done.  I know that there are difficulties in recruitment, but the correspondence states that in the period from September to December 2017 the ETB internal audit function carried out one audit of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It is utterly and totally unsatisfactory that there is no evidence of any internal audit having been carried out of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board.  It is not fair to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to answer off the top of his head, but what turnover does the organisation have?</p></speech>

This is an organisation through which &euro;500 million of taxpayers' money passes each year and the correspondence appears to show that no internal audit reports have been carried out in at least the last year and a half.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

It is up to the Department to get a handle on the issue.  The solution is not in the hands of individual ETBs.  It is obviously a departmental issue.   I will pass on the concerns that have been expressed.  The Department must come up with a detailed plan to resolve the issue.  To do our work, the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General need to rely on the internal audit function, but there is a big gap in the system.  It is just not on that an organisation with a turnover of &euro;500 million has no internal audit function.  I have made my point.  We will ask for a detailed timetable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#B01200"><p>Tangentially, last week I met representatives of the Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, with other Deputies.  This does not concern the internal audit function, but I note that the implementation of shared services is moving very slowly.  The GRETB representatives said the technology was not fit for purpose.  They highlighted payroll and finance operations.  They said it openly, which is the problem.  I must say it is in spite of their best efforts.</p></speech>

The ETB's representatives explained to us the issues related to payroll.  I am trying to get my head around the finance aspect.  I do not know how far behind we are in the roll-out, but the people who are speaking to us identified it as a risk.</p></speech>

I would appreciate that.  This will be noted and published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It follows on from the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB.  I believe that the Galway and Mayo situation is replicated in many places around the State.</p><p>No. 2041B from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health, provides information requested by the committee as follows: a breakdown of the cost of services provided by laboratories in respect of CervicalCheck and further details in on the provision of out-of-cycle smear tests.  Both of these are in line with what was said at the meeting here on the out-of-cycle tests and the costs of approximately &euro;10 million for the services provided by the laboratories.  Mr. Breslin has outlined in the correspondence that it is &euro;9.6 million and he gives a small breakdown of those costs.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>No. 2044B from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman, Office of Public Works, provides information requested by the committee on the negotiations on the rent for Miesian Plaza and the basis of measurement to determine the rent.  This matter is still under discussion.  Mr. Buckley said that the matter has not been concluded.  The committee will note and publish this and will ask for an update on that by a maximum of three months' time.We will give him a little bit of time.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>No.  2045B is from Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Department of the Taoiseach, and provides information requested by the committee on the costs of commissions of investigation, which we received subsequently from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That was a very detailed and comprehensive note that we discussed at this committee.</p><p>The correspondence from Mr. Fraser also includes a breakdown of figures on the Office of Government Information Services staffing and a copy of the Government's 2018 national risk assessment is also enclosed in No. 2045B(2).  This risk assessment is an 87-page document that has been signed off by the Taoiseach.  Mr. Fraser, in his letter, says that each Department looks after its own risk.  The committee will write back to him because we had asked specifically about the national risk register, which he has given to us, but in his correspondence he refers back to the Department's risk register.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>The Department's Risk Register includes five categories of risks including Reputational Risks described as Risks to the public reputation of the Department, alongside Strategic, Operational, Financial and Legal &amp;amp; Regulatory Risks.  The National Risk Assessment is in place to highlight national risks so for the Department a significant proportion of the risks are in the corporate and operational sphere.</blockquote> <p>The committee will ask Mr. Fraser to give us a note on what I would call a whole-of-Government approach.  When we put the question to him, I thought we would get a  response with the report such as a short observation on the whole-of-Government approach.  He has come back with only the implications relating to his Department.  This is produced by the Taoiseach's Department and signed off by him, but I would ask Mr. Fraser to give an observation from a whole-of-Government approach, to give us a similar overview to that which has highlighted at departmental level on the national risk register.  I assume that he is the most appropriate Secretary General to answer that question.  We will come back to see where that is.  It is as if each Department has its own risk register, and this report is a compilation, but this committee always likes to see a whole-of-Government approach.  That is what we are about.  We will ask for that and will await a response on it.  It is not an extensive document.</p></speech>

They can be taken up with the respective line Department's committees if there is a risk register for each Department.  That job should be dealt with by the respective sectoral committees from their own points of view.  This correspondence has been produced for the Committee of Public Accounts, and it was overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach, but we would like an overall whole-of-Government comment on that.</p></speech>

The correspondence states:</p><blockquote>The Human Resources Division contacted Mr. Conor Hannaway who was involved in the process, and he has advised that the intervention was an organisation development initiative which resulted in a briefing (set of presentation slides, which were provided to the Committee) which was shared with management and staff to help address the particular situation in 2006 at the Estates Office in Kilmainham. No formal report or minutes was required or prepared as a result of the intervention. </blockquote> <p>While there was a briefing, I do not recall what the presentation in Kilmainham was called.  Mr. Mitchell has given us the best information he has.  He has said that there was no formal report, minutes or documents from that presentation.  We will note and publish this.  If anyone here would like to take it up directly, he or she is free to do so.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 2047 from Mr. David Feeney, chief operations officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, provides information requested by the committee on Project Ireland 2040.  This correspondence was noted and published at the last meeting but it was not in time for our normal correspondence list.  We had it at the previous meeting.  We are formally noting and publishing it now.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 2050 from Ms Rosalind Carroll, director at the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is on the single public service pension scheme.  This is a follow-up letter.  Members will be pleased to know that when the committee does its periodic report, if staff see there is a gap in the information we have not been provided with, they go back to get an update.  This correspondence deals with the single public service pension scheme and the cost to the RTB.  The committee dealt with those issues specifically in our report and we had a chart on it.  That was fully dealt with in the report we published two weeks ago.  This will be noted and published.</p><p>No. 2051 is from Dr. Mary Lee Rhodes, head of regulation with the interim regulatory committee at the Housing Agency.  This regulation office is a voluntary body - not statutory - that is not established yet.  The correspondence covers the overall staffing levels in approved housing bodies, AHBs, including the numbers of staff dealing with housing and accommodation and those providing support services; details regarding how many of the 260 AHBs who have signed up to the voluntary code have ensured their financial statements are published and audited within nine months of year end; and the number of AHBs that do not meet the Companies Registration Office requirement for the publication of accounts.</p><p>We will discuss the next correspondence with this because it is on the same issue.  No. 2052 from Dr. Donal McManus, chief executive officer with the Irish Council for Social Housing, provides details regarding security of tenure for clients in AHBs, including life tenure and any reduction in tenure in properties acquired under the NAMA scheme; overall staffing levels; details on the payment and availability scheme; information on local property tax paid by AHBs, paid at the minimum rate of &euro;90 or thereabouts, which is the first step on the ladder; and a note on the number of new builds delivered by the sector.  There are a few points here.  We had the Irish Council for Social Housing before the committee because we are dealing with housing.  We have had three meetings on the housing issue and we will bring it to a conclusion soon.  With regard to the staffing numbers in AHBs, I am having trouble reconciling the two letters, one of which is from the regulatory office stating there are 10,067 staff and the other stating 1,236 staff are employed directly in the provision of housing.  This implies that the other staff are either involved in administration or in providing care and support services for people in that area.</p><p>The letter from the Irish Council for Social Housing, if I am reading it right, suggests that the overall number of staff is 4,600 and the number of volunteers is 5,922.  I am just not sure how these two letters gel.</p></speech>

I have exactly the same conundrum as the Deputy.  I am trying to figure out what they would be doing and what their function would be.  Most approved housing bodies, as far as I am aware, allocate houses.  There would be a degree of administration but I am not aware that there are care services provided in most cases.  I cannot figure out where they would have a requirement for 10,000 people.  How does that end up being factored into the cost of that housing?</p></speech>

That is the letter from the regulation office and the Irish Council for Social Housing gives a staff figure of 4,600 and mentions almost 6,000 volunteers.  Maybe the other letter should have referred to staffing, including volunteers.  I do not know.  It is not clear so we need clarification from both bodies.  I do not follow the two letters.  They seem to be saying different things.  It is amazing if there are 10,000 employees involved in the sector.  We need to know how many houses are under the control of approved housing bodies.  We are going to ask the Department for the housing stock of all the local authorities.</p></speech>

In that same paragraph, just before the chart, it is stated that the Irish Council for Social Housing does not have a breakdown available of the split between staff engaged in housing functions and those engaged in care and support services.  They should have that.  It is a big area.  We are dealing with a housing crisis and the approved housing bodies, which are the ones dealing with a lot of the housing nowadays, cannot even give us this breakdown.  It is a basic bit of information.  I think we will also have to write to the Secretary General.  He is ultimately the person who is handing out all this money on taxpayers' behalf.  We should ask him to respond to these two letters as well.</p></speech>

It was always my understanding that people had security of tenure for life, subject to complying with the tenancy agreement, and that there was no difference between being housed under a voluntary body and a local authority except that tenants could never buy the house outright.  That is what I understood.  Over the last few years, I have seen voluntary bodies acquire housing and it is not clear what security of tenure the tenants have.  It is not clear whether they are on four, five or ten year leases.  That is what I was asking.  What the ICSH has done in reply is quote the legislation back to us referring to Part 4 tenancies and so on.  It was very kind of it to clarify the RTB and the legislation.  However, what I asked was what security of tenure is in place in those almost 30,000 units.  Are they offering life tenure or five-year leases?  My question applies particularly to the last few years when accommodation was acquired from NAMA and so on.  It is an important question.</p></speech>

We are also going to write to the Department and will include all these items of correspondence.  We want the Department to respond to the issues in these two letters and the issues we are raising.  It is all well and good getting something from a voluntary regulatory office.  It is fine getting something from the Irish Council of Social Housing.  However, we need something from the Department on this.</p></speech>

There have been figures bandied about and disputed, on which we got some clarification only in the last few weeks.  It is primarily going to be a factual report so that we can also look at it from the point of view of value for money.  In simple terms, that is what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#D04400"><p>We probably will not be able to do a report on leasing versus ownership because that is a long-term thing and we have not done enough.  However, there are lots of things such as the HAP and various other matters that we have covered in our three meetings.  When we get these clarifications, we will be able to do a report on the areas we have covered, exactly as the Deputy has said.  There are other issues in housing for other people to address.  In respect of what we have done, we have enough information gathered or in the process of being assembled for us to do a project ourselves directly in the very near future.  I said to the secretariat before the meeting started that there are two issues.</p><p>I am just throwing that out; I am not asking for members' views.  There are two issues which are more time sensitive rather than waiting for a periodic report.  The first one is the broadband issue.  There is no point in the matter being concluded and this committee issuing a report two months later.  The second is housing on which I believe we have most of our work assembled as far as we are going with that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's audit this year might throw up something else which we will come back to on another day but we might bring those two issues together.  I am just asking members to think about it and we will decide on it the next day.  I believe there are two issues.  We have had three or four meetings on housing and at least three meetings on broadband.  They are the two bigger projects that we have and I believe we should work on producing a report just covering those two items as soon as possible.  It is advance work.  It will not be in our next periodic report.  There seems to be a general logic in that approach so we will follow up on this one and come back to that.  I thank the members.  We understand what is required.  The Department has to come in on all of this as well because we will be issuing a report as soon as we get all our information back.</p><p> The next item is No. 2053B from Mr. Paul Quinn, Chief Procurement Officer, Office of Government Procurement, dated 12 March 2019, providing information requested by the committee as follows: a copy of the capital works management framework; a note on the required delivery timeline for the national paediatric hospital; and a copy of the minutes and attendance list for the meeting of the Government Contracts Committee for Construction when the request for a derogation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the standard forms of contracts was considered and agreed.  We will note and publish that.</p><p> There is a second item of correspondence relative to that on the list which I will skip down to.  It is No. 2075B, which we will put on the screen, from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, specifically on the children's hospital.  It is dated 25 March 2019 regarding our invitation for a second meeting.  It states that given that the PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report will not be discussed by the board until 1 May, it has asked that the meeting be scheduled after that.  I want to look at the correspondence.  There is quite a time gap in respect of No. 2075B.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board states that PwC is currently targeting to complete its review on 5 April and the report will then be issued to the HSE, which commissioned the report, and not to the hospital board, and other relevant stakeholders for consideration.  The board will not have its subsequent board meeting until 1 May so it is suggesting that it would be premature to come in on 18 April, which we accept.  We will not have had an opportunity to discuss it.  I will call Deputy Cullinane on that shortly.  It is asking us to agree an alternative date after it has had an opportunity to consider the report.  No. 2075B states that the board would like to invite members of the committee to visit the construction site of the new children's hospital to hear more about the project and view the work to date.  They kindly ask that we would progress this invite with the members, and it suggests some date, one of which is this week.  I will ask members for their views on that.  Deputy Cullinane has commented on that.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy O'Brien because it is the HSE which commissioned the report.  We will put it on notice that we request that as well.  We will come back to the other issue about the capital works management framework and the Government contracts committee at that meeting.  We will hold over all the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board correspondence to that meeting.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2054B from Ms Geraldine Larkin, chief executive officer, National Standards Authority of Ireland, again relating to the single public service pension scheme.  The NSAI had a potential liability of &euro;395,375 for the years 2013-2018 but we covered that topic in our interim report.  We will just note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2058B<b></b>from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing information on a number of matters related to the national broadband plan and the metropolitan area networks.  We will note and publish that and discuss it in our meeting with Mr. Griffin after this session.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2059B from the chief executive of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, which again is in connection with the single public service pension scheme.  That topic was covered in our periodic report, which we published recently.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2060B from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 13 March 2019, providing information requested by the committee for a bi-monthly update from the Tax Appeals Commission regarding 17 high value appeals.  We will note and publish that but I want to remark that some very big cases are concluded and we intend to ask about them, without identifying any of the people involved.  In one case the quantum of the appeal was &euro;138 million.  These are the biggest ones.  It is to be reviewed at the end of the second quarter but there is a case for &euro;119 million, which is an appeal against a refusal of a corporation tax deduction in the cumulative amount of &euro;120 million.  That case was closed in January 2019.  If that case is closed, we want information on the agreed figure, the amount for the taxpayer, if it has been paid since or had it been paid in advance.  There was another case for &euro;103 million against a refusal of a corporation tax deduction.  That case was closed very recently, in February 2019.  There was another case of &euro;68 million which was an appeal against refusal of a corporation tax deduction.  That was also closed last month.  There are cases relating to corporation tax deductions worth &euro;370 million that were closed in recent weeks.  We want a report on the outcome of those cases.  The taxpayer need not be identified but we want to know the final agreed figure, if it has been paid and, if not, when it will be paid.</p><p>Most of the other cases are scheduled for hearing.  There was another case of &euro;23 million relating to corporation tax, which was closed in October.  Another one of &euro;19 million was also closed in October.  Another case of &euro;10 million was closed in October.  It is the same issue.  We will ask for an update on the financial issue of all the closed cases in terms of the outcome of those cases and the payment to the taxpayer.  It is a great schedule.  We will ask the Tax Appeals Commission to continue to provide us with a list of the top ten current cases from now on.  A good few have gone off the list.  We want to make it a manageable list from our point of view.</p><p>There was another case, an income tax appeal, involving a sum of &euro;19 million, that was closed in January.  A number of cases have been settled in recent weeks to a figure of as much as &euro;400 million and we would like to know the outcome for the taxpayer in each of them.  We will change our format.  We will ask the Tax Appeals Commissioner to give us every two months the top ten cases in terms of the quantum of money involved and indicate how they are progressing.  That will help us to make sure there is a resolution of these matters.  There were appeal cases, in respect of which the quantum of money involved was &euro;1.6 billion.  I know that the amount of tax to be paid was probably about &euro;1.1 billion.  It is in our interests to make sure tax due to the State is collected as speedily and efficiently as possible.

It explains that the Bill "provides for a replacement of the Court Poor Box by the establishment of a statutory Reparation Fund.  These funds will be allocated to ... victims of crime and for compensation payments payable by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  The reparation fund ... will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General".  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General aware of this?</p></speech>

At least the position is being regularised, which is probably the key point because the practice varies in the District Court throughout the country.  We understand the money in the poor box is accounted for through the Courts Service, but there may still be a gap.  We will ask the Minister to clarify what is meant by the phrase "the replacement of the Court Poor Box by the establishment of a statutory Reparation Fund".  We also want to clarify what is meant when a judge says in the District Court that someone must pay so much into the Garda Benevolent Fund or to the local homeless charity.  That money does not go into the poor box.</p></speech>

The Higher Education Authority, HEA, has produced a report on the governance of intellectual property, which we welcome.  It is a national overview and a review of policy.  We also received a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which was published and we discussed with Professor Donnelly.  It looked specifically at the company FeedHenry and its disposal only.  That was one part of the issue at Waterford Instituted of Technology.  We then received a separate report from the HEA, which cannot be published for the reasons we were given in correspondence received from the Department and the HEA.  The difficulty is I received correspondence from a number of individuals who were part of that process.  They are very upset at the letter sent by the HEA, which is very similar to the letter we received.  Essentially, the HEA states we cannot publish the report for legal reasons, that it has carried out a global review of intellectual property, that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report also looked at the issue and that that is the end of the matter.  The problem is that the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at it very narrowly in the sense that he looked at one specific issue.  The HEA's report looked at the issue more broadly and raised a number of issues.  The former head of the HEA has confirmed to us that it raised substantial issues.  Simply, it seems that the HEA did not have the power to produce the type of report that it did produce.  Essentially, we are being asked to forget about it as if it never happened and simply accept that the national review of policy and the Comptroller and Auditor's report which looked at one narrow element are sufficient.  I do not believe they are sufficient and that it is fair to all those who took part in the process, especially those who have concerns who I imagine might also write to the committee about the issue.  </p><p>Essentially, the letter from the Department states there are a number of questions that it has put to the board, which is fair enough.  However, the questions arise from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report only.  As i said, that report is very narrow.  Again, the Department seems to be stating that is at what we are looking.  We are looking at it through the prism of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, not the wider examination of the issues involved undertaken by the HEA.  That concerns me.  The Department can do that in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  My concerns are that there was a substantial report produced over the course of many months, for which a lot of people were consulted, including in the institute who were also defending their positions.  A comprehensive report was compiled.  At no time in our hearings or discussions were allegations made of wrongdoing by individuals.  Again, the report looked at the process.  It seems, both from the HEA's letter and that of the Department, that they think it is sufficient that the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced a report and that we can now move on.  </p><p>I welcome the response from Professor Donnelly because it is good that an Accounting Officer takes an interest in the work of the Committee of Public Accounts, but there is a lot of correcting what Members said and statements made.  I am concerned about that memo we sought to have released has been redacted.  The response from the Accounting Officer is as follows: </p><blockquote>With regard to the &quot;Memo&quot;, as outlined in our letter dated 20<sup>th</sup>February 2019, we reiterate that the Institute has received legal challenges to the release of the Memo.  Subsequent to our previous letter, a third person, who is a current WIT employee, also challenged the release of the Memo on the same basis and also on the basis that the Institute has a duty of care to them.  As the Institute is duty-bound to protect itself against legal and financial exposure, and as it is of the opinion that providing even a redacted copy of the Memo would not provide such protection, we must respectfully decline to provide a copy of said Memo. </blockquote> <p>I find it extraordinary that even a redacted version cannot be given to us.  I am not saying the institute has not received legal advice, but it is a memo that was cited in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Interestingly, the Accounting Officer has no difficulty in referencing the memo and, in fact, corrected the committee in its interpretation of the memo.  However, we cannot be given a copy of it to adjudicate for ourselves and decide what the issues are.</p><p>I have a concern about page 2 of the Accounting Officer's letter where he takes exception to one of the members who had raised concerns about the memo.  Can the Comptroller and Auditor General quickly remind us what the memo was and what the observations in his report were on that memo?</p></speech>

The Accounting Officer states:</p><blockquote>It was also stated: &quot;... somebody in the research office had written to Professor Donnelly, who was the vice president, raising concerns about the process and asking that the memorandum be circulated higher up.

The January document was not given to anybody else that we know of.  It was a different document but the different document was never produced to us.</p></speech>

It is a memo that is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We have sought a redacted version, which I imagine would block out the names of the individuals, and they are saying that they still cannot give us this memo, yet they can still cite the memo in a lengthy letter taking the Committee of Public Accounts to task.  In fact, it is inaccurate in terms of taking us to task on it and also then asking us to remove it, which I would have no problem with if there was inaccurate information that we had published.  We should do so in that case.  We have done good work on this and I commend the institute on accepting the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  My broader point is that the bigger issue is that through our work we have ensured that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, did a more global review of intellectual property and we have come a long way on this.  However, I have a concern about a HEA report which was done very comprehensively and cannot be published for legal reasons so then we just park it.  I have a real concern about that because it examined issues beyond FeedHenry.  The problem is that we will never know what those issues were and these are people on opposing sides with different views of the process and different interpretations of how the process worked.  Professor Donnelly was very clear in making that point as well.  It was the case that 50 people or more took part in the process, some of whom would have been management, some of whom would have been researchers and staff and there were different opinions but the point is that an independent process heard from all sides and then produced a report that outlined the facts and all we want are the facts and yet it seems now that we will not get them.</p></speech>

If the HEA cannot do the report, what was discussed at the last meeting with the Department, when it was in with the HEA, was that it can appoint a statutory inspector to do the exact same work that the author of the HEA report, which cannot now be published, carried out.  We have to make a decision as a committee whether we are satisfied or content with leaving the process go and saying that it cannot be published for legal reasons.  That is fair enough and we accept that if they stepped outside their remit but the issues have not changed.  That is the point.  None of the concerns and the issues that have been raised by individuals or by those who have a different interpretation of what was raised will be tested or independently examined if it is just left as the Department and the HEA seem to be advocating.</p></speech>

It has to be specifically for a purpose.  We looked at the document.  It was relevant to the examination of the development and the disposal of the interest in FeedHenry because in 2009, Aceno Mobile Services was a shareholder in FeedHenry but it ceased to be a shareholder at some point in late 2008 or early 2009.  That was why it was relevant to us to look at it but it was looking at a broader relationship between the company and the institute of technology.  I had set a scope for the examination, which was to look at the development and disposal of FeedHenry, so it was not appropriate for me to throw a wider net just as it happened.  I would have had to commence a whole separate piece of work on it.  We looked at the memo and the issues that were raised and we identified what we felt were the risks that the memo spoke to about the relationship between an institute of technology and a campus company and we examined those issues in relation to FeedHenry in chapter 4 of the examination.  I formed no definitive view on the relationship between Aceno Mobile Services and the institute of technology.  That is a matter that is dealt with in the memo and, as the Deputy said, there are different views to be taken into account on that.  Different interests might take different views on that but that is where the matter rests.</p><p>I needed to complete the work on FeedHenry and I have done that.  Whether there is a case for further examination might be judged when the institute comes back to the Department on the questions about how the system deals with the matters going forward.</p></speech>

This raises questions beyond WIT.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General cited a memo which we looked for but which we were told we could not get for legal reasons, even in a redacted form.  I do not know what the legal basis is for why we cannot get the document.  It was said that legal advice was taken but the memo was shared by people who worked in the institute.</p></speech>

Somebody was concerned and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General analysed it in a limited way.  The president said he would do the same tomorrow but that is where we come in.  When risks are brought to someone's attention there is an extra burden on that person but he is clearly saying that he dealt with this in the right way.</p></speech>

It may be possible for the legal team to give us a synopsis of the memo, if not the memo itself, redacted or otherwise.  If somebody could give us the key facts of the memo we could be satisfied that we had its content.  There has to be a halfway house for this.  I accept that some people do not want to be named and the college has to protect itself if there is a legal challenge.  It is the content that is important, not the individuals.  Is there a halfway house in which the Committee of Public Accounts and the college could be happy?</p></speech>

While I propose publishing the letter and lease agreement enclosed, I do not propose that we publish the communication in relation to the property leases as it includes details of names of individual staff, phone numbers etc.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2071 is from Mr. Kevin McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Rural and Community Development, and provides information requested by the committee on the My Open Library service, which is a staffless library.  He says there will be no reduction in staff and an improvement to services.  It is an issue in several local authorities.  We will note and publish this item and members are free to follow it up themselves.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2073 is from Dr. Deirdre Keyes, chief executive of Kildare and Wicklow ETB, providing a response to information requested by the committee including notes on: independent valuations; meetings of the board held in hotels; leasing of property by KWETB that was previously owned by it; and details of the rent-free period for Bray Civic Centre.  Dr. Keyes also refers to a review of all KWETB leases and the difficulties collating the documentation.  We will note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The matter does not fall within the remit of the committee.  Can we note the item?

The individual is seeking an update.  It is good to see that our reports are being examined carefully by members of the public.  I propose we forward the queries to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a response.  We will note that item and look forward to receiving a response.</p> <p>  No. 2042 is a note prepared by the liaison officer on non-competitive procurement.  We will note that and deal with it as part of our next periodic report.</p> <p>  No. 2043, dated 6 March, is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer, CEO, of Nursing Homes Ireland, and requests that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General provide an update to the committee regarding its proposed report relating to an examination of the nursing home support scheme.

We will take it on board as part of our meeting with the Department on broadband.  We will publish it because representatives of Enet appeared before the committee and this is a follow-on from that public meeting.</p> <p>  No. 2049 is from Mr. John O'Dwyer, head of regulation at BT Ireland, and provides information requested by the committee in regard to the Analysys Mason report, outlining recommendations.  It was discussed at a meeting of the committee and we will take the correspondence on board as part of our forthcoming discussion.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  It is a follow-on from a previous public meeting of the committee.</p> <p>  No. 2055, dated 5 March, is from an individual and is in regard to a proposed new Garda station in Schull.  The individual alleges that &euro;300,000 of repairs was carried out on a building that was less than one year old and that the original contractor may not have been held to account.  I propose that we write to the Office of Public Works for a note on the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2056, dated 6 March, is from an individual who has a concern that nurses at KDoc, Kildare and west Wicklow, are being paid in excess of agreed pay scales.  I do not think that KDoc falls under the remit of the committee.  These GP practice groups do not fall under our remit.  The individual states that nurses at the group are being paid in excess of agreed pay scales.  If they were being paid less than agreed pay scales, I would be very worried.  Mr. McCarthy has not dealt with the funding of out-of-hours GP practice groups.</p></speech>

From that point of view, it is an entirely voluntary process by groups of GPs in a region.  Some GPs are involved and others choose not to be.  It is a matter for them.  We will forward the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Health.  It is a matter for that committee.  It is a voluntary affair and does not involve public funds.  We will forward the correspondence to the Joint Committee on Health for any action it considers appropriate.  I do not wish to ignore the correspondence but it would be very much stretching our brief to address it.</p> <p>  The next item is from Mr. Sean Bolger, the CEO and chairman of Imagine Communications Group, and provides information regarding 5G.  It will be considered as part of our proceedings today.  We will note and publish the correspondence.  Agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2070 is from an individual and relates to the operation of the Irish election observation roster and a response received from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The individual believes that the selection process was flawed.  The individual was not granted a place on the roster and has taken an appeal to the High Court.  The committee previously dealt with matters involving another individual in respect of this matter and decided that we would not pursue it any further.  I propose that we note the matter.  We should not become involved, particularly if a case has been taken to the High Court.</p></speech>

It is not off our desk completely in that regard.</p> <p>  The next item is statements and accounts received since the last meeting.  We will move through this relatively quickly.  I want to get these issues dealt with because if they are not, there will be a build-up for next week, the following week and every other week.  The statements and accounts are before the committee.  There is nothing major therein for discussion, apart from one unusual item.  The first item is the National Library of Ireland, which has been given a clear audit opinion.  The Royal Irish Academy of Music has also been given a clear audit opinion, as has the Cork Institute of Technology.  Sligo Institute of Technology has been given a clear audit opinion but attention is again drawn to a severance payment which we dealt with in our most recent report.</p></speech>

This is occurring across the board.  It is being highlighted by ETBs. The need for internal audit has been recognised in that sector.</p> <p>  The next item is the Educational Research Centre, which receives a clear audit opinion.  Attention is drawn to the recognition of deferred pensions.  It is a new organisation in its second year of existence.  It has not yet formally adopted a code of practice of governance and the board did not carry out a review of the effectiveness of internal systems of internal control.  We will note that.</p></speech>

There is no turnover.  It is a fund established a number of years ago to receive donations from long-stay patients or their estates arising out of the overpayment of charges.</p> <p>  The next item is a special account established for the purposes of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act.  There is no turnover and a clear audit opinion.  The Environmental Protection Agency received a clear audit opinion.  It is on the work programme of the committee.</p> <p>  The HSE received a clear audit opinion, apart from the inadequate monitoring of grants and the issue of the surplus on capital income and expenditure account brought forward.  We examined the financial statements for 2017 last year.  For some reason, the HSE was late in lodging them with the Oireachtas but the committee has already examined them.</p> <p>  The next item is the University of Limerick, which received a clear audit opinion.  The Economic and Social Research Institute also received a clear audit opinion.  The HSE patient and private property accounts, clear audit opinion.  The HSE disclosed some inadequate controls of private property accounts in 2017, which was dealt with by the committee as part of our discussion of the 2017 accounts with the HSE.</p></speech>

A deferred pension issue again arises.  Dundalk Institute of Technology has also been given a clear audit opinion.  Again, however, internal control is an issue.</p><p>At least with the ETBs, we have gone from a situation where they were not producing accounts to a situation where they are now producing accounts.  We now know they have an internal audit function.  We are getting there with them.  That is all I will say.</p></speech>

When people from Dundalk were in here, their significant problems were well aired and discussed.  At the same time, we should note that they are coming through with a clear audit opinion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to certain aspects of that.  They have gone through a period of considerable change at their campus.  That is to be welcomed as well.</p></speech>

It was bad planning by the Government to set up organisations.  I have seen three or four cases.  We might have to deal with that.  Three years after they passed the legislation, they did not know which public bodies should be included under the public service pension scheme.  Where were they going?  There was a lack of planning when they drafted the legislation.</p></speech>

We can see where there was a lack of thought or planning in some of the amalgamations and things like that.  We are seeing where computer systems might not be compatible and that kind of stuff.

There were approximately 30 old bodies - I am not sure how many of them there were - and each of them had a different accounting system.  All of this was foreseeable.</p></speech>

In the case of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which specifies and monitors standards for the delivery of pre-hospital treatment, there was a clear audit opinion.

In the case of Sport Ireland, there was a clear audit opinion.  Other people are dealing with that organisation at the moment.  In the case of the Loughs Agency, there was a clear audit opinion.  In the case of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, there was a clear audit opinion.  Like all health bodies, it has its own accounting standards when it comes to superannuation.  In the case of Louth-Meath ETB, there was a clear audit opinion, although there was some non-compliant expenditure and the internal audit function was raised again.  We will move on.  The point about learning lessons in advance is the most important issue we have covered there.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  We will be very brief with the work programme now.  One or two changes have had to be made since we were last here, solely for logistical reasons.  Next week, representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality will be back to deal with the Vote of that Department.  There might be outstanding questions from the previous meeting.  On 11 April, we will be joined by representatives of the Central Statistics Office and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I assume that means the Comptroller and Auditor General's Accounting Officer will be here instead of the Comptroller and Auditor General that day.</p></speech>

It had been scheduled that the paediatric board would be here that day, but we did not want to do that.  We felt that we could slot in these two groups at relatively short notice.  The Central Statistics Office was meant to come here at an earlier date.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had already been provisionally mentioned.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be here the following week.  Then there will be two non-sitting weeks.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be back on 9 May.  There is a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report on the report and accounts to the public service on the management of overtime expenditure in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On 16 May, representatives of the paediatric hospital board will be here as part of their financial statements.  The Courts Service will be here on 23 May.  On 30 May, officials from the Department of Finance will be here.  A lot of Votes come under that Department.  On 13 June, we will consider the appropriation accounts of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We have said that we will deal with the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer.  There might be a little variation in our plans for some of the dates that are a little further way.</p></speech>

I said I felt we needed a substantial hearing with them to cover a lot of issues, including the surveillance issue.  The Chairman will recall one particular answer they gave.  They confirmed that private companies were procured for surveillance, but they were not in a position to state whether they were surveilling staff.  I felt that was an unreasonable response given that there is documentation in circulation that seems to prove, or certainly to strongly suggest, that such surveillance was taking place.  The answers to do with the mess committees, tuck shops, cash, money and a load of things certainly require more work.  I would certainly like to have them in.</p></speech>

I imagine that members would like to revisit some issues relating to the Prison Service.  I am certainly not comfortable with the mess committees.  I have been wrongly accused, externally, by the Prison Officers Association, of being interested in closing down the mess committees.  That is not the issue at all, but the concern is that they are functioning correctly with regard to cash management, oversight and auditing.  I am not happy that they are.  I believe there are also issues with the tuck shop and general governance of certain issues within prisons, and the level of knowledge that might pass between individual prisons and management in Longford.  I am not certain that the appropriate level of communication and oversight is taking place.</p></speech>

I have no idea of the answer to one point that Deputy MacSharry raises.  I would like to know how many of the senior management of the Prison Service in Longford have been governors or assistant governors.  In An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there are senior garda&iacute; at the most senior level as well as civilians.  Do we have several governors and people who know how to run prisons, none of whom is at a senior level in the organisation?  Is it effectively a Civil Service approach at a national level from people who may not have any knowledge of what is involved in running a prison?  How many of the senior management have been directly involved in the prisons?  It would be helpful to know.  There should be a mix of people in the headquarters who have direct experience at senior levels on management committees in prisons, as well as maybe those who are not former governors or assistant governors.  I think Deputy MacSharry's suggestion that we come back to that separately is probably the best approach.  We raised one or two issues earlier this morning that we need to follow up too.</p></speech>

Following our previous meeting with the Department, we met the following broadband service providers and representative organisations to inform members of the committee in respect of the topic: BT, Eir, Imagine, Enet and the Regional Internet Service Providers Association.  Members found it to be a useful exercise and this meeting will provide us with an opportunity to discuss the matter in further detail.  I apologise to Mr. Griffin and his colleagues for the late start.  Due to the celebrations for St. Patrick's week, the D&aacute;il did met for a week or two and there was a build-up of correspondence, which took a little longer to process.  We wanted to address that before we began this part of the meeting.</p><p>For context, broadband is an issue under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The topic of the previous meeting was the national children's hospital and we examined the major items of capital expenditure under the Government's capital plan, and broadband is one of the major projects in that regard.  Across the board, rather than just in the case of broadband or the children's hospital, the Committee of Public Accounts is examining the processes, procedures, governance and procurement in place in respect of such projects.  We have not been impressed to date but that is a matter for another day.  The committee has decided that, following our earlier meeting with the broadband provider and today's meeting, we will issue a report on broadband and housing, on which we have held a few meetings, as soon as practicable rather than waiting to include them in our periodic report, which is some months away.  As a result of today's meeting, we ask that witnesses revert with any information requested as soon as practicable because we want to complete our involvement in the project as soon as possible.</p><p>From the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we are joined by Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in, Ms Finola Rossi, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, Mr. Patrick Neary and Ms Orla Ryan.  We are also joined by Mr. Brendan Ellison from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off or switched to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent mode can nonetheless interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions under Standing Orders to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I understand that Mr. Griffin's opening statement will be short as it follows on from our previous meetings.  I invite him to make it now.</p></speech>

The benefit of the meeting is that it will give the committee the opportunity to follow up on some of the matters we discussed on 6 December and the detailed presentation it had from the telecommunications companies on 14 February, which we have studied.  In addition to the colleagues the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Ms Catherine McGinty, Ms Ciara Kennedy and Mr. Bernie Kiely.  We will deal with the national broadband plan, NBP, and I understand that there may be some follow-up questions on the metropolitan area networks, MANs, which we will be in a position to address.</p> <p>  As the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, the national broadband plan is a key Government commitment and a core component of Project Ireland 2040.  The State intervention under the NBP takes place against the backdrop of significant and rampant transformation of technology and digitalisation, which, in turn, is driving exponential growth in the demand for high-quality, reliable high-speed broadband.  Continued commercial investment, in parallel with the progression of the State&rsquo;s intervention, is important and the recent announcements by industry are welcomed.</p> <p>  Given the pace of developments, it is clear that the NBP network needs to be future proofed and capable of meeting increasing data demands, supporting new ways of working and new technologies.  In relation to data demand, it is notable that in quarter 4 of 2018, an average fixed broadband subscriber used 170 GB of data per month, which was a 17% increase on the same quarter in 2017 and more than double the volume of data used when compared with quarter 4 of 2015, when the procurement process for the NBP was commenced, which illustrates the exponential growth in data.  I did not include in my written statement one point that is notable when looking back over time, namely, that the last big State intervention we undertook, the national broadband scheme, was in 2008.  The maximum download speed under that scheme was 2.3 Mbps.  The state aid guidelines under which we ran the procurement process had a minimum download speed of 30 Mbps.  As we have indicated in the briefing note we sent to the committee, the Commission subsequently updated its outlook in relation to the future technology needs at an EU level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-28a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019032800002#M00800"><p>The European Commission.  It updated its perspective on what the future infrastructure requirements should be and stated that by 2025, the infrastructure should be capable of providing a download speed of 100 Mbps, while for schools, businesses and transport hubs, it should be capable of a download speed of 1 GB/s, which is a significant change, even over the past two years.</p> <p>  With the NBP, we are trying to provide the foundation for Ireland to meet Europe's 2025 targets for the creation of a gigabit society.  Widespread access to such connectivity, underpinned by a scalable, responsive and reliable digital infrastructure, is fundamental to maintaining and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness at this critical juncture, and will allow all citizens to embrace digital transformation to innovate, be creative and thrive, resulting in sustainable economic growth and positive social dividends.</p> <p>  Since I last appeared before the committee on 6 December, my Department has continued with the assessment of the final tender, and the Minister updated the Oireachtas on that yesterday.  That process is now reaching a conclusion and, as the Minister has indicated, he intends to bring a recommendation to the Government shortly.  The technology solution proposed by the bidder is predominantly fibre to the premises, FTTP, which is the same technology being rolled out by commercial companies in urban areas.</p><p>While the procurement did not specify the technology to be used, all three bidders proposed similar FTTP solutions.  As a result of the choice of fibre technology, the basic NBP wholesale entry product will be 150 Mbps download speed, with speeds of up to 1 GB available to businesses.  The FTTP solution ensures additional capacity can be added over time to meet future needs at low incremental cost.  The bid involves maximising reuse of existing pole and duct infrastructure across the country.  A wireless solution will likely be used for a small percentage of premises which are the most remote and difficult to reach.</p><p> The State-owned MANs infrastructure continue to play an important role in the regional telecommunications market.  The creation of the MANs as an exclusive fibre network facilitates service providers, large and small, in responding to the ongoing growth in demand for bandwidth capacity.  Some 70 service operators are using the MANs infrastructure in connection with the provision of fixed and mobile broadband services to over 1 million citizens and business customers, which include domestic fixed and mobile customers, State entities, educational institutions, SMEs, industrial estates and multinationals.  The MANs are an important element of the intervention area solution.</p><p> I am accompanied by officials who are experts on the technology issues, have been involved in the procurement process and understand the evolution of the project in recent years.  I will be deferring to some of them during the course of the meeting.  Rather than me acting as the voice for some of the expertise around the table, I believe the committee will get more value from these experts.  Looking back on the meeting of 14 February, there were issues around technology such as would 4G or 5G suffice.  We will share the workload to the extent we can.</p></speech>

I do not want to implicate any of my colleagues and I am not on the interview board.</p> <p>  At our meeting with service providers and representative organisations, BT suggested that it had first become aware of the fact that the MANs were prepared to be extended to the 2030 date from Parliamentary Questions Nos. 604 and 607 of 23 May 2017.  It highlighted that there was a process and that the Minister was considering extending it.  On the basis of that, BT wrote to express its interest in participating in that process and to formally register its interest as a bidder.  In correspondence, Mr. Brendan Whelan, a principal officer, wrote back on 4 August - the original letter was dated 15 June and the parliamentary questions were tabled in May - stating that it had effectively already extended this, that it was within its rights to extend it and that it was a case of "Thanks anyway".  BT further wrote back indicating that it was very disappointed with this and that it might have to go to the European Commission with some of its concerns on the matter.</p> <p>  Was there a parliamentary question from which BT could reasonably have been led to believe that a process was going to commence in which it could register its interest as a bidder?  As it alleged that the decision had already been made at the date of the response being given to the parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il, it would not seem transparent if the Minister was going to commence a process, or consider a process, when at that time the extension had already been granted.  That is the implication of the correspondence from Mr. Brendan Whelan on the Department&rsquo;s side and from Mr. John O&rsquo;Dwyer on the BT side.</p></speech>

If I look at the parliamentary question, to which the Deputy referred, there is a line in it which states, "I recently finalised decisions relating to the management of the MANs to provide that the current concession agreements co-terminate in 2030, in line with the relevant contractual provisions."  Effectively, the Minister stated that the decision had been taken to extend, as was provided for in the concession agreement.  As the Deputy knows, the concession agreement provided for an initial term of 15 years, extendable by a further ten years in the case of both lots of MANs, one which was commissioned in 2004 and the second which was commissioned in 2009.  Effectively, the termination date for the first was 2020 and the second was 2024.</p> <p>  We carried out a review and, as the Deputy will have heard me say back in December, the conclusion was that it was preferable for the State for a number of reasons that it would extend rather than retender.  That review was based on our internal analysis and it was supplemented by a report we commissioned from Norcontel which further reinforced the preliminary view to which we had come.</p> <p>  There was a consultation earlier in regard to how effective the MANs were, whether it was delivering services in rural Ireland in the manner which had been hoped and whether it was achieving the objectives in terms of providing service to the 70 or so service operators which use the MANs.  We consulted with several parties.  We did not consult the 70 or so but we consulted BT as part of that consultation process.  The view back from the process was that the MANs were performing, that they were working well as a concession agreement and that the State should not sell them, one of the options put on the table.</p> <p>  We had gone through an extensive process to consider the provision in the concession agreement which was whether to extend by a further ten years as provided for.  In the interests of transparency, it probably would have been preferable if at the time we had issued a press release to say we had done this.  The individual service operators would have understood it by virtue of their interaction with MANs as the concessionaire.  On reflection, it probably would have been preferable if, in May 2017 or a little bit earlier when we had concluded the decision-making process, we had issued a press release.  There was no good reason we did not do so but, on reflection, it would have been a sensible thing to do at that time to bring clarity to the wider stakeholder group.</p></speech>

It would have had a very good understanding of the market and would have looked at market conditions in detail.  It would have looked at the state of evolution of the fibre market at that time.  It would have looked at developments in the private sector and a range of other things that were on the telecoms landscape in Ireland at that time, and it would have factored that into its analysis.  Indirectly, therefore, we consulted the market.  We consulted earlier on its perspective on the MANs as a piece of State infrastructure.</p></speech>

All right.  The BT letter to us states:</p><blockquote>A key point we would like to make not addressed in the Analysys Mason report is that the European Commission State Aid Approval precluded the MSE (Managed Service Entity running the MANSs) from being owned or controlled by an authorised electronic communications operator.  This approach was adopted so that the provider of the MANs had the function of infrastructure provider to assist competition in the market rather than to directly compete with the market, which is what has happened.</blockquote></speech>

The decision that was taken in seeking an MSE was that existing operators were precluded from that competition.  The ambition was to get a new operator into the market in Ireland to strengthen competition and introduce more competition into the market.</p> <p>  Any operator or anybody providing electronic communications services in Ireland must be an authorised communications operator and must register with ComReg as such.  The only fair interpretation of this paragraph is that it is a statement that, at the outset of this process when seeking an MSE, the entity that would come forward to be an MSE could not at that time be an operator, but once it became an MSE, it could not operate the MANs without being an operator and it would so register with ComReg.  That is how that should be interpreted and I am not quite sure what BT's analysis around it would be because no entity could operate the MANs without being registered with ComReg.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at the list of MANs, there are some that are more commercial.  I think we have circulated the list previously to the Committee of Public Accounts secretariat.  I have a copy, myself.  The MANs were broken into phase 1 and phase 2.  Phase 1 covers more commercial areas where it was more likely that the MSE would be in a position to commercialise the business on the phase 1 MANs.  The phase 2 MANs, which were a further 60, were in areas that were deemed to be far less commercial.  For example - I will put my hands on the list in a minute - one of the last MANs on the phase 2 list was lit recently and that was in Knock.  It kind of gives the Deputy an idea of the scale of location being dealt with in phase 2.  There was a payment made for phase 2 of &euro;1.2 million per annum.</p></speech>

I cannot comment on the extent to which the deep dive was done on the individual budget lines by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important to say all of this was done by way of public procurement.  We have extended the contracts on one or two occasions in line with public procurement rules but we extended them on the basis of the original rates proposed in 2014.  That is of significant advantage to the Department.</p> <p>  The other important element on which to comment is the extent of internal management within the Department in governing those costs.  Much rigour is applied by colleagues sitting around the table here and by a big team we have in the Department to manage the budget, time sheets, requests for additional work, formal change control procedures and approvals of the quality of work delivered by the various consultancy teams.  I am happy the necessary due diligence within the Department is being done, given the levels of expenditure involved.  All the invoices are carefully scrutinised by the team and we require detailed narrative work to be carried out, including billable hours and all of that.  There is much rigour in place in the Department.</p></speech>

We went through public procurement and although it has been extended, we got legal advice on our authority to do it.  We have particularly put the squeeze on the consultants at each stage and one of the big benefits for us is the level of control we expect in terms of what they will deliver.  We are also working off 2014 rates and if anybody knows the consultancy business, the rates over the past number of years have gone through the roof.  That is helpful.  Nobody likes spending &euro;25 million but it is a big project.</p></speech>

On 27 February, the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that the cost of the national broadband scheme would be "many multiples" of what was originally anticipated.  He indicated, as Mr. Griffin did in his opening statement, that he expected the decision would be made before Easter.  The original indication in 2012 was that &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million would be the spread of anticipated expenditure.  That was to connect 800,000 homes and premises generally.  The Taoiseach has indicated it will be many multiples of those costs and we are now talking about 540,000 homes and premises.  Will Mr. Griffin shed some light on that?</p></speech>

He has been grappling with this at the coalface for the past three years.  The initial cost estimate cited of &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million was for a scheme of much narrower scope.  That scheme was announced in 2014 by the then Minister, former Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and it primarily took in providing fibre backhaul to approximately 1,100 areas, primarily villages, in rural Ireland, with the assumption being that the commercial sector would deal with what we termed the last mile.  That is a loose term as the distance could be much further or less than a mile.  It was a different scope and it was predominantly focused on fibre backhaul to these 1,100 locations.  It did not make provision for connection costs to individual premises.</p> <p>  As our own intervention strategy developed and we did further work on this, and again in consultation with the market, the view was that the scheme was not fit for purpose.  It was felt that a scheme that would provide a connection to individual premises in rural Ireland was absolutely critical.  I will not get into the cost estimates, if the Deputy allows me that latitude, because we are still in the procurement process.  The first cost estimate that was based on a high-level desktop analysis and it was a higher figure than the &euro;355 million to &euro;512 million estimate that was mooted.</p> <p>  There is another aspect and the Deputy might have heard reports from the National Transport Authority, NTA, in the media this morning.  We are talking about a bespoke project.  It is not like a road, where one could say a project would cost &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million per kilometre or a school where we might know the specification is for a particular size or number of classrooms.  This is a project which had no national comparators until Eir did its 300,000 premises, and there were very few international comparators.  As the chairman of the NTA said before a committee yesterday, it would not be able to put a cost on MetroLink until the final design is completed, and we have had the same experience.</p> <p>  We have used the competitive dialogue process as it allows us to engage directly with bidding parties.  It is used where projects are particularly complex and the target solution is not known at the outset.  It allows engagement with these parties' understanding of what the requirements are, as well as their market knowledge and experience of projects both nationally and internationally.  The cost framework has been complicated to an extent by Eir's 300,000 premises taking a chunk of homes from the intervention area but as part of that evolutionary process, our understanding of the likely subsidy levels, the technology, construction and operation costs, demand, revenue projection, risks and so on all evolve.  We are now satisfied that we know the figure.</p><p>We have constantly updated our models.  Will I let the expert who is in the bowels of this-----</p></speech>

During the questioning Mr. Griffin can tease out what he is going to say.  My final question arises from the debacle of the national children's hospital.  Would he be prepared to give a ballpark figure for how many multiples the Taoiseach might have been talking about, notwithstanding that he cannot give us details of the tender or the like?  A ballpark figure to the nearest couple of hundred million of euro might give us an indication.</p> <p>  Second, taking the example of the national children's hospital, there appears to be a crisis in accountability to the extent that even though Mazars did a report we now need another one from PwC to find out whose fault it was that prices went up exponentially.  Where does the buck stop on the NBP?  Let us say, hypothetically, somebody is before the committee two years hence and the programme goes over budget by 70%.  Will a PwC report be required then or is there a structure in place, given what one hopes is the lesson of the national children's hospital, where Mr. Griffin is in absolute control?  Who is the chief executive over this?  In the case of the national children's hospital, it appears that neither the Minister, the chairman of the board, the development board, the HSE or anybody else had an executive role.  Everybody seems to have been non-executive and there was a blurring of the lines of responsibility.  We know the outcome, but we do not know who is responsible.  Does the Department have a structure in place whereby if the wheels come off this project it is Mr. Griffin's, John's, Mary's or the Minister's fault?</p></speech>

We have the leadership role.  There is no secondary entity involved at a level below where we can say it is that entity.

The money will come directly from the Department's Vote.  We have looked at governance arrangements to be put in place after the contract award and we are still at the early stages of that.  The last programme for Government referred to setting up an agency that would pull together the NBP, the MANs, ECAS and perhaps some other State infrastructure of a broadband nature under a single State entity so it could be managed by the right people who have the right commercial skills and can generate maximum value for the State.  All of that will require legislation.  However, as things stand, the responsibility for this project rests with the Department.</p></speech>

As part of that assessment - and the Department is overseeing that work - has the option of not proceeding with the plan been examined and is it one of the options that was contained in the overall assessment that will then go to the Government?

The primary operator is Eir which has a vast number of poles and ducts which are available.  The vast majority of the Eir network in rural Ireland is overhead and carried on poles.  As part of our tender, we have encouraged bidders to use existing infrastructure and it is very likely that any deployment of fibre to homes in rural areas will primarily use the overhead poles for telecommunications infrastructure.</p></speech>

I do not think I am breaching any confidences in saying we are talking here about approximately 14,000 km of duct being used and approximately 1.2 million poles.  That gives one an idea of the scale of the roll-out.  On the maps we circulated with the briefing to the committee, when one looks at the areas we are trying to get to, most if not all are remote and not being served by the commercial sector.  There are no plans to have them served by the commercial sector.  We will reuse very substantial chunks of existing infrastructure and there will be new build by the bidder also.</p></speech>

The rules that apply at both national and EU level require providers of major infrastructure to allow their infrastructure to be used in certain circumstances.  The whole thesis of the national broadband plan intervention area is that we reuse as much as we can.  In some places, that may involve the reuse of ESB infrastructure.  We have approximately 1,000 different deployment areas of approximately 5,000 premises each.  When we get to the low-level design for each area, we will discuss with the contractor what is the most economical way to roll out broadband in that particular area.</p></speech>

I hope I am right in answering the question, but if I am not, I will get others to correct me.  It will not be the first time it has done so.  Under state aid rules, we are obliged to go through a public procurement process, which we did.  Indirectly through SIRO, its joint venture with Vodafone, the ESB was one of the original bidders.  Its focus was primarily on using its own network and it might well have used existing Eir infrastructure.  As such, the ESB was on the pitch.  For reasons it set out publicly at a later stage, it decided to withdraw from the process.  There has been some public commentary in the media and in the Oireachtas about simply assigning this function to a State undertaking.  That cannot be done under state aid or EU procurement rules.</p></speech>

Mr. Griffin is right when he says this is a bespoke and unique project.  At the same time, there are very few households in the country that are not connected to the ESB.  From a layman's perspective, it would have made sense, given that it will be difficult to create a new layer of infrastructure, to use the ESB.  Most observers would say the ESB's bid was not a serious one.  That is just an opinion that is offered up by some analysts.  Am I oversimplifying matters by saying that if the vast majority, if not all, homes have access to the ESB, there is obviously infrastructure there which it would have made sense to use to ensure broadband could be rolled out to every home and property in the country?  The difficulty is that we need to get to that position but are now creating a whole new set of infrastructure which is creating problems.  Into the mix also come the 300,000 homes Eir took out of the original plan which has complicated matters even more and potentially rendered the proposition non-viable.  That is why we are down, potentially, to one bidder.</p></speech>

Under EU state aid rules, one cannot simply assign a contract which may involve significant state aid support to a commercial economic undertaking without a procurement process.  We took that step and SIRO withdrew from the process.</p></speech>

As such, there is still nothing going forward under any solution that prevents anybody from using the ESB.  Its door is open as is ours.  Eir is regulated and the ESB Networks company has products, etc., available.  In the context of the understanding that everyone has an ESB connection, most people also have a copper connection from Eircom.  There are two infrastructure networks in place that were traditionally serving very different purposes, namely electricity supply and the old landline phone.  Both infrastructures remain in place.  In June or July 2016, the bidders started on the road of procurement after they qualified.  We have had major engagement with one particular entity since Eircom left.  When we had three bidders in the process, we spent over 800 hours in dialogue with each bid team.  Between July 2016 and September 2017, when SIRO left, the Vodafone and ESB team involved in the bid spent 150 to 200 hours going through how to use the ESB network.  With the Eir bid team, the discussion was on how to use the Eir network.  With the other consortium, it was about whatever network they chose to use.  Obviously, each bidder had a bias towards its own network.</p><p>We learned through all that process whether one could use it, whether it was cost-effective to do so and what represented the best value to the State.  As we know, Eircom's pole network goes along the road and the ESB's network goes across country.</p><p> We can come to this later but the most important thing in any capital project is to find out first how one designs it.  If one chooses a particular design, that will dictate which cable one is going to use to get into the house.  If one goes along the road with the Eircom pole network, and one is going up a laneway to a farm, it may not be possible to use the ESB network, if it is coming in behind the farm.  One just cannot jump from the road over to the field to get onto the ESB network.  It is not quite as simple, technically, as using the ESB connection to the house to do the last mile.  These are the issues about which we have had dialogue to find this out.  There are some homes that have the ESB network going along the road as well, and if during the build - if the current bidder is successful in getting the bid and is building it - it may have the opportunity to get to that farm using the ESB network, if there is not an Eircom pole network there already.  That will be its choice, depending on what is the most cost-effective solution.  All of these issues are on the table at the moment.</p></speech>

It agrees with very few, where they have been implemented.  I refer to a couple of examples.  Number two was that Enet should update its assumptions used in preparing the desktop survey.  It states that it has no visibility of this activity.  Number four states that Enet and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment should discuss price changes for dark fibre sub-duct and duct, which will ensure that wholesale customers will not find it more expensive.  It states that it has no visibility on these discussions.  It further states that Enet should make single strands of dark fibre available.  It notes the introduction of this.  Number six states that Enet should document all its discounting schemes to ensure that it offers the same type and level of discounts to all requesting customers.  It states that it has no visibility of this documentation.  Again, right down through all of these it states that there is no visibility of the evidence of this or of the activity.  In a detailed reading of this, we can see that it does not accept that the implementations which it states have been made have actually been made.  Can Mr. Griffin respond to these issues or has he given us a response?</p></speech>

To return to an issue that just occurred to me when Mr. Griffin was dealing with last issue, on the ESB infrastructure, I understand what Mr. Mulligan said about the direction that the infrastructure would come from.  He gave the example of some premises that might be some distance away from the actual poles.  Would 4G or wireless technology not be a solution in instances where that might have been a problem?</p></speech>

I am a mere accountant and not an engineer.  My simple answer to that is that it very much depends on where one is in Waterford, Wicklow or Kerry.  Is one in line-of-sight to a mast on the nearest hill?  Again, that is something that has been looked at in detail across every townland in this country.</p></speech>

There may be poles on the road or the ESB network may be behind it farm, but it may still not be cost-effective to get a fibre to that farm and a wireless solution may be used if there is a base station somewhere in the proximity that gives it the service quality that we are saying is required, which is at least 30 Mbps.</p></speech>

I am going to look at metropolitan area networks, MANs, and the national broadband plan.  I will turn to MANS first.  Back in 2008, the Comptroller and Auditor General did a report with which the witnesses are probably familiar.  Whoever the Comptroller and Auditor General was at that time talked about slow uptake and he pointed out certain things that he discovered.  The Department was on notice that there were issues with MANs.  I want an update on the uptake of MANs.  If the Department does not have it to hand, I would like to receive it in writing later.</p> <p>  On the report we received, this is all about accountability.  I am not here to ask about fibre or dark fibre, but to ask about value for money and the processes.  When we had a meeting on 14 February, the Analysys Mason report was handed to us.  That report was from March 2018.  Why, for openness and accountability, was this not published quickly in March 2018 and not in February 2019?  On that day, there was a certain cynicism because prices had reduced significantly when this was published.  Why was this not published immediately, given the seriousness of the complaints made and what was stated in this report?  Can I have a simple answer as to why this was not published?  Does the fault lie with Department, the Government or the Minister?  Who does it lie with?</p></speech>

Some 70 service operators are using the MANs.

Within the Department's processes, would what subsequently emerged in the Mason report not have been clear?  It raised serious issues.  It mentions a number of options and recommends one.

The view that came back was that the MANs were operating effectively and performing well so, by extension, one could conclude from that the concessionaire itself was doing a good job on the MANs.  It met all its annual investment obligations to extend the MANs and met all its key performance indicators, KPIs.  We had three complaints out of a pool of 70 service operators.  At that stage, we flagged our intention to undertake a detailed review which we had commissioned Analysys Mason to do, to look at pricing issues.  It is important when looking at the Analysys Mason report to look closely at what it says.</p></speech>

There was difficulty with separation between two sister companies.  There are four options.  One is to separate them completely and it does not go down that road.  There were very clear issues.  They are not just minor issues or areas for improvement.  They are all about transparency and accountability, and giving maximum information.</p></speech>

When one looks at the detail of the report, it was only in exceptional circumstances, because of competition in the market, that Enet used that maximum price.  To respond to the point that the Deputy is trying to make, we recognise that there are deficiencies.  There are 13 recommendations with 11 implemented.  The key bit is what the Minister has referred to ComReg to look at, which is that if there is an issue with regard to transfer pricing arrangements between Enet and ETNL-----</p></speech>

It will be published in due course.  The reason it has not been published yet is because since 2015, which is four years ago, there have been six versions of that because every time the map changed, from 757,000 initially, to 540,000 now, we needed to change it.  The main reason is because there is substantial information in there with regard to the cost of fibre, ducting, subcontractor prices and so on which are highly sensitive to the market.  We would eventually publish the much fuller details if a Government decision is made.</p><p>The analysis is going through a final iteration with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is a concluding process; it is not finished yet.  When the Government decision is made, that is the conclusion of the CBA process.</p></speech>

There are many other cost benefit analyses because clearly, that is right.  Things change and the map reduces as somebody pulls out.  There is no cost benefit analysis for us or the public to see, however.  I am going to park that for the moment.  When the cost benefit analysis was done, was it on the basis of 800,000 premises?</p></speech>

We hear every day of the week that companies cannot get contracts from public bodies in Ireland because their turnover in the previous few years was not at a certain level.  The officials will be familiar with that.  It is a very basic question.</p><p>The Department is proposing to sign a contract with a company which does not even exist yet but will be incorporated in some solicitor's firm which, by definition, will have no previous business or turnover by which it can be judged.  It may be judged based on who its shareholders are, but the company, if it has no turnover, would not be eligible to apply to build a single local authority house in Ireland because it would not meet the previous turnover requirement.  That is a basic thing that public bodies do.  How is it that a company that does not exist is likely to get this award with no previous turnover?  The witnesses may think that a strange question but it is one the public will ask.  I will park that question and the witnesses can come back to it.</p></speech>

Ireland has one of the most expensive State-owned broadband networks in Europe.  The Minister issued a press statement after the Analysys Mason report was produced.  The headline issue identified in that statement was that there was a 50% reduction to &euro;2.60 per metre.  We saw the response from BT to some of the points in the Analysys Mason report.  The Minister referred that issue of pricing to ComReg and it was an issue on which it had no responsibility previously.  I subsequently met a number of providers that are wholesale entities, so to speak.  I asked if the reduction was of benefit to them and they said they had got quotes after the announcement of the reduction and, lo and behold, those quotes contained increases, rather than reductions, in price.  There is something fairly serious happening here because the end user will pay for this.  I continue to be dissatisfied with the lack of transparency and whether there is a real effort to get to grips with price here because one of the determinants for the take-up of the service will be price.  We need to look at what is happening with the MANs.  The witnesses might comment on that to begin with.</p></speech>

There is a remark on page 20 of the Analysys Mason report, referring to dark fibre, that states that the analysis shows that price per metre is strongly affected by the term of the contract and the proportion of the MAN distance used.  I do not know if the providers who approached the Deputy are comparing like with like in terms of offers and if the project is the same as was originally costed.</p></speech>

I will suggest that they make a complaint because that seems to be needed to trigger someone to take a look at it.  There is a real issue with cost here because we are out of line.</p></speech>

There is a company called Enet in Limerick which employs 100 people and I want to ensure that the engagement on both sides of the table reflects the factual position as well as possible.  The Analysys Mason report made comparisons between the price of dark fibre for Enet and ComReg and used international comparators.  It stated that benchmarks of dark fibre prices are not widely available.  Dark fibre wholesale offers are not common, and those that are available do not have published prices.  Analysys Mason had to go to Sweden because of the absence of good national comparators and said that the prices vary according to different areas of the country.</p></speech>

The total that the State has spent on MANs so far is &euro;176 million.  That was a piece of information given to us by the chief executive officer of Enet.  The revenue share represents about 5% of a return over the past 15 years.  When we discussed this previously, one of the reasons for not going to tender was because investments were being made by Enet and there was a return to the State which represents about 5% over 15 years, which is not a sizeable return.</p> <p>  The State was paid &euro;8.8 million in revenue from 2004.  It is not a huge amount of money.  Looking at that and listening to Eir, which I accept is a commercial entity with a parallel fibre network, it was fully expecting to see a competitive process for the concession contracts and they were done earlier than anticipated.  In hindsight, has the return to the State been sufficient that a competitive process was not required?  Is it a question of how the Department handled the communication or is there something more than that?</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Connolly, it would have been preferable if we had been clearer around the outcome of the extend versus retender issue.  One must look at why the MANs were set up because they are a unique offering.  Some 84 or 85 are rings within towns, some of them large and some of them small.</p><p>It can be because the take-up was low or having to operate on a commercial basis to generate additional take-up.  The reason we went to look at the extend versus retender option was not to do with their having invested &euro;30 million.  We did a very detailed analysis around performance but also on what would be the right thing for the market in terms of whether we would extend or retender.  The Norcontel report covers some of that.  It is clear that, leaving aside the financial aspects, several qualitative and quantitative outcomes were identified which would give greater certainty to telecoms operators on the availability of the MANs infrastructure.  That would allow them to draft their own investment plans.  We were entering a time where there was very substantial change, which can be seen both from the private sector investment and our own work in the period under review. </p></speech>

There were entities that were interested in quoting and expected an announcement.  I am surprised that it happened as early as it did because there was some time to run.  I expect people need a lead-in time to make investments and so on.  What would have been the downside to going to tender and making sure there was a testing in the marketplace?</p></speech>

Second, if one goes to a retender and does not emerge with a successful solution, the only option is to return to the existing incumbent who will have one over a barrel because he will know the tender process has failed.  Therefore, the prospect of being able to negotiate what had been negotiated originally, which was a &euro;21 million extra return to the Exchequer, would be absolutely and utterly off the table.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the national procurement framework.  Contracts and agreements are written in a particular way.  This was written in, crystal clear, that after the first 15 years of the contract, it was open to the contract authority to secure an extension of up to ten further years.  That was there from 2004 when we had the first concession agreement.  It was replicated in 2009 for the other MANs.  To be honest, if I came before the Committee of Public Accounts in 12 months, or even now, and I said I had a report from Norcontel stating this was the most preferable option, we had done some preliminary desk work which found we would accrue &euro;21 million in extra benefit and we would provide greater certainty to the telecom operators and the sector, but we decided to go in another direction-----</p></speech>

The report is written in a very balanced way.  It does not say that prices at reduced or reasonable levels were not available to service operators.  The criticism is primarily, as I read it, that it needs to be better documented.  It appears that perhaps there is an issue about the transfer pricing arrangements between Enet and ETNL.  We need to bottom out on that.  We will look at that but ComReg has been commissioned to undertake that work by the Minister and will produce a report.  As I said, the Deputy should not take the set of recommendations that issued on foot of the report as the last word.  We will constantly evaluate whether the recommendations are being implemented.  We will take further feedback from BT, which is a customer and a competitor of Enet, and from other entities.  We will review this on an ongoing basis.  The Analysys Mason report refers to the need for a further review within a two-year period.</p></speech>

The lack of a competitive process is highly problematic.  I appreciate that this is a bespoke process that we will not undertake a second time.  However, the process has the same feel to it as that of the national children's hospital.  What specific safeguards can be put in place to ensure delivery?  It is not just a question of awarding the tender.  The plan must be delivered within a timeframe.</p> <p>  When the natural gas network was being established, if, for argument's sake, 20 households in a housing estate wished to avail of gas, that would be sufficient to warrant putting a gas pipeline through the estate.  Other households could then join the network at a later point.  I appreciate that it is possible for people to connect to a network subsequently.</p><p>What timeline is allowed for people to connect up to it?  Will that be specified in any tendering process?  The original suggestion of the amount of money it would cost being a fraction of what it will cost is an issue of serious concern given that the number of households that require to be connected is fewer now than the number talked about when that original amount, albeit a desktop exercise, was suggested.  If there are 300,000 fewer households that require to be connected but it will still cost multiples more, how could the desktop exercise have got it so wrong?  Mr. Griffin might talk us through that.</p></speech>

When we look at procurement processes, it is not unusual for certain projects to find oneself in a situation where one only has a single bidder at the end.  If we look at the equivalent of the UK in terms of its national broadband plan, it received only one bid at the end.  It was from BT, the final company that was participating in the process.  Fujitsu pulled out before submitting a final bid.  It is not unusual and it is not ideal.  We will be perfectly upfront on that.</p> <p>  Going back to the value for money point, we have used a competitive dialogue process which allows us do a helicopter move and circle in and reiterate as more evidence becomes available.  We have done significant market engagement.  We have interrogated various proposals from the three bidders.  It has allowed us deepen our understanding of likely subsidy levels, technology, construction operation costs and demand revenue projections.</p> <p>  The other important point to bear in mind, and this is very useful to us from a comparison perspective, is that at the penultimate stage before receipt of final bids and before Eir withdrew from the proposal, which is known as the invitation, submit, detailed submissions, ISDS, stage, we had two bidders submit proposals which included their financial estimates of the cost of the project.  That was very helpful to us in terms of the comparisons to be made.</p> <p>  We have got modelling expertise from ComReg.  We have looked at international models.  We have got a separate report from KPMG which looks at how to engage, based on national and international best practice, and value for money in the context of a single bidder assessment.  That will form part of the valuation that will be submitted to Government.</p> <p>  The other point-----</p></speech>

As we pointed out, fibre to the home or fibre to business is fantastic but fibre to cabinet or a wireless solution can be equally as good depending on one's proximity to that network, the quality of that network and the price of it.  All those things are factored in.  In terms of any hotel or business, depending where it is in any part of Ireland, outside the intervention area, that is the competitive environment we are in.  In the blue and light blue areas people have a raft of choices.  It is the amber area in which the issue resides and that is what we are trying to address.</p></speech>

From my short studies on it, it only works where there is not clogging up of the system, the weather is good, the leaves are not on the trees and the wind is blowing in the right direction.  I know there are businesses that it suits.  Many businesses in Dublin fall into that category where they have wireless masts on the side of buildings to ramp up the speed.</p> <p>  In terms of what we are trying to achieve here, and the Chairman spoke about people at home watching these proceedings, I believe it is something monumental.  We are trying to put down fixed cable infrastructure to serve the country into the future but it is a bit like the gas analogy.  People may not want or require it in their homes today but they may want it as technology advances, our fridges start talking to us and we have all these advances that apparently will happen.  My understanding is that once the proper cable broadband infrastructure is laid down or up, as the case may be, they may not need it today but in 15 years' time the capacity exists to expand for those requirements.  Mr. Griffin might explain that to the committee because much of it has been lost in the idea that we are trying to provide Netflix for everyone.  We are not trying to provide Netflix for everyone.  We are trying to provide an infrastructure that leaves people in Carlow, Ballyferriter and Tyrrellspass as connected as people in Dublin.  My understanding is that regional development can happen and not be in any way inhibited by lack of access to proper cable and that we will not have a company coming in and telling people their broadband will work perfectly fine once there are no leaves on the trees, they are on flat ground and the wind is blowing in the right direction.  Mr. Griffin might outline that for the committee.</p></speech>

The comparison I like to make and with which all of us are familiar is that we built the M50 with two lanes.  There are now four lanes on each side and it is still massively congested.  The N7 is a disaster zone because we are putting on additional capacity.</p> <p>  One can take a short-term or a long-term perspective on this.  We have taken a long-term perspective over a 25-year period.  One of the fundamental issues for us is the technology we can put in place that will guarantee that in 25 years' time, irrespective of what happens between now and then, and we know there will be massive developments in terms of the ask of the public and businesses, including virtual and augmented reality, automated driving, remote surgery, artificial intelligence and precision farming, we will have a technology to cater for that.</p><p>We will not have to go back in a second time.  We sometimes have a particular problem in the provision of infrastructure.  In 2008, we thought that download speeds of 2.3 Mbps under the national broadband scheme were cutting edge, but by the time we started, it was out of date.  However, this project will endure.</p><p> It is interesting to see the assessment that was made as to what one does in rural areas.  One must look to what is happening in urban areas and the decision by Eir in the past few weeks to have a fibre overlay in all major cities and towns across the country.  That will involve fibre to the home, not a cabinet.  Siro, which has been assisted through the NBP process by virtue of the fact that the State brought forward legislation, is bringing fibre to the home.  The question we must ask ourselves as administrators and politicians is whether we want to put something in place in rural Ireland that is sub-optimal and will simply further exacerbate the urban-rural digital divide.  Even though we were technology neutral, we are clear that the fibre to the premises technology proposed by the bidder - interestingly, by all bidders - is the right direction to allow future proofing to be guaranteed.</p><p> There is a further statistic that may be of interest.  The European Union did some work when it was scoping out the direction of travel up to 2025.  Some 59% of respondents think they will need fixed download speeds of 1 Gbps in 2025, with only 8% of respondents saying they will need download speeds below 100 Mbps.  It is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

One does not expect those 300,000 people to need it today, but they may need it in the future.  As such, it is a pointless analysis.</p></speech>

That leads to a reduction in commutes and the associated frustrations and difficulties for families and children.  One must consider the social dividend of that.</p></speech>

On the bidder, the team he has coalesced around him - all of whom are Irish apart from one individual - and who have taken part in the bid process have massive experience across the telecoms sector in Ireland.  They have had significant responsibilities in rolling out national telecoms networks in various countries, delivered 170,000 km of fibre across 56 private projects and managed or delivered &euro;30 billion in contracts business values.  These are big hitters.  We would not be comfortable as a Department in putting forward a solution unless we had faith in the entity.  The other thing it is important to say is that the evaluation process as part of the final bid assessment looks at all of these issues, including the capacity of the bidder and its technical ability to deliver a project on this scale.</p></speech>

We have spent 800 or 900 hours working with the engineers.  I am back to the issue of who can deliver this project.  On our side, there have been ten or 20 experts in attendance at each meeting with the opposition - the three bidders - with ten or 20 commercial, technical and legal experts.  The technical experts with whom we dealt across all the bidders, including the remaining bidder, are people who worked for 30 or 40 years on the Eircom network or a Vodafone network.  They are all Irish-based engineers with 20, 30 or 40 years of experience.  One of the head experts on the side of the bidder with whom I deal every day started off in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and built the Eircom network.  That is the type of person on the current bid team.  Obviously, people moved around in various companies.  We are not dealing with people who have just flown in from New York and are telling us how to build a network here.  They are indigenous, home-based people who have worked on the Irish networks, mobile and fixed, for the past 30 years.</p></speech>

How will that work when a contract has been awarded?  I would consider these things, such as scope for movement on certain issues, to be a nightmare for investors.   At the end of the day, investors want a return on their money.  How do these penalties and so on fit into a contract?  The witnesses may respond after we break for lunch.  I am concerned about a contract being signed with this company that obviously has lots of expertise and, based on the evidence that has been given, seems to be capable of doing the job, but that when we say we want clawback and penalties it will respond, "On your bike.  You need us."  What protection exists in that regard?</p></speech>

At that time, the draft contract was based on the best available contracts we could get from the UK, where it has run broadband contracts, and the initial broadband scheme contract.  After nearly two and a half years of negotiating with almost every senior legal house in Dublin and across the water, the contract currently runs to 1,500 pages.  Within it is the governance of this for 25 years.  That includes the requirement that the operator must pass and connect every home in the intervention area.  It is very much a contract that requires connections.  The subsidy includes connecting every home in the intervention area where a consumer seeks a connection, be it in year 1 or year 25.  That is the contract.  It is based on when people want it, to go back to the gas analogy.  When people will want to connect to the network is a critical issue.  When will Mary Murphy or Jimmy Doherty want a connection?  It might be in 2020 or 2025.  We predict that in our modelling and the bidder is predicting it in its modelling.  That demand may occur sooner or later than expected, but we know generally that people will connect to this network because it will probably be the only network available in the next 25 years.  People may have a choice.  If demand exceeds our expectations, the clawback would kick in.  In the event that the scheme is hugely successful, there may be far more profit in the contract than we ever envisaged.  In that context, the contract has within it specific percentages regarding exactly how much would be clawed back and recouped by the State.  That has been agreed with the existing bidder as we are concluding the tender process,  There are three clawback mechanisms.  There is one for any cost savings, whereby we recoup any money the operator expected to spend but did not spend.</p><p>Second, there is a mechanism if they make more profits than they ever thought they would.  Third, there is a mechanism for us to find out at the end of the contract whether the business has a value.  There are significant clawbacks to the State within the contract.  They apply to all bidders.  Again, all of this was subject to huge negotiation over the past two or three years.  The point has been made that if we look for too much clawback, they will look for too much money.  All of that has been concluded.  It is significant.  By the time the contract is signed, there is no change to that.  They are locked into that and they must do it whenever those accounts are ready.</p></speech>

I apologise if I ask questions that go back over ground that has already been covered.  We are all asking questions about competition.  According to the old saying, competition is the life of trade.  We started out with five or six companies that were supposed to be interested in the national broadband plan, but that number dwindled down to four, three, two and eventually one.  Is the Secretary General happy that we are down to one?  As I have said, competition is the life of trade.  Would it be better if there were two or three bidders and the Department could use one against the others to try to get the best value for taxpayers' money?  I would like Mr. Griffin to comment on that.  I know this question has probably been asked several times already.</p></speech>

There have been cases in this country and overseas in which just one bidder remained at the final stage of a project.  For example, there was just one final bidder at the end of the UK equivalent of the national broadband plan.  The other bidder dropped out at the last moment.  We had to figure out what to do in the circumstances we found ourselves in.  We looked at what we did over the course of the procurement process to ensure value for money was guaranteed.  The procurement process we had engaged in involved competitive dialogue.  This kind of process is used for bespoke projects when the technical scope of the project - what the final network design will look like - is not fully known.  It allows one to engage with the bidders in the process in looking at things like subsidy levels, technology, construction and operating costs, demand and revenue projections.  It was helpful for us that there are a number of different stages in the competitive dialogue process.  During the penultimate stage, which was the ISDS stage, we got two bids - one from the final bidder and one from Eir.  This gave us a chance to compare the bids and the factors taken into account, etc.  We had something to compare against.  The other useful thing from our perspective is that we did a great deal of financial and technical modelling during the procurement process.  We used models that ComReg uses for regulated services.  We looked at models that are used internationally.  A great deal of financial modelling was done by the Department and its advisers, KPMG.  At the final stage of the process, we asked KPMG to compile a report which would assess the position with regard to value for money, for want of a better term, when there is just one bidder.  The other important component is making sure we have robust post-contract governance arrangements, the suite of protections Mr. Mulligan and I have mentioned, the performance indicators, the penalties, the oversight arrangements, the checkpoint reviews, the clawback provisions, the stand-alone board which is responsible for the-----</p></speech>

The winning bidder who is successful will have to design, build and manage the network.  That means it will all be built in the first stage, whatever number of years that takes.  We know that people will iteratively and incrementally connect to the network.  People will connect as each area is built from the top of the country to the bottom.  It is inevitable that many new homes will be built over the coming 15 or 20 years.  We are requiring the winning bidder to honour the contract for 25 years so that this company is required to connect someone who builds a new house, someone who does not get a broadband service until the tenth year, for whatever reason, or someone who moves house.  It will be a contracted connection.</p></speech>

We expect that whoever is building this network will use the most cost-efficient solution to get maximum value for money.  At the moment, the proposition is that the best and most cost-effective solution involves the use of Eircom poles.  Those poles are fully regulated by ComReg, which oversees how they are used, as well as the monthly or yearly charges that Eircom is allowed to charge for poles and ducts.  They are fully regulated and will continue to be.</p></speech>

That bidder will have many subcontracts with infrastructure providers, including Eircom.  If it decides to use the ESB in certain instances, it will have a contract with the ESB.  It will have contracts with Enet and others.  If it uses towers and masts, it will have contracts in respect of them.  They have been in discussions with many providers, including Eircom, for the past two years.  There are very substantial subcontract agreements and rental agreements in place for 25 years.

It has set out the requirement to bring a high-quality, reliable broadband service to rural people, with a minimum download speed of 30 Mbps and a minimum upload speed of 6 Mbps.  We set that out and we want it to be future-proofed so it is fit for purpose over 25 years.  At the table, during the process of procurement, three large consortia of experts came forward with their proposals.  Through that engagement and with our own advice and expertise, we have examined all technologies.  We have examined fibre to the home, wireless technology, satellite technologies and how they could be deployed in the most efficient manner in the areas we are talking about.  That has taken probably two years, end to end.  Throughout that period, however, the bidders have concluded the best solution is predominantly fibre to the home.</p></speech>

The representative said that if there are good copper lines &ndash; many of them are old &ndash; up to 80 Mbps or 100 Mbps could be achieved.  Are these lines all to be replaced with the fibre-optic lines?  It sounds phenomenal to me.  It involves an awful lot of money.</p></speech>

The line from the cabinet out to the house is copper.  That is the solution Eir has deployed in the cities and suburban areas.

In the UK and Germany, it is fibre to the premises.  In France, all the commercial operators are bringing fibre to the premises, as is the case in Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Norway.  The horse being backed by the commercial operators in Ireland and internationally is a fibre-to-the-premises solution.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il - I have asked about this a few times - the final cost will be a multiple of the original.  Could the witnesses shed any light on that?  Owing to the furore over expenditure on the national children's hospital, many believe there is a waste of money.  What will the final figure be?  Have they any idea?  Will it be a multiple of what we are talking about now?</p></speech>

That is a very important distinction to make.  We have not spent money other than on the advisory services we use to assist us in developing the overall approach.  We have not spent money on a building.  It is different from the children's hospital in that respect.  The cost will be a lot higher than what we had-----</p></speech>
