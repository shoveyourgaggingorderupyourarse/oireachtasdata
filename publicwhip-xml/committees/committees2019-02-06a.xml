    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#A00200"><p>We have received apologies from Deputy Cullinane and Senator Craughwell.  I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  It is important because it causes serious problems for the broadcasting and editorial staff.</p><p>Today the committee will engage with Mr. Juan Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s, director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, on the work of the foundation.  I am delighted to welcome Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s and his officials to the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs.  The foundation is the only EU-based agency in Ireland and has been doing essential work for many years in helping us to understand the trends in industries, working conditions, labour markets and what life is like for Europeans and all those living in Europe.  This information can be essential for policy-makers like us in order to understand the structures that exist and help us to tailor any changes to improve the lives of our citizens.  I met the director six months ago and had a very interesting engagement.  I am looking forward to this engagement today.  The foundation has been very good in sending the committee copies of its reports and other publications, which I am sure all members found very informative and helpful.  We find the reports of great use to us in doing our work.  I again welcome Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s and his officials.  We are delighted to have them at the committee and the members and I look forward to hearing about the work of the foundation.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are about to give to the committee.  If they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and they continue to do so, they are only entitled thereafter to qualified privilege in respect of the evidence they give.  They are directed that only evidence concerned with today's proceedings is to be given to the committee and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an entity or a person either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s to make his presentation.  Members will ask questions and make comments afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Juan Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is a real privilege to be in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is the third time that I have been given the opportunity to be at the committee.  The other occasions were during the previous legislative period.  I would like to share with the committee some of the information and findings from our work at Eurofound.  The good news for the members is that I will not speak about Brexit as I think they have had enough of that.  The bad news is that I will bombard the members with a lot of information that may require us to jump a little from one topic to the next without time to go into all of them in depth.</p><p>I hope, however, that we can give more detail on some of them during the question and answer session.</p><p> As the Chairman mentioned, ours is the only EU agency based in Ireland and Ireland and Germany were the first two countries to have an EU agency.  The agencies were established in 1975.  We have since operated in Dublin where we have our headquarters.  We have a small office in Brussels where we have a relatively large number of meetings but we have only a few rooms and facilities there.  Our budget is &euro;20 million per annum which some think is too small, while others think it is too big.  Not counting external contractors, there are approximately 100 staff members contracted directly with Eurofound.  One of the peculiarities of our agency is that we use a shamrock to symbolise our tripartite governance structure.  The management board consists not only of the European Commission and the Irish Government which is represented by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but also the two social partners, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The same is true for each member state.  There is also an independent expert appointed by the European Parliament. </p><p> Our mission is to provide knowledge and information to assist policymakers in the development of better social, employment and work-related policies.  Our primary target group is the EU institutions: the Commission, the Parliament and the Council, but we also serve national governments or their social partners at different levels.  Our strength is to provide comparative information.  We carry out research, but we try to help member states to benchmark with each other to see where they perform well or not so well or where there is some room for improvement.  A good example is probably the best known research work by Eurofound, the three Europe-wide surveys we conduct.  The oldest is the European Working Conditions Survey which started in 1990 and is repeated every five years.  It covers different dimensions of job quality, including the physical and social environments, the intensity at work, autonomy, skills, earning, etc.  It involves 40,000 face to face interviews with workers in Europe.  The second oldest is the European Quality of Life Survey which includes some elements of what we call quality of the societies.  For this, we interview citizens, some of whom are working, while some are not.  The third is the European Company Survey which is based on interviews with representatives of companies and work practices at company level. </p><p> I will give some highlights of the surveys relevant to Ireland.  This is an optimistic and satisfied country in terms of quality of life.  It has been through a serious crisis, but it is over and the country is scoring better than the EU average at this level.  On average, in most dimensions of job quality, Ireland is doing well in respect of autonomy, physical demands and several other dimensions.  In some aspects of quality of society Ireland is doing well, for example, the high level of engagement in community activities.  There is a relatively low level of tension in society, while there are, more or less, average levels of trust in national institutions and above average levels of trust in European institutions.  On the index, on a scale of zero to ten, for happiness and life satisfaction, Ireland scores high, similar to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  The average countries are France and Spain, while at the bottom are the candidate countries, some old member states such as Greece and new member states such as Bulgaria.  At the top are the usual suspects, the Nordic countries. </p><p> After the crisis people in Europe generally became more optimistic about their own future, but in response to the question about the future for their children and grandchildren there is a huge difference.  Ireland scores relatively high compared with the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain.  There is a greater difference between it and Italy and France which are much more gloomy about their projections for their children's or grandchildren's future.  This may, to an extent, reflect a perspective on the evolution of the economy, but other elements are also relevant.  </p><p> In respect of quality of society, one element we consider important is engagement in community and civic activities.  In all of these Ireland rates relatively well, for example, in volunteering.  That was visible to me when I came to Ireland eight years ago.  The EU average is 17% and Ireland is in the top group for involvement in volunteering and civic activities.</p><p> Another important element - it is a negative if it is very high - is tension between different groups in society.  We measure tensions between rich and poor, management and labour, men and women, and between people from different racial and ethnic groups.  The EU average is 41%, but Ireland scores among the lowest, at 21%, which is remarkable for a country which has one of the highest shares of foreign population living in it.  There are some elements that can nuance this a little.  We do not count the second generation which is very prominent in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium, where they may be counted as nationals once they obtain their passports.  There is also the fact that most immigration here is relatively homogeneous.  It is mostly European, with a Christian background from, for example, Poland, the United Kingdom and Lithuania which differs from countries with more Muslim immigration or a higher African population that would be more visible.</p><p>Another element that could be relevant is the relatively high number of highly qualified foreigners living in the country and working for high-tech companies such as Google, Facebook, pharmaceutical companies and others.  However, this result is a very good sign.</p><p> The next slide focuses on trust and shows information sourced from the Eurobarometer surveys.  The blue line shows the level of trust in the European Union among Irish citizens.  Not surprisingly, trust decreased during the crisis and the period of the bailout .  The red line shows that trust in the national Government also decreased.  The graph does not show the 2018 figures but in 2018 the majority of Irish people surveyed expressed trust in the EU.  The level of trust in and support for the EU in Ireland is among the highest, if not the highest, among the member states.  The yellow "X" on the graph represents France and shows the level of trust French people have in the European Union.  France has a very pro-European President at the moment but the picture is not so nice when one considers the whole population.  The UK voted to leave the European Union so the level of trust in the EU was found to be lower in the UK.  The figure for Italy is not much higher than the UK figure, which is not the lowest in the EU.  Greece has the lowest level of trust in the EU, perhaps for good reason.  The results are relevant to the debate on the future of Europe.  Some people say the social contract is broken and we are giving power to an entity that we do not trust, and that is not good news.</p><p> Part of the discourse during the period of recovery after the crisis has been that if we want to recover trust, we must make visible that the EU is doing something for the people.  This involves doing more in the social area, rather than focusing only on finance, the banking system and the eurozone.  As the committee will be fully aware, the European Union came up with the European pillar of social rights, which consists of 20 principles.  I do not intend to go through all of them, which fall under three headings, namely, equality opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; and social protection and inclusion.  These were proclaimed by the Heads of Government in Gothenburg.  The Taoiseach was present and we also had the privilege of being there.  We are now in the phase of implementing these principles.  For example, a political agreement was reached recently on a proposal for a directive on work-life balance for parents and carers.  This will require some adjustment, albeit not a huge one, in EU legislation to increase opportunities for work-life balance.  Much of the implementation of the pillar falls on member states and the social partners.  The European Union has certain competencies but it is in the remit of national governments to make most of the changes.</p><p> Another tool that is relevant to the EU process, and one with which members will be familiar, is the European semester.  The country report for Ireland is very positive because the position here comparatively is very positive.  Nevertheless, the report makes a number of country specific recommendations, three of which are referred to in the next slide.  I have highlighted the one that is linked with the area in which Eurofound is working.  This is a recommendation from the European Union to Ireland to ensure timely and effective implementation of the national development plan, including elements related to housing and affordable quality childcare.  Has this recommendation come out of the blue or is it related to facts and objective figures?  The next slide shows the findings of the European quality of life survey in respect of quality of public services.  The graph shows a selection of public services, namely, the education system; childcare; healthcare; long-term care; the State pension; public transport; and social housing.  The blue square represents the average satisfaction experienced by Europeans and the green column represents the satisfaction rate in Ireland.  Where the blue square is displayed within the green column, it means the result in Ireland was better than the EU average.  The graph shows that Irish citizens have a higher rate of satisfaction with education and the State pension system than the average European.  In all other areas, the blue square is displayed above the green columns which means Irish citizens have a lower rate of satisfaction.  The areas in which the gap between Ireland and the EU average was highest were public transport followed by the health services.  In that regard, I know there have been some issues with nurses and doctors recently.  These are followed by childcare, an area in which some recent reforms move in the right direction, and social housing.  None of this will be a surprise to members because these are the issues Parliament is discussing.</p><p> The next slide, on the use and quality of social housing, shows the percentage of people renting social, municipal or non-profit housing.  Rental is only one social housing model but it is among the most prominent.  The graph shows that Ireland is not bad compared with the average, but the 8% figure for Ireland is much lower than for its neighbour, the UK, where the percentage is 20%.  The figure in the Netherlands, at 26%, is even higher.  The correlation between the percentage of social houses available for rent and perceived quality is shown.  While it is not a perfect correlation, in countries that have a larger amount of social housing available to rent, people tend to rate the quality higher.  In Ireland, the percentage is not especially high and the quality is considered good.  The position in Ireland is not much different from the position in the UK.  While there is a big difference in the number of social houses available for rent, the difference between the two countries in terms of quality is not significant. </p><p> While there is a problem with homelessness in Ireland, how does the country fare with regard to global insecurity in housing?  We asked people how likely or unlikely it was that they would need to leave their accommodation within the next six months because they could no longer afford it.  If we exclude the very unlikely, which means the people who feel pretty secure, we have an index showing some level of insecurity.  However, Ireland, at 22, is ranked slightly lower than the European average of 24.  If we consider different scenarios, insecurity is very low among people who own a house without a mortgage and a little higher among those who own a house with a mortgage.  It is higher again for those renting municipal or social housing.  Insecurity is highly concentrated in the cohort of people renting houses or apartments in the private market.  Again, I am sure these findings will come as no surprise to members.  Ireland has taken some measures that may not yet be reflected in this survey.  However, it is important to bear in mind that the problem is concentrated in certain segments.</p><p> Childcare affordability is another area where Ireland scores below the EU average.  The graph compares Ireland, which is the green column, and the European Union, which is the blue column.  The first category shows those who find childcare costs very difficult.  The percentage here is 11% and while it is not a high number, it is almost double the EU average of 6%.  The next category is those who find childcare costs a little difficult and is again almost double the EU average.  The opposite is the case in regard to those who find meeting the costs of childcare not difficult at all, where Ireland scores 35% against an EU average of 61%.  Again, I am aware that some recent measures have been taken so maybe the position is moving in the right direction.</p><p> I want to add something which is not so much in the indices to which we normally pay attention but is relevant to the situation of Ireland, which is the mental health of young people.  The light blue bar on the slide shows the risk to mental well-being, according to our survey.  Ireland would be, more or less, average at 13%.  The dark blue bar shows the actual reported chronic depression.  One can see that Ireland is the highest in the EU according to the EUROSTAT health interview survey.  If we dig a bit deeper and look in the same survey at the proportion of young people with severe or moderate depressive symptoms, we see it is mainly young women between 15 and 24, again shown by the blue bar.  Women rate higher than men in all countries, as shown in the grey column, with Ireland again the highest.  The committee is in a position to understand the reasons for this but we thought it was one of the indicators that was relevant.</p><p> I do not want to end my presentation in a depressing mode by talking about depression.  The next slide shows the network of EU agencies.  Eurofound is one of these and is, of course, based in Ireland.  Ireland almost had another, the banking authority, but it went elsewhere.  Some would say there are already too many agencies, with 48 spread all over the EU, and some are talking about mergers or synergies.  On the other hand, new agencies are being created, with the latest likely to be approved in this legislative period of the European Parliament, the European labour authority or agency, whatever name is finally approved.  The Council will then discuss where to locate that agency.  I do not know if Ireland has an interest but I can say there are nice grounds in Loughlinstown that belong to the OPW; they are rented to Eurofound but there is enough room for another building.  We talk a lot about synergies and having common and shared services.  This will be an agency operating in the social and employment field, so, if Ireland wants, it could make a case for that, knowing that the highest likelihood is that this new agency will end up in a country that has no agency at all, that is, one of the newest member states such as Romania, Croatia or Latvia, for example.  Almost all countries have volunteered to host the agency with the exception of the UK.</p><p> We have much more information available on our website and the committee can contact us at any time.  There is a country page about Ireland with many indicators, not so much to inform Ireland but to inform other countries about the situation in Ireland.  Of course, the committee is welcome to let us know its concerns and priorities and we are happy to assist in any way.</p></speech>

There is certainly a lot of food for thought there for all of us.  I call the Vice Chairman, Senator Leyden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#D00300"><p>I welcome the director and his colleagues.  I want to start with reference to the potential location of the European labour agency.  I hope the Government is very much aware of that and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Employment Affairs and Social Protection should be very active in this regard.  It seems logical to join with Eurofound here in Ireland, whether in Loughlinstown or elsewhere, given the labour relations aspect.  In light of Brexit, I believe we should be given special consideration because of the challenges we face.  Eurofound has a budget of some &euro;20 million, which is a big contribution and provides approximately 100 jobs.  I was disappointed we lost the medical agency which went from the UK and also the financial services agency.  We were outmanoeuvred and out-lobbied in those cases and, quite frankly, we should have got one of those agencies in Ireland, particularly as, in one way or another, we will be the biggest losers as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  Among the interesting information provided by Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s, I was interested with the information on the low level of social housing here compared to other European countries.  It is evident that we do not have enough social housing, which is why we have 10,000 people without houses in Dublin and other regions.</p> <p>  The mental health of young people is a serious matter.  I presume that all of the information presented by Eurofound is sent directly to the Department of Health, in particular the section that deals with mental health.  The situation is very concerning.  Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s elaborated further in regard to young people with severe or moderate depressive symptoms, where the trends are worrying.  Knowledge is power, in a sense.  The fact that Eurofound is preparing this information is giving the people involved with policy formation the facts for all of Europe.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s and his colleagues well in their work in the agency.  I am delighted they had a chance to come here today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#D00400"><p>I thank the director and his team for attending and for presenting this information to the committee.  Their research and findings generally in regard to Ireland are very interesting and while it is very positive for Ireland in many respects, obviously, there is no room for complacency.  As policymakers, we know this and know there are alarm bells in regard to public services, including childcare and public transport.  I am certainly aware of this as a public representative in the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>  In the context of the two surveys on working conditions and quality of life, there is a view that young people of the upcoming generation are finding things difficult in regard to permanent employment.  Has this been picked up in the surveys?  Is much of the work young people are engaged in contract work or part-time work, and are there zero-hour contracts and so on?  Are their living and working conditions deteriorating and what are the trends in that regard?</p> <p>  In terms of comparing and contrasting with other great states in the world, like Canada or Australia, how does the EU compare with the states many of our people are emigrating to, either on a short-term or long-term basis?  What are the international comparisons between the EU and other nation states?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#D00500"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for the very interesting report and information.  The issue regarding housing is not new to us; we are conscious of it and have been concerned about it for some time.  As a personal opinion on the phrase "social housing", for some unknown reason, since we began to use that phrase we have had difficulty meeting the required level of housing.  It used to be called "local authority housing" or "public housing".  We are aware of the extent to which people are shown to be in fear of losing their housing arising from landlords moving in and so on, and this has been a serious issue in recent years.</p> <p>  I am also conscious of the fact that, throughout Europe, there is a greater history of families living in rented accommodation than applies in this country.  In Ireland, 150 years ago, there was a war called the land war.  The purpose of the exercise was to establish the right of the individual to own his or her own land or home.  This is very much intrinsic in the Irish psyche to this day and will remain that way.</p><p>It is seen by people in this country as the foundation on which they build their families and lives.  If they do not have that, it tends to engender in their thinking a level of insecurity that does not apply to their counterparts in the rest of Europe where there is a greater tradition of reliance on public housing.  I accept, however, that this does not apply in all cases.  The interesting part of the study is that which relates to interracial tension.  The degree of such tension in Ireland is shown to be low.  As a race, we have lived in most countries.  Some would say that there are Irish emigrants across the globe as a result of which Irish people have become more accustomed to working with and living in the same areas as other nationalities and they do not see the same level of need to differentiate between one nationality and another.  That is a positive.</p><p> The findings relating to mental health are alarming.  Mental health is an issue about which we are aware, particularly as it affects young women.  We are conscious of this issue and have spoken about it in the Houses of the Oireachtas many times.  We are aware of the increased incidence of depression, serious depression and self-harm and are monitoring the position.  There are a variety of things which we believe to be the cause of these increases, including insecurity, lack of confidence, lack of self-esteem and the use of the Internet by young people who find themselves overwhelmed by what goes on in that regard.  There have been numerous incidences of young people engaging in unsuitable dialogue with individuals who are much older than them.  This is an area we need to examine further because we must protect our young generation.  We must control the technology to which they have access.  Such access is increasingly to their detriment.  We all engage with our constituents on a daily and weekly basis at our advice clinics and we come across these situations all the time.  The incidence of Internet bullying is particularly common among young schoolgirls.  Often, a young schoolgirl will find herself the victim of a concerted campaign by girls from within her school, sometimes outside of the school, but most always outside of school time.  It is in this regard that technology needs to be controlled.  There must be a means found to ensure that young people are not abused in a fashion that undermines their self-confidence and self-esteem to the obvious detriment of themselves and society.</p><p> In most other cases, we have scored fairly well.  That is reassuring.  I agree that the issue relating to childcare costs is serious.  Another serious issue is the cost of housing.  There is a theory among people globally that one feels better if one lives in a very expensive house.  I do not agree.  A house is a house is a house.  It provides security for children and so on.  The theory that if one does not live in a really expensive house one has not made it needs to be addressed, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  When residential property becomes expensive child care becomes the victim.  We have reached a situation where the cost of child care for, say, two, or three, children, even with Government supports, is similar to the cost of a mortgage.  This is not sustainable and it puts a huge burden on the family.  We need to lower housing costs because mortgage costs are forcing both partners in a household out to work in the early stages of the lives of their children.  The cost of a house remains with the family from the day it is purchased it until almost retirement age and this has an overbearing influence on their lives.</p><p> On access to health services, Ireland ranks fourth among the OECD countries in terms of its level of expenditure on health services but we do not have the same level of access as our European colleagues.  It is impossible to determine the cause in this regard.  We have been at odds with ourselves and others in an effort to identify the cause but we think it arises from a multiplicity of factors.  If we cannot improve access on the basis of current expenditure as compared with other European countries it raises the question what are we doing wrong.  We need to do more about this issue because we should not have to pay more than most other European countries for lesser access.</p><p> We hear constantly in European circles about the need to bring Europe closer to the people.  For me, this needs to be reversed.  People need to move closer to Europe.  In moving from the geographical locations across the Continent, we, the people of Europe, will come to realise that we are part of a community and that we have something to contribute to and we can contribute in a meaningful way.  We should not resile from that objective and wait for Europe to come to us, which it already does in terms of construction, social cohesion, etc..  In my view, the countries that are waiting for Europe to come to them need to look at the extent to which they can move towards it in order to achieve the European ideal in the way that was originally envisaged.</p></speech>

On a humorous note, I would love to know what they are doing in Denmark that people there are so happy because it might encourage us to think about moving there.  On voluntarism and the statistics provided in that regard, in my humble opinion the biggest and best voluntary organisation in Ireland is the GAA.  Was this volunteering aspect taken into account in compiling the statistics?  If it was, that is okay but, if not, it challenges the accuracy of the voluntarism statistic.</p> <p>  On the EU-wide impact, there are two or three things the EU could do which would improve everyone's lot.  Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s, as director, is obviously experienced in compiling statistics.  What in his expert view are the two or three things the EU could do to change everybody's lives in a positive way, be that health-wise, work-wise, sports-wise and so on?  Is there any one thing that he would suggest if Europe implemented tomorrow would have a positive impact on all of our lives, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe?</p><p>Following on from that, when one considers the statistics that were given that were applicable to Ireland, it looks like we are doing well but as with everything in life, competitiveness is great.  I like to think that whatever a person is doing, it is not enough and I believe we are all in that category.  I believe we should all push ourselves better, further and harder.  It looks like we are doing okay but is there something we should do to pull ourselves up a bit and pull up our socks?  When I say "we", I refer to us as politicians whether we are Senators, Deputies or Ministers in government.  I am aware that Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s cannot be politically motivated about it but I turn it around to him: if he was in the position tomorrow morning to make suggestions to us as to what we could do to pull up our socks, what would they be?  What would Mr. Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s like to see us doing as legislators?  Perhaps he could give us a comprehensive overview.  We would appreciate his answers.  We must be concise, however, due to time constraints.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Juan Men&eacute;ndez-Vald&eacute;s" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019020600002#F00200"><p>I thank the members and the Chairman for the very interesting questions, remarks and comments.  They are also enriching our own reflection.  I shall address some of the queries, but not all of them.</p> <p>  With regard to making the information available to all the different services, we try but we do not necessarily target each department.  We usually make it available to the national organisations.  We have a member of the Irish Government on our board who also receives all of the information.</p> <p>  Several questions were asked, and could be included as part of the final reflections by the Chairman, about what can be relevant around public services.  This is where one sees a relatively positive image of many things for Ireland but not so much in the perception of a number of services.  Some of them are better than others.  I say this because there is a very high correlation between the citizens' perception of the quality of public services and the trust they have in their national government and national institutions.  In countries where there is trust in the national government and in the parliaments and other public institutions, it is highest in Nordic countries where they also have a very high perception of the quality of public services.  They pay a lot of taxes but they think that they receive a lot in return.</p> <p>  Members have pointed out clearly, and having lived in Ireland myself for a number of years I have also noticed it, that it is not necessarily an issue of money.  The health system is the perfect example.  Ireland invests well above the average in the health system but the access, affordability and quality perceived by citizens is lower.  I am certainly not in a situation to give specifics but off the record I can tell of some personal experiences or opinions.  They would be totally anecdotal and not scientific.  In the transport area, it is probably about money; if more transport is wanted then more infrastructure costs money.  In health or in education, however, it is not just money.  There are countries, for example, which are less generous with child benefit but they have free early years education and care.  That is a political choice.  I am not saying that one is better than the other but these are elements that can be done within certain limits of the budget that a government will always have.  If there is one thing that can be done to increase the trust of the people, it goes in this direction.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the evolution of the labour market, especially with regard to young people, part-time and temporary employment, precarious jobs and so on.  Ireland is not that bad when compared with other countries in the EU.  The general trend for part-time work is increasing all over Europe.  The rest of the market has not so much change.  In the UK, there are the zero-hour contracts and some forms of casual work that are being looked at to avoid abuses.  Temporary employment is not increasing.  We have to look at - and we have a lot of work done on this - the new forms of employment.  These are people who are working, for example, for platforms delivery of food by bike or the Uber drivers.  This platform economy is a new form of employment and we have to look at how they are evolving.  There are positive elements but there are also elements that are not so positive.</p> <p>  We do some global comparisons but not a lot.  Our main mandate is to produce reports that are similar to those the committee has seen - a comparison of 28 member states.  Sometimes, in the counting of countries we go outside the EU in a few projects and we compare globally.  We are about to publish, with the International Labour Organization, a report on the publication of working conditions across the world.  We will not include the countries the members mentioned such as Canada or Australia because we do not have the data on them, but we will have information from the US, South Korea and other regions.  In a globalised world, this is important because we do not want the world to be competing on the basis of lowering conditions.</p> <p>  A point was made on ownership of houses.  I come from a country where traditionally the majority of people also like to own their apartments - not so much houses because we live mainly in apartments in cities.  I was told by a colleague, who is an expert, that the ownership of houses and apartments in Ireland has declined significantly in recent years.  I do not know if this is linked with affordability or if it is due to foreign populations coming to Ireland who do not want to buy because they may not intend to stay permanently. </p> <p>  Reference was made to migration, tensions and the history of Ireland.  This may play a role.  I come from a region with a long history of migration to America first and then to more developed countries in Europe.  It is not, however, giving the full picture.  Italy was an immigration country and the tensions there are very high at the moment.  It is probably a combination of factors but it is certainly good here, and even if it is observed, it is good to observe why it is so good in Ireland and what can we do to keep it that way.</p> <p>  With regard to volunteering, I believe that we have to separate the requests among the sports.  We talk here about volunteering but I am not 100% sure we can give a reply or if the GAA activities would be included</p></speech>

This is a separate item.  The GAA would be considered volunteering.</p></speech>

The players would be the participants and would come under the other question.  This is where Ireland rates higher than average, so it is a sports country.</p> <p>  On the three things the EU could do, that is a difficult question.  At European level, if we have to build on success, some of the members' comments remind me of the successful programmes.  ERASMUS, for example, has been a great experience.  It is being expanded now and its direction is about bringing the citizens to Europe, and if a person is more exposed to other cultures, this will also enrich one's own culture.  It will give a broader sense of belonging to the same continent.  We have done some research on convergence and divergence in Europe.  The history of Europe, of my country and of Ireland are good examples of countries that have been catching up - and surpassing in the case of Ireland - many of the best performers in many areas.  It is good to be a member of the club because we are going to grow together and prove to have social progress together.  Let us consider the experience of Greece recently.  Ireland went through a bailout but is in a very good position now; Greece is not.  This is explained in some of the results there.  The Greeks see, rightly or wrongly, that the European Union has given poverty to them.  I am not saying that everything Greece has done is wonderful, but that is the situation.</p><p>EU policies provide this convergence such that no one is left behind and people catch up.  There are very good examples of this.  Poland is a great example.  It did not have a crisis at all.  It has been growing constantly since it joined the European Union.</p><p> As for not being complacent, I will mix some of the evidence and some of my own perceptions as a foreigner living in Ireland.  The health system is certainly an issue to look at.  I will make a comment that is not in the presentation.  Again, perhaps it is a totally stupid comment.  It is a general, broader perception.  This country is doing very well but is relying a lot on the huge foreign investment of a number of big companies, which for a small country is making a huge difference.  I think any other country in the EU would envy Ireland for doing this, but it can also create some undesired effects, such as higher prices for the whole population and, perhaps, higher salaries.  The underlying competitiveness of the traditionally Irish business and so on can be affected by this.  Sometimes we talk a lot about wages.  I am again getting more into personal opinion here, but I think the problem in Ireland is not wages, which I do not know much about, but prices.  I am taking this from the cost of some pills in a pharmacy rather than any other example, such as having a coffee, with the exception of goods that are the same price all over the world, such as a car or a computer.  Again, this is not scientifically sound, so I probably should not have said it.</p></speech>

I really believe that, from our daily work perspective, having all this information easily available and following on from the presentation will be really helpful to us in our work.  I have no doubt but that we will have interaction again in the future.  I believe the work Eurofound is doing is very important as it allows us to use that well-informed work to help us formulate opinions and policies on all aspects of life.  Again, we will really have to study the Denmark model and see what they are doing there.</p> <p>  At this stage I will suspend the meeting for a minute to let the director and his staff leave.  I thank them most sincerely again.  Then we will go into private session for the remainder of the meeting.</p></speech>

I look forward to having an opportunity to answer questions on a wide range of issues.  I have circulated an opening statement but with the agreement of the committee, I would like to comment at the outset on a few issues related to the National Children's Hospital and then the Chairman can decide whether I should read the rest of my opening statement or to take it as read.</p> <p>  I would like to update the committee on four matters relating to the National Children's Hospital this morning.  First, I wish to confirm that yesterday evening I took the decision to appoint Mr. Fred Barry as the new chairperson of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  Mr. Barry has a wealth of experience in delivering major capital projects, particularly in his role as CEO of the National Roads Authority.  It is recognised across the House that the National Roads Authority is one of the State agencies that has done a very good job in bringing in many capital projects.  Mr. Barry's record shows him to be a man who went into that agency and really ensured that projects came in on time and on budget.  I am very grateful to Mr. Barry for agreeing to take up the role.  I think his long track record with the National Roads Authority coupled with his professional experience and qualifications leaves him very well placed to lead this entity and all its legal responsibilities at what is a crucial time for this landmark project for children's health care in our country.</p> <p>  We had a long discussion on the next issue, the PwC investigation into the spiralling costs and its terms of reference at our previous committee meeting and at other engagements the committee has had with officials.  I, of course, heard from members of this committee, from members of the Committee of Public Accounts and from others that there was a view that the terms of reference needed to be made robust and more comprehensive.  I have listened very carefully to the committee's suggestions on that and I have tried to meet them in the revised version which was also published yesterday evening.  This review will now deal with the accountability of relevant key parties, functions and roles.  Obviously any sanctions to be applied to any individuals or people in roles will be a matter for Government, be it by way of the contracts we have with such organisations or by issues regarding board appointments and the likes.  It is important that it will also examine the role of the Department of Health and the HSE in terms of making sure that we are comprehensive about roles and responsibilities.  Crucially, and this is an issue that Deputy Donnelly raised with me last Tuesday and again this week, which is the importance of PwC also looking at cost mitigation and value for money.  On the suggestion of Deputy Donnelly and others, I have also included that in the terms of reference for PwC.</p> <p>  My third point relates to the reference in the media this morning to potential cost pressures being highlighted at an earlier stage.  Of course, this should not be news to anybody at this committee because by my count the issue of the &euro;61 million of potential cost pressures has been discussed at this committee and at the PAC on at least 11 occasions from a quick tot I did of the transcripts this morning.  Far from the figure being concealed, it is explicitly referenced in a briefing note that I provided to this committee in advance of my attendance here last week.  This is a very different situation and I need colleagues to be clear on that.  There were cost pressures emerging in 2017 but the development board had been told in no uncertain terms that it was important to take measures to mitigate that, that we were not seeking additional Exchequer funding at that stage and that there were a number of things, including some of the suggestions I have heard from members of this committee, including descoping that had to be considered is a very different situation from the one we found ourselves in at the end of August of last year when it became apparent to me that there was going to be a need to apprise Government of its options and indeed to seek a substantial additional amount of Exchequer funding as well.</p> <p>  The fourth and final issue is what was going on between August and December.  I am somewhat frustrated at the characterisation I have heard of this.  I have heard a characterisation that the Minister knew in August and nothing happened until November.  Nothing could be further from the truth and the paper trail and testimony from my officials, from members of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, from the HSE and from my own mouth at this committee last week show that not to be the case.  </p> <p>  When we talk about August, we are talking about 27 August, effectively the end of August and start of the September where I became aware of the potential significant cost increase.  The Secretary General made it clear to this committee that he was on leave until the start of September.  We are talking about roughly the start of September when it became clear that there was a significant emerging capital issue.  We then had a situation whereby there was a significant level of negotiation ongoing with commercial entities to try to drive down the cost, exactly what one would expect the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to do as the legal entity that had the contracts and the only legal entity, by the way, that could negotiate.  Neither the Department nor I could negotiate.  The legal power in respect of the contract and the negotiations rested with and rest today with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  The commercial process of negotiation was going on.  I need to be clear that this idea that I and I alone knew about the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process does not stand up to any scrutiny.  A Government decision was made when the Fine Gael and Labour parties were in government and I believe it was the right decision that the procurement process should be two phased, that Phase A would be in respect of the excavation works and Phase B would be the substantive works.  It was always going to be essential that before one could award a contract for Phase B, there had to be the finalisation of the GMP process.  The idea that the knowledge that the GMP process was ongoing was confined to me and my Department is not true.  Of course, that is not to suggest people knew the figures of the overrun, because they could not have had such knowledge because they did not crystalise until 9 November but the fact that the process was ongoing in the month of September was not concealed nor was it a secret issue.  In the month of October as this work was ongoing, my officials were engaging and seeking to engage with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as one would expect them to do.  They would have been engaging and seeking to find out how they would deal with an emerging issue, telling others about the information they had.  On 9 November, the final figure that we now all know became apparent; the Taoiseach and I were told about that figure, I believe, on 9 November.  I think also it was told to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform's officials as well.  I think the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform knew in November and he spoke about that yesterday.  In the months of November and December we had intensive engagements about what we should do about the very large overrun and what options were open to us.  As I discussed at length, and do not propose to do again today, in the interests of time, there were effectively three options: pause, re-tender or proceed.  I do not believe any Minister, sitting in my seat, would have made a different decision, other than to proceed with this project.   </p> <p>  What was happening from August to December, was an intensive body of work to present a full and detailed number of options to the Government at its meeting on 18 December to enable the Government to make its decision, which it made, to proceed with this project.  I believe it is the right decision.  It is the right decision for children and I believe, whoever is Minister for Health in 2023 will be very proud opening that hospital, which will transform the delivery of children's health care in our country.  It could be one of the members present.</p> <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform commented yesterday on two other matters.  He said that it was the appropriate thing for me as the Minister for Health to come to him when I knew the quantity, that one would go to the Minister when one knows the scale of the problem and the potential solutions.  He believes that I acted appropriately in that regard.  I have no doubt that I did.  He also made the point that it would have been helpful to know earlier.  He is entirely correct.  I said the same thing.  We all would have liked to know about the scale of the problem earlier.  The programme board, the Secretary General, the HSE and I have all flagged the fact that an early warning system would have helped significantly in terms of people knowing about this earlier.</p> <p>  I just wanted to put on record what actually happened between the months of August and December.  That was a period of very intense engagement to arrive at a set of robust options for us to pick the best way to proceed or not to proceed with this vital project. </p> <p>  My opening statement is quite long and it goes into a number of issues.  Obviously there are many issues happening in my Department and the HSE in respect of industrial relations matters; our efforts to reach a new and better deal with our GPs; on the progress we have made on issues, such as termination of pregnancy, the introduction of abortion services; the passage of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2018.</p><p>We are also working on falling waiting lists for inpatient day cases; significant increased funding in respect of waiting lists, particularly outpatient waiting lists for 2019; our Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan; the establishment of the advisory group and the progress being made on that; the fact that I have appointed a new HSE board on an interim and administrative basis while we await the legislation to be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas; and some of the work we are doing in respect of patient safety and the patient experience survey.  I have set out all of that and also some of the progress and work ongoing in the areas for which the Ministers of State, Deputies Catherine Byrne, Jim Daly and Finian McGrath, have responsibility.  However, if the Chairman is happy to do so, I am more than happy to take questions on that rather than take time reading it into the record.</p></speech>

On the winter plan, the HSE commenced winter planning for 2018-19 in May 2018.  The planning process focused on three main areas: emphasis on providing community based care options to prevent emergency department, ED, attendance and expedite discharge from acute hospitals to either a patient&rsquo;s home or a community-based care alternative; close integrated working between acute hospitals and community services through local winter action teams with national oversight; and increasing specific measures in nine sites over a peak four-week focus period between 17 December and 30<sup></sup>January.  <br/><br/>Some &euro;30 million was provided in winter funding - &euro;10 million once-off in quarter 4 of 2018 and &euro;20 million in 2019.  The emphasis on community-based services saw two thirds of the available funding directed towards primary and social care services - &euro;10.6 million to home support packages, &euro;4 million to the provision of aids and appliances, &euro;1.5 million to transitional care and more than &euro;4 million allocated to community beds and initiatives.<br/><br/>Due to increasing system pressures towards the end of the focus period, the national oversight group agreed to extend the enhanced measures by an additional two weeks to support unscheduled care at the nine sites.  Unscheduled care performance improved significantly in quarter 4 2018 compared to quarter 4 2017 where the 8 a.m. trolley count was 4.2% lower than the same period last year.  This was despite ED presentations increasing at a rate higher than expected at 3.3% for the same period.<br/><br/>This trend has continued and increased into January 2019.  Analysis of performance for the period 1 January to 27 January 2019 recorded ED attendances at 98,797, an increase of 9.2% on the same period in 2018.  ED admissions in this period were 27,319, an increase of 6.3% on the same period in 2018.  Despite such increases, the 8 a.m. trolley count for the same period in 2019 was 8,732, representing a 14.8% decrease in trolleys on the same period in 2018.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the flu season in 2018-19, while not yet over, appears to have been shorter and less intense than that in 2017-18.  However, the high ED attendances this year have included significant levels of respiratory cases that are non-flu related.<br/><br/>Regarding service improvements and achievements in 2018, during the year there were significant achievements and improvements across the range of health and social care services and I would like to highlight some of these to the committee.  Our acute hospital services continue to demonstrate improvements in the inpatient day case waiting list, which reduced to almost 70,000 at the end of 2018 from 86,100 in 2017 or a reduction of 18%.  This ambitious target was achieved as a result of the continuous focused efforts in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and the Department of Health.  Last year saw considerable improvements in a number of other targets as follows: the number of patients waiting over nine months has almost halved since July 2017 from 28,100 to 14,900; the number waiting over nine months for a cataract procedure has fallen by 87% since July 2017; the number waiting nine months for a tonsillectomy has fallen by 84% in the same period, with the number for angiograms falling by 88%.  Over the course of last year, 418 spinal surgeries were completed, including 201 spinal fusions, and the number of children waiting longer than four months reduced to 35 at the end of 2018.  Cancer key performance indicators, KPI, continued to improve in services such as symptomatic breast, lung and prostate cancer in 2018 with all sites showing sustained improvement over the year.<br/><br/>In 2018, primary care services expanded with the opening of 13 new primary care centres.  Within the primary care services, 743,000 people were seen by community nursing services; 1.5 million people were treated by health and social care professionals; and in excess of 1 million contacts were made with GP out-of-hours services in the year. <br/><br/>A significant milestone was achieved when all of our 1,149 disability centres were registered by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, as of 31 October 2018 under the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities.  This has been a substantial achievement for the sector.<br/><br/>More than 53,000 people benefitted from home support in 2018 and 15.7 million hours of support were provided.  The percentage of persons over the age of 65 in long-term care has fallen to 3.4% against a target of 4%.  This is assisted by the ongoing investment in home support.<br/><br/>In our mental health services, 10,734 children and adolescents were seen by child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS; 203 children and adolescents were admitted to CAMHS acute inpatient units; and 27,124 adults were seen by mental health services.<br/><br/>However, notwithstanding that progress and achievements, we still have significant pressure on acute and community services with high numbers of people on outpatient waiting lists, a significant increase in the numbers of people attending EDs and increasing unmet demand for home care support.  Our service plan for 2019 will focus on bringing about further improvements and increased capacity across the health services, particularly in those areas where we are experiencing ongoing service pressures.<br/><br/>The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy was published last year.  A detailed action plan is in development, led by the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office that will set out a series of work streams and designated actions, with associated measures to be delivered in 2019.  The HSE is committed to working with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office and all stakeholders to play our part in successfully bridging the gap between the vision for health service transformation in Ireland and delivery of that change at the front line.<br/><br/>In respect of termination of pregnancy services, following last year&rsquo;s referendum and subsequent legislative change, abortion services are now being provided by the HSE through GPs or family planning services and in maternity units and hospitals across the country.  People can now access an abortion in Ireland under specific circumstances.  Some 259 GPs have signed the contract and each day more GPs are signing up as the service evolves.  Of the 259 GPs, 128 consented to having their details shared by My Options.  There is a good geographic spread of GPs taking part, enough to meet the needs of people who may need to access the service.  The Well Woman and Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, clinics are now well established in the provision of services in the greater Dublin area.  All maternity hospitals are providing the following services: managing complications arising from termination; providing appropriate care and supervision for women following a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, and referral to the appropriate tertiary unit; and providing appropriate care and supervision in cases where maternal health or life is at risk, and referral to an appropriate tertiary hospital, as appropriate.  <br/><br/>Nine maternity hospitals are providing the full range of termination of pregnancy services.  The number of sites providing these services will increase during the remainder of 2019.  My Options, the HSE&rsquo;s unplanned pregnancy service, is the first point of contact, providing free and confidential information and non-directive counselling to people experiencing an unplanned pregnancy.  The My Options helpline has seen a steady number of calls each day since it went live on 1  January 2019.  Since the <i>myoptions.ie</i>website information went live on 21 December after the legislation was enacted, there have been more than 80,000 visits and almost 300,000 page views to the website.<br/><br/>I will give an update on the nurses' strike action.  Within the HSE, we have put in place a governance structure to oversee preparedness for the series of nurses strikes and for the co-ordination and implementation of system-wide contingency plans.  During the recent strike days the ongoing interaction between local management and strike committees proved to be effective.  As the strike continues, there is increased risk for patients and clients along with increasing disruption.  We estimate that in excess of 40,000 patients and service users are impacted on each strike day.  The HSE continues to seek full derogation for cancer surgery and services while the action continues.  There is ongoing engagement with community health organisations, CHOs, hospital groups and all front-line services to seek to manage this difficult situation.  We are acutely aware of the significant impact of patient appointment cancellations and the cumulative impact on access to services, and we are advising the public to stay tuned to media reports and adverts as well as to contacts from local services to those affected.<br/><br/>In addition to this week's strike days, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has notified further strike dates next week from 12 to 14 February, inclusive, and 19 and 21 February.  The overriding objective remains that the dispute be resolved given the number of patients and clients affected.  The HSE remains open to be part of any talks to achieve that objective.<br/><br/>That concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may wish to ask.</p></speech>

The report PwC will provide at the end of March will not have substance if it does not have that expertise.  We need to forensically examine the original bill of quantities and procurement documents to find out exactly what was being asked.</p> <p>  Was there a target cost for the hospital?  It would appear that the two-stage process allowed the costs to escalate without having any target cost.  Most building projects have a price and the project will be accommodated at that price.  It appears, in this instance, there was no cap on price.  It was allowed to develop between the contractor, the design team, the quantity surveyors and all the other participants in the project who came up with a cost as the project developed.  That is where the problem lies.  The Minister might address those questions.</p></speech>

I am more than happy, as the line Minister, to be here and I note the comments the Chairman has made and they will also be noted by others.</p> <p>  The contract with BAM has been signed for phase B.  The decision to proceed was taken by Government on 18 December and that decision was conveyed by me to the director general of the HSE.  I obviously conveyed the disappointment that Government felt about the lack of early warning systems and, therefore, the need for this external review in the letter I sent to the director general.</p> <p>  PwC has expertise in procurement and construction.  It is important to say that, even when we were amending the terms of reference in recent days, we took on board the Chairman's concerns and PwC satisfied itself that it could deliver on those terms of reference.  I am satisfied that is the case.</p> <p>  I will be very clear that the target cost for the hospital was &euro;983 million.  That was the sanction given by Government when it made its decision in April 2017.  That was always meant to be the cost of the hospital.</p> <p>  There was a two-stage procurement used.  The Chairman did not quite say this, but I presume he is thinking, as we all are, whether that was the right model to use.  At the moment the view seems to be that it was.  The report commissioned from Mazars by the project development board before we proceeded with phase B suggested that, while there were weaknesses and a lack of early warning, from my memory, the gross maximum price, GMP, process would have highlighted issues at an earlier stage than the traditional procurement model.  One would hear about the overrun at the end of the project under a traditional procurement model whereas the two-stage process highlighted the problem earlier and we can now have the conversations about how to mitigate and manage the problems.</p> <p>  What happened when the Government approved &euro;983 million?  I have been asking a lot of questions about this, as one can imagine.  We can talk about GMP processes and all of this, but, for people watching at home, the way I think of it is we effectively approved phase A, the excavation works, which, by the way, came in on budget.  We also acknowledged there was further work to be done under phase B but, based on the outline design, the project would come in at &euro;983 million.  We were all badly let down when we went beyond the outline design and design teams, and the likes, did further work and it was clear that the costs were an awful lot higher.  Where the responsibility for that lies is something that, even with privilege, I should not prejudice, though I have strong views about it, and I hope and expect PwC to get to the bottom of it.  We will then act on that.</p></speech>

I wish Ms O'Connor the best of luck in her new job, which is not an easy one.  We wish her the very best with it.</p><p>I want to focus on the timeline for the children's hospital and who knew what and when.  In April 2017, the Cabinet approved &euro;983 million.  As the Minister stated, in August 2017, concerns were raised about an additional cost of approximately &euro;60 million.  That has been referenced before.  I understand that the next time the Minister knew about cost escalations was on 27 August 2018, a year after this initial issue of &euro;60 million was raised.</p><p>Today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>contains details of minutes from project management meetings which show that, at project management and board levels, issues of costs were continuously being raised, month after month.  In March 2017, there was a recommendation that the concerns on the issue of the GMP were escalated.  Eight senior HSE officials and three senior Department of Health officials were present at earlier meetings.  In April 2018, the minutes show that further cost issues were discussed.  In May, which is particularly relevant, in response to increasing cost concerns, an assistant secretary from the Department of Health advised the board to go before Government prior to the budgetary process.  That is critical because, obviously, these kinds of cost overruns are relevant to a budgetary process.</p><p>Can the Minister confirm that he was not made aware of any of this?  He signed off on the cost of &euro;983 million in April 2017.  In August 2017, he was made aware of the &euro;60 million increase and was told nothing else until August 2018 when he was told the cost escalation was in the range of several hundred million euro?</p></speech>

I hope he understands and accepts my explanation that this was a different situation from the one in which we found ourselves in August 2018 when it was clear that work would have to be done, and decisions made, by Government.</p> <p>  I want to make a slight tweak to something the Deputy said.  While the meeting he referred to took place in August 2017, I was informed in September 2017.  That is to be accurate, not to be pedantic.  I was told on that occasion by my Secretary General, who may wish to add something about this.  That is also referenced in the briefing note given to the committee last week.  The NPHDB had been told to put in place a programme of work to mitigate those costs.  It was also more specific than that.  The board was just told to try and manage the costs.  Issues such as philanthropy, risk minimisation, offset through value engineering savings, offset through other design or scope changes where appropriate and the deployment of contingency were all mentioned.  I was told, in September 2017, that there was a cost pressure but that it would be managed, the board had been told to manage it, and there was no proposal to go to Government about it.

He did not know it was &euro;450 million but the statements received by the committee over the past few weeks confirm that it was in the range of several hundred million euro.  The Minister responded to a parliamentary question on 18 September concerning the original cost of the children's hospital if it was in budget when compared to the original budget.  The Minister said that the total budgeted cost was &euro;983 million, which was the 2017 cost.  He also said that capital expenditure to date was in line with expected expenditure.  We all now know that the Minister knew at that point that it was not in line with expected expenditure.  Contracts may not have been signed but the Minister had been made aware that it was above by several hundred million euro.  Does the Minister accept that his response to a parliamentary question was misleading?</p></speech>

With the benefit of hindsight and in the interests of absolute honestly, when reflecting on this in recent days, I wish I added a further sentence to acknowledge that there was an ongoing GMP process that would crystallise the final cost for phase B.  Again, I do not think the existence of a GMP process was a secret.  Members of the Oireachtas would have been well aware of it because it was originally decided on as a strategy in 2014, endorsed by the Government's contracts committee in 2015 and subject to a number of Cabinet decisions and Cabinet memoranda, including memoranda on the children's hospital, before my appointment to Cabinet as Minister for Health.  There was an ongoing process.  I stand by the importance of answering the question accurately, which I did.  The project was on profile.  I repeated the figure relating to the original budget as well.  With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had added a line pointing out that there was an ongoing process relating to the GMP.  I must also make the point, and the evidence before this committee clearly shows it, that very intensive commercial negotiations were ongoing for about three months during and after that parliamentary question.  I did not know the accurate figures until 9 November.  Without being too pedantic, I would reject the assertion that I knew of figures of several hundred million euro.  I do not believe that was the case.  I have learned as Minister for Health - at times, the hard way - about the importance of establishing accurate and factual information before throwing it out into the public domain or putting on the record of the D&aacute;il.  Being truthful, a process was ongoing and I wish I had referenced that fact in the beginning.</p></speech>

The Minister did not know the final figure but he knew the cost had spiralled significantly.  The entire fiscal space was just &euro;800 million.  The Minister and his officials would have been engaged in detailed negotiations with the Minister for Finance and his officials around the health budget for 2019, including the capital budget.  This committee was looking in detail at the current expenditure overrun for last year, which was around &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million, and was spending time trying to identify ways of making sure there was no overrun in 2019.  Fianna F&aacute;il was in detailed negotiations with Government on the health budget and was looking for some big ticket items to the tune of many millions.  We were also looking for very small ticket items - around &euro;50,000 here or &euro;100,000 there - so very detailed negotiations were taking place.  The D&aacute;il signed off on a budget, the HSE service plan was delivered, a capital plan was put together for healthcare for the following year and the whole time the Minister knew there was an additional overrun to the tune of several hundred million euro, which transpired to settle at &euro;450 million.  I know Fianna F&aacute;il was not informed of it.  It was a very pertinent piece of information in terms of a fiscal space of just &euro;800 million.  Can the Minister confirm that at no point during the entire budgetary process did he inform the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance about this enormous overrun and the enormous amount of additional funding on top of the entire budget that would need to be found?</p></speech>

When we talk about the health budget and the budget negotiations that were ongoing - I do not need to explain this to the Deputy because he was involved in it - the significant effort at the time involved dealing with current expenditure issues and the fact that we were facing and ultimately agreed a supplementary budget on current expenditure for the health service for &euro;645 million.  The overriding priority for me in budget 2019, and I accept for the Deputy and the Oireachtas, was stabilising current expenditure and making sure we addressed what was going to be an immediate shortfall in funding to provide services.  That was my priority.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the size of the fiscal space and the sum being larger than or a very large proportion of the available fiscal space.  That ignores one fact, which is that during budget negotiations, I neither knew nor could have known the outcome of the ongoing process nor the cashflow.  I could not possibly have known the impact of this in 2019, 2020 and 2021.  This project will go out to 2023 when the hospital will open.  Construction finishes in 2022.  Until 9 November, it was not possible to know the impact in 2019 and 2020 or indeed any subsequent year.  What people need to know, and freedom of information documents have shown this, is that I was actively seeking additional capital for the health service throughout budget negotiations.  There is correspondence that journalists who made freedom of information requests have received and put in newspapers about me writing about the need for more capital for the health service.  While neither I, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform nor anyone else could crystallise, because nobody knew the figures, the outcome of the commercial negotiations or the impact in terms of cashflow in each of the years, I was actively looking for more capital for the health service and indeed received some in the negotiations.</p></speech>

First, as I said in my opening statement, there was an awareness across Government, including in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that the GMP process was ongoing.  The fact that there was an ongoing process to finalise the costs for phase B for the national children's hospital was not a secret that I or my Department was retaining.  All of Government, and, I would suggest, much of the Oireachtas, would have known that before the contract for phase B of the children's hospital could be awarded, a GMP process was ongoing.  Government colleagues knew about that.  What was not known, and this is entirely in line with what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said yesterday, was what that quantity was going to be.  The fact that this process was ongoing was known by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would suggest that it was widely known.  I did not negotiate specifically on additional funding for the children's hospital but it was always going to be apparent that at some point the Government was going to have to award a contract for phase B, that this contract could not be awarded pending the completion of the GMP process and that the GMP process was ongoing.  That was known about more broadly and not just by me.</p></speech>

I think we are all in disbelief.  The Taoiseach and I found out about the figure on the same day - 9 November.  We found out about the figure at a meeting we attended in the Department of Health on 9 November, so I can assure the Deputy that the disbelief was shared more widely.  I believe the job of a Minister is to obtain factual and accurate information and then brief Government colleagues as appropriate.</p><p>I am saying very clearly that the GMP process was ongoing.  The outcome of it was not known.  There were commercial negotiations, the outcome of which could have made a difference in terms of a very large scale.  We did not know and could not have known the impact of this on capital expenditure in 2019, 2020 or any other year pending the outcome.  I was very busy negotiating on what I did know we were going to need for 2019 in terms of both current and capital expenditure.</p><p> The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did say, with the benefit of hindsight, that even had I told him or had I had a direct conversation, he would have told me to do exactly what we did, which was to quantify the figures and come back to him.  I am very satisfied that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, looking at this with the benefit of hindsight in February rather in October of last year, is satisfied that I acted entirely appropriately.  So is the Taoiseach.  When we did quantify the figures, there was very intensive work to decide what to do.  There was a very stark decision to be made, on whether to pause, re-tender or proceed.  We made the decision to proceed but it was not an easy one.</p></speech>

I would reflect on those remarks if I were him because I do not believe the view is shared by other people.  Those who look in at this are dissatisfied.  The hands-off approach that has been referred to by me and others is very evident here.  I do not believe this is something that the Minister can simply dismiss, saying everybody believes he has done a fantastic job on this.  The scale of the overrun is such that it will cause other projects to be brought into question.  Those who are waiting on projects - many of them are small but they are vital &ndash; probably would not share what the Minister for Health says is the view of the Taoiseach and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I have a question on the tender process.  Mr. Tom Costello told us when he was here in January, which strangely seems like a very long time ago although it was only a few weeks ago, that the lowest bid came in at &euro;637 million.  That would have been &euro;131 million below the next highest bid.  Could the Minister outline for me the values of all the bids?  We obviously know the values of two of the bids because we can add &euro;637 million and &euro;131 million.  What were the figures for the other bids that came in?  When the bid of &euro;637 million was chosen - it was &euro;131 million below the next lowest - what was the value of the contract?  Could the Minister give us those figures?  I have not seen them in the public domain as yet.</p></speech>

First, could I address three of the assertions made by the Deputy?  They concern comments she put into my mouth that I did not make.  No word such as "fantastic" was used.  The Deputy can be sure that I share the concerns of this committee and the people of Ireland on the scale of the overrun.  I am not satisfied about it and that is why I am determined to act in relation to personnel changes, governance changes and the like.  I will be led by PwC's recommendations in that regard.  I reflected on the Deputy's comments and others in making those terms of reference more robust.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about a hands-off approach.  I do not believe she was here for all of my opening statement, which is fine, but I documented very clearly the very hands-on approach we actually took when teasing through these issues, seeking expert reports and ultimately arriving at a very difficult point for any Minister to be in, that is, a point where a decision has to be made on whether to pause, re-tender or proceed.  From me, there was only one decision, namely, to proceed.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to other projects.  It is right and proper for her to do so because people are wondering what will happen to their project in their community, be it small-scale or otherwise, and about the difference that will be made to their health service or, indeed, other projects.  It is important to say that 25% of our population comprises children.  Some 20% of the Department of Health's capital budget will go towards this project.  Some 80% will not go towards this project.  We are talking about &euro;50 million having to be found out of a capital budget of almost &euro;700 million this year.  We are talking about &euro;100 million across Government out of a capital budget of about &euro;7 billion.  Of course one would rather not be in this place but there needs to be a degree of context on this.  The Deputy does not have to take my word for the impact but she should take that of the Minister for Finance yesterday.  At the committee, he talked about no project needing to be cancelled and how this could be managed.  I believe he is proposing to bring a memo to the Government on that next week.</p> <p>  On the awarding of tenders, the procurement process and the like, obviously PwC is considering all the steps.  I am not suggesting the Deputy is doing otherwise but we should follow the expert views of those who have procurement and construction expertise and who are going to consider this matter.</p> <p>  I ask the Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, to give any information we have on the figures the Deputy is requesting.</p></speech>

I am really loving the phraseology such as the "emerging challenges".  If I had emerging challenges like that within my own household budget I would probably end up in the poorhouse.  The "emerging challenges" were being discussed.  The person who is the head of the Office of Government Procurement, who presumably oversees all of this convoluted procurement process, sees these "emerging challenges" and then goes back to work but says nothing about it.  Does the Minister have a view as to whether that is appropriate?  The Minister has very senior people on his staff.  Let us say they had important information about a catastrophic overspend or whatever words he wants to use.  Would he expect his staff to tell him or make it their business to let him know about such a matter?  The Minister either has a Department that has a culture where open and transparent conversations are encouraged or he does not.  In my view, one should have such a culture and I am interested in hearing the view of the Minister on this matter.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the circular refers to what should happen if one is not satisfied that one's board is dealing with it through the appropriate structures.  I cannot speak for individual members of the board but, clearly, they were satisfied that the board was dealing with these issues.  The board's minutes seem to suggest to me that the board was dealing with these issues, and then the board did escalate these issues into the Department of Health in August and, ultimately, they arrived at Government in December.  There is a suggestion, and not just on the part of the Deputy, that there may have been a board member sitting on a board saying: "Hmmm, something is going on here and no one is, kind of, doing anything about it."  I do not think that is a fair reflection of what the board was doing.  It looks to me that this was a board trying to grapple with a problem and then, when it became aware of the seriousness of that, escalating it through the structures.  Let us see what the PwC report says in terms of how that actually worked.  That is my view of the matter today.</p></speech>

In the letters of reappointment, with which the Deputy will be familiar from her work on the children's health legislation, I advised the members of the board that I was appointing them for continuity.  I do not have the letter in front of me but I also advised them in the letter and, indeed, it is in the briefing notes that I have given to the committee, that I would have new powers under the Children's Health Act, if and when it was passed by the Oireachtas, which would give me the right, if I so chose, to replace the board.</p></speech>

I am going to await the outcome of the PwC report in terms of where the weaknesses lie.  If I had not reappointed the people there would have been a vacuum.  There was legislation about to be passed in the Oireachtas that was going to give me, as Minister, a raft of new powers in relation to replacing that board.  I now have those powers and I am actively considering what to do in that regard, and will decide when the PwC report comes back at the end of March.</p></speech>

I understand that the board comes under the remit of the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act.  Let us drill down into this matter.  This idea that somebody from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can be a representative on the board, under this legislation under which the board was set up, yet act in a personal capacity and not be subject to circular 12/2010, which was incorporated into the 2016 code of State bodies, is complete and utter garbage.

I do not think anybody in the Oireachtas fundamentally believes the line that has been spun about personal capacity.  I think it is the weakest of all of the weak arguments that have been put out.

It reads: "The first full assessment of the cost overrun and the reasons for it was received by my Department in the form of a report from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board submitted by the Department of Health on 19 November."</p></speech>

There was then a time lag.  The date 9 November is a significant one because the development board had just completed the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process.  It was not complete in October.  It might have been completed by the eighth.  We had good information by 9 November.  We had a written report from the development board by the following week.  This issue crystallised in that period.</p></speech>

I will go through some minutes that would raise other concerns relating to other issues.  We know that this is a serious escalation.  The Minister told us that he was shocked in late August, and, to be polite, "annoyed".  He had budget negotiations going on in parallel.  He looked for meetings with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which had somebody on the board.  He could not get a meeting.  To the public watching, this is "Father Ted" territory.  The idea that it would not sit down and that there was not awareness across the two Departments that this was a significant issue and that they could not have a meeting beggars belief.  I accept what Mr. Breslin said about 9 November and the meetings.  I have gone through all that and understand it.  Given that the Department and Minister were aware of it, the idea that it took that long to have a meeting beggars belief and throws up a whole new set of issues.</p></speech>

We knew around here that it was around &euro;200 million.  We have established that it was at least that on some level.  In parallel, the Department was engaged in budget negotiations.  Maybe there was concern that one would be conflated with the other.  I do not want to suggest that but there may have been an issue.  This beggars belief for any member of the public watching this.</p> <p>  I understand what Mr. Breslin said about the &euro;61 million.  The minutes of the steering group from 20 October 2017 state that John Pollock said they would have reasonable certainty about the size of the funding deficit by March 2018.  They knew there would be a funding deficit of over &euro;61 million.  On 23 April 2018, it was said that the GMP approval was significantly at risk.  Mr. Dean Sullivan chaired that meeting.  On 31 May, it was said that a memorandum would go to Government by October.  On 25 June, BAM was asked for a response about the implication of the delay.  Throughout April, May and June, GMP was way off and was going to be in trouble.  Throughout the process, the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health would have been aware that the GMP process had not been concluded.</p> <p>  The Department had people on the board and was aware of it.  It had brought in layers of oversight.  It had a steering group over the board and another board over the steering group.  It brought that in because it had concerns and would not have done so otherwise.  Concerns were expressed during the GMP process.  I have read the minutes of April, May and June.  How did those not escalate through the Department to the Minister?  I know they came in August.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was also aware of the GMP process.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has people who monitor all capital budget lines.  It has people there specifically to deal with health.  Why were they not asking?  The GMP was way off.  Was there any communication from it to the Department of Health saying that?</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Donnelly earlier, the &euro;61 million arose in September 2017.  I appreciate that Deputy Kelly accepts that is different and thank him for that.

I wrote on 20 September 2017 that the Government has to be very clear that this project needs to come within budget.  That was the position of the Government, of the Department of Health, my Secretary General and senior officials, who fed the information back through the appropriate structures, saying that something needed to be done, that contingency and descoping needed to be looked at where appropriate, and that value engineering and risk management needed to be looked at.</p></speech>

I share the Deputy's frustrations and it is a reason for having an external review.</p><p>I refer to the role of the governance structures and why there was not what I am politely calling the early warning system, to which my Secretary General and the HSE have referred.  Even board members have reflected on it.  The questions of why flags were not raised earlier and who decided they did not need to be raised earlier are questions that those producing the PwC report absolutely need to consider.</p><p> As Deputy Kelly knows, the timeline for the GMP process kept getting pushed out.  It was taking longer to complete the process.  As part of that process, there were commercial negotiations ongoing and, therefore, perhaps a great deal of uncertainty as to where the figures would end up.  I do not think the PwC report, which I do not want to pre-empt, is needed to suggest clearly that something was badly lacking in terms of early warning.</p></speech>

Incidentally, I am aware this issue has been dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is inappropriate because that committee does not have a competence in policy.  In fact, it is specifically excluded from dealing with policy.  I want to establish that because what is occurring undermines the role and function of the Chairman of this committee.  Speculation is outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is acting <i>ultra vires</i>.  There are consequences if that continues.</p><p>The point I want to raise relates to tenders.  What is the process for evaluating a tender?  Someone might tell me how it works.  For instance, what is the capacity of the client to assess the validity of a tender?  How can it be grounded?  How can we test it?  What was the process in this particular case?</p></speech>

In this case, companies must give an indication that they have the requisite ability to deliver.  They put forward their capacity to undertake a job of this scale and get short-listed.  In this situation, five companies for the main contract were short-listed.  In advance of any tenders being received, the people who are going to award the contract come up with a marking scheme in line with the request for tenders they have issued.  That would involve a combination of quality and cost.  My understanding in this situation was that the first thing done when the tenders were opened entailed a sealed process pertaining to quality.  One had to meet the quality criteria before being evaluated for price.  Those companies that met the quality criteria were evaluated on the price they were tendering, and marks were awarded based on that.</p></speech>

I would like Mr. Breslin to devote some time to addressing this.  How does one assess whether the lowest tender is even feasible?  In answering, could Mr. Breslin refer to the detailed specification and the bill quantity.  I presume these are all made available to the tenderer at the time in order that the tenderer can present a valid tender.</p></speech>

That was carried out without the costs being present in what it was evaluating.  It evaluated the quality and the technical detail of the tender.</p></speech>

Normally I would not have this information.  Normally the process is sealed like a drum and nobody can interact with it.  In these circumstances, we obviously have information on it, which I am passing on to the Deputy, but I was not in the process.</p> <p>  To clarify a point in which I believe the Deputy is interested, my understanding of the scoring is that quality and price were assessed and that there was a proportion of 25% for quality and 75% for price.  Therefore, the most economically advantageous was awarded.</p></speech>

In a previous existence, many of my colleagues and I would have been cautious about tenders, particularly the testing of a tender.  It is illegal to qualify a tender, or in theory, at least.  In the case in question, however, I am concerned that all kinds of figures have been thrashed around over the past few weeks as to where the project came from and went.  My summation is that, in the initial stages, the project was not adequately costed from the point of view of the client.  If it had been, we would not have that degree of overrun we have now.  For that reason, I am asking what competence existed among board members to assess the validity and basis for the tender.  For instance, why did somebody not say accepting the lowest tender price could result in the making of the wrong decision, thereby undermining the whole process?  Could Mr. Breslin elucidate how we can prevent that kind of thing from happening again?  Would the same thing happen again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#L02300"><p>There are two points.  There was a clear approach to the competency that would be needed among the professional staff of the development board, who were recruited by the development board, and among those on the board.  If there is one body that was specifically set up for the task it was being given, it is this body.  It was not an existing body that was asked to take on something different on the basis that since it looked like it was good at doing a certain thing, it might consider doing something different.  This was a body that was specifically set up for the purpose of executing the children's hospital.  It recruited competent individuals for that task.  The PwC review will consider the procurement process very carefully, how it was managed, whether the right process was utilised, how it was utilised, and whether the approach taken was fully in line with best practice.  We will by the end of March have independent experts saying how this was handled.  That will be important for us all to see.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#L02400"><p>Could I add to that?  There are two points I would make.  The first, which echoes the Secretary General's, is important.  We have had, and I have appeared before, Oireachtas committees that have predetermined the outcome of expert reports only to be proven to be 100% incorrect.  We have had committees talking about cover-ups and the like.</p><p>We have expert reports, such as that produced by Dr. Scally, that found that there was none.  If we are going down the route of an expert inquiry, which we are, have been collaborative in trying to make sure those terms of reference are robust and have taken on board and addressed the weaknesses in them that were rightly highlighted by members of this committee, we should allow it to do its work.  I know the Deputy is a believer in that due process.  </p><p> This should be a cause of great frustration and concern to all of us because if we look at the competencies and skill sets of the people on the board of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board and take out the names because this is not about personalities, it does read like a "Who's Who" in terms of who we would want to develop capital projects.  Without getting into the names, we are talking about chartered engineers, former managing directors of very large construction companies, a solicitor with 40 years' experience in dealing with public authorities, developers, architects, engineers, surveyors and builders.  We are talking about people who have won significant commendation or who are members of the International Court of Arbitration along with chartered engineers, a former president of the Institution of Engineers of Ireland, a founding director of the Environmental Protection Agency, an architect by profession, people who have worked outside the jurisdiction, a fellow of the Royal Institute of Architects, a deputy chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and a procurement expert.  Often politicians are accused of tapping random people on the shoulder and saying "congratulations, you're on this board because you're a branch chair" or something stupid like that.  I am not saying this to throw bouquets at the Government because I did not make these decisions.  This was and is a competency-based board in terms of the skill sets of its members to deliver major projects.  That adds to the frustration.  The board had such a skill set yet, clearly, the price the Government presumed to be the price of the national children's hospital based on all of the expert and professional advice available to that board - &euro;983 million - turned out to be a far higher cost.  I hear people jump up and down about this project and how it will cost &euro;2 billion and more than that.  Can we please let the record show that the sanctioned sum for this project is &euro;1.4 billion?  We have asked PwC to look at how we can mitigate some of those costs.  Included within that &euro;1.4 billion along with money wasted - &euro;40 million on the Mater site that never took off - is an effort to get philanthropy.  Something that is not included but must be considered is the future role of the assets we have such as Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, when it moves to a new hospital and the value on that in terms of new services being delivered there or funding that could be provided towards the cost of this new hospital.  </p></speech>

Was the bill of quantities around at that time?  It should have been and I presume it was.  I know the bill of quantities was ultimately found to be short of the target.  Why was that not spotted at the stage when it should have been spotted?  From the cost increases in front of me, which I will not go through again, it appears there was a serious deficiency in the degree to which the tenderer could assess the price and come up with a competitive price and, at the same time, not come up with a shortfall if that information was not precise.  Given that three projects are running together - the one in the children's hospital, the one in the urgent care centre in Blanchardstown and the one in Tallaght - to what extent were they all examined at the same time with a view to identifying possible snags because when there are three different projects and three different sites, there is the potential for something to go wrong?</p></speech>

The Government of the day consciously made a decision, which remains the Government's position, that the best way of delivering this project was to bring in that expertise and professionalism rightly referred to by the Deputy that, with no disrespect to my Department, does not exist in-house in the Department such is the scale and magnitude of this.  Appointing a competency-based board that I have described as a "Who's Who" in terms of professional qualifications and experience allowed it to bring in professional expertise.  The legal power did not reside with me or the Department in terms of the awarding.  It resided with the development board.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the bill of quantities.  He reminded me of something.  The benefit of this two-stage procurement process - the GMP process as it is now known - was that it actually locked in the price per item at 2016 costs.  We were badly let down by the quantities being entirely incorrect.  Members have heard that in the evidence given to this committee and other committees.  The cost of a widget is still at the 2016 level but they need a hell of a lot more widgets.  I want to know who messed that up, and it is one of the reasons the Government wants a review.  Who got that wrong?  When we know who got that wrong, we will take action.  PwC will not take the action.  That is not what it does.  It will identify what happened and then we will act.  We will act as a Government whether it is through powers we have under contracts we may have had with professional companies or whether it is through changes in governance structures, boards or personnel.  There are lots of reasons for the composition of the &euro;1.4 billion but that is really where a large proportion of it is.  The good thing is that prices were locked in at 2016 levels but the really worrying thing was that quantities were so off.  The quantities were not decided by me or the Deputy.  They were decided by professionals who were paid a handsome fee to get this right and that is what we must get to the bottom of.</p></speech>

Time seems to be very short.  I was just beginning to enjoy myself.  The main question for the benefit of the State, the client and the committee involves giving some indication as to what we have learned in this process.  For example, how do we get professionals who, having read a detailed specification, can come up with a bill of quantities that gives a clear indication of what the costs will be and then we can put the guaranteed maximum price in place?  If we do not learn something from it, we could find ourselves back in the same position.</p> <p>  The phrase "who knew what, who said what to whom and when?" comes from the McCarthy investigations in the US a long time ago.  What that means is that by asking a series of confusing questions in rapid order, one can implicate the friends and relatives of all the people who are being questioned in a way that proves a point that is extremely vague to say the least and only because it is obvious.  The most recent effort in this regard was the investigation into the Garda Commissioner by the Committee of Public Accounts where several allegations were made about serious wrongdoing and knowledge by the Commissioner and the Minister of the day.  This is a serious issue.  Playing politics is one thing but this is a serious matter that we do not want to be repeated.  It transpired that there was no basis for the allegations or supposition and all that was happening was a tourist project on behalf of people who wanted to make a name for themselves at the expense of somebody else.  If the Committee of Public Accounts goes down that road once again, there will be repercussions.  Could the Minister answer the question about the learning curve?  </p></speech>

Robust questioning is a really important part of any democracy but so too is due process.  I do not believe it is the job, or the only job, of a Minister to find partial information, chuck it out into the media or on the floor of the D&aacute;il and say: "That's grand.  Job done.  I told you all about the problem."  I believe the job of a Minister is to make decisions based on full facts, make sure due diligence is carried out, stress test things and then make difficult decisions.  I have often reflected in recent weeks and months that perhaps the easiest way to get through being Minister for Health is to keep the head down and do nothing.

There is a reason the children's hospital was first mentioned in these Houses in the 1960s.  My mother was born in the 1960s.  How long does this have to go on for?  We are building this hospital.  We are going to get to the question but we are going to get to it in a logical way, which brings me to the next point about what we learn.  The learnings from this will be far bigger than just my Department.</p><p>Thankfully, we are back in an era of growth, in capital terms, and of doing big projects.  That is good and that is why I am excited about the appointment I have made of Mr. Fred Barry to the new chair of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  As CEO of the National Roads Authority, Mr. Barry showed an ability to demand that projects got delivered on time and on budget.  He will bring a forensic eye to the issue and he has my full support.</p><p> We also need to be careful that we do not presume, yet again, that these increases were avoidable and that if everybody had not made loads of big mistakes, the figure would have been &euro;983 million.  Even without the PwC report, we know there was user engagement and that, after the Government decision of April 2017, there was further engagement with staff and patients.  Staff and patients made other changes that were appropriate, though I do not suggest it represented a big amount.  I believe it was some &euro;20 million.  There was a High Court ruling on fire safety standards and, while there were safety precautions in the existing hospital, the High Court stated that we had to do more and this cost several millions more.  We need to differentiate between the costs that were unavoidable and those that could have been avoided if people had done their job.  It is not within my competence to do this and that is why we have brought in PwC.  We should not jump to category 2 and presume everything sits in that bucket.  If we did that, we could cancel the external review and issue findings now.</p></speech>

Does the Minister think that he and the health sector are unravelling?  He is reminding me of a knitted jumper from the sleeve of which the wool is coming away.  There is the overspend, the nurses' strike and cervical smears and GPs are outside today.  Does he see that he is unravelling before our eyes?</p></speech>

I have not knitted since primary school but I get the reality of what the Deputy is saying.  It is a political charge but it is, as is always the case with the Deputy, one that is made very politely.  I do not see that.  I am very proud of the record I have so far in the Department of Health.  Like many before me, I have made mistakes and I would rather have done some things in a different way.  However, on my watch we have worked together to repeal the eighth amendment, we have introduced the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2018 and we are building a national children's hospital that others have shirked, or tried to build on sites on which they could not even get planning permission, wasting &euro;40 million in the process.  We are increasing the number of nurses, with 3,300 more nurses working in the health service in the past five years.  We have challenges in health, but that has always been the case no matter who the Minister was, whether it was the Deputy's party leader, a former leader of her party, my own party leader or anybody else.  All of us have one thing in common, which is that we all face challenges.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony referenced CervicalCheck but I do not think the Chair would appreciate it if I opened up a big debate on that, though I look forward to the debate on the matter in the D&aacute;il this evening.  I take comfort in my work from the comments of people who have been impacted by the CervicalCheck audit, who know the work I have done and have articulated their view of the way I have, quite publicly, worked with them.  They are the people whose views on my political record I care about rather than those of political opponents.</p> <p>  The recent period has been very challenging and many issues have come together at the same time.  We will work our way through them.  We will resolve the nurses' strike because all disputes get resolved.  It does not fall just to me to do that as there is a central government pay policy issue, but disputes are resolved by engaging, and that needs to happen urgently.  On GPs, the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, circular to members referred to the significant progress we were making in moving beyond the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, and reversing the cuts that were imposed by the Deputy's party and mine during the economically different years.  I will work as hard as I can to work through the issues, though we will not solve them all.</p></speech>

He said there was a way to deal with the issues and he was, I believe, more optimistic than he was originally interpreted as being about it.</p></speech>

There may be a new figure for what the Department of Health is getting and the question will be what the impact will be.  There is a context to all of this.  The capital budget of the Department of Health and the HSE is almost &euro;700 million.  We have to find &euro;50 million during the course of 2019, and while we would rather not have to find it but have an extra &euro;50 million instead, it is &euro;50 million out of &euro;700 million.  The entire capital budget for the State is approximately &euro;7 billion, with the increase alone being &euro;1.1 billion.  The entire Government has to find &euro;100 million, and while I do not want to be flippant about it, it has to be seen in that context.  It is a question of paying a bill a month or two late, or staggering the starting times of projects, but there will not be a widespread cancellation of projects.</p></speech>

She was retested with a cervical smear because her first test was inconclusive.  The Minister asked me to write to him and he wrote back with a generic letter that stated it was important that she be rechecked.  She did this in November but she is still waiting for the results.  She is a symbol of many women throughout the country.  Her test was inconclusive and this is a worry for her as people need to know.  Are there any plans in place to extend the long-term illness list?</p></speech>

I answered questions on CervicalCheck in the D&aacute;il yesterday and we have a debate with questions and answers on the issue today.  I remember the Deputy's letter and the case of Ann, which she raised here.  There are no two ways about it.  We have a very significant backlog in our CervicalCheck programme, with an average waiting time of some 22 weeks.  I do not suggest that is appropriate, desirable or acceptable, but I want Ann, and everybody else who is affected, to know that everything possible is being done to drive the waiting time down, including the HSE working to find additional capacity.  This is very challenging as there is a global shortage in cytology, but the HSE is working on a capacity plan, which I expect to receive shortly.  I think the Deputy knows that this is not a resourcing issue.  If we could write a cheque to solve this problem, we would write it in the morning.</p> <p>  There are two reasons for the backlog.  When the CervicalCheck controversy broke, many people, including some in this room, asked if people could have a repeat smear test and whether they would have to pay for it.  People said it was not fair that a woman could get that assurance if she could afford it but that, if she could not, she would have to wait three years.  At a time of great uncertainty, it was not easy to provide clarity on our screening programme and we needed to wait for Dr. Scally's report for that.  Contrary to the cheap political charges that have been made against me, I took the decision, in conjunction with my officials and the Chief Medical Officer, to offer the free repeat smear test and I negotiated the fee to be paid to GPs with the IMO.  This has meant many women went for tests, and while many got reassurance, it has contributed to the backlog.</p> <p>  The second reason is something we saw in the UK, which became known as the Jade Goody effect.  After Jade Goody's high-profile illness, many women opted into the screening service, and while I am not sure of the figures, this could account for up to one third of the backlog.  This estimate has not been validated so I cannot stand over it.</p><p>Up to a third of the backlog could be new women signing up to the screening programme who had not participated but  I am awaiting figures on that.  They are the reasons behind the backlog.  The people, who are working night and day, are very familiar to this committee.  People, like Mr. Damien McCallion, in the HSE are doing everything they possibly can on this and I am very confident about that.</p><p> I have been told cervical cancer is something that can develop over a period of ten to 15 years and that the clinical risk is low but Dr. McKenna is much more qualified to speak about clinical risk than I am.</p></speech>

The programme dealt with an expansion of more than 100,000 smears, which is against the backdrop of the programme doing approximately 250,000 every year.  That is a very substantial increase in number.  The other thing to bear in mind is that it is very difficult now to get screeners internationally because as screeners see that the programmes internationally will be moving to human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV, it is not considered to be a career that has, necessarily, a long-term future.  Therefore, the number of screeners internationally is decreasing and currently this is not regarded to be a particularly friendly environment for companies to work in.</p> <p>  One of the American laboratories, which has been coming in for criticism, has proven to be very helpful and the HSE has funded the development of the Coombe laboratory which will in the future be able to provide a much larger capacity to read smears in a publicly-funded laboratory, which as a medium-term to long-term goal, will be very helpful.</p></speech>

Exactly the opposite has happened here.  While there is undoubtedly is much concern, it is overstating it to say that women have lost confidence.  They are appearing.  They understand the message and that currently this is the only way we have of detecting cervical cancer.  I do not subscribe to the notion that people have totally lost confidence in this. Of course, it could be improved.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the waiting lists for the assessment of needs and after that for the therapies are particularly high in Cork and Kerry.  Why is Cork way higher than the national average and what is the Minister of State going to do about it?</p></speech>

We accept the argument that waiting lists in Cork and Kerry are particularly high.  There seems to be high number of young children with disabilities coming into the services.  That is something we have put a strong focus on.</p> <p>  I am doing a number of things to deal with the issue and there are a number of initiatives are under way.  The first is that we are trying to reorganise the disability services in geographical teams under the progressing disabilities services programme.  We are trying to clear a pathway for children, irrespective of their disability, so they can get services.</p> <p>  Another initiative is the new standard operating procedure for assessment of need, the purpose of which is to ensure that children and their families access appropriate assessment and intervention as early as possible.  Another initiative, which is very important, is that we are doing much in-school early years speech and language therapy.  We are doing occupational therapy demonstration projects in different areas also.  This is something we have rolled out already and it is made up of 75 preschools, 60 primary schools and 15 post-primary schools indifferent areas.</p> <p>  We have taken the points raised by the Deputy very seriously that we need to improve the number of speech and language therapists in the system and we are recruiting more speech and language therapists in the services.  We got a budget for 100 therapists and we will try to drive that higher as we go along.  I take the point that there are issues but the assessment of need is very important and I will focus on that.  We need to understand that the additional therapy posts will make a dent in this as well.  There were industrial relations issues behind the scenes but these have been resolved and I am confident that we can roll-out the services for these young families.</p> <p>  This is a priority for me in 2019 because when took office three years ago, we had the school leavers' issue, the respite issue and other issues within the disability services but listening to colleagues, like Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, we have to do something about the assessment of needs.  That has started and I will drive that forward in 2019.</p></speech>

I would like to go back to the hospital contract issue and to the Department.  In planning for this project, I presume the Department would have looked at other projects internationally where new hospitals had been built.  The Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, for instance, which has 371 beds, cost &pound;504 million in 2004, which translates to approximately &euro;680 million.  A project in Ontario is costing Canadian $2.4 billion dollars, which is equivalent to &euro;1.68 billion.  The interesting thing about the Ontario project is that it has received approximately Canadian $1.3 billion dollars in donations from the public for building that hospital.</p> <p>  Our project was always going to be a huge one, with 6,151 rooms in the hospital.  My understanding is that at any one time there will be approximately 140 outpatient clinics running.  The building itself will be approximately the length of Grafton Street.  When one then considers projects that went radically wrong in the past, for instance, the Dublin Port tunnel, where the project went from &euro;250 million to &euro;900 million, the Department must have been aware, in terms of dealing with any issue, that precise detail would have had to have been worked out at a very early stage.  Were all those risks identified at an early stage?</p> <p>  When exactly were the various stages of contracts signed?  For instance, the Department states that the tender came in at &euro;637 million and we ended up in April at &euro;983 million.  Can we get an outline of the additional items which were added to the &euro;637 million figure?  I presume these are mechanical and electrical items.  Do we have the exact figures on those so that we can make up the margin from &euro;637 million to &euro;983 million?</p><p>When exactly were the contracts for those various additional items signed?  Were they all signed in December 2018 or at an earlier stage?  Why did it take so long to work out the finite detail, which is about where everything would be located in each room?  Planning permission was granted in April 2016.  When the tenders were invited, a bill of quantities was prepared and sent out to all of those who were tendering for the project.  I presume it was known at that stage that certain items were not included in that.  When did the process of working out the finite detail start?  If the second highest tender had been selected, would the other additional mechanical and electrical items still have worked out at the same price or would there have been a difference?  There is a need for clarity on the move from &euro;637 million to &euro;983 million and on how everything progressed after that.</p></speech>

I listened to the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, talking about this on the radio last weekend.  He spoke about the huge volume of work that he and his Ministers did in his time, in terms of the discussion about the need for a children's hospital, what other countries have done, what sites were available and so on.  I was struck by the fact that so many Ministers of Health, Governments and taoisigh have been involved in this project.  This is something that was probably scrutinised, considered and debated more than any other capital project and bizarrely, it has still yet to be delivered.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke referenced some projects that ran over budget but were delivered.  I heard some members of the commentariat refer in recent days to other public projects like Thornton Hall on which &euro;50 million of taxpayers' money was spent, the Mater Hospital site on which &euro;40 million was spent, as well as e-voting machines, PPARS and so on and try to compare them to this project.  Obviously, that is such a ridiculous analogy because the difference with all of them is that none of them happened.  This children's hospital is going to open.  Indeed, the Connolly part of it will open this summer.  The X-ray machine was delivered this week and it is going to start serving kids this year.  </p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke is right to raise the issue of the comparative costs with other countries and the international comparisons.  AECOM completed an external report on this and estimated that the cost of this project is approximately &euro;6,500 per sq. m.  Regarding international comparisons, it estimated that the cost of building the equivalent paediatric hospital in London would be &euro;9,000 per sq. m.  The report also referred to the spectrum of the costs being somewhere between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000 per sq. m.  If one was to measure the project just by bed numbers, one could get a great headline figure about the world's most expensive hospital.  However, paediatric healthcare is about a hell of lot more than just putting a child in a bed and in that context, this project is not the world's most expensive hospital or anything like it.  We will move from having 14 theatres today serving children in Ireland - and we all know the impact of only having 14 theatres in terms of waiting times - to 22 theatres.  There will be outdoor space so that kids can exercise and get fresh air.  I heard something on radio recently which went unchallenged.  I heard somebody on radio ask why we need so much outdoor space in the new hospital, given that there are lots of parks in Dublin to which the kids could go.  That sort of ignorant comment is incredible and the person who said it should get in his or her car and visit Crumlin or Temple Street hospitals and look the children there in the eye and repeat it.  Some of the children have spent most of their lives in hospital while others have been there for months on end.  They cannot go to the local park because they are ill.  </p> <p>  Serious questions must be answered regarding this project and we need to get to the bottom of serious issues but gathering in a radio studio to wax lyrical about Thornton Hall and open spaces shows a lack of basic understanding of the matter.  I will now ask the Secretary General to comment on some of the figures and comparisons referred to by the Senator.</p></speech>

The design team recruited by the development board includes international expertise that delivered hospital facilities internationally.  They visited those sites and also reviewed, in detail, the design they adopted, the adjacencies in terms of which departments fit best together and the facilities that have been put in.</p></speech>

That process of research informed the design brief, against which the hospital will be built.  The Senator asked when the contracts were signed.  The briefing note given to last week's meeting references the main contracts signing dates.  The contract with the main contractor and the two specialist contractors was signed on 3 August 2017.  As we said earlier, the instruction of the phase B works took place on 8 January 2019.</p> <p>  The Senator asked why it took so long to finalise the detail.  It took so long because it is a very technical process to get to a final design.  The option that existed was not to go to the market but to wait for all of that work to be done, which could have taken two years.  We would then be pricing things at a higher level, when we could have gone with our outline design.  That is what the technical exercise of getting down to the very nitty-gritty detail of every room and every piece of plant takes.  The choice was to do an outline design, to go the market and get pricing against that and then to remeasure it, based on the detailed design or else to hold off for two years and go in one go.  That will obviously be examined now but that was a strategic choice made by the development board.  The board decided that it was better to get into the market and get the prices locked down at 2016 levels.</p> <p>  The Senator asked a question about the second bidder.  It is important to say that if the second bidder for the main contract had been selected, which was not the lowest bidder, we would still have had the process for selecting the mechanical and electrical elements.  We would have had to look at those competitions as well.  The lowest bidders were accepted for all three elements.  The main contract was awarded to BAM and the mechanical and electrical contracts were awarded separately.  Then they were brought together as part of the whole construction programme.</p></speech>

In terms of the figure increasing from &euro;637 million to &euro;983 million, that includes the outpatient and urgent care centres, equipping, planning and design team fees, contingency and elements of VAT.  We can work that up from the &euro;637 million to &euro;983 million for the Senator.</p> <p>  The final question was about what would have happened if the contract was awarded to the second bidder.  The second bidder would have gone through the same process of final design and remeasuring of the bill of quantities.  It would have been entitled to look for an uplift for the increase in quantities.  It is not that in awarding the contract to the second bidder, whose bid was approximately &euro;130 million above the lowest bidder, we were likely to get the product for that price.  Once we started to adjust the final design and add in extra quantities, the second bidder would have been entitled to increase the price which it had tendered on a lower level of quantity.</p></speech>

How will the cost overruns on this project will affect other projects?  Project Ireland 2040 contains plans for an elective hospital in Cork, for example.  The population in Cork city and county has increased by 130,000 over the past 30 years but no new beds have been opened in any of the area's hospitals over that period.  It is my understanding that a committee was to be established to help to identify a site for a new hospital.  That committee has still not met and I am concerned that this project is now on the back foot.  I ask for a commitment from the Minister that the committee will be set up within the next four weeks and will meet at an early date thereafter.  It has not even started identifying a site.  This is an important project.  It is an elective-only hospital.  The other issue that arises is whether there have been discussions with the two voluntary hospitals that provide a crucial service to the city and county of Cork as well as to the wider Munster region.</p><p>I am concerned that while there is a focus on the Dublin area now in relation to hospitals - the focus on a new maternity hospital in Dublin, the children's hospital and the work going on in D&uacute;n Laoghaire - we have not even had a meeting of the committee to help identify a site, let alone go through the planning process.  I wonder if we can get a commitment on that issue at this stage.</p></speech>

I need to refer to it as a projected overrun because we have just asked PwC to come back to how we can rein in the costs.  I want members and, most importantly, taxpayers, to know that trying to rein the costs is now what needs to happen.  That is why I have asked Mr. Fred Barry, with his expertise, to take up a role.  It is also why I have amended the terms of reference and asked PwC to look at how we can mitigate costs.  It is also why I stated at this committee, for the first time publicly, that issues such as what future role Crumlin hospital can play in terms of resources for this project must be considered and examined.  I suppose the benefit of the GMP two-stage process is that the overrun becomes apparent before it happens, whereas generally in procurement, we hear about it afterwards and all bemoan the fact.  We know about this now.  There is no overrun today.  There is a projected overrun.  What are we going to do?  It is an important point that we try to grapple with together.</p> <p>  I understand, and know well, Senator Colm Burke's interest in health in general and in the elective-only hospitals in particular, as well as the fact that the Cork region lacks an adequate number of beds per head of population.  I am sure the Senator will not mind me making the point that when we talk about the national children's hospital, it is not a project for Dublin.</p></speech>

It is a project for the country that has to be located somewhere and happens to be located in Dublin.</p> <p>  As for the elective-only hospitals, a significant body of work is being done in my Department on deciding what these will do and deciding the policy framework.  I visited Scotland not that long ago to look at its elective-only hospitals and its model.  I am hoping that we will complete that policy piece of work in 2019.  I will give a commitment to Senator Colm Burke to meet him and Oireachtas Members from Cork within four weeks to discuss the next steps in the preparatory work that could be taken in Cork.  I am happy to give the commitment through this committee that I will arrange in the next month for this to happen.</p> <p>  I dealt with the issue of capital in general when the Senator was out of the room but I am happy to repeat it.  There needs to be a context to this.  I understand people are worried and want to know what is the impact of this and what will not happen as a result of this.  The Government has been very clear.  Everything we have committed to will happen.  That is the first point.  Projects will not be cancelled.  A total of 80%% of the health capital budget is spent on projects that are not the national children's hospital.  At present, 25% of our population are children and 20% of our capital budget is being spent on a hospital for children while 80% is being spend on projects that have nothing to do with the national children's hospital.  The budget for the Department of Health from a capital point of view has increased by 165% for the next ten years.  In real terms, that means the capital budget for the next ten years is almost &euro;11 billion, compared with &euro;4 billion for the past ten years.  I would much rather not be in this situation.  The Senator should not get me wrong in that regard but at least we are trying to deal with this situation in a time of rising, rather than static or shrinking capital budgets.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will bring proposals on capital re-profiling for 2019 to Cabinet shortly, as he outlined yesterday, and we will make any adjustments we are required to make then.  I certainly do not see the adjustments in health capital projects in 2019 being in any way significant.  It is manageable in 2019.</p></speech>

That even involves starting off by identifying a site.  It is about setting the structure in order that everyone, from the hospital to the university and the two local authorities, Cork city and Cork county, is involved and we can get on with identifying where this hospital should go and move on from there, rather than what happened in Dublin, where it went on for ten or 15 years before the site was identified and then it turned out that An Bord Plean&aacute;la held that the size of project could not go ahead on the Mater site.  I do not want that to happen in Cork, namely, that there was a further delay of seven years arising from what occurred.  I want this committee set up in order that it can identify the most appropriate place for this elective hospital and that we can get on with the other work thereafter.  We do not even have a site identified and we do not even have a committee meeting.</p></speech>

We will take a break from the children's hospital for the minute.  I have a few issues in this regard.</p> <p>  As the Minister will be aware, recently there were breaches of patients' privacy and knowledge of terminations happening in hospitals.  In terms of the alleged breaches of patient privacy, what action has the Minister taken?  The reason I am concerned about this, other than for obvious reasons, is it was flagged by both committees, namely, the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and the subsequent Select Committee on Health on which we dealt with legislation, that some people perceive this to be a separate issue and therefore, confidentiality does not seem to apply to it.  This is extremely concerning.  The whole point was that we would be able to care for women in a compassionate way in their own country.  If people are concerned when they go for a termination of pregnancy, or seek to have one, that their details might be in the public domain, that inevitably will lead to back-street abortions or to women still travelling.  Consequently, it defeats the purpose of what we spent two years doing.  The Minister might refer to that.  We spent a lot of time last year talking about data protection and having systems in place and how even we Deputies had to sort out our houses in terms of data protection.  Here, we have, at a basic level, what is to my mind a very serious breach.</p> <p>  What actions can be taken against rogue agencies that have contacted this particular lady?   I also am being told that GPs are being contacted randomly by people purporting to have ultrasound machines they can use to date pregnancies.  There appears to be a bit of skulduggery going on in the background, all of which is adding up to a difficult and dangerous situation for women.  The Minister might comment on that point.</p> <p>  As far as I am aware, the Rotunda has pulled back from 12 weeks to 11 weeks in terms of providing the parameters.  We spoke on Committee Stage about somebody being on the cusp of the 12 weeks and how we would manage that.  Here we are with a self-imposed 11-week end-period by the Rotunda.  Is the Rotunda in breach of the legislation or is it acceptable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#Q00800"><p>I thank Deputy O'Connell for raising these important matters.  I will take them sequentially.</p><p>Like the Deputy, I am extremely disturbed that there is an attempt by some, despite a referendum and the legislation, still to think it is in some way acceptable to treat termination of pregnancy services differently from other legally authorised services in the Irish health service.  We will not stand for it and I thank the director general of the HSE for the swift action she has taken after I engaged with the HSE.</p><p>There are two separate, but interlinked, matters that at the same fundamental level have that disgusting attitude to women's healthcare.  The first is the idea that there would be fake My Options websites.  We set up a 24-7 helpline and an informative website that gives a woman information, in a non-directional way, on all of her options, including abortion.  The director general outlined in her opening statement the success of that website and telephone line, in terms of women now being able to have a conversation with a health-qualified professional, rather than having a conversation with Google or an airline.  That has worked fairly well.</p><p>The idea that people would endeavour to fake being that website is fairly despicable.  First, I echo the advice of the HSE that any information from the HSE displays its logo and <i>myoptions.ie</i>is the best way to access the site, rather than hoping Google searches will come across it.  We cannot promote the <i>myoptions.ie</i>web address enough in terms of women knowing that is where one goes for reputable information.</p><p>The HSE, at my request, has now looked into that matter and has initiated legal proceedings in the form of cease and desist.  Those legal proceedings relating to the owner of the so-called &quot;fake&quot; website were initiated on Saturday, 2 February.  The director general may wish to add to that.  I thank her and the HSE for showing leadership and swift action on this.</p><p>The second issue is the issue of potential data breaches.</p><p>We have seen two examples.  We saw one where an allegation emerged on social media that at a certain time a termination was taking place in a certain hospital, and we saw another - we can talk about it because it is in the public domain - where a woman who accessed a termination through the National Maternity Hospital found herself being contacted in the most despicable way by people opposed to the provision of this service pretending to be others.  Hospital group CEOs are investigating that to establish in the first instance if the data breach happened.  I assure members, as I know the HSE will, that we will not tolerate such data breaches.  Whether a person is getting a hip replacement, accessing termination, having a cataract operation or to talking to his or her doctor, that person is entitled to privacy in relation to his or her medical information.  That is not a privacy that is partial or complete, dependent on a person's view as to the service.</p><p> On the Rotunda Hospital, the law is the law, and the law is clear.  Twelve weeks is the outer limit, the cut-off point legally, for accessing termination without specific indication in our country.  Beyond that, as Deputy O'Connell knows better than most, the grounds relate to one's health, life and fatal foetal abnormalities.  However, 12 weeks is the cut-off, not 11 weeks.  The Chief Medical Officer has helpfully written to the Rotunda Hospital clarifying that.  The law is the law.  The operation of the law is a matter for clinicians and not for me, and that is right, but through the Chief Medical Officer we have written to the Rotunda to provide clarity on the matter.</p><p> The final issue I wish to mention is one that regularly comes up at the committee.  It is about making sure that we address not just the parts of the all-party committee report that relate to abortion but also the ancillary recommendations.  The committee has been pushing for access to free contraception for women, which is a recommendation of the all-party committee.  I want to let the committee know that I will be setting up a working group in my Department, including all the various divisions, the Chief Medical Officer, primary care and eligibility, and some external experts in women's health.  We will have that set up in the next few weeks to look at how we move towards expanding eligibility to free contraception for women.  It is easy enough to do for men.  We just increase the number of condoms, which we are doing this year.  To increase eligibility to free access for women is likely to require legislative change and different types of contraception, but we will have the working group established with external expertise in women&rsquo;s health in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

To correct the Minister, in terms of ancillary recommendations, it was free contraception for everyone, not just women.  I am very much in favour of vasectomies being provided in future if men want them.  Obviously, it would not be mandatory.</p></speech>

That is very generous.  We will be here for the day probably.  As Mr. Breslin and the Minister know, I sit on both the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  A few issues arose that I hope we will get through today.  Something came up on Thursday.  I want this hospital.  I want it to continue.  I do not want it to be paused or stopped.  I am fully aware of the political pressures and medical politics that have led to the delay of this hospital that was first mooted in 1962.  Sometimes I feel as if I am banging my head off a wall in here.  I am very concerned about the future of the project.  I spoke late last Thursday evening in this same room at the Committee of Public Accounts about the liquidity of BAM.  What I am concerned about is the situation with subcontractors that are being given jobs by BAM, such as M&amp;E, which keeps being mentioned as one subcontractor.  Does BAM have enough headroom if one of the subcontractors goes bust?  If M&amp;E goes bust and is not liquid and the job has been given at whatever price, what happens then?  I was not happy with the answer I got last Thursday evening in that, for me, this is about not having a hospital half way out of the ground.</p> <p>  We spoke on 16 January about specification with regard to the hospital and we heard about the famous 5 km of cables and we did not know how many lengths of 5 km.  Last night I thought about what would not have changed from point A to B.  The windows would not have changed.  We saw a model of the hospital with the glass on the outside.  Could anybody get me the price that was quoted on the specification for the hospital for the glass on the first day and the glass on the second day?  We saw a model.  I questioned Professor Hardiman as to whether it was full of cotton wool inside the model because it was clear that nobody worked out whether there were 6,000 rooms.  We know the size of the building and the amount of glazing on the outside.  I would like to compare that figure just to see who is making the money here.</p> <p>  Mr. Breslin might come back to me after lunch on a figure on a sheet the Committee of Public Accounts was given last week.  If I remember correctly, there was a &euro;66 million saving in the 2017 costs.  I am sorry as other members of this committee might not have this document in front of them.  Unless I am reading it wrong, this &euro;66 million saving was not transferred to the 2018 costs.  I am missing &euro;66 million on that balance sheet.  Could somebody look at that on the next break and get back to me on it?  I am not happy that there is minus &euro;66 million on one side and it does not reflect on the other side.</p> <p>  I have asked for this information already.  I would like to know in terms of the people involved in this project, who was working on a fixed contract and who was working on a percentage.  Who was going to gain financially in terms of more money being spent?  Was an architect working off 1%?  Were quantity surveyors working off 3%?  Obviously, if there was more work to be done, they deserve more money but I want to know how many of those getting taxpayers' money have an elastic fee system.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Woods would like to speak at some point to his position, unless I have the wrong Mr. Woods.  He is national director of acute operations in the HSE.  He was on the 12 person board beside Mr. Quinn from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  At any point did he consider that if he was spending all his money on a children's hospital, given his role as national director of acute operations, he would not be able to do his job.  I refer to Deputy Kelly's circular 12/10.  It is fairly clear to me from that circular what his role was.</p></speech>

On 16 January 2019, this committee asked about this new governance structure that emerged in May 2017.  The gist of what I said then was that the Department never puts in a new governance structure unless something is going wrong.  I am still worried about that date in May 2017 as to why that new governance structure was put in place.  From memory - I think I used these words - I asked what sparked the creation of that board.  I think that is where we will find our answers to this.</p></speech>

To give the Deputy an example, during the course of 2017, the Department of Health and the Minister brought the Children's Health Ireland legislation through this committee.  That was passed in November 2018.  By 1 January 2019 we had to have Children's Health Ireland established with a bank account and with the staff transferring from the three constituent hospitals on to the payroll of Children's Health Ireland.  That is just one example of how various strands, and tasks being executed by one element within the overall programme, have to be co-ordinated.  We were going to have to do that all the way to go live, that was the issue.  We did not want to find ourselves in 2023 with a building complete but with the technology, the electronic health record, not complete or with the staff not having transferred.  There was a co-ordination mechanism to put in place to make sure all of the milestones by each of the entities involved was to be executed.  That does not take from the responsibility of the individual entities for the execution of the responsibilities they have statutorily been given but it is a co-ordination task that needs to sit above that.</p></speech>

Would people not be correct to be pretty sceptical?  The GPs are protesting outside because we have a crisis in general practice.  We have a national nurses strike over pay, recruitment and retention.  We have a national ambulance strike which we do not seem interested in resolving.  We have a desperate trolley crisis and hundreds of thousands of people on hospital waiting lists.  We have a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, CAMHS, which is 50% understaffed and a major crisis in community mental health.  We have a CervicalCheck scandal, a &euro;600 million overrun in the health budget and the cherry on top, from a Fine Gael Government that prides itself on prudence and fiscal rectitude, we have a cost escalation for this project going from &euro;400 million when Fine Gael came into power to &euro;1.4 billion for the hospital itself, and &euro;1.7 billion in total.  At an elementary level, is it not a shambles, that this has happened collectively for the years of Fine Gael Government from the time of the then Minister, James Reilly through Deputy Leo Varadkar to the present Minister?  That is not improvement.  We are actually reaching the worst point of a crisis in the health service at just about every level.  Is that not a reasonable comment, given what is going on?  Is that not a reasonable perception that the public would have at present?</p></speech>

If one asks patients who spent a night in a hospital last year or the year before how they found their treatment by the health service, how they found their experience from the moment they went into the emergency department, how they went to the ward and how they were discharged back home and how they got into the community and whether they had a good or very good experience, some 84% of people said good or very good.  They are the people who actually used the health service.  People are not as negative as-----</p></speech>

That is my first point.  The second point, which never gets discussed here bizarrely, is that people measure the health service through a very limited prism.  I accept there are access challenges in respect of getting into the health service.  That is a valid and fair criticism but if one looks at survival rates for cancer, for strokes, for heart attacks, life expectancy being above the EU average and the fact that a baby girl born in a hospital across the road today has a very good chance of living to be 100, how is it that anything my Department or the Government funds that goes well in the health service has nothing to do with the Government and the Department and anything that goes bad has everything to do with it?  These are conscious decisions that we as a Government and indeed previous Governments, made.  For example, the current leader of Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the smoking ban.  There are things that have been done in our health service that have significantly improved the outcomes of our people.  I find it somewhat hard to square the circle where one of the things that Deputy Boyd Barrett criticised me for is the overrun in the health service last year, an overrun that has happen nearly every year, and then listed out a number of other things that had I done that would have actually tripled the overrun.  The Deputy wants me to sort out the nurses strike at a cost of &euro;300 million a year and to rectify the GP budget and then he is being critical that we cannot live with budget.

We have not had a chance to discuss these today but perhaps we will at some point because there is still an industrial relations dispute with 40,000 nurses and midwives, which is very serious and is having a serious impact on patient safety, that we need to resolve.  If people want to try to resolve the disputes through the parameters of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the public service stability agreement, we are ready and wanting to engage intensively.</p></speech>

Now he is batting off the answers to all of these questions, as well as essential responsibility to PwC, when it has been the auditor of BAM, the contractor at the centre of this issue, for nine years.  PwC has received &euro;30 million in fees from BAM.  It also works for the HSE.  Can we honestly put faith in it to do this task and not fear a serious conflict of interest?  This is particularly relevant, given that ordinary people believe they have been had.  A company comes in with a bid which turns out to be a gross underestimation of the actual cost of the hospital.  The ones who are going to look into how it happened are the same people who audited the company, BAM International, or whatever it is called, for nine years.  Moreover, it seems no one was made aware at the time - Ministers included - that there was a gap of &euro;130 million between the BAM bid and the next bid.  Were the Ministers made so aware?  No one said the gap was a little odd.  If it was &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million, it might be credible, but there was a gap of &euro;130 million between the lowest bidder and the next bidder and no one thought it a little odd.  That is extraordinary, especially when BAM had a record of cases in which the company had significantly overrun, both in this country and internationally.  As that has been well flagged in the press, I do not have time to go into it, but no one raised the need to look into it.  <br/><br/>Did anyone do the basic things?  For example, in talking about windows, did anyone ask what cost BAM had included for them?  What costs did it include for wires, bricks and all of the different components?  How did these costs compare to those included in the next bid and the one above it?  Was there a significant gap between them?  If so, did no one ask whether it was a little odd?  <b></b>I realise the Minister is not supposed to be over every single detail, but the then Minister responsible &ndash; it was probably the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, at the time &ndash; should have been aware at least of the difference and the dichotomy between the bids.  He should have called for them to be checked and sought a forensic analysis.</p></speech>

It is shared across the Oireachtas.  It is that getting in some external expertise, such is the scale of the overrun, makes sense.  Members of this and other committees suggested they would like to have an input into the terms of reference.  They had suggestions to make, on which we also acted.  I have no doubt about the competency, ability and impartiality of PwC to do a professional job and we will publish the report.</p></speech>

For the record, the HSE appointed the company and commissioned the report.  It would have followed due process in respect of there being a conflict of interest, the procurement process and the like.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a series of questions about procurement.  I am not suggesting they are not valid, but there would be serious concerns if they were questions to which I knew the answers.  Of course, the procurement process was gone through in the awarding of the contract and tender.  If the process was gone through by me or any other politician or Minister, we would be back to the dark old days of Ministers awarding contracts or endeavouring to do so.  There is a review in place that will look at all of these issues and a report will issue.  We are not asking people to wait forever and a day.  PwC will report next month and we will act on the report.  That is when responsibility and accountability will come back to me to make the decisions on the various recommendations made and what needs to be done next.</p></speech>

If I heard him correctly, he said the board knew about the escalation from &euro;61 million and had received a figure at a meeting in September.

The board was being briefed in its ongoing meetings on the issue of pricing and the gross maximum price.  That was part of the normal board process related to information that became available.  The question I was asked was when a report had been made available to the board.  To be honest, I would have to go back and look, but my recollection is that there was a report in September about concerns.  Clearly, it developed, as indicated in prior discussions here, up to the date of 9 November.</p></speech>

I will be sharp in the questions I intend to put because we are confined to five minutes.</p> <p>  My first question is for the Minister.  He will know that at the Committee of Public Accounts last week there was some discussion about capital projects that might or might not be under consideration.  There was some confusion, it has to be said, about the second catheterisation laboratory in Waterford.  I know that the Minister communicated by email with Oireachtas Members and provided clarification.  However, given that this is the first chance he has had to clarify the matter in public, I am seeking an assurance that there will be no delay of any description in giving approval for this project.  Is that the case?  Has the design team been appointed to commence the work?  It is my understanding that it will take up to 15 months to complete.  The clock only starts to tick when the design team is appointed.  Has that been done?  Is the project absolutely guaranteed?  Can the Minister give a commitment that it will not be affected by the overspend on the children's hospital project?</p></speech>

I have been dealing in a bi-partisan manner with all Oireachtas Members from Waterford, as the Deputy is aware.  He has also been operating in that way.  This project will proceed.  It is very important and we have had numerous discussions on it.  It affects not only Waterford but also the south east.  It will proceed and not be delayed as a result.  I cannot be more clear.  I do not know the answer to the question on the design team.  Perhaps Mr. Woods might answer it.  If he cannot do so, we will come back to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin said figures had been presented to the Committee of Public Accounts that were somewhat helpful, but there is still some confusion about the matter.  Perhaps either the Minister or Mr. Breslin might help me.  We are told that the original quote or tender from BAM was for &euro;637 million.  That was the original tender.</p></speech>

At the Committee of Public Accounts I asked about the figure of &euro;630 million.  The overall tender was from the three contractors.

There was haggling over the guaranteed maximum price which took a great deal of time.  The minutes of the meeting in April suggest there were difficulties with the guaranteed maximum price, yet it took until November to sign off on it.</p><p>That suited the developer, BAM, because the longer it went on, the more it was going to cost.  The cost eventually went from &euro;432 million to &euro;556 million.  Why did it take from April until November for the issue to be resolved?</p></speech>

The minutes of the meeting of the steering group on 23 April 2018 stated a number of things.  When I asked Mr. Breslin at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when he had first become aware of any serious overrun, he said it was in November and that the Minister had been informed at the same time.</p></speech>

I am on the record as to when I became aware of the figure of &euro;61 million.  It was in the autumn of 2017.  With regard to the subsequent guaranteed maximum price process and the additional costs coming out of it, I am on the record as saying that when I came back from leave in the first week of September, I read the briefings on it.</p></speech>

From my reading of the minutes of the meetings of the steering group, from November 2017 up to April 2018, there were issues with the accommodation unit.  There were concerns about the philanthropic funding and car parking.  These issues were arising, on the one hand, and, on the other, there was the issue of the guaranteed maximum price.</p></speech>

In the minutes of the meeting of the steering group in April it is stated approval of the guaranteed maximum price by the end of June was significantly at risk.  They also state the Exchequer capital budget was already under significant pressure.  The expectation was that Ronald McDonald House would pay for the accommodation unit.  Why was none of this reported at that point to the Department?  I have a request that I will make through the Committee of Public Accounts, but it might be helpful to make it on behalf of this committee also.  We have all of the minutes of the meetings of the steering group.  They seem to paint a picture that there was some discussion on the over-expenditure on a range of issues as far back as November which certainly crystallised in April.  How was the information from the steering group communicated to the board?  It would be helpful if we obtain the minutes of board meetings.  Perhaps they might give us a clearer picture.</p></speech>

There is a clear demarcation, set out in the briefing note supplied to the committee, on fire certification, programme alignment, the design team and the urgent care centre costs which add up to &euro;61 million, as well as the reference the Deputy has made to the GMP process and the fact that it was not being completed as quickly as originally scheduled.</p></speech>

I can recall clearly a report in September.  Clearly, that is included in the records of the board and can be made available.  There would have been earlier discussions and advice, perhaps even a report; I would have to look back at the records to be sure, but I am not saying there was not.  Substantively, with regard to the concerns to which the Deputy is referring, related to the &euro;450 million piece on which he has just concluded, September was certainly a time that it would have been known to a board member.  The extended period was requested to do further work on it.</p></speech>

I am just making the point that, given all of the time put in at meetings of committees, we need to have a very serious schedule of questions that will form part of what PwC is doing, whereby it can go off and verify against records in real time and report accurately.  Of course, the Deputy is entitled to ask the questions he is asking and get the answers to them, but there are others that are also worth asking.</p></speech>

We will get him back before the Committee of Public Accounts also.  It was in June 2018 that those concerned first became aware of the issue.  The actual wording was that we were on budget up to that point.  Leaving aside the 2017 figure, we were told that we were on budget up until then.  There had been no indication that there was an issue, but we are now hearing that it was known in April that potential issues were arising.  This totally contradicts what we were told at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We were told that we had been on budget until June 2018, but now we are being told that it was September when the board became aware of the issue in a report.  There may or may not have been a report before then; Mr. Woods cannot recall.  The witnesses need to get real.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  We are paying somebody &euro;450,000 to find out this information and the delegates cannot remember what happened six months ago.</p></speech>

In a situation where a bidder is stating it will supply this number at this price, then that is something that can be more accurately priced and to which a weighting can be applied.</p></speech>

I would argue that the weighting is usually around 40% and anything above that has to attract questioning.  The EU procurement guidelines are very clear.  They grant the ability to question low tenders.  If that had been done, it might not have ended up in the Four Courts.  I refer to the power to question.  I will give Mr. Breslin the guidelines.  I know he is not an expert in this area but we had individuals appointed by the Minister of Health who were experts to sit on the development board for this very reason.  They did not do their job.  They completely washed their hands of it.</p></speech>

There is an element of expertise needed to form a judgment on that.

My steering group typically meets every month or so and the board typically meets every other month.

In April 2018, Mr. John Pollock from the development board advised that approval of GMP by the end of June was at risk.

I later had a meeting of the board of the Children's Hospital Programme Project in mid-September.  I got a verbal update from the project director at that meeting and that allowed us to interrogate what the issues were.  At the previous board meeting, I think it was in June, we would certainly have been informed of the delay in the GMP process.  We would also have been informed that it might have had to be extended and that difficulty was being experienced with the contractors on the GMP process.  Quite an aggressive stance was being taken, particularly with collaboration on value engineering where there was an attempt to make savings.</p></speech>

I submitted a freedom of information request a couple of years ago.  There are references in the minutes of the board to discussions on the inflation taking place.  It was agreed that the implications of this could not be underestimated and that confirmation that this would be covered would be required so there was a clear trend in the board minutes of the Children's Hospital Group concerning the trend and a consistent reference to and concerns about that cost.  For anyone to say there were concerns around cost, even around the tendering or post-tendering stages, does not really follow through because there is a clear trend throughout this.  If we go back through the minutes, we can see that the Department of Health and the HSE were being notified about the scale of the potential inflation risks and the scale of the risks around the capital costs.</p></speech>

The development board is on record as saying that as it initiates the GMP process, in terms of the work packages, one does not just try to cost everything but rather one tries to cost elements of it.  The first work packages that are coming back are on trend.  They are on expectations and on budget.  As it moved through the GMP process into the summer of 2018, and I have tried to stress this point on a number of occasions with regard to mechanical and electrical because that is where many of the large increases take place, and those work packages arrive back, the quantity surveying design team supporting the development board is saying that these are now coming in ahead of budget so it was late in the process.  At the core of what PwC must ask is why it was late and why there were no early warnings.</p></speech>

There is an odd reference in the November 2016 board minutes that the board was advised that invoices for the public information advertorials had been queried by the HSE but the board paid on re-submission.  The minutes stated that the advertorials had been placed following the ministerial briefing request for the board to be more proactive in communications.  The Minister needs to clarify why he was seeking increased communications in his own engagements with the board.  In those board meetings, Mr. Woods said that he would assist in resolving the matter-----</p></speech>

I know that we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter on Thursday morning so I will save my contribution for that.  As the Minister is aware, the GPs are outside Leinster House today.  Again, there is a significant issue around primary care delivery and the new contract.  Could the Minister give me a brief update on those issues along with a brief update on the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation group?</p> <p>  I will focus on the issue that seems to be dominating today's proceedings, namely, the national children's hospital.  I watched proceedings on the monitor in my office and Mr. Breslin spoke about a serious underestimation of quantities and that prices had been obtained for individual items.  I have two questions relating to that.  Why was there a serious under-estimation of quantities and who made that error?  Were there complete omissions of quantities?  If this was a private client engaging a design team and the team came in with a seriously under-estimated bill of quantities, that client would take very serious action against the team that was responsible for the under-estimation right up to, I would imagine, suing the team.  Why did such an under-estimation occur?  Were there complete omissions?  What action can we take against those who made those errors?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#W02600"><p>I take as noted Deputy Brassil's comments on the nurses' dispute.  We will have an opportunity to debate that in the morning but I hope that between now and then, there will be a continued effort to get this back into some formal engagement because that is the only place where it will be resolved.  The floor of the D&aacute;il is a perfectly appropriate place to discuss it but it is not going to be resolved there.  It needs to be back in our industrial relations mechanisms.  That is where we need to get to.</p> <p>  I would be happy to provide Deputy Brassil and the committee with a note about the GPs.  The most up-to-date and accurate position is the one issued by the IMO to its members this week, a copy of which I can also send to Deputy Brassil.  Significant progress has been made between the IMO, my Department and the HSE to try to move to a point where we move beyond FEMPI.  Obviously, there are things we need in return from GPs for significant additional investment.  We have a lot of money that we want to spend in general practice.  We have been talking about this for a very long time.  The fact that the IMO is reporting progress this week to its own members is significant in itself.  I know the IMO and I want to bottom it out this month.  I will send Deputy Brassil and perhaps the committee a note about where we are at.  I will try to do that today.  </p> <p>  Regarding the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, we are at the point where I am about to publish the action plan for 2019.  I will give the committee a slight preview of what are likely to be the priority areas this year.  Geo-alignment is one area.  One of the key recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare was that we cannot continue to have the siloed structures so we cannot have hospital groups and CHOs, separate budgets and separate management structures.  Deputy Brassil understands this.  How do we get there? What does the map of Ireland look like effectively?  Geo-alignment will be significant this year.  Elective-only hospitals constitute another issue.  What do they do, what range of services do they provide, and ultimately, where do they go?  The third key element I would highlight is the integration fund.  We have a ring-fenced integration fund this year.  There are a couple of really good pilot projects such as the Sligo primary eye review and the musculoskeletal physiotherapy service.  Could we use that integration fund to roll out what we know are successful projects locally to a broader region or indeed to the country this year?  The action plan will be published in the next few weeks.  </p> <p>  Regarding the children's hospital and the quantities, I am giving a general answer to the specific question asked by Deputy Brassil but I did make the point earlier about not pre-empting the PwC report.  What is apparent in advance of it is that the prices per unit had been locked in at 2016 levels.  What was clearly completely off the Richter scale were the quantities that would be provided.  While there are a number of elements involved in how we got from &euro;983 million to &euro;1.4 billion, a very sizeable element was the fact that when the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board went beyond outline design stage to the detailed design, somebody got the quantities seriously wrong.  That is one of the things for which we are paying a significant price today.  I expect PwC to be able to get to the bottom of that.  Professional companies and people with expertise were used.  Through its agencies, the State would have had contracts with these people in terms of the provision of services and we must consider what action can be taken in light of the PwC report.</p></speech>

The price put on the increase in quantities is &euro;115 million, of which &euro;27 million is the statutory element - the fire works and so on.</p><p>Therefore that could perhaps be taken off.  One can see the scale of the increase in quantities that has taken place there and in the omissions from it; it is &euro;20 million.  Those two things combined are really sizeable in explaining what is happening.  They probably underestimate it because they knock on into the programme and the preliminaries, and how long it will take to execute the project.  Further increases result from the overall increase in scale.  I agree with the Deputy that a very serious question remains to be asked as to how the order of magnitude of increase could have taken place albeit from a preliminary design to a final design.  How could it have been out by so much?  When we asked the question of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in the context of finalising it, it was of the view that the design team and others were not at fault.  However, in December the Government made a decision to request an independent review by PwC of this process to see where any of those omissions or increases could have been avoided and whose responsibility it might have been to do so and if they carried out those responsibilities.</p></speech>

That is not obvious to me because there is a separate figure of &euro;20 million for user engagement where the scope changes because users identify issues.  It looks like the change-control procedure on quantities and omissions does not involve an authority based on the user engagement to instruct an increase the quantities.  It looks like - this is me being pre-emptive of the PwC report - it is going on at a lower level than that.  I am very interested to try to establish that.</p></speech>

How much of that &euro;90 million relates to preliminaries?  What percentage of the overall contract price did the preliminaries represent?  It is normally between 10% and 15%.  It might be as high as 20% for a very complex structure.  Mr. Breslin might not have the figure right now.  What was the percentage of the original tender price for preliminaries?  What is the mark-up now for the nine months?  The contractor might claim things have changed and are now more complicated, and look for a mark-up for the preliminaries for the extra nine months.  How does the percentage of that mark-up compare with the other mark-ups on the contract price?</p></speech>

At least Mr. Barry is conversant with and has knowledge of overspending on contracts because he was the CEO of the NRA when two projects in Kerry, the bypasses of Tralee and Castleisland, overran by &euro;55 million.  The records will show who the contractor was on that occasion.  There is a striking similarity with the contractor for the national children's hospital.</p></speech>

GPs were also ringing the helpline asking if they could give women sitting in front of them a repeat free smear test.  I discussed the issue with my officials, including senior officials well known to this committee and the Chief Medical Officer, all of whom agreed it was an appropriate action as part of the reassurance statement.  The Chief Medical Officer has told me that they would have drafted the memo I would have brought to Cabinet on 1 May where I sought Government approval for this.

Following an FOI request I believe they appeared in publications such as <i>TheJournal.ie</i>.  In those letters people expressed a contrary viewpoint.  However, this did not happen in advance to the best of my recollection.</p></speech>

The Minister was aware of the lack of cytologists at the time, which is still an ongoing challenge.  The Minister is saying that of all of the experts and officials advising him, not one person suggested this might have an adverse effect on the screening programme and put the system under unnecessary pressure that it might not cope with.

I want to give the Deputy the correct date.  If I do not have it I will revert to her.  From my memory, I think it was in October after the publication of the Scally report.  I will confirm the timeline for the Deputy because I do not have it before me and I do not want to mislead her.  From my recollection it was in October post the publication of the Scally report.  The Scally report had stated definitively that our screening programme was safe and that we could continue using the labs we were using.  I felt that was a very big part of reassurance.  I would have conveyed my decision to the HSE that I now wanted to end the out-of-cycle smear tests at the appropriate opportunity.  It was agreed operationally that that would be in December because many women would have booked in for smear tests because three months need to elapse.</p></speech>

The Deputy must remember we were waiting for Dr. Scally's report to provide reassurance to the women of Ireland as to whether the programme was safe, if they needed to get new smears.  There was considerable unease on the matter.  Many Members of the Oireachtas, women and GPs recommended that we do this.  I think it was the appropriate thing to do and many thousands of women got reassurance.  As I told the Deputy yesterday in the D&aacute;il and as I am sure will be saying later during the CervicalCheck debate in the D&aacute;il, it certainly contributed in part - not exclusively - to the backlog we are dealing with today.</p> <p>  As GPs pointed out to the helpline, women who could afford the repeat smear test were always going to go and get it.  There was an equity issue where women who could not afford it would have been left out.</p></speech>

This issue was also the subject of ongoing monitoring and discussion at the steering group which included doctors, officials and patient representatives who were supportive of the monitoring of this.  The patient representatives, who are my concern, were supportive of this measure.  I received advice that in light of the Scally report - I think it was in October but I will confirm that date to the Deputy later - that I should now move to end this cycle of free repeat smear tests, which was only ever meant to be temporary measure.  We conveyed that to the HSE as to when it would be operationally appropriate to do that, and in its discussions with doctors' organisations, including the IMO, a date of December was decided on.</p></speech>

My officials then would have conversed.  I accepted their recommendation in full.  They can attest to that.  My officials would have conversed then with the HSE as to when it would be operationally best to do that.  The date in December was decided on because women book their smear tests some time in advance because they have to wait for three months to elapse.</p></speech>

This is the fourth session we have had on the hospital.  We have met the development board, the hospital group, the HSE, the Department of Health and this is the second time we have met the Minister.  A common theme we are hearing at committee is that while it is all very regrettable, nobody has done anything wrong.  The two stage process, which was clearly the wrong process, has been repeatedly defended.  I put the withholding of information from the D&aacute;il to the Minister, and he has defended it, as is his right.  I would argue that if a Minister is asked if we are on budget and knows we are several hundred million euro over budget, then it is misleading the D&aacute;il to say we are still on budget.  He has given his reasons for that.</p> <p>  The withholding of information from the Cabinet, the Minister for Finance, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach during budget negotiations has been defended.  It has been defended that not a single commercial contract has been cancelled, in spite of the fact the Minister said a few minutes ago that the quantities were completely off the Richter scale.  As Deputy Brassil alluded to earlier on, if private contractors get their quantities wrong to the tune of being completely off the Richter scale, those companies tend to be fired.  People tend to lose their jobs but not here.  When I put it to the officials in previous sessions as to why no commercial contract had been cancelled, that was also defended as well.  Everything has been defended.</p> <p>  The most egregious defence is the one on costs.  This is what I want to put to the Minister.  I want clarity on this.  I have sat through hours of debate on this and I still do not know what the Government's position is on costs and on whether or not it believes that a reasonable cost is being paid.  My position, which I have put forward several times, is that per bed, this will be the most expensive hospital ever built by a mile.</p></speech>

When I put this to the Minister and the officials, the defence consistently is that it is not the way to look at it and if one looks at the cost per square metre, they have this quantity surveyors' report, which in 2016 said it was &euro;2,500 per sq. m, but it turns out that two years later it thinks it is &euro;6,000 per sq. m.  If one looks at the children's hospital in cost per square metre terms essentially what the Minister and his officials said that it is coming in at a reasonable price.</p> <p>  Can I ask a straight question?  Given my position and how I am looking at the numbers and the Minister's position and how he has laid them out and given that he arrives at very different conclusions, does he believe that the costs that are being incurred - we all accept a fantastic children's hospital is required - at &euro;1.4 billion to &euro;1.7 billion is not acceptable and does not represent a reasonable price for the hopefully great hospital we are going to get?</p></speech>

What I agree with him on is that we are going to look at ways of mitigating the cost further, without compromising the clinical benefits, which neither of us wants to do, of the hospital.  I have put in the additional line regarding that in the terms of reference at the Deputy's constructive suggestion.</p> <p>  I must respond to a couple of points the Deputy has made.  He said people on this side of the table, and presumably he is including me, suggest that nobody has done anything wrong.  To be clear, that is not my position nor is it the position of the Government.  The position of the Government and myself is that the PwC report will identify roles and who did what, who knew what and will knit all this together in a way in which it has an expertise that we as individuals and collectives may not have.</p><p>The Deputy talked about not telling the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I was very clear in my opening statement that it was well known in Government Departments beyond my own that the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, process would have to be worked through, that it would arrive at an outcome and that this outcome would then go to Government.  The Deputy said that no contracts were cancelled.  That is factually true.  The Deputy knows that I do not have the legal power to cancel contracts.  The awarding of contracts is a matter for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  I thought I had said this but perhaps I have not said it explicitly.  If the PwC report, or any report, suggests that a company which has a contract did something wrong or was incompetent or inept, we will act with the full vigour of the law to pursue the matter under the contracts we have.  I assure the Deputy of that.</p><p> Deputy Donnelly and I go back and forth on the issue of costs, on which we have different viewpoints.  It is not just a matter of cost per bed because it is not just about beds.  It is also about moving from 14 theatres to 22 theatres and from having two or two and half MRI machines for children to having five of them.  Costs are not comparable with the costs of the Mater Hospital because the new hospital will be a digital hospital.  We cannot build paper based hospitals in the 21st century.  The new hospital will also be spread across three sites.  The facility at Connolly Hospital will open and start providing services for children this summer.  The extra equipment was delivered this week.  The AECOM review was a good way to look at the question because it looked at what it would cost to build an equivalent paediatric hospital in London.  From memory, I believe it indicated a cost of &euro;9,000 per square metre in London, while our hospital will cost &euro;6,500 per square metre.  This will be an expensive hospital but-----</p></speech>

It is the rebuttal to that point.  The AECOM view is that the Deputy's view is not correct.  The overrun to which the Deputy refers is a projected overrun.  I am not being pedantic about this.  The reason I am making that point is that there is some benefit to the overrun being projected rather than actual as it gives us a chance to mitigate the costs further.  That is what we are all going to try to do through the PwC process.  When I had three options, this option represented the best value for taxpayers because it delivers the hospital.  The other options would not have delivered the hospital or would not have delivered it any more cheaply, while delaying it further.</p></speech>

The Government seems to have set its mind against rewinding FEMPI for contract holders, including general practitioners.  This has brought general practice into a very sorry state.  GPs are under severe pressure with regard to funding.  FEMPI removed 38% of funding for the provision of services through general practice.  GPs feel that the stance of the Government and HSE in respect of the provision of GP services is dishonest and negligent.  They are under severe pressure.  GPs cannot be recruited and those who are still in place cannot supply a service to their patients because of the reduction in funding made under FEMPI.  What is the Minister going to do with regard to the reversal of FEMPI cuts for general practitioners?  It is unacceptable to state he will move beyond FEMPI because to do so would be to ignore FEMPI and expect services to be delivered without its unwinding.  How does the Minister intend approaching that?</p></speech>

The Irish Medical Organisation is in negotiations with my Department and the Government.  A circular it sent to its members this week referred to the progress made through those negotiations.  While some GPs obviously have a different view, and while I do not speak for the IMO, I do not believe it is of the view that engagement with my Department and me has been dishonest or negative.  I need to make that point.</p></speech>

Negligence is evident because GPs cannot supply a service to their patients.  Patients are now moving out of general practice and into casualty departments because they cannot get a service from their general practitioner.  They are moving into out-of-hours services, which are being flooded and overworked, and ending up in accident and emergency departments unnecessarily.  I believe the Minister's refusal to unwind FEMPI treats GPs dishonestly.</p></speech>

I will have to be slightly cautious about what I am saying because my Department and I have not finalised agreement with the IMO, as the Chairman knows.  The IMO certainly said an awful lot about its view of the negotiations in its circular.  Its words are there for every GP to see.  For the record, while I can be pedantic and careful in my wording, I want to see fees moving towards what they were before FEMPI.  I want to see FEMPI reversed.  I will need some modernisation measures if that is to happen.  That is not unusual and does not involve treating GPs differently.  There is not a public servant working here or in our hospitals and health services who did not see some modernisation or productivity measures introduced in return for the unwinding of the FEMPI measures that affect him or her.  Separate and distinct from that, there is also additional money for new services in respect of chronic disease management, eligibility and access.  These are services about which the Chairman is very passionate and which he knows about in great detail.</p> <p>  With a big push, we can wrap this up very quickly.  It would be incorrect to say "quickly" because this has been going on a long time, but we can wrap this up in a very short period of time.  The IMO circular to its members sets out its position.  There is not much in it with which I disagree.  Good progress has been made.  We need to address the issue of FEMPI.  There is funding for new services.  We - the employer, contractor or whatever word one wishes to use - on the management side need productivity and modernisation measures in return.  We can get to a point at which GPs will see a very significant increase in the fees being paid to them in 2019.</p></speech>

Many of the public servants or anyone working in the public service who had their FEMPI unwound, to use the Chairman's phrase, are doing new and different things as a result of that.  What I am saying to GPs, who I am sure are watching this very carefully and closely, particularly given the day that is in it, is that we will in 2019 invest an awful lot more in general practice and that will address the issue of FEMPI.  It will also address the issue of new services because our patients need new services and our GPs want to provide them.  It will do so in a way that is managed and controlled and does not flood general practice.  Mistakes have been made in the past in that regard but we are making very significant progress.  I welcome the fact the IMO updated its members this week.</p></speech>

With regard to the unwinding of FEMPI, I do not think it is true to say everybody necessarily has some form of productivity or changed work practice associated with the unwinding of FEMPI.  My understanding is that the processes by which that was monitored have been substantially dismantled.  Some attempt was made several years back but we can talk about that another time.  Nonetheless, I would not say with the same confidence as the Minister that everyone is doing something different that would be outside of the norm in terms of upskilling and changed general roles.  It is not linked to any percentage because, clearly, if it was, we would be able to point to a grade, group or category of workers that had not necessarily achieved whatever targets were set down, and there would be a timeline and so on.  That is not the case.  It is a bit unfair to GPs-----</p></speech>

The Deputy is asking me questions about why would somebody accept a tender that is &euro;130 million below another one.  I am saying that one reason they might do so would be that, if they did not accept, they would be challenged legally and would be tied up for two years.</p></speech>

Is it his opinion that the board would have sought legal advice on how likely that was?  Should it have done so?  Would Mr. Breslin consider that to be best practice or was the board fine just to say it had better not take the chance, just in case?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#AA02000"><p>Okay.  When the board went to the tender process, the weightings used were 75% on price and 25% on quality.  That does not really square with the emerging narrative that the children of Ireland deserve the best hospital in the world, and one would be putting a small bit more emphasis on quality if that was going to be at the absolute top of the agenda.  I cannot square the statements made about wanting this to be the best.  I am not getting into whether it is the most expensive and I think that once we are in catastrophic overrun territory, it does not matter.  However, it does not square with the notion that everything was going to be done to the highest possible standard because, actually, far more emphasis was placed on getting this done cheaply.  We see now where that was because, obviously, the lowest bidder was going to get it if 75% was going on price and 25% on quality.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister can comment on that.  He is the one who keeps saying he wants it to be the best in the world but 75% was on price and we see now that the emphasis on price is going to cost very dearly.  The Minister used the phrase that somebody got the quantities seriously wrong.  That is a wee bit of an understatement when we are dealing with cost overruns of this nature.  The Minister might comment.</p></speech>

I am telling the Deputy how I see it.  When we look at the quantities between the detailed design and the outline design, someone did get it seriously wrong.  I can put it in more hyperbolic language if the Deputy wishes but that is my view in regard to it.</p></speech>

My view and my position when I talk about it being the best hospital for children is based on what it will do for kids compared with what they have today, the services it will provide and the specifications it will deliver.  I am very satisfied in that regard that it is an investment worth making.</p></speech>

The assistant secretary general, Ms Conroy, attended ten of them and Mr. Woods attended six.  It is clear from what was being discussed that people were starting to get concerned.

Did she not say anything to him?  It is obvious from the tone of the minutes that concerns were being raised.  Would she not have said anything to Mr. Breslin in this regard?  She was at ten of those meetings and Mr. Woods was at six.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Was this not mentioned at any stage to Mr. Breslin, even casually if it was not followed up?  Did Mr. Woods understand that somebody who was a member of this steering group was making the concerns that were being raised by the members of the steering group known to Government?  Was he happy to continue with the Secretary General and-or the Minister being unaware?  Mr. Woods went to six meetings and, presumably, he read the minutes of the ones he could not get to.  Would he have had a belief that the concerns being raised were being communicated to people more senior than the ones sitting at the table?</p></speech>

I can quite honestly say that my understanding would be that the assistant secretary general's understanding of where the process was would be consistent with my understanding of that.  We communicate regularly.  The surprise moment I got was coming back to see in September how the issue had crystallised, not that it was taking longer and not that there were not challenges in the process, but the type of figures that were talked about when I came back off leave were news to me.  However, it would not have been news to me that the process would have to be extended because it was taking longer and the GMP was at risk, and it would not have been news to me that there were challenges around value engineering savings and other inflation factors.</p></speech>

I will restate what the Secretary General has just said in saying that the concerns that were reflected in those minutes related at that time, the spring and summer of 2018, to a delay in timescale.  The financial challenge on the guaranteed maximum price crystallised and became visible in autumn.</p> <p>  The Secretary General has addressed the information flows within Government and it is not for me to comment on them.  The HSE has its processes and this was one of them, so that information was being shared, to the extent reflected in the minutes, at those meetings.</p></speech>

Point 5 of page 3 stated that MOC noted concerns around the nursing intake to third level education, as the current flow will not generate the required 300 paediatric nurses in 2022.  We have had discussions on this but my observation is that, even if this hospital is built, there will not be enough staff to staff it.  The minutes also suggested that similar challenges exist in relation to junior doctors, allied health professionals and an ongoing interface with the Department of Education and Skills was noted.  Has that circle been squared now?  Is the staff ready?  Are there sufficient numbers in the system?  Is the HSE confident that the staff will not emigrate like everyone else?</p></speech>

There are issues with any major capital build like this that requires a significant expansion in staffing.  One needs to be clearly assured that the building is happening, which has been the subject of major discussion, but also that when it is built, the staff will be available to run the services.  We know how many staff members there will be when the hospital opens in 2023 by staff group.  We know how many more that is than we currently have, we know what the turnover is of the different staff groups and we know where the pinch points are in all of that and there is a process, staff group by staff group, under the arrangements that I chair to look at each of those areas and to seek to mitigate the existing risks in terms of ensuring there is a pool for the hospital group to recruit from.</p></speech>

Staffing for the satellite unit in Connolly is proceeding now and there has been some success in recruitment of consultant staff and others.  We also need to remember that this is not just a hospital, this is a model of care for paediatric service nationally, so resources have also gone into Cork, Galway and Limerick and will have to go into those facilities.  It also goes beyond hospitals into mental health and disability.  Actions are under way at the moment across a range of areas to grow staff numbers.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right in saying there are challenges.  Theatre nursing, for example, is one challenge that is real and the children's hospital group has looked at training its own staff in that area and are doing some work on that.  There will be challenges but there are also some signs of progress at the moment in recruitment for the satellite unit, which is the first step.</p></speech>

As someone looking on, it seems that sufficient attention was not being paid to the detail.  There is no additional detail on how many new nurses will be in the system, how many will be recruited, and it is the same with allied health professionals.</p> <p>  I understand the witnesses are here to say that people were taking responsibility and all of that but it does not help the HSE's cause if the hospital were to be built and not to have sufficient staff to be able to open it.  It is not a new model of anything.  It would be just like the rest of the health service.</p></speech>

I have pointed out to the Minister and Secretary General that sometimes, one must follow up parliamentary questions to get documentation.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman that it does seem bizarre.  I have asked for the memo that went to the Minister in August on at least three occasions now.  I do not think we need to get a note from the clerk to ask the Minister to get it.  I expected to get it while the committee has been sitting here because I asked for it four hours ago.</p> <p>  To be clear, we also looked for all correspondence to and from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding requests for meetings in October.  We also want all minutes of the board meetings from the board of which Mr. Breslin is the chair and the original hospital board.  The minutes of the steering group should also be distributed to everyone.</p> <p>  Anything else that the witnesses think would be useful should be given to us.  Is that not the best way?  If in doubt, do not leave it out.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the pinch point.  I have always accepted the Minister's bona fides about the cost escalation of &euro;61 million.  He found out that figure was at least &euro;200 million in August.  I want to know what happened between summer 2017 and August 2018 as to communications from the board to the steering group, to the other board and to the Minister.  That has not really been discussed today.  I have been waiting for two and a half or three hours to get to this point.</p> <p>  Mr. Woods sat on the board of the hospital and on the steering group.  In his view, when was the escalation and changeover?  Think about it.  We are accepting the bona fides in respect of the &euro;61 million.  When was there a sign of an escalation over the &euro;61 million that made Mr. Woods think this was a real issue?</p></speech>

I am not distinguishing between the two roles.  In my role in the HSE, the timescale was something similar to that.  That is the answer.  I would have to look at the detailed record.

Mr. Connaghan, as chair, asked about the scale of the financial risk involved.  Mr. Pollock advised that it was too early to estimate at that point but agreed to provide clarity about the timeline and financial risk by June, as per the minutes.  That was in April 2018.

The next steering group meeting was in May 2018.  As the Deputy noted, that is the first one I chaired.  At that meeting Mr. Pollock advised that, by the end of June, the NPHDB would have a strong sense of where we stood in overall terms regarding the capital construction cost.  That was the view he expressed at the time, in good faith I am sure.  There is only one other date that is relevant to where I assume the Deputy is going in joining the dots in all of this.  Subsequent to that May meeting, there was a board meeting on 20 June 2018 which Mr. Breslin chaired.  Again, consistent with what has been said today and in previous sessions, Mr. Pollock reported to the board on capital costs, challenges, pressures and delays in completing the GMP negotiations.  He said at that meeting, as was recorded, that the close-out date for the GMP process had been pushed back from the end of June to the end of October.  That was the position at the board meeting Mr. Breslin chaired.</p></speech>

I was very clear.  I did not ask Mr. Sullivan to know whether it was &euro;200 million or another figure.  I just asked both Mr. Sullivan and Mr. Woods the same question.  The figure of &euro;61 million is parked.  We now know that in August the figure was &euro;200 million and in November it was &euro;450 million.  What we are trying to figure out is the timeline between midsummer 2017, when the figure was &euro;61 million, and August 2018 when it was &euro;200 million.  It is very clear.  What Mr. Sullivan said is probably quite accurate.  From reading the minutes, the April meeting is the one at which I noticed that there was noise in the system.</p></speech>

I know about the board meeting.  In January and March, the programme board, which I chair, was only dealing with the figure of &euro;61 million and what was being called a "backstop" around that.  That backstop was intended to manage that issue without any impact on funding.  The first meeting at which issues were raised was in June.  The most important development at that point was the signal that the time for the GMP process would have to be extended by three months.  The conversation on that topic was about pressures.  The board saw that the contractors and the behaviour and interaction we were seeing were causing problems.  It was taking longer, but we did not have figures at that stage.  Then-----</p></speech>

I apologise to the Chairman for taking some of the Deputy's time but it is necessary to put this on the record.  In August, as I have described, information came into the Department.  In September, I got that information.  On 19 September, we held the next board meeting.  At that point, the board was further along in the process.  It was talking about figures but saying the figures were preliminary.  The board was still not in a position to be in any way definitive about the outcome.</p></speech>

We now know that there was no communication at all at any level in the Department with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about the noise in the system.  Is that so?  That question is specifically for Mr. Breslin.  From April on, there was no communication at all on the noise in the system with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform until August.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister, Deputy Harris.  In November, he was in the mid-west.  We are talking about projects that are affected and I want clarity here because I am very confused.  The Chairman and I welcomed the Minister's announcement that the 60 bed modular unit in Limerick would be funded amid great public fanfare.  I asked a parliamentary question about this two weeks ago and the Minister gave me an answer with a bottom line that there was no commitment to do so, it was competing with all other projects and no decision had been made until a capital plan was in place.  I do not like using this word but either what the Minister said in November is not accurate or else the reply that came back to my parliamentary question last week is false.  The Minister announced it in November, the funding was there and all of the Minister's colleagues were out saying it was great.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister not to respond to parliamentary questions like that.  It is not appropriate for parliamentarians to be sending out something which is not factually accurate.

For normal people watching at home, it is not acceptable or believable that Mr. John Connaghan, who was in the role that has just been described, was in Mr. Sullivan's position and that taxpayer's money would be described as noise here this morning.  I understand Mr. Woods's commentary about crystallisation of the financial position, which could basically be summarised as the price of it.  That is just HSE-speak for the price of the product.  It is not credible for people watching at home that we had the top man in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform doing shopping.  His job is procurement and that is essentially shopping.  We have a fellow charged with shopping for the country who is on the board and he does not see that this noise will have a knock-on effect on his position on the board and on his job doing shopping for Ireland.  I do not buy that, even if there was no formal communication.  </p> <p>  Mr. Breslin said recently that he expected the normal governance structures to be in place and he said just now that he did not advise the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Everyone with a head on their shoulders knows that somewhere along the way, the man who was in charge of the shopping, Mr. Paul Quinn, must have said that this is getting out of control, this will pull from other areas and he would not have enough money to do his day job in his board position.  When Mr. Breslin looks at this useful document which we got at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting last week, which details all of the reviews that were done in 2018 and 2017, he will see that &euro;200,000 was spent on reports in 2017 and 2018, starting in February 2017.  In February 2017 there was a stakeholder review.  In April 2017 there was a contract management review.  In my mind, at some point before February 2017 the "you know what" was heading towards the fan and this exercise of spending &euro;200,000 on reviews was a backside covering exercise.  I am suspicious of the &euro;200,000 spent on reviews up to then.</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Kelly, there was a gap in the reviews from July 2017 to May 2018.  We are going around the houses here in the sense that obviously there are official emails and official memos but Mr. Breslin is taking all of us for fools when he expects us to believe that Mr. Woods, who is sitting here in front of me, who works for the HSE and whose job is to deliver the service, did not consider that his day job could not be achieved if all the money was spent on the hospital.  It is not believable that the man who was in charge of the shopping did not mention it.  Whether there is a paper trail or not, whether people secretly said it or whether it was in this noise situation, it is just not credible.  I do not blame the Minister; he is being treated unfairly here because he cannot be inspired about what is going on.  If people deliberately plot behind his back and do not tell him, how is he to know?  It is not his job to go measuring the cable.  This is our fifth or sixth meeting on this and we are none the wiser.  We are getting nowhere because no one is prepared to answer direct questions unless they know they have themselves covered and it is very concerning because at the end of the day the HSE is supposed to deliver the service.</p><p>Further to that, when Dr. Gabriel Scally started his review, he met an information wall.  How are we to say that PwC will not meet that same wall?  I cannot remember the exact phrasing Dr. Scally used at the health committee.  Why should we expect that PwC will get the information?  Many people in here seem to be very good at referring to minutes.  However, Mr. Woods is in a top position in the HSE and Mr. Quinn is in a top position in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I do not believe they did not tell somebody before the Minister was told officially in June.</p></speech>

In my years observing the questioning of how things happened, often a position is adopted that no records are available, minutes were not taken and it is not documented.  I think PwC will find documentation of the issues discussed at meetings and a clear record of that.  I think that is good public administration; it is not something to apologise for.  The Deputy is asking if there is stuff going on outside that.  I was not involved in stuff outside that.  We had a formal process for considering issues, documenting the issues and making decisions on the actions to be taken, and they are available.  There was not some other subterfuge going on somewhere else.  That is how the issues - tough issues, difficult issues - were being dealt with, starting with the &euro;62 million going into the summer of 2018 when problems were flagged in the GMP process and arriving at a point where the GMP process was completed in November and Government made a decision in December.</p></speech>

Although the GMP figure had crystallised in November, does Mr. Breslin think it is credible for the public when they hear this?  We have the HSE and the Department of Health - I would argue over the need for both, but that is another day's work.  We have this change of governance structure etc.  The minutes are the minutes, but, as I said last Thursday, we all know that discussions happen.  I do not believe that this overrun could happen and nobody would have mentioned, "Okay, we don't know the amount, but it's going to be big."  I find that really hard to believe.</p></speech>

Many GPs are not in the IMO but are in the NAGP.  However, the NAGP is not in those negotiations.  I am concerned that even if the Minister reaches agreement with the IMO, NAGP members might not accept the outcome of those negotiations.  At what stage will the Department engage with the NAGP?  I know its members will be protesting later today.  A large number of GPs who are not part of this ongoing negotiating process feel frustrated at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.720" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019020600002#EE01000"><p>That is a fair point.  My Department engages with the IMO on contractual matters.  The IMO is a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We have a framework agreement with it.  Issues with FEMPI etc. would have been introduced as part of discussions with the broader union movement - I am not saying they were in any way agreed.  There is a role for the NAGP to play in terms of being consulted and involved, but the negotiations are with the IMO.</p> <p>  I will not get into the medical politics of it because it makes the politics in which we are involved seem very tame at times.  They are different organisations with perhaps different perspectives and rivalry.  The IMO is the organisation with which my Department engages.  I am happy to explore consultative roles for other organisations.  The IMO has delivered on a number of occasions - for example, when we were negotiating the free repeat smear test.  It also negotiated for its members on the contract for termination of pregnancy and the free GP-visit card for the under sixes.  That is the current negotiating arrangement.  The IMO has issued an update to its members.  The organisation individual GPs decide to join is not a matter for me.</p></speech>

Any GP can sign up to any contract being offered by the State without necessarily being a member of one organisation or the other.  I am happy to reflect on the issues the Senator raised.  We are in intensive negotiations with the IMO.  I believe the outcome of these negotiations will benefit all GPs.  It is obviously up to GPs to decide whether they wish to sign up to contracts being offered by the State.</p></speech>

I will not exaggerate the claims.  I will not start the estimate for the hospital at a lower base than has already been discussed in order to further inflate the degree of annoyance one might have at the new price.  I believed weeks ago and I still believe that unless the specification and the bill of quantities are properly identified and assessed in the initial stages, it leaves the whole situation open to exaggeration, mistakes, allegations and levelling of blame on different people.  I do not want to do that and I do not believe there is any value in that.</p> <p>  The word "preliminaries" should be removed from big contracts like this; it is lethal.  The one thing that needs to be learned is it is not possible to achieve any degree of accuracy if working on preliminaries, estimates or guesstimates, which is really all they are.  In a big contract such as this, taking place over three sites, there is a propensity for something going wrong or something slipping.  That is what we heard referred to as noise in the system; I can understand what that might be.  My supposition is that the degree of concern at that stage was not of a magnitude that would cause the matter to be brought to the attention of those higher up the ladder.</p> <p>  It comes back to the kernel of what was in the original tender documents, what was tendered for, the bill of costs, the specifications and if the two meet.  Obviously they did not meet.  The bill of costs was short or else the detailed specification was short.  I do not know how anybody can assess a situation given those circumstances.</p> <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned last week that it would be a great help to the committee, if we knew what was involved in the very beginning.  Somebody somewhere must know what kind of hospital we were going to have.  Was it to be a high-tech hospital or was it to be just walls, floors and ceilings, the same as traditional hospitals or whatever the case may be?  That is fundamentally the debate we are having.</p> <p>  The debate we are having now can be detrimental to the quality of health service that we all want to provide in the future.  That has been a characteristic of the debate on the health services for some time.  This relates to GP services and hospital services.  As a result, I think we are dumbing down the quality of the services to suit the particular location, which is very dangerous.</p><p>This is a very dangerous thing to do, and if we keep going on like this, we will not have the class of health service we expect and that we pay for, that is provided for by the taxpayer.  I expect PricewaterhouseCoopers to get to the bottom of the matter.  I expect that the cost will be revised in accordance with the actual specification and the actual bill of costs, which did not emerge until late in the day.</p></speech>

If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I wish Mr. David Walsh well in his new role.  He has only been in it three months.  He brings vast experience to it.  I wish him well in this new endeavour.  He is greatly missed on the other side but I know he brings vast experience and expertise to this area.  I invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by Ms Loretta Lambkin, chief officer, and Ms Rachel Kenny, director of planning.  As I have only recently taken up the post of chairman, with the committee's indulgence, I will defer to my colleagues to answer questions that may be posed, which they may be better placed to answer.<br/><br/>The board is well aware of its critical role in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals, and we remain fully committed to delivering decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  The national planning framework, NPF, and the emerging regional spatial and economic strategies set a clear priority for appropriate development in the right locations to facilitate the sustainable and orderly growth of our cities, towns and rural hinterlands, and the board has a clear role in implementing such policies through efficient processing of case decisions.  In a constantly evolving and more complex legislative and legal context, where environmental issues and public participation are to the fore, it is also crucial that the board has all the information it needs to make sound decisions and gives people time to feed in their views on proposals during the deliberative process.  This reflects our core principles of integrity, independence and fair-mindedness. <br/><br/>To give the committee a little background on the organisation, the board currently has 159.5 whole-time equivalent staff and ten board members.  The Minister and the Department have been supportive in approving recent resource requests, in recognition of the increased demands and complexity of the cases that are coming before the board, including in regard to strategic housing developments, vacant site levy cases and major infrastructure projects, as well as the forecast increase in case intake that we expect during the coming years.  We are currently undertaking a workforce plan to assess our future capacity to deliver on our statutory mandate in a timely manner and we will shortly write to the Minister identifying what we see as the core resource requirements to maintain and improve our performance. <br/><br/>While it is acknowledged that the board&rsquo;s capacity and performance to meet our statutory objective period of 18 weeks has been impacted by the transition to our new IT system called Plean-IT, the increased intake and caseload as well as the fallout from reduced board capacity in the past, we have made strong progress to turn things around in recent months.  In 2018, we recorded a 32% increase in the number of cases decided over the previous year, with more than 2,800 decisions made.  In November and December alone, we decided almost 600 cases, which was up 36% on the same months in 2017 and helped to reduce the number of cases on hands by more than 300 from the level of 1,355 to just more than 1,000 files currently.  This great push and effort reflects the commitment of our hard-working staff and board to get to grips with the backlog generated and deliver robust decisions as efficiently as possible. <br/><br/>In terms of meeting our 18-week statutory objective period for deciding normal planning appeals, we are aware that a 40% rate is not where we want to be but, equally, the priority and focus for me in my first few months has been to process and decide the cases longest with the board, which has meant that many of the cases determined in the past three months were beyond the 18-week period.  This has had a knock-on consequential impact on our percentage compliance rate, but we have a clear plan in 2019 to clear the backlog during the first half of the year and get back to a compliance rate of 80% plus by the end of the year.The compliance rate for appeals decided in December had improved to almost 50%.<br/><br/>The board&rsquo;s performance with respect to strategic housing developments has been strong, with 39 cases decided during 2018, all well within the 16-week target.  Overall, the board granted planning for more than 7,100 housing units and almost 4,500 student bed spaces during 2018, which is a vital contribution to the overall increase in residential activity.  We expect a significant increase in housing applications in 2019, reflecting the ongoing demand for pre-application meetings.  We have 19 applications up for decision in the next three months, which have the aggregate capacity to deliver approximately 4,170 residential units and more than 1,750 student bed spaces.  We will continue to prioritise these cases and deal with any large-scale housing appeals expeditiously. <br/><br/>During 2018, An Bord Plean&aacute;la prepared a five-year strategic plan with four clear goals, namely, to protect and enhance our reputation for independence, impartiality, integrity, trust and transparency; to make robust, timely and high-quality decisions that support proper planning and sustainable development; to improve our service to meet changing customer expectations; and to foster a motivated, resilient and responsive organisation.  While this is a five-year strategy, we will prioritise a number of initiatives and actions in 2019 to help realise these objectives and set us on the right path.  High among these priorities is the roll-out and refinement of our Plean-IT project, which will ultimately enable applications and appeals to be made online, linking in with the local authorities' own e-Planning<i></i>initiative.  This year will also see the development of a new website to make it easier to find information and a separate web portal through which online appeals and applications will ultimately be lodged.  Furthermore, in light of the likely increase in strategic infrastructure applications, I am also prioritising a review of our processes, including our pre-application consultations, to learn and apply lessons from our own and participants&rsquo; experiences in the past and to identify ways to streamline and ensure that we are operating as efficiently as possible to facilitate robust and swift decisions. <br/><br/>As the largest planning body in the country, with exposure to a wide range of case types and issues, it is also incumbent on the board to support the Department, planning authorities and the new Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, to ensure planning policies are practical, consistent and clearly understood by all.</p><p>The board provided practical, helpful advice to the Department on the establishment of the strategic housing development functions in 2016, and I believe that we can also contribute to shaping and informing new policies and legislation to improve everyone's understanding of the planning code and ensure a consistency of approach across the country.  I am conscious that I am taking up members' valuable time to raise particular issues so I will leave it there.  We are happy to take any questions.  I have included a couple of summary graphs with my statement that give members a sense of the type of cases we deal with and also the level of activity in recent years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.738" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019020600002#L00200"><p>I thank Mr. Walsh and his staff for coming here and I wish them well.  I thank him for his presentation which was circulated to us yesterday, and which I read in detail.  I will pepper a few questions with comments and he might take them as he sees fit.</p><p>I acknowledge that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent.  Its independence and impartiality are important.  It is a participant in the process.  Encouragement, engagement and transparency are also important in this two-way process.  Some people in the public domain feel that sometimes the board is not impartial.  The board does not help itself and concerns can be raised when it gives a very summarised version of how it reports its activities and, in particular, its findings.  There will always be a certain amount of tension in a system.  I will go through the issues as I see them.  We are conscious that it is about planning, sustainability, making better communities and there will always be tensions.</p><p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory 18-week process for making a decision but the time taken has been poor in the past.  I took the time to look at Mr. Walsh's predecessor's previous three annual reports.  They refer constantly to striving to increase compliance with the statutory obligation of 18 weeks.  Clearly, the board has addressed that and it is going to work on that but it is of major concern.  We have heard large developers talking about their frustrations with the process.  If someone is building an extension or a cottage in the west, the board still needs to comply with the key statutory objective of 18 weeks.</p><p>Could Mr. Walsh detail the Exchequer income, which is the principal source of funding, and other sources of funding that the board receives?  I am aware of the amount the board received in 2018 but how much was budgeted for An Bord Plean&aacute;la for 2019, if the figure is to hand?  If not, Mr. Walsh could come back to us with it.</p><p>His predecessor talked about an independent review in 2016.  The review began in 2017 and it made a substantial number of recommendations, which I looked at.  Some of them have not been implemented and there may be good reason for that.  Others have been implemented on a staged basis.  One key recommendation related to how the board itself is appointed.  How is that progressing?  If the information is not available today, Mr. Walsh might furnish the committee with an update on the review.  If he considers it appropriate, he might talk to us about that.</p><p>On resources, is the board equipped to successfully meet the increasing challenges in terms of its expanded remit and competence and the demands on it, effectively, by the Government?  I am mindful, in particular, of Rebuilding Ireland and the board's commitments in that regard.  The board has not delivered on all its targeted commitments in the plan.  If one does a word search for Rebuilding Ireland in the five pillars, one will see all the commitments there.  I suggest that at some stage it might be helpful for this committee if we look back at all of the key objectives the board was tasked with.  There may be good reason they are not happening.  Mr. Walsh mentioned e-Planning and there is another similar process.  Three or four deadlines have been missed, but the board was doing a pilot scheme.  However, it might be a good exercise to look back at the responsibilities An Bord Plean&aacute;la was tasked with under Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p>The board's information and communications technology, ICT, strategy is important in terms of how it will engage more with the public and provide platforms.  It is important where there are large planning applications, especially outside Dublin, because people do not have the same access to the board.  I will leave it at that.  I think Mr. Walsh knows what I am talking about.</p><p>Litigation has become a major issue.  This was identified by Mr. Walsh's predecessor as well.  Mr. Walsh may have seen &quot;Prime Time&quot; last night.  There has been much negative comment about Ministers, Deputies, county councillors and various other representative bodies in respect of their interface with the planning process.  I do not believe we should apologise as public representatives for engaging in the planning process.  We have a representative role.  It is right, proper and appropriate that public representatives make representations on behalf of their constituents.  However, it must be open and transparent and there must be a mechanism for the public to see those interfaces with the planning authority.  That is worth saying because it came up last night.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i>carried a major story that implied politicians were all over the place frustrating the planning processes.  If the system is robust enough, correct and full of integrity, it will withstand challenges, which is all they are.</p><p>I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to three or four more issues but I will not comment.  This is a very interesting case, namely, Connolly <i>v</i>. An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

It has been completed.  This was a planning case.  The board's decision was overturned and it was appealed to the High Court.  I will not go into more detail.  The board lost and it then went on to the Supreme Court and it also lost there, which is most interesting.  I have the judgment here.  Much of the expenditure was incurred by the board, but that is its prerogative, and I respect that.  We must be careful because we have a situation now where there is no appeal system for any development of more than 100 houses.  Unfortunately, because of the Government's arrangements, Rebuilding Ireland and the priorities of the Custom House, there are no appeals for major planning applications.  The first appeal is to the board and then applicants go from the board to the courts. The courts, therefore, are becoming the arbitrators of planning policy.  That should be of concern to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the public and to us because of the significant costs attached.  There is also significant exposure for the board.  It is not a nice place for anyone to find themselves in and, in particular, it is not a nice place when there is a lot of money involved.  I am happy to send on the details if anyone wants a reference for it but there are lessons to be learnt from that case and the vast costs incurred by the board.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Walsh comment on the conflict in contravening local county development plans?  That is a source of great annoyance to local councillors.  They agree county development plans.  It is one of their most significant powers and functions and then the board overrides them.  What is more frustrating is that the board sometimes makes a determination on a planning application where its inspector has decided that it should not go ahead but the board then overturns the decision of its inspector.  I understand the board and the inspector have roles but they need to communicate because there are concerns.</p> <p>  I refer to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire cruise berth.  It is not a live application.  I do not wish to go into it but when I looked at the website this morning, I had no better idea what was happening.  There is no clarity on the decision.  Much of it is about messaging.  I know I have said a lot.  I am supportive of the board.  I recognise its independence but it is important to communicate messages. I am especially interested in how its member are appointed.  Are there currently vacancies on the board?</p></speech>

I appreciate his comments and support.  I will try to deal with most of the issues, and Ms Lambkin and Ms Kenny might step in on elements of them.</p> <p>  I am very impressed with the calibre of people both on the board and throughout the organisation.  When one comes in with a fresh perspective, it is always good to test and review what is there and to see how, as Chairman, one can add value and further improve.  Communication is hugely important, both internally within the organisation and within the system from local to national Government, but also in respect of stakeholders and members of the public.  The system we operate at the moment in terms of how we make information available and how we justify and explain the rationale for our decisions is constantly evolving and improving.  We can always make things clearer by the use of plainer English but we work in a complex legislative and legal context so there is some legalese that we must reflect in our decisions but, equally, we are working through making that information available and accessible on an improved website.</p><p> The Senator raised the issue of the strategic objective period of 18 weeks.  We have made progress on that in recent months and will make more progress over the next six months.  The reason we are still in the low 40s is that we have taken a conscious decision to deal with the oldest cases first and to make sure that people are not waiting any longer, whether it is for large scale applications, an extension to a house or whatever it might be.  The efforts of the board and the entire organisation have been focused on prioritising those applications.  We are working through them and many of the older cases have now been dealt with and addressed.  Over the course of the next three to six months, we will see the percentage going back to where it needs to be.  There will always be cases that require further information or even an oral hearing.  It is a challenge to say that every single case will be addressed within 18 weeks but certainly we would expect to be back to where we were in the last three or four years, where we were hitting 80% to 85%.  That is the target we are setting ourselves for the end of 2019.  I recognise that people also need to understand this and have those dates communicated to them.  They need transparency in terms of when to expect a decision if we are not meeting the 18 week target.</p><p> We do not have Exchequer income in our budgets for 2019 just yet but I am happy to communicate that when we get it.  We have communicated to the Department what we feel is required in terms of our capital and current spending.  We continue to engage and communicate with the Department and I would-----</p></speech>

In terms of how it is spread out, we have set out our case and continue to have sufficient comfort that what we are doing will have the resources required.  We expect to have both existing resources and additional resources, if required under the workforce plan that we are undertaking.  We believe that we will be pushing an open door in that regard.<br/><br/>On the independent review, I was involved in that from the other side back in 2015 and 2016.  A huge amount of work has been done and as the Minister and the Department have pointed out, we created an implementation group comprising departmental and board officials to look at the more than 100 recommendations of the review and to determine which ones were practical and could be implemented.  Some of them are already in place, while others require legislative solutions.  The responsibility lies with the board in some areas and with the Department in others.  It is important to note that our five-year strategy looked very closely at all the actions that were within the control of the board and we have integrated all those actions into what we see as our five-year priority strategies.  From the board's perspective, we are confident that there is a very strong correlation between the actions and commitments that we feel we can deliver.  It will be a matter for the Department and the Minister to decide on some of the legislative or policy changes that may be required, including the issue of how the board is actually appointed.  That is set down in legislation in the Planning Act at the moment.  It is in the Minister's gift to look again at where nominations come from, that is, to consider the nominating bodies and to determine whether that needs to be updated or refined further.  The board stands ready to support, inform and assist the Department and the Minister in making the process more efficient and responsive.<br/><br/>On the actions we have delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, the core element has been the strategic housing development policy.  It is comforting for me to see a policy that I helped to design actually working so well in practice.  It reflects the work that Ms Kenny and her team and the board itself have done to ensure it was a practical step.  It may not be the perfect solution in terms of everybody getting what they want but it responded to a particularly acute need.  We had to ensure that there was some clarity and certainty around the timeframes for delivering large scale housing projects.  In terms of the record of homes that have been approved, it has not been a case of blanket approval.  We have refused around one quarter of the applications that were submitted to the board.  We have made very clear in our pre-application consultations that there is a lot of work that the developers need to do and, indeed, the local authorities need to feed in their views too.  That obviously has a time stop.  The legislation is due to fall, unless the Minister changes it, in 2021 and the process will then revert to the normal local authority planning system.<br/><br/>Ms Lambkin will talk about the ICT strategy and the fact that we have revamped our entire system and gone live internally.  These projects always take longer than one might anticipate or hope for but it is important that the board has a fully robust system which it is confident can deliver before we go live externally and allow for online applications.  Ms Kenny will deal with the issue of national versus local policies and how the board handles the potential mismatch there and the considerations involved in balancing national with local interests in certain plans.  <br/><br/>On the question of litigation, there are lots of costs involved.  We spent almost &euro;3 million on legal costs in 2018.  There are cases from which we can learn and we can then adapt our systems in order to avoid future litigation.  We are learning from solutions across the board.  We delivered about 2,900 cases last year and only 41 cases were subject to judicial review.  Obviously, many of those were high profile cases but in terms of proportion, it is not a very significant number.  That said, anything that draws high court costs and takes time to run through the system should be minimised.  We are trying to ensure that the State is well served and any public money is spent wisely.  We have conceded cases where we felt that we were clearly deficient in terms of our decision or in terms of our handling of the case.  Some of those have come back in and we have had to review them again, <i>de novo</i>.  We have a very strong system in which there are opportunities for judicial review.  People can take a case and it is important that the system is efficient.  I know that the courts themselves are looking at ways to ensure that there is a fast-tracking of some of the more critical cases through the commercial courts.  Some cases go on the weekly list so that the courts can examine whether they need to be fast tracked rather than going through the longer High Court process.  <br/><br/>I will ask Ms Lambkin to talk a little about the Plean-IT ICT system and Ms Kenny about the other issue to which I referred.</p></speech>

It is a multi-year project that was started in 2014.  It is being implemented in a number of phases.  We are finished phases one and two now.  These involved the implementation of a new case management system for the organisation and a Geographic Information System, GIS, which required a complete overhaul of processes and systems within the organisation.  We are through that now and we launched the system live in October 2017.  Every new case that came into the building went onto that system from that point.  At this stage, we have the large majority of all cases on that system.  What happens next is that the online service will be built on top of the case management system.  As with any of these types of projects, it is taking longer than we expected.  We are just completing the final phases of procurement for programme management services so that we can start work during 2019 on the online element, that is, the website and the portal.  These are the important parts for our customers in terms of being able to submit appeals and applications online and to be able to make payments electronically.  We are just scoping that out and we hope to be well on our way to progressing delivery of that before the end of the year.</p></speech>

At the moment, that is largely within the national framework, given the number of recent guidance and policy context changes that have occurred nationally.  Ultimately, all of these will begin to be reflected in the some of the county and local development plans over the coming years so that there will be less of a mismatch between the national picture and the local policy context.  However, if we have applications or appeals in with us and there are differences between the two, which is the case at the moment, there is no one, <i>de facto</i>, way of dealing with them.  We look at what is in most accordance with proper planning and sustainable development.</p><p>If we are contravening the plan or recommending contravention of the plan, the reasons for that are very clearly outlined.  It usually relates to a conflict between the local and national picture or within particular plans.  There are several conflicts within particular development and local plans and those would be considered.<br/><br/>On strategic housing, obviously, we do not have to go through the section 37 criteria in order to contravene a plan.  The one thing we cannot contravene is the zoning objective.  However, a developer proposing to materially contravene a plan is required to advertise that fact when making the application to us and to justify that contravention.  We will examine that closely.  There is no<i>de facto</i>permission to contravene a plan.  The proposal must accord with proper planning and sustainable development and that is what we consider in order to try to deliver the best for the future.</p></speech>

My questions are very similar to those that have been asked.  The length of time taken to deal with planning appeals is a significant issue.  An 18-week processing time was mentioned.  Appeals relating to schemes in my area have been waiting nearly a year for a decision.  It is unacceptable that we have a housing crisis and it may take that length of time to deal with an appeal for one-off housing or a larger scheme.  Mr. Walsh is new to the job but that waiting period is unacceptable.  I know he will change it.  Does it result from staffing issues or planning applications themselves?  Why does it take so long to deal with some cases?  I acknowledge that the board must look for further information and environmental studies and so on in order to ensure that everything is done right.  More effort must be put into shortening the time taken to process appeals.  It is important that the board concentrate on that issue.</p> <p>  I understand that we are in the process of clarifying objections to planning.  The Minister stated that legitimate objections will be considered but groundless objections, such as by a person in a nice neighbourhood with lots of land who objects simply because he or she does not want any more houses built in the area, will not.  Are there so many "not in my back yard" complaints without merit that the Minister believes legislation is required to deal with that?  Obviously, we want houses to be built for those who need them but we must also ensure that there is a system in place such that everyone is listened to.  I ask Mr. Walsh to clarify that issue because I was a little taken aback by the Minister's recent comments in that regard.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan referred to the importance of local area plans, particularly in local authorities.  More planners are being recruited around the country to deal with this area.  Zoning is very important for local authorities.  When I was a councillor we changed the zoning of certain areas.  We must try to speed up the process because it can take a very long time to change a zoning designation, which is of particular importance in the case of a group housing scheme.  Is there a system at which we could look where the various agencies work together to try to get this done more quickly?  There is a particular urgency on that issue.</p> <p>  The Government has approved the appointment of the first planning regulator, Mr. Niall Cussen, whose role will involve reference to the national planning framework.  The appointment is very welcome.  We should probably always have had a planning regulator.  He will be vital because he will work with the various agencies.  What will his role entail?  What will be his interaction with An Bord Plean&aacute;la?</p> <p>  As the witnesses are probably aware, it costs &euro;220 to appeal a planning decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and &euro;50 to make a submission or observation on an appeal.  Has that caused difficulty for some people?  Is it likely that the level or range of fees will increase with the introduction of the new online scheme?  Some people cannot afford the fees.  I understand that there must be transparency and everybody wants that, but people only object for proper reasons and those reasons must be considered.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Walsh to address my questions on fees, the planning regulator, local authorities and their role, staffing levels, the time taken to process appeals and the legislation proposed by the Minister.  I am delighted that more planners are being recruited, which will be of benefit in the bigger picture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019020600002#N00300"><p>The Senator is correct that a waiting time of one year for an appeal is not acceptable in the view of the board.  A confluence of internal challenges existed.  The small number of board members meant that they could only hear a limited number of cases.  As Ms Lambkin stated, a new system was implemented across the organisation involving all files having to be put onto the system rather than staff dealing with hard copy files as had previously been the case.  That required that the system be refined.  In the middle of that process, the board took on new strategic housing functions which meant that we had to redesign and build into the system the capability to deal with the new strategic housing schemes of 100 houses or more.  Obviously, there is a large intake of cases.  We have recruited to ensure that we have sufficient staff with the right skills sets to cope with the demand.  As cases have become more complex, they require more resources.  I am now in a position to look to the future.  I recognise and the organisation accepts that change is required.  Our objective is to be able to deliver all cases within 18 weeks by the summer and to then maintain that level of service.  We have brought through some initiatives.  We have created a free-flow system for smaller cases such as extensions, which we seek to prioritise and have dealt with quickly by the inspectorate and the board.  Some 96% of smaller cases are decided within an 18-week period.  It can be done but not for every project.  We will improve further.  As we develop the system we will refine it and it will become more efficient.</p> <p>  The board treats every submission, whether from an individual or a group, in the same way.  We look at everything in the file, the history of the local authority and what happened.  If it is an appeal, we get the full papers from the local authority.  The point of having an impartial board is that we can look at an appeal, assess it in its entirety and come to a robust and defensible decision.  The number of appeals is not declining but that probably reflects the current level of planning activity rather than more objections and complaints being lodged.  Indeed, many people contact us in support of developments.  Not all submissions seek to block planning applications.  The number of cases we are able to process reflects the fact that we are still efficiently dealing with cases while adhering to the clear statutory requirements for us to take all views into account.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that there has been an upsurge in planning activity.  It is great that local authorities are getting the resources and planners that they need.  As well as development management, they have responsibility for development planning.  Obviously, the national planning framework and the regional plans need to be reflected and built in to city, county and local plans.  An Bord Plenan&aacute;la has more than 50 planners but, given the complexity of some of the appeals, we needed to ensure that we have the right skill sets and expertise to efficiently process those cases.  It is a matter for the Minister and the Department to ensure that local authorities are resourced to do likewise.  We are a planning authority.  The planning regulator, Mr. Niall Cussen, will have a very important role.  The need for a planning regulator was flagged in the report of the Mahon tribunal in 2012-2013.  Although it has taken some time for the regulator to be appointed, with activity currently ramping up, his role will be to assess how the system is working at local level and to ensure consistency.</p><p>It is a policing role but it is also a supportive and facilitating role.  Efficiencies and best practice can be shared across local authorities and we are able to assess and address some of the issues Senator Boyhan had about the perceived or temporal inconsistencies between what might be in local plans and national guidance.  That is something in which the regulator will have a strong role.  We will be subject to the scrutiny of the regulator as well in the way we perform as a planning body.  We will also answer to and be subject to the role of the regulator, who is independent in his functions.</p><p> One question related to appeal fees.  Obviously, the fees are something that the board proposes and they are set by the Minister.  Again, as part of improving the system and so on, we may take the opportunity once the Plean-IT project is rolled out and available to see whether the fees are proportionate.  The fees have not changed much in the past ten years or more.</p></speech>

Obviously, the development plan process is set down in legislation and is a matter for the Department.  It is a long period but the long period reflects the need for engagement.  It reflects the need for opportunities through public consultation processes to have adequate debate among councillors and to look at seeing how a scheme will evolve.  The context for planning is changing so quickly that a six-year development plan may be very different when it comes to the next six-year plan.  However, there are opportunities to vary plans, and in many cases plans will be varied once the regional plans are in place, and it is a matter for the local government to prioritise that system and to work with the Department.</p></speech>

I believe that the 18 week period is unacceptable in today's environment.  I fail to see why it cannot be put into statute that a decision has to be made in 18 weeks one way or another.  We brought a similar measure in the local authorities many years ago whereby the authorities were forced to make a decision within eight weeks.  The board should be under the same obligation, whether it is 18 weeks, 20 weeks or 12 weeks.  In any event, a decision must be made.  It is unfair that a person who has to go through an appeal process does not know when the decision is going to be made.  Whether it is a matter of business or the family home makes no difference.  People should know as a basic entitlement when the decision is to be made.  I acknowledge the work of the board in trying to address that, but the level of 40% is nowhere near where we need to be.  It should not be there.  We should not have the option in the first place.  The decision should be made within the statutory process and it should not be extended.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh has been part of the strategic housing development process moving towards the board.  The strategic infrastructure process is with the board at the moment and site valuation is with the board at the moment.  It looks like a great deal of planning is going to the board and bypassing the local authority.  From an observation point of view, there are three different types of planning process.  This is what I am trying to get to and what the public has a difficulty with.  It is very difficult to understand the planning process for the public.  Even as a public representative I find that it gets rather complicated.  Now that the board is dealing with three different types, is there a model or is there something coming forward in a more transparent or consistent way?  The term "consistency in decision-making" was used.  That is what the public wants to see.  They want to see consistency.  It is difficult for the public to understand how decisions are made and it is important that we get consistency in the decision-making process.  I am seeking the opinion of Mr. Walsh on the three different processes that the board is dealing with at the moment.</p> <p>  My next point is on the figures.  One of the charts that the An Bord Plean&aacute;la representatives showed us indicated that 1,200 appeals relate to residential development.  Of that a significant number relate to one-off rural housing appeals.  The figure is in excess of 400.  That raises a concern for me as a person who comes from a rural area and who has been through the rural planning process.  The level of appeals for one-off rural houses is staggeringly high.  Is there anything we should be doing to try to prevent that happening or to deal with issues at council level such that they do not end up with the board?  I have my views on the planning process about one-off rural housing.  There is not enough consultation with the applicant at local authority level.  A great deal could be ironed out there which would mean it might not end up taking the time of An Board Plean&aacute;la officials.</p> <p>  I will offer some observations on the national planning framework, regional plans and county plans.  Although I am supportive of the logic and the sequence, it has put several local area plans completely out of sync in my county.  I mentioned the Newtownmountkennedy plan.  It will have been 16 years before it has a new local area plan because we wrote it at the time of the crash but nothing was happening at the time.  The six-year period ended last year.  Now, we are told that we have to get into sequence with the national planning framework.  The original plan will be adopted.  The information coming through now is that we will not be able to put in place a variation on our county plan and that we will have to redo the county plan.  In the meantime, Newtownmountkennedy will have to wait for the county plan.  It could be another three years before Newtownmountkennedy will have a local area plan.  It is similar with the Wicklow town and Wicklow environs plans, which were meant to be done this year.  They are going to be kicked down the road now.  Development is beginning to take place in both these areas, but they will not have a local area plan in place to deal with each situation.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on county development plan policy versus national plan policy and maybe even EU policy further up the line.  There has been controversy around wind energy.  County policy has been overruled by national policy.  Despite this, at the moment there is no national policy and we are still waiting for the strategy on wind.  We have many applications for solar farms.  There is no policy around this sector.  Some authorities are not making decisions because there is no policy.  What will happen around the area when there is no policy on the information?</p> <p>  I welcome the Plean-IT project.  It is a pity it is not in place now but I can understand how important it will be.  It makes the process transparent for the public when it can access all the information freely online.  The same applies to our county plan process.  When we show people that they can get everything online, it makes them more comfortable with the system and makes them believe that the system is more transparent.  The same applies with the board.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la website could probably do with a rehash.  It is rather difficult for people to make their way around it.  I might come back on some points following the reply from Mr. Walsh.</p></speech>

One core issue concerns whether the statutory objection period should be cut off.  That issue has been discussed between the Department and this committee and has been debated in the Oireachtas through various tranches of legislation.</p><p>The system is the system we are currently implementing.  Until the Government and Oireachtas change the legislation, we will be dealing with it.  We have learned lessons.  In the strategic housing development process, we have been able to deliver on all cases within 16 weeks.  The Oireachtas built in a safeguard stipulating that if the 16-week period is exceeded, there is a penalty for the board.  It has been possible to deliver on this because there has been a very clear structure of pre-application consultations involving the local authority, developer and board.  Everyone understands what is expected, the key drivers and the appropriate use of the site, and then we drive forward.  We have resourced a strategic housing development team dedicated at administrative and inspector levels within the organisation to ensure we can meet the 16-week deadline.  The reality, however, is that there are limitations to strategic housing development.  If we were to hold an oral hearing or look for further information, the process would require more time in order to enable people to comment and send in further information, to see what comes in so there is transparency on a file, and to participate in an oral hearing.  The difficulty is that with every single case, one wants to ensure the board has sufficient information before it to make a robust decision.</p><p> With regard to some of the European directives and requirements and environmental impact assessment reports, appropriate assessment is required.  Again, the processes in this regard add time to the evaluation but also to circulation and participation by stakeholders, including other Departments.  Until such time as the Oireachtas or the Minister say we are changing the system, we will proceed as I have outlined insofar as we can.  Where we have been able to identify particular types of schemes - the free-flow, smaller types -  we are hitting 96%.  There will always be one or two cases in which we do not have enough information and have to go back out.  That might take four or five weeks because when someone replies, we then ask the local authority or other observers to respond.  We are seeking to make the system more efficient.</p><p> As I mentioned in my opening statement, strategic infrastructure involves an important role for the board.  I recognise one might feel this has evolved and moved into the board from local government and the planning process but we have processed and adjudicated on about 110 or 111 cases since 2006 or 2007, when the strategic infrastructure functions fell to the board.  These involve large-scale projects and major schemes, including roads and infrastructure projects.  They have provided many of the building blocks for what we regard as the investment necessary for business, residential and commercial activity to happen as demand for development increases.</p><p> Through our systems and processes, we are learning lessons from strategic housing and determining what lessons we can learn about transparency and communication to streamline pre-application consultations, but recognising that where there are complex cases, they might not be as straightforward as a housing development.  There could be much interaction on heritage and environmental issues.  There is certainly room for greater efficiencies and streamlining of the processes.  That is something we will be prioritising the first half of this year.</p><p> It was stated that if we had a clearer system and better communication regarding how we make decisions, so people can understand the system, it would be beneficial.  The issue of a website arises in this regard.  The development and modernisation of a website is one of our top priorities.  Ms Lambkin is very eager to move with the times and ensure we have it.  We have obviously had to prioritise our internal improvements first.  As we now have the system running live within the organisation, we are certainly turning our attention to it.  Part of that is about making information fully available so people can navigate the board's website.</p><p> It is also a question of the language we use.  Both Senators touched on how we explain how the system works.  It is a matter of removing some of the jargon from the system in so far as we can.</p><p> I shall ask Ms Kenny to elaborate on local area plans, one-off rural housing and the high rates.  Our body is in development management so we actually deal with applications and appeals.  The process concerns development plans being out of date and local area plans.  It is a challenge.  There are consequences to having plans that do not reflect the current context or reality, and this is where the board has to take a very balanced view and consider the latest and most up-to-date policies on the environment, planning and other elements, in addition to considering the local objectives.  That is something the new regulator should be examining in terms of determining how to address the issue of consistency between regional, county and local plans, which should take precedence, and whether there are better ways to ensure consistency.  Ms Kenny might touch on wind energy also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019020600002#P00200"><p>Regarding out-of-date local area plans, particularly regarding the strategic housing application, there has been very positive interaction with the planning authorities, which recognise and are hamstrung by the fact that some of their plans are quite out of date.  They are very supportive of the proposals coming in, notwithstanding that they do not comply 100% with the development plans or local area plans because of the passage of time and the delays in having to review them, brought about by the changing national and regional policy context.  In a way, the strategic housing allows those to go ahead.  Notwithstanding that the board is allowing and facilitating material contraventions of plans, they are actually being supported by the planning authority because of the time lag.  The others are, unfortunately, not in such an advantageous position, but that depends on the particular case and the rationale being put forward on appeal stage.</p> <p>  With regard to the rural housing element, it is not just first-party appeals.  If members believe all the applicants are appealing the decisions, they should note that a significant number of the decisions are appealed by third parties.  While pre-application consultation assists the applicant, our system allows for third parties to be involved and to have a say.  That will also be related.  The other element that keeps the figure high is that sometimes it is an issue not of the principle but of the design, conditioning and so on.  The figure looks quite dramatic within the residential context as a whole but it is not just a case of applicants being refused and having to appeal.  There are multiple reasons.</p> <p>  With regard to wind and solar energy and the lack of national policy or guidelines in that regard, there is a general policy or national context in terms of positivity towards renewable energy.  We know we have to move towards renewable energy.  In principle, we should be looking positively at renewable energy.  We must look to the local context, local development plans, county development plans and so on to ensure there are not particular issues that would influence the decision-making because ultimately the board will look at each case on a site-by-site basis and at the proper planning and sustainable development.  We support renewable energy but if there is a negative or adverse impact brought to our attention by the planning authority or objectors, that will obviously be brought into consideration.  Just because there is not specific guidance in this regard, which would be very helpful, the board is still in a position to consider these cases in a very holistic way.  As Mr. Walsh said, however, we are referring to some of the application types or appeal types because they do not all fall into the strategic infrastructure development category.  Solar does not fall into it at all.  I refer to some of the appeal types that take longer than the 18 weeks.  Since they are new, there is not always a policy context, nationally or locally.  Therefore, there are sometimes oral hearings and sometimes we have to go back and circulate information and look for more information.  It is a very new field.  When we are operating at full efficiency, these cases are part of the 15% regarding which it takes us a little longer to ensure we have a consistent approach across the board.</p><p>I wish to address one point I omitted.  Going back to the issue of customer service and our ultimate driver to make the system more accessible and easier to understand, we are obviously working very closely with the local authorities, the CCMA and its e-planning team.  We sit on the steering group on planning.  We are aligning ourselves so that as and when they pilot their scheme for online applications in the first instance we will be ready to take any online appeals.  We will be moving into an aligned and synchronised system.  Separately some housing and large infrastructure cases come our way directly.  We will be taking new applications as well as dealing with appeals.  We are clearly focused on ensuring that hopefully by this time next year we will be able to talk about how the new system is close to being in place if not in place, making it much easier to make appeals and see what is happening on the ground.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that and thank its staff.  Sometimes given the An Bord Plean&aacute;la web difficulties, which I will come to in a minute, it is often hard to find information, but when we follow up with phone calls we always get the information very quickly.  I ask Mr. Walsh to pass that on to the staff.</p> <p>  I will make two comments and then ask some specific questions.  I share Deputy Casey's view.  Not only would I have a strict statutory limit, but I would have a shorter statutory limit for the majority of cases.  From my understanding of the majority of cases, not those outliers or exceptionally long ones, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is reviewing substantive assessments that have already been made.  Having a statutory limit is not a decision for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I accept its position.  I presume it is a resources issue.  Local authorities can do it in eight weeks because approximately 30 of them are processing all those applications.  This is a matter we can raise with the Government at some other stage.  We need to get to a point where those timelines are much more fixed and streamlined for the average cases.</p> <p>  I also comment on the political debate that has started.  These are not questions the witnesses can answer but it is important to point out I have a different view from the other members who have spoken so far.  Third party opinions are an important part of our planning process.  I say opinions and not objections because many of the opinions submitted are not objections.  They are suggested improvements, amendments etc. and they are valid.</p> <p>  There is considerable hypocrisy in the political process.  I will not name any politician or any case.  I regularly see politicians submit objections to developments not on planning grounds but purely for electoral reasons.  However, I think the Minister is wrong; most of those opinions have no impact on planning decisions nor should they.  I have seen planning submissions from politicians that make no planning points whatsoever.  The politician knows it will have no negative impact, but wants to be seen to be opposing something for electoral reasons.</p> <p>  On one occasion politicians who wanted the development to proceed deliberately submitted objections opposing it, knowing full well it would have no material impact.  I do not ask the witnesses to comment on that.  I want to put it on the record because other members have raised it and I think there is a failure of leadership on behalf of some politicians to engage with residents to try to ensure that where a development happens it is done in a sensible way.</p> <p>  There is also considerable misinformation out there that just because a politician objects it has an impact.  I would be very concerned and my experience on South Dublin County Council is almost no political objection has any planning impact because the quality of the objections is so poor and they are not rooted in planning regulation.  In light of last night's programme it is important for us to be clear about that.</p> <p>  On a more general point we need to level the playing field for genuine third party opinion makers who want to improve development but do not have technical expertise.  Other jurisdictions have non-governmental organisations that can assist residents not to oppose something but to work out how the development of a hospital, school or housing can happen in a way that meets the needs of developers and the local community.  Greater support for third party and particularly community-based third party opinions would improve the process overall.</p> <p>  Of the 60% of cases taking longer than 18 weeks, how many are taking six months or 12 months?  If Mr. Walsh does not have that information, he might be able to provide it in tabular form at a later stage so that we have a quantifiable picture for it.  I would always use the phrase four and a half months because 18 weeks just sounds short.  Four and a half months is a long time.  I know some of these are incredibly complex cases; I am not trying to minimise it.  However, I would like to know how many are eight, 12, 16 or 18 months to get a sense of all of that.</p> <p>  Mr. Walsh will remember I supported the legislation on strategic housing developments at the time.  What is the average timeline from start to finish for the applications that have been through the board?  The 48 weeks was the problematic length of time for the 15 or so cases that the Department at the time cited to justify the introduction of the legislation.  How much better is An Bord Plean&aacute;la doing than the average 48 weeks from the spreadsheet for 2015 large housing developments that was given to the committee at that stage?  If Mr. Walsh does not have the information today, he might send it on to us subsequently.</p> <p>  How will An Bord Plean&aacute;la get to the 80%?  It will be great if it can do it and the committee will commend Mr. Walsh and all his staff.  The resources at An Bord Plean&aacute;la have not increased dramatically - I know there are more board members etc.  Promising that it will get to that level of compliance by the middle or end of the year is a big commitment.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about the major issue of the website and Mr. Walsh has answered part of it.  The local authority planning sections' websites have improved greatly.  Not only is it easier to search for something, but, for example, the interactive mapping tools now available are wonderful.  I often want to know about a planning application in South Dublin County Council.  Without any notion of the reference number, I can go on map and see all the planning history.  Will the An Bord Plean&aacute;la site eventually not only have functionality that allows us to access decisions and filed, but will it also have that kind of mapping tool?  Does it hope to reach that point?  Having that would be an enormous advance and more than welcome.</p> <p>  Returning to reaching the 80%, what is holding An Bord Plean&aacute;la back?  Is it simply those legacy issues of fewer board members and staff?  What is the explanation?  If they are all just legacy issues, clearly it will be better able to meet the 80%.  If they are not just legacy issues, are there other issues of which we should be aware?</p></speech>

I note his first few comments and probably will not give a view on those.  I do not have a breakdown on the number of cases and where they are and how many are 12 plus months or whatever.  When I went into the board I was clear that I wanted to look at the oldest cases and ensure they were put at the top of the pile and addressed.  I can understand the frustration of someone whose application has been waiting for 12 months when someone else's is completed in four and half months or three and a half months.  The vast majority of the cases we dealt with in the last few months of the year - the 600-odd cases - are cases that were already over the 18 weeks.  Therefore making the decision to focus on cases that are well beyond the four and a half months did not improve - in fact it disimproved - our percentage.</p> <p>  Ms Kenny and the planning team have confirmed that we are at a point where cases where the decision dates that were due in the latter half of the year we are now actually up to where the four and a half month period in most cases is probably November or December.  We are now getting it back to where there are still two or three months of cases that still need to be resolved.  Obviously some of the larger cases will require significant further information, ecological reports, full-year studies etc.  Some will obviously skew this and be almost historical cases.</p> <p>  There are some other cases where we have actually opened cases through pre-application discussions and the legislation as it stands does not allow the board to close it; it requires the applicant to actually close.  We probably have 50 or 60 cases on our books that will never happen but still exist.</p><p>We will engage with the Department to see whether legislation can be amended or improved to correct this anomaly whereby cases are left sitting.  We are happy to provide further information.  We are within the last two or three months of dealing with the bulk of cases.<br/><br/>This partly answers the Deputy's second question as to whether we are being too ambitious in how we will deliver this.  The statutory objective is to deal with cases within 18 weeks and, at present, the average is 22 or 22.5 weeks.  Some cases are dealt with faster and others are not.If we take it that, on average, we are getting approximately 250 cases a month, over the next three or four months we will work through the remaining backlog and deal with cases in which there is enough information for us to go to the board.  The fact we have ten board members as opposed to the four we had back in May or June 2017 means we can have a number of board meetings at the same time.  The minimum quorum for normal board meetings is three so with ten people we can have three board meetings concurrently.  The larger strategic housing development schemes require more people.<br/><br/>As Ms Lambkin said, when we introduced the new system staff were not able to deal with applications for a month while we took our time.  We began with live cases.  We stated that from a particular date we would put them on the system.  This involved our entire team, from people in reception to those processing cases, to ensure the system worked.  There was a certain and necessary slowdown that always happens in a transition.  If we lose one or two months' work, we will suddenly find ourselves 500 or 600 cases behind and chasing them.  We must then decide whether to go with the old cases.<br/><br/>If, as I outlined, we can put in the resources and be innovative in tackling this, for example, by initiating extra work and overtime and incentivising planners to take extra cases and deal with them out of normal office hours, we will clear some of the backlog.  We need to continue to do this and get support from the Department, not only for the resources we need but also because we expect to see more cases, including more complex cases, coming through.  If there is a case where an inspector or a team is no longer tied up for three months but for six or nine months dealing with a huge file, it means we do not have an inspector to deal with other cases that might come through.  It is not solely about throwing bodies at this.  It is about making sure we have people in the right locations.  We are hiring an ecologist and we will bring in business analysts and programme managers to ensure we keep Plean-IT on track.  I feel very reassured given how the board operates and how professional the team is.  Over 12 months, we will probably have dealt with between 60% and 70% of cases because of having to deal with legacy issues in the first half of the year.  For the last quarter, however, I expect to deal with more than 80% of cases and to maintain this rate as we go forward to ensure the organisation will not face the same challenges in future.  It is something we are ready to do.  The workforce plan will further support and identify any deficits we need on the resources side.<br/><br/>With regard to mapping, we will build in a geographic information system, GIS.  The wider <i>myplan.ie</i>, which is led by the Department and includes local authorities, is very much more from a zoning perspective and seeing designations.  As Ms Lambkin said, we have been building a system.  The GIS element is the second phase of our Plean-IT project.  When the website goes live we will have a GIS and it will be interactive.  Going back to the issue raised by Deputy Casey, the key is to have a joined up system.  We cannot have the board doing one thing and local authorities doing something else.  There must be synergy and sharing.<br/><br/>With regard to the intensity of the work, if we were to try to deliver cases more quickly, it would come down to resources and ensuring we have timely feedback from statutory bodies and local authorities.  Even as it is, strategic housing developments have worked.  We have put a huge amount of focus and resources on them but they are hugely work-intensive.</p></speech>

It appears larger because 117 were received but 20 of these were invalidated for one reason or another and resubmitted.  We had 97 valid submissions, of which 40 applications have been decided and 20 are on hand, which is a total of 60.  We are beginning to ramp it up.  At the very start we could only be involved in the pre-application stage.  On day one, we had a nine-week lag with regard to pre-application submissions.  We noticed that towards the end of 2018, we had a significant number of pre-application consultations.  On average, there were 20 per month in the final quarter of the year.  There was also an increase in application numbers.  We anticipate that 2019 will be busier because the pre-application consultations will be more dense and intense in the latter part and it will take time.  A large proportion of pre-application consultations require further consideration.  We have been delivering within the nine-week period.  The applicant must then go back and have further conversations with the planning authority before coming back in.  That said, they are all coming in within a relatively tight timeframe.  There may be a couple of months during which they will come back into us.</p></speech>

He knows where I am going with this.  On the basis of what Ms Kenny has said, Mr. Walsh's answer did not compare like with like.  The previous 48-week period was all in from the day the pre-planning application was made until the final board decision.  It included developers submitting badly done applications and having to resubmit or having extended additional information requests.  What I would like, and Mr. Walsh's answer has not given it to me, is to know how do we compare like with like in all of the applications?</p><p>If, for example, the 27 pre-applications were logged but sent back because they were not valid, I presume they would come back in and be included and that the 97 figure is the unique number.  With the applications that were rejected and then come back, is An Bord Plean&aacute;la including in the calculation of its averages that initial period when the applications were rejected and then put back in? </p></speech>

It is typically in and around a month if an applicant has decided to proceed.  Some people decide to not proceed.  If they do proceed, the timelines are very much dependent on whether the applicant wants to engage.  The inspection board does not cause any delay.</p></speech>

In some cases it was six months or nine months and so on.  That was not something the local authority could control although it had asked for the additional information.  If I was to ask what is the actual average time for the processing of these one would need to include the period between the nine weeks and the 16 weeks.  If it is a very short period that is great, but I would really like to know, comparably from start to finish, what the actual average is.  Ms Kenny has said that it would be more than 25 weeks.  How can we have a comparison on this that would allow us to judge the improvement?  I presume there is an improvement, so it would be in An Bord Plean&aacute;la's interest to show it.</p></speech>

This is not just for strategic housing developments, it is for the ordinary appeals that are made.</p> <p>  One thing has been annoying me for a while, it is probably to do with my own County Kildare, namely, the interpretation of national planning framework, NPF, particularly national policy objective No. 19.  Ms Kenny will be aware of objective No. 19.  The first time I came across it with regard to the board was an application in Carlow, which was granted by the planning inspector in April but was refused by the board in October, quoting NPF national policy objective No. 19.  I have spoken with the Minister on this.  I have a problem with this.  The Minister's intention on it when he spoke about it in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad-----</p></speech>

I have a problem with it in the context of the Minister's intention and the board's interpretation.  To my mind that has caused untold problems, especially in County Kildare.  That board decision was made in mid-October and from 1 November, decisions by Kildare County Council have included NPF national policy objective No. 19.  There is real concern that the interpretation taken by the board of what the Minister's intentions might or might not have been has suddenly caused fierce problems for people putting in planning applications for one-off housing.  They would qualify under either social or economic reasons.  Social criteria is used because from an EU perspective, we cannot use being close to family as a reason.  I would like Mr. Walsh to explain to me his interpretation of NPF national policy objective No. 19 in order that we can sort out this issue.</p> <p>  My last question is on strategic housing development.  Mr. Walsh referred to the quorum normally being three.  Has this been increased with regard to the SHDs?  Mr. Walsh said that generally there were more board members there.  Does he request more than three or can the decision be made based on a quorum of three?</p></speech>

I will answer a few of the queries and Ms Kenny may be delighted to answer some of the questions regarding objective No. 19.</p> <p>  Senator Lawlor asked how long the board has a file from the time when the inspector hands it over.  The 18 weeks is generally broken down into the first five weeks for processing, validating the application, circulating information to the local authority, getting data from the local authority if it is an appeal, and notifying other statutory bodies or Departments if they need to be aware that an application has been appealed.  Then there is a nine-week period when the inspector will have the file, go out on-site to inspect and do the necessary research to prepare the folder.  The board then has it for between three and four weeks, to make the decision within the 18-week period.  That is generally the timeline that we keep, but where there are issues around further information some of those requests may push that timeline out.  On average the board members have three to four weeks with the file.</p></speech>

This specific case was a lot longer than that.  While there may be particular reasons in many cases - and Mr. Walsh has identified that - surely the inspector's report would make a recommendation and the board's decision should not take as long as six months.</p></speech>

That is our timeline under the strategic objective periods.</p><p>The 18 weeks is broken down but, as we said, we have been dealing with a backlog.  I do not know that particular phase of the timeline but there are many cases in which we have not been able to meet the 18-week period because an inspector has not had time to deal with it within the timeline, or it has not reached the board in time, or for other reasons, but that is the normal period if everything is working to plan and we have all the information.</p><p> The next question was about the rate or divergence of inspectors versus board decisions.  It is normally somewhere between 10% and 15%.  In 2017, the figure was around 12.5%.  In some cases, the board considers whether to overturn a decision or recommendation by the inspector to approve or, indeed, refuse a permission, so it could be either way.  It is not just all one way.  The point and premise of the board is that there is a planning inspector who prepares a file and assesses all the information and there is then a range of expertise on the board.  There are architects, engineers, planners, administrators and people who understand the policy.  Collectively, those board members look at the review, look at the file afresh, examine it and decide whether, in the context of consistency, there are decisions that sometimes merit either altering conditions or deciding to go against the inspector's recommendation.</p></speech>

I can call a full board on any file that I decide.  A minimum quorum is three, including a minimum quorum for strategic housing development, SHD, but there are five members designated in the legislation for strategic housing, with at least three of those at any time because people may not be available.  One would not want to have a quorum of five while only having five members because it is then difficult to make efficient decisions within the timeline.  We record when there is a split decision whether a two-one split, a three-two split or a five-four split.  In many cases, the board comes to a collective view and records its decision.</p></speech>

The legislation and policies are set down and the board interprets the legislation and policy that is produced.  I flag that the Minister may have certain views and intentions but the legislation and policies that are produced and set down are interpreted by the board.  The board often may not be able to read the mind of the Minister.  We look at the legislation, the case law and guidance that is there and then we interpret it.  That reflects a consistency of approach, not only at board level but through local authorities on a practical, case by case basis.  Ms Kenny might be able to elaborate on how it applies in reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.818" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019020600002#T01000"><p>The rural housing guidelines introduced a certain level of consistency across the planning authorities when they were in operation and were understood by the board.  Before the national planning framework, there was the European decision on social need, so the board has looked at that and the national planning context now because the rural housing guidelines are slightly out of date, as are development plans and local area plans, and they do not reflect the NPF.  There are also regional strategies.  We look at the national picture and go all the way down to the local context, as we would in any other instance.  Where there is an inconsistency between the two, we look at the proper planning and sustainable development, predominantly starting at the most relevant and recent and the national picture downwards.</p> <p>  The interpretation of national policy objective 19 depends on the case.  We would, generally, look at that policy in the NPF with the idea of protecting rural life, landscapes and communities, including smaller rural villages.  Planning authorities want populations directed to those places but also facilitated in many rural areas.  Where there are weaker rural areas with declining populations and so on, the national planning policy facilitates housing there whether based on social, economic, local needs or other needs.</p> <p>  Some areas are under strong and growing urban influence as urban areas increase in size and density.  The distances people commute also increase.  Some planning authorities are taking an opportunity to reflect that in their decision-making because the NPF has also referenced that.  Some of the planning authorities are refusing on that basis, as are we.  However we are in consultation with the Department which is currently reviewing, or looking to review, the rural housing guideline which will allow clarity and, I suppose, consistency in the interpretation of the new NPF.</p> <p>  The NPF was intended to set a national picture and a national policy context that would filter down.  That will happen over time.  We are working to ensure that there are consistencies both within the board and across planning authorities and there is a shared understanding and this can take a little bit of time.  We have set up working groups and workshops to ensure a consistent approach and understanding in interpretation.</p></speech>

The County and City Management Association, CCMA, through the land use and transportation study committee, is also involved in looking at rural housing policy for the development plans and local area plans, and we would be informed of those and, ultimately, involved in that.  When the Department reviews its rural housing guidelines, under the local need issue, there will be public consultation on that.</p></speech>

The first relates to people who object to particular planning files, something which the witnesses look at face on and deal with.  As they know, there were a couple of high-profile objections recently which meant a loss of serious investment to the State.  I am curious.  Given the witnesses' experiences, should there be some guidelines or a particular set of rules so that a person who wants to object to a planning file should fit a certain criteria?  A person needs to meet a certain criteria if he or she looks for planning.  There are many hoops to be jumped through at the best of times.  We have been listening to Senator Lawlor speak about local planning.  I am curious because anyone can make an objection from wherever they want, from their sitting room or wherever.  I am trying to drill down.  Is now the time to address this?  There is no problem if someone has a case for an objection.  It is brilliant if somebody wants to make an observation.  Anybody can make any observation and the board can take it on board, as it were.  As we are aware, people who make objections often might have different reasons for making them, and anything but a good reason lies behind quite a lot of objections.  Should some guidelines or criteria exist as a prerequisite for making an objection?  I would like Mr. Walsh to give me a straight answer on that, if at all possible.</p> <p>  Senator Lawlor picked up on something that emanates originally from the Flemish decision on one-off housing and, as we called it at the time, local needs.  We got an Irish answer to a problem we were hiding behind in Ireland.</p><p>The Irish answer to it is that it is local and economic.  Has that been tested?  Is that a case of us suiting ourselves or dressing up the same thing in whatever way makes us feel the best?  Has that been addressed in Europe or anywhere else to see whether we fit into European laws?  Is it the case we are great Europeans who can do what we want and have no borders or have we given ourselves an Irish answer to what we have manipulated as an Irish problem?</p><p> Ms Kenny spoke about the rural housing guidelines.  There are guidelines.  Some planners are great while some are not so good.  It is all down to interpretation.  There is significant variance in how planners interpret the guidelines.  When new guidelines are released, are planners told that something has been done for a particular reason?  I know Senator Lawlor touched on this briefly with regard to training.  If we just bring out guidelines, where some of these people have come from, how they have dealt with planning previously and their backgrounds affect how they will interpret the guidelines.  A person could get results from two different planners with regard to a file that would be like chalk and cheese.  I have seen this at first hand.  I could name 20 cases where this has happened.  I could even name more such cases over the course of my time in politics.  I know this is not An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit but it feeds into a lot of it.  A situation can arise where if someone gets a certain planner, he or she has a good chance of getting planning permission because the planner is tuned in, knows the locality and is trying to keep people in the locality, whereas if the person gets another planner, who comes from Dublin, the planner could say "No" to one-off planning.  This happens.  Unfortunately, this is real life in rural Ireland.  Do the witnesses think such a scenario is good enough for the people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019020600002#U00200"><p>I will take the last question first.  From the board's perspective, we must ensure that we are consistent internally.  Again, as Ms Kenny has said, we have workshops where all of our planning teams come together to discuss issues, cases that have come through, emerging decisions and feedback from the board, so at least from our perspective, we are satisfied that all of our planners understand the context and how we see the interpretation of the guidelines and legislation.  As I said in my opening statement, there is opportunity and scope for the board to support and engage not only with the Department but also with other local authorities and to ensure that, through formal structures with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and through engaging, arranging for workshops and speaking at events, we can deliver and get the balance right.  The Senator is right.  Possibly more than other professions, people bring certain perspectives to planning, but that is not to say that one plan is correct while another is not.  There are always different considerations and perhaps that also reflects the point made by Senator Lawlor around where the inspector has a particular view, having that test through the board itself and saying that there is a review of it.  Obviously, I cannot speak about individual local authorities but I know that from a professional development perspective and from elaborating and explaining our new policies and expectations, the Department as well as the CCMA do arrange for sessions where many planners get together.  That shared information might help to iron out some of those divergences in approach.  It is something on which we will always be working.  Policy is changing quicker than the speed at which we can adapt and it is important that we retain that professional development piece.</p> <p>  Regarding the Flemish decree and whether it is an appropriate approach, Ireland has been engaging with the Commission since 2007 and 2008.  Obviously, the decision that came out was not just one relating to an Irish issue but was something to which we had to adapt.  From ongoing discussions the Department has had with the Commission regarding the national planning framework, NPF, and some of the policies, I know that it is satisfied that the policies set down with regard to rural housing and local need within the NPF are consistent with the Flemish decision.  On that front, it is probably something on which the Department needs to provide its view.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Senator feels that I am not giving him a straight answer to his first question, but the board will look at every submission and every objection that comes through on the merits of the application.  Obviously, we must make sure it is a bona fide submission or objection and that it is not anonymous.  We must be able to trace it and say this is somebody who has outlined his or her view.  Whether he or she raises substantive issues and planning considerations or just provides general support or an objection, these are all factors that the inspector and, ultimately, the board will take on board.  As we outlined, the system allows for third-party appeals.  There are not that many restrictions on being able to ask whether one has standing to make a case.  Obviously, there are some EU environmental requirements in terms of public participation and the Aarhus Convention that enable people to make views known, so it would not be appropriate to restrict it to people within a certain zone.  It is something that the Department and Minister are looking at in the context of some historical cases that have shown up what might be seen as matters where the system might not be as fully aligned with what it was intended to be.  That is the matter for the Minister and Department to look at but I know it is something that is certainly under consideration.</p></speech>

I am not saying it must be somebody living within 20 miles.  I am not tightening a noose around Mr. Walsh's neck, so to speak, with regard to it.  Does Mr. Walsh think it would be helpful for us to have some set of rules so that, in particular, if somebody wanted to make an objection, he or she would fall under some sort of schedule into which he or she would fit?</p></speech>

At times, there is no doubt that the reason behind appeals can be questionable.  I have even noticed some people looking for financial reward out of that, if nothing else.  It has stymied much critical development in the country over the years and is something at which we probably need to look.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  I could spend another two or three hours with them here going through the planning process.  It has been very informative.  Many issues have been raised concerning one-off rural housing, an issue close to my heart.</p><p>I am aware that there are huge inconsistencies regarding once-off rural housing, much of which is down to not understanding the process.  That is why it is vital that everything is as transparent as possible moving forward and that we make the public aware that all this information is available online.  Constituents come in to me and when I open up the computer and bring them all the way down into information on people who are objecting and everything is there, they ask, "Can I see this?".  They are shocked that this information is actually available.  It just puts the planning process in a better place.  I wish Mr. Walsh well in his job.  It is a tough job but we will be here to support him in whatever way we can.  I look forward to another engagement with him, perhaps in the near future, to see how he is progressing on that 40%.</p><p> I now propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.</p></speech>

The Bill is sponsored by Independent Senators, comprising Colette Kelleher, our own Frances Black, Lynn Ruane, Alice-Mary Higgins and John Dolan, and Senator Grace O'Sullivan from the Green Party.</p> <p>  We are joined by Senator Kelleher who will present the Bill on behalf of the co-sponsors.  We are also joined by Mr. Nick Henderson, chief executive officer, and Ms Rosemary Hennigan, policy officer, from the Irish Refugee Council, IRC.  They are both very welcome.  Representing Nasc Ireland and appearing before the committee again, I would like to extend a welcome to Ms Fiona Finn, chief executive officer of the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, and Ms Fiona Hurley, legal services manager.</p> <p>  I will shortly invite the witnesses to make their opening statements in the order in which they have been introduced but I first must draw their attention to the matter of privilege.  They should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Senator Colette Kelleher to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Frances Black, my co-sponsor of the Bill who is sitting at the other side of the table, for being a very supportive person, along with other members of the Civil Engagement group.</p><p>There is much common ground regarding the importance of family reunification and where we differ with the Government, it is more about the means than the end.  I recognise the actions of the Government and the Department of Justice and Equality in support of refugees and their families, including the introduction last year of a temporary Irish humanitarian admission programme, IHAP.  The Minister and I are united in what we intend to achieve in this area.</p><p>I also recognise the work of Nasc, which is a wonderful organisation doing great work in Cork, as well as the Irish Refugee Council and Oxfam Ireland and I say a big &quot;Thank you&quot; to Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Hinds, who is in the Gallery.  I thank the people who have shared their stories with us, those directly affected by the law.  The statement by lzzeddeen Alkarajeh outlines the struggles he is experiencing as he tries to reunite with his mother.  It is an important story because it shows that there are human beings at the heart of all of this.  Those stories have driven us to keep going, even in the face of Government opposition.  There has been significant political support in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il for the Bill.</p><p>The scale of the human catastrophe that is unfolding around the world is unprecedented.  The UN Refugee Agency identified that, by the end of 2017, more than 68.5 million people were forced to flee, 25.4 million of whom crossed borders in the search of safety.  The scale of the response in Ireland and elsewhere has to be commensurate with this.  The Government states that it is doing a lot, and this is true, but it has to match the scale of the catastrophe.  There are 5.6 million people seeking safety in Turkey.  In South Sudan, there are 2 million internally displaced people, while hundreds of pregnant women, unaccompanied children and survivors of torture are being abandoned in refugee camps on the Greek islands.  It is unimaginable.  Some 2,275 people died or went missing in the Mediterranean Sea, an average of six deaths a day.  Approximately 84% of displaced people live in low-income countries, where some of the poorest communities in the world are providing refuge.  I was in Beirut when my son lived there.  A total of 1 million people have travelled from Syria to Lebanon, which is the size of Munster.  We need to measure our response against what some very poor countries are doing.</p><p>A common thread that unites the experiences of all refugees is family separation.  In the desperate search for safety, families can become separated and scattered, forced to follow different routes as they flee.  When a person reaches safety, finding and reuniting with their loved ones is often their number one priority.  Each one of us who has a family will understand that.  The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has identified family reunification for refugees as a &quot;pressing human rights issue&quot;.  Members will be able to imagine the anxiety of refugees.  How can one possibly settle, knowing that loved ones are in danger or under threat?  The lack of family reunification has an impact on people's ability to get on with their lives.</p><p>My current studies in family therapy reaffirm what I expect we all know to be true, that is, the centrality of family in people's well-being and ability to live well in the world.  Family reunification, which is what this Bill is all about, will put that on a firmer footing in order that people can have their families by their side.  This is a modest proposal.  When it was debated in the D&aacute;il, it was criticised by Deputy Clare Daly, who moved it, for being too modest and she was right in many ways.  I would have liked the Bill to go further.  It puts the right to apply to reunite with dependent family members on a statutory basis.  It proposes to revert to the definition of &quot;family&quot; that existed under the Refugee Act 1996, and it gives applicants a more realistic timeframe to apply for family reunification.  The legislation also provides for it to come into force three months following the date of legislative approval.</p><p>There is substantial political support for the Bill and it enjoyed substantial majorities in the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  The small changes represented by the Bill are necessary because of restrictions introduced in the International Protection Act 2015, which mean that refugees, or persons with subsidiary protection, currently have a statutory right to apply to reunite with a very restricted category of family members.  The 12-month time limit is also posing major difficulties and Nasc and the Irish Refugee Council will be able to elaborate upon that.</p><p>When we think of our children, who here believes that they are fully independent of us at 18?  I have a 28 year old daughter and we are about to put her on our insurance.  My son is studying and we are still helping him out.  I am sure that we all know of parents who rely financially on their adult children.  Do we know of elder brothers and sisters who, through circumstances and chance, are the carers of their younger siblings?  Relationships of dependency do not fit into the neat confines of the 2015 Act.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, supports our view and, in its comprehensive analysis, it describes the removal of the right to apply for family reunification for extended family members and the introduction of a statutory time limit as a &quot;retrogressive measures&quot;.  Our Bill is in line with the recommendations of IHREC's report of last year.</p><p>I have heard the Minister's arguments that our Bill would deny discretion but we do not believe this.  Our Bill sits well alongside discretionary programmes, such as IHAP, and it does not in any way preclude them.  Reliance on discretion alone creates uncertainty for refugees and for their family members and that is why we make the proposals that are in the Bill.  This is not an either-or situation.  There can be rights and discretionary programmes but they are not counter to each other.  I would welcome a broadening of IHAP but it has critical limitations.  It is a temporary scheme and is only applicable to people coming from ten countries.</p><p>A major concern, which was introduced into the debate on later Stages by the Minister, was that moves on migration were problematic <i>per se</i>.  I want to challenge arguments that migration and diversity are problematic <i>per se</i>, and that they are divisive.  Specifically, I challenge the suggestion made by the Minister in the debates on the Bill that the arrival of more refugees to Ireland could provoke a political and social backlash similar to what we have witnessed in some European countries.  My own lived experience challenges that.  I was an emigrant in London for 17 years and I was a net contributor.  I signed on at the beginning but I paid far more taxes in the long run.  My children went to a state primary school in not-very-affluent Tottenham.  Some 31 languages were spoken at the school that my children attended.  The children, including my own, had parents from, and with roots in, all parts of the world.</p><p>We were people escaping danger, poverty or mass unemployment in my case.  As we discovered, Ms Finn and I lived in a similar part of London.  </p><p> I recall with real fondness my children's friends and schoolmates, all learning and playing together.  Crowland primary school was the London borough of Haringey at its best.  Our home and school were in a constituency which, although poor, voted overwhelmingly to 'remain' in the Brexit referendum.  The notion, therefore, that diversity and migration automatically cause people to pull up the drawbridge is not the case in that situation.  Government action in doing all that is possible to respond to refugees and their families in a generous and welcoming way, as the International Protection (Family Reunification)(Amendment) Bill 2017 proposes, is the strong and the moral thing to do.  </p><p> It can also be the popular thing to do.  Some 70% of those surveyed in research by the Social Change Initiative agreed with the statement "If I were from another country and fleeing terrible circumstances I would want Ireland to offer me protection" and only 7% disagreed.  We need to challenge and not follow the dog whistle often used in conversations about refugees and migration.  I was very surprised and disappointed by the Government's decision to deny a money message for this legislation, particularly as it came so early into the legislative process, in October 2017 as I recall.  I hope the Government has now given this Bill due consideration and has listened to the debate.  The Bill does not appropriate public funds, does not compel the Government to make expenditure and does not set up a new Government agency or create a new body. </p><p> I have heard this Bill described as "open-ended" and that it will "open the floodgates" but that is a fundamental misunderstanding of the legislation.  This Bill does not give people an automatic entitlement to bring dependent family members to Ireland.  As was also pointed out to me, Standing Order 179(1) states a Bill cannot be initiated and taken to Second Stage if it appropriates revenue in the most meaningful sense of the words "significant charges".  Standing Order 179(2) then states a Bill cannot go forward to Committee Stage if it includes incidental expenses beyond this.  By letting this Bill take Second Stage the Bills Office, therefore, has already accepted the Bill does not involve the appropriation of revenue as dealt with in Standing Order 179(1) and the only cost issues here have to be incidental, such as administration.  That tallies with the argument that an increased administrative burden for the Department of Justice and Equality is the real issue here. </p><p> The Bill changes existing regulations.  It gives refugees and people with subsidiary protection a statutory right to apply to reunite with dependent family members.  Applicants must still comply with the rigorous requirements of the application.  The Department of Justice and Equality will still have control of accepting or rejecting applications.  This is a managed system.  My colleagues from the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, will be able to speak further on this.  Any costs related to this Bill would clearly be incidental.  Should this Bill require a money message, it is difficult to think of legislation that would not.</p><p> The International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill 2017 is timely, humane and modest legislation which falls well within the resources the Government has available to it.  I am thankful to Members of both Houses for their continued and overwhelming support for this legislation.  I am hopeful we can resolve the money message issue as soon as possible and enact the urgent change so desperately needed for refugee families.  I thank the committee for hearing me.  </p></speech>

The members of the committee have our written statement so I will not repeat it completely.  I am going to talk about two issues in particular.  First, I will give a reminder of what the Bill does and does not do.  I will then speak on the money message and cost issue.  On what the Bill does, as Senator Kelleher stated, we are submitting that this is a modest law which does three things.  It broadens the definition of family from child and spouse to include child, spouse and dependent relatives.  It takes us back to a definition that existed in Irish law for over a decade.<br/><br/>The Bill creates an internal review mechanism.  It does not create a new body, instead it creates an internal review mechanism reporting to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  It also removes the 12-month time limit.  In our experience, that limit is important because refugees struggle to prepare a family reunification application within 12 months of the granting of refugee status.  Refugees have to prepare themselves to transition out of direct provision and they may have difficulty in identifying and finding their family member in the country from which they have fled.<br/><br/>With the greatest of respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, we submit that he, arguably, overstated the power of the law when he spoke in the D&aacute;il.  It does not create the right of family reunification.  It creates the right to apply for family reunification.  That application could be refused or it could be accepted.  The application will turn on whether the evidence submitted establishes whether there was dependency between the refugee in Ireland and the family member outside of Ireland.  <br/><br/>The Bill does not remove existing provisions that allow the Minister to refuse an application.  The Minister can still refuse an application on the grounds of national security, public policy, whether the applicant has been excluded from the protection of the refugee convention or if the applicant put forward information during their application that was found to be untruthful.  Ms Finn may speak on this in more detail, but in our experience establishing dependency under the old Act was not at all easy.  It required a lawyer, usually a good lawyer, to assist the applicant in preparing evidence that would show there was emotional and financial dependency and that dependency had been existing prior to the granting of refugee status and after it.  <br/><br/>It must also be remembered that these issues have been considered by our courts and, indeed, by the Supreme Court in the decision of AMS <i>v</i>Minister for Justice and Equality, as referenced in our submission.  In that case, the court again found that there is a balancing act the Minister has the right to apply in all such cases.  He has to balance the rights of the individual against the power of the State to regulate immigration.  A court, including the Supreme Court, will be slow to intervene in that process unless it can be established that the weighing up process was unreasonable.  What I am trying to say in all of this is to emphasis this is a modest proposal and the Minister will still has considerable power to control this process.  That is perhaps contrary to the perception that developed in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister has also said people could apply to the administrative scheme.  In our experience, and in our submission, and I think Ms Finn will also mention this again in more detail, that is a very arduous and difficult process for an individual to apply through.  <br/><br/>Turning to the issue of the money message, in forming our perception of what the relevant Standing Orders state and in developing our analysis we have considered the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's note on Private Members' Bills.  That has been quite helpful.  As Senator Kelleher said, as we read it Standing Order 179 refers to it not being possible for a Bill be initiated and taken onto Second Stage if it appropriates revenue.  We argue this Bill does not appropriate revenue.</p><p>It does not create a tax or charge.  As Senator Kelleher suggested, that it has already moved to this point in the legislative process possibly suggests the Ceann Comhairle agreed with that analysis.  We are now at the point where we have to consider whether there is an incidental expense.  I note that the Standing Order does not define "incidental".  We have asked the committee to be mindful that the Bill, on a literal reading, does not create any public expenditure or a tax and does not necessarily even create incidental expenditure.  If it were to be enacted tomorrow, it would merely give the opportunity to an individual to apply for family reunification.  It would not require the State to create a body to consider applications because there is already a body that does this, namely, the Department of Justice and Equality.  We also have to be mindful in our submission that "incidental" must mean something more than simply the printing of paper, for example.  It is not defined, but for the Oireachtas to use the word "incidental", it must mean something more than the consideration of applications which, as I said, are already processed by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p><p> Even if we continue to have concerns about this issue and within this area the money message, we ask the committee to be mindful of the fact that there is no legal aid in seeking family reunification.  In other words, the burden is completely on the applicant to prepare the case.  The measure only creates a right to apply.  We are not aware of the Department seeing any reduction in staff, necessarily.  There is an existing Department, or part of the Department of Justice and Equality, that considers applications.  The review body carries out an internal review of the papers involving the Minister.  If we believe there are costs, it could arguably reduce them on the grounds that it would possibly reduce expensive and long judicial reviews involving the High Court.</p><p> We ask the committee to be mindful of the fact that family reunification, in our experience, is beneficial, possibly to everybody.  The Minister has made reference to the family reunification directive, an EU instrument to which we have not signed up.  In the instrument, in recital 4, it is stated family reunification is a necessary way of making family life possible and helps to create socio-cultural stability and promote economic development.  As Senator Kelleher stated, in our experience, people who come here are often net contributors in the end.</p><p> There is not an appropriation.  The measure does not create a tax or charge.  With regard to incidental expenditure, the amount falls below the threshold the Oireachtas envisages in that regard.  I ask members to consider the fact that it does not create an immediate right; rather, it gives a person the opportunity to apply for family reunification.</p><p> Those are my views on what the Bill does and does not do.  I have also outlined the associated money message issues.  We will be happy to take questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.848" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Finn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#G00300"><p>I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to make a presentation to it.</p> <p>  Nasc has over two decades of experience in supporting refugees and beneficiaries of international protection in applying for family reunification.  In 2017 we provided for 347 consultations on family reunification for refugees.  A total of 43 of our clients who were beneficiaries of international protection were successful in their applications to bring family members to Ireland.  Our contribution today is directly informed by the issues that present at our legal clinics and in our direct work with refugees who are seeking to be reunited with family members.</p> <p>  Since the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 at the end of 2016, Nasc has seen at first hand the impact the restrictions on family reunification has had on refugees. In particular, both the time limits and the removal of dependent family members have caused fierce hardship for the refugee families with whom we work.  The affected individuals are not able to fully settle into their lives here knowing that their family members remain in conflict zones or at risk of persecution.  We have seen families split up because only some family members are eligible.  We have seen individuals descend into deep depression because they are forced to leave family members at home in the midst of horrific conditions.  We adamantly believe modest but critical amendments to the International Protection Act 2015 would go some significant way towards improving the lives of refugees living in Ireland and help to fulfil our obligations to support people who are seeking safety in Europe.</p> <p>  I recognise and commend the Minister of State at the Department of Justice Equality, Deputy Stanton, for his commitment and dedication to providing solutions for refugees through the Irish refugee protection programme and initiatives such as Irish humanitarian visa programme and refugee community sponsorship.  I commend him for his statement in the D&aacute;il on 6 December in which he confirmed the Government&rsquo;s commitment to proactively assisting family reunification.  It seems, therefore, that we have achieved broad consensus and that our views may not be as divergent as they first appear. </p> <p>  During the debates in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il the Minister of State raised a number of concerns which I would like to address.  Concerns were raised that the current proposals would legally oblige the State to reserve resources for unquantifiable numbers of potential applicants.  It must be noted that the Bill only provides the right for refugees to apply for some extended family members.  This right, as is the case with all rights, is not absolute and not open-ended.  It is highly conditional.  It is further limited by the fact that sponsors are required to prove that the subjects of the application are dependent on them or that they are suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for them to maintain themselves fully.  All applicants must provide evidence and documentation of a very high level to support any application.  </p> <p>  In any one year between 2014 and 2016, inclusive, under the family reunification provisions contained in the 1996 Refugee Act which allows an application to be made in respect of extended family members, only between 200 and 400 family members were granted family reunification.  There were 229 in 2014, 328 in 2015 and 406 in 2016, with an average of 2.8 family members per sponsor.  They are not overwhelming or unmanageable numbers and provide us with a very solid basis to quantify the numbers of potential future applicants.  </p> <p>  In our experience, refugee families prioritise their more vulnerable family members who, for the most part, are their older unmarried children or their parents.  They also tend to wait until they have secured housing and employment prior to submitting an application in respect of extended family members because they want to be ready for them when they come.  This further illustrates the need for the removal of the 12-month time limit.</p><p>Since the new Act has been in place, only 272 persons have been approved for family reunification.  This is a very low number and one that should cause us some shame given the scale of the current global refugee crisis.  We can and must do more to provide durable solutions for these families and this modest proposal in the Bill will help to undo the harm and suffering that has been caused to refugees.  We must also be mindful and guided by Article 41.1.1&deg; of the Constitution, which &quot;recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&quot; and guarantees its protection by the State.  This Bill is giving clear effect to both the spirit and text of this constitutional provision.<br/><br/>During the debates, it was argued that this provision would substantially curtail the State&rsquo;s ability to respond to ongoing and future crises.  There is nothing in this modest provision that in any way curtails the State's ability to respond to ongoing and future crises.  This is evidenced by the fact that during the lifetime of the old Refugee Act, which contained the broader definition of family, the Government introduced the first humanitarian admission programme for Syrian refugees and nationals living in Ireland.  We would also submit that by broadening the definition of family, it would see a reduction in the need for and additional cost of operating once-off <i>ad hoc</i>limited schemes such as the current Irish humanitarian admissions programme.  The introduction of broad, clear and rights-based family reunification laws brings with its certainty for both the State and refugees.  The fact that the Government introduced the humanitarian admissions programme, laudable as that was, which afforded a limited number of refugees and Irish nationals the ability to apply for extended family members, could be viewed as a clear admission by the Government that our current family reunification law and policy are inadequate and in need of reform.<br/><br/>During the debates, claims were also made that the Minister for Justice and Equality proactively applies discretionary permission under the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, non-EEA policy document on family reunification.  Unfortunately, that has not been Nasc's experience of supporting families to apply for visas for their loved ones.  In the Department of Justice and Equality's policy document on family reunification for non-EEA nationals, it is stated that the &quot;default position&quot; for applications for visas for elderly parents is &quot;a refusal&quot;.  It is difficult to see how a policy with such a harsh default position could be construed as a viable alternative for refugees seeking to be reunited with family members.  It also requires persons who wish to apply for a visa for elderly parents to have income - after taxes and deductions - for three successive years in excess of &euro;60,000 to apply for one parent and &euro;75,000 to apply for two parents.  Realistically, this allows for only the wealthiest in our society to even make an application.  Even then with substantial earnings, applications may still be refused.  It is simply unrealistic to expect that a person newly granted international protection status will be in a position to earn anywhere near these income thresholds.<br/><br/>The Minister also noted that the current limited provisions are in line with the EU family reunification directive.  First, when considering the directive, it is critical to note that, as Mr. Henderson noted, we have not opted into it but, additionally, this is a unified document that provides a legal basis for both refugee and non-refugee family reunification and sets down minimum standards for member states to implement.  On its face and when viewed in isolation, the current definition of family falls within the minimum standard set out in the directive.  However, we should look at the directive as whole and in particular, the preamble which sets out the clear purpose and objective of the directive.  It provides that:</p><blockquote>	Special attention should be paid to the situation of refugees on account of the reasons which obliged them to flee their country and prevent them from leading a normal family life there.  More favourable conditions should therefore be laid down for the exercise of their right to family reunification. </blockquote><p>Also, the directive provides more favourable family reunification rights for unaccompanied minors, granting them the right to reunite with their legal guardian.  It provides member states with clear guidelines on extended family members stating positively which family members member states may include.  Additionally, it sets down clear time limits for the processing of applications and grants family members an autonomous residency permission and provides in law for the right of family reunification for non-refugees, all of which are absent in our current family reunification laws.  It is, therefore somewhat disingenuous to state that Ireland is in compliance with the directive when we have cherry-picked certain limited provisions to justify a removal of the rights for refugees to apply to reunite with extended family members.<br/><br/>Concerns were also expressed that we cannot go beyond EU norms.  However, a 2016 report on family reunification in the EU compiled by the European Migration Network on behalf of the European Commission highlighted the fact the average percentage of permits issued by member states for family members was 30%.  Ireland came in second last at 7% just ahead of Poland, so it would seem that we have some way to go before we are in line with current EU norms, let alone exceeding them.<br/><br/>It is overwhelmingly clear in Nasc's experience that refugee families rarely fit into nuclear family arrangements, and the precariousness of life in the midst of conflict means that our understanding of what constitutes family cannot be overly rigid or prescribed.  In our work, we have come across any number of refugees who are now forced to make &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; type decisions when applying for family reunification.  One woman had to decide whether to apply for her husband because he was the sole carer of her elderly and unwell mother who would not be eligible.  One man applied for his minor daughter but was not eligible to apply for that daughter&rsquo;s child, his grandchild, who was born as a result of rape.  An aged out minor, so-called, who has waited years for his application for refugee status to be processed in Ireland is now not eligible to be reunited with his parents and siblings.  These are the real unintended consequences of our current laws.  What becomes clear from working day in and day out with beneficiaries of international protection is that there are no norms as to how human lives operate in the context of persecution, war and displacement.<br/><br/>As part of our membership bid for the UN Security Council 2021 to 2029, Ireland placed empathy as one of our core pillars.  The campaign brochure recalls &quot;the great compassion and open doors shown around the world to Irish emigrants fleeing famine as they sought refuge&quot;.  It then goes on to state that &quot;we reflect on that as we work to assist today's refugees&quot;.  We would ask members here today to reflect upon this and upon the impact the erosion of family rights has had upon refugees and how this modest proposal will go some way to ameliorating the harshness of our current law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#H00300"><p>I will read into the record a statement by Izzeddeen Alkarajeh, a Palestinian refugee living in Ireland.  Izzedeen's situation is representative of those who lost their rights to family reunification when the International Protection Act was commenced and is typical of the situation facing refugees accessing our services.</p> <blockquote> 	Dear Members of the Justice Committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my problem.  Sorry I am unable to make it here today but I have work commitments and I am happy for Fiona Hurley to read my statement.  I'm a Palestinian refugee, living in Cork with my wife and our 4 children.  I'd like to thank Ireland for the protection and safety that my family is enjoying.  And I would like to thank the department of justice for taking only 11 months to decide that we qualify for protection, after we spent 15 years waiting Israeli justice system to recognize our family status, with no answer.<br /><br />When we lodged our protection application in September of 2016, our interview was scheduled to be on the 1st of December 2016.  Unfortunately, all interviews were cancelled by then, to facilitate the new law and procedures enforcement, and I lost a great opportunity to be reunified with my mother that was possible in the old system.  In August of 2017, I had my interview according to the new law after ORAC has become IPO.<br /><br />In order to keep my statement short, please allow me to identify the issues that I see in the current regulations:  	-Although Palestine has the oldest continuous conflict, with one of the largest refugee crisis, it's not among the 10 countries benefiting from the IHAP.<br /><br />-Before obtaining protection in Ireland, I was living in Saudi Arabia, and I was able to visit my mother in Palestine from time to time.  Unfortunately, after being protected in Ireland, I'm no longer allowed to visit her until I obtain full Irish citizenship.<br /><br />-The only option remaining to bring my mother here is by sponsoring her.  The financial requirements needed for me to qualify to sponsor my mother is so high and unrealistic, because even if I earn half of the current required amount of &euro;70,000, I would still be able to sponsor her living.  The current system sets a fixed figure, regardless of the number of family members to be sponsored, and regardless of the family members potential health care cost.  In my case, it's only my mother, and she is not so old that she may cost me so high to take care of.  In addition to that, I must prove the above income for three years, which adds unfair complexity of the regulation.<br /><br />-Even if I become desperate of bringing my mother to live, and decide to invite her for a visit, the current system makes it so hard if it&rsquo;s seen that we attempted to apply for family reunification. I have great confidence that justice in Ireland has a room to fit Palestinian vulnerable people, and I have a great hope that new laws or amendments would make it easier for me to be with my mother again. </blockquote> <p>The letter is signed, &quot;Sincerely, Izzeddeen Alkarajeh&quot;.</p></speech>

We are unlikely to fight with them given that we are on the same side.  We will save the fight for the Government.  I have to leave shortly for agriculture questions and ask that when I leave it is not taken as disrespect.  We are very interested as a committee in this issue and have been very involved with it.  Deputy Clare Daly and I have been to the camps in France and visited Syria twice.  We have also been to Iraq and Lebanon.  I do not want to bore the witnesses.  While I will make a couple of points, we came here to listen to them.  It is very good to hear what they have had to say.  It will be taken on board and used to the best of our ability to make things fairer.</p> <p>  Mr. Henderson spoke a great deal about money messages and went through the technical nature of that process.  The truth of the matter is that they can do whatever they like.  They can twist that money message around and make almost any decision.  They can decide to apply the money message rule just about every time if they so feel.  As Senator Black can explain, they even used the rule in the very first minute of their submission against her recent Bill in the D&aacute;il, which is a complete nonsense.  Our challenge is not to decipher and break down the money message, it is to break down their attitude and change their mind about how they see things.  While some good things have happened, for which we are very grateful, and while the Department of Justice and Equality has made some good decisions, it is important to remember that it has been dragged kicking and screaming to this point.  People will have seen that if they had been watching events here over the last few years.</p> <p>  The 4,000 figure is small but it has not even been reached.  The obstacles to family reunification are unreasonable and do not stack up.  I know a lot of the refugees for different reasons.  I know one man from Afghanistan very well who is seeking family reunification but is probably not going to qualify.  He saw his father, who was working for the Taliban, shot in front of him by the Americans.  A couple of weeks later, the Taliban came for him.  At 14, he was kidnapped and taken to their camp for training.  He escaped and actually made his way to Ireland without money and landed in Dublin despite not even knowing that Ireland existed.  It is just the way the lorries went.  His mother is alive and he has two brothers aged 15 and 13 years for whom the Taliban are searching.  They are in hiding.  The notion that we should not help them is hard to defend.  We know another kid from Afghanistan whose father was working for the Americans and who was shot by the Taliban in front of his son also.  He left a mother and two sisters behind him and has had no contact with them since.  It has now been a couple of years.  Obviously, he would like family reunification, but it is not even possible for him to contact them.  They have not been able to contact him either.  Both these kids are 18.</p> <p>  We agree that a different attitude is required.  Some points might have an impact on the Government.  Considering that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights holds that the right to family life in Article 8 extends beyond the nuclear family to include grandparents, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews and adult siblings, there is an argument to extend the definition of "eligible family member".  Perhaps, it could be done along the lines of the IHAP eligibility requirements for those over 18 who cannot necessarily prove dependency.  These are arguments we can make.  The witnesses have made them, which is good.  The International Protection Act 2015 was a serious rowing back on the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, which allowed at the discretion of the Minister for any dependant to be eligible.  That included any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who was depending on the refugee or suffering from a mental or physical illness or disability to such an extent that it was not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully.</p> <p>  There are many good reasons for us to take a different position and for the Government to be more accommodating of Senator Kelleher's Bill.  Mr. Henderson and Ms Hurley made the point about the number of net contributors who come here, which is obvious.  All of the kids I have met and some of the parents will, God help us and save us, contribute a great deal to this country.  It is a no-brainer.  Before my building company went bang, I was employing 85 eastern Europeans.  There was a great deal of racism in the city at the time, but they were amazing.  They had a very good attitude and the notion that they would not be welcome here is obvious nonsense.  I am speaking to the converted saying that to the witnesses.  It is a bit like the priest giving out about people not coming to mass to the ones who are there.  We will work hard on our end to make the Bill happen.  When Deputy Clare Daly was critical that Senator Kelleher's Bill did not go far enough, it was not a criticism of the Senator.  We know that if one asks for too much, sometimes one gets nothing.  We know we have to be very measured in what we seek.  A great deal more should be sought, but we will take things one step at a time.  I say "Well done" to Senator Kelleher.</p></speech>

Those presentations were amazing; they were absolutely fantastic.  I know how hard Senator Kelleher and Mr. Meany have worked on this.  They put their heart and soul into this and I thank them for that.  They have made the case for this Bill very clearly.  Even though we know what is going on, when one hears the reality of the situation from listening to the presentations it is still quite shocking.  There is a humanitarian crisis going on.  I think of the trauma people are going through and the importance of family.  That is an area with which I am very familiar from my other work.  I am also a member of a family, and I know how important my family and my adult children are.  My mother has passed away, but my sisters and brothers are so close.  Family is the heart of everything.  It is so important.</p> <p>  I could go on but I will try to keep my remarks short.  I have two specific questions to ask.  Senator Kelleher noted the importance of retaining discretion in the Bill.  I understand that the Government's opposition to the Bill is partly based on the idea that it would introduce an open-ended structure for family unification.  Could Senator Kelleher expand on why discretion has been retained in the Bill and how this meets the Minister's concerns?</p> <p>  I must highlight the money message.  It was lovely to listen to Deputy Wallace talking about his experiences of meeting people who really touched his heart.  Mr. Henderson was very clear on the issue of the money message and I thank him for that.  It illustrates a very worrying anti-democratic precedent which could be set today.  As Mr. Henderson stated, the Bill would not appropriate public funds.  It does not compel Government expenditure.  It does not set up a new Government agency or create a new body.  It also does not give an automatic right to reunification.  It simply enables more people to apply.  That is all this Bill does.  It is not rocket science; it is very modest.  Essentially, it would mean that Department officials might have more applications to process.  Am I right in saying that?  The idea that this extra administrative burden is enough to require a money message is absolutely ridiculous; it is crazy.  The standing orders have always been read with a sense of elastic public service so that a new responsibility does not necessarily mean that the budget must rise or fall.  With this new reading of the rules, whereby an administrative cost alone is enough to require a money message, the Bills Office is handing the Government an effective veto in respect of any Bill.</p> <p>  My concern is that the need for a money message is constantly used to block legislation.  It is very frustrating.  From the Opposition's point of view, why even bring forward legislation if it is going to be constantly blocked?  I am obviously very passionate about this because my own Bill just went through the D&aacute;il a couple of weeks ago.  I would like as many of the witnesses as possible to expand on this as much as possible.  I am sure they are very frustrated.  I am sure a lot of people in the Houses of the Oireachtas are very frustrated by the requirement for a money message.  We have to highlight and talk about this more.  As far as I am concerned, it is highly undemocratic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.856" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#K00200"><p>I thank Senator Black.  I will address the issue of discretion.  The Bill proposes a right to apply the extended definition of a family member as per the Refugee Act 1996.  In that sense, there is a little less discretion for the Minister but it does not preclude the Department or the Minister from introducing all manner of additional schemes in response to unfolding crises.  For example, I am of the view that there is a strong case for us to act in response to events in Yemen, which is not one of the ten countries because of the scale of the catastrophe.  I would welcome the Department doing that.  The Bill as we propose it does not preclude the Department from doing any of that.  It was suggested in the debates that it might.  I challenge that.  Discretion and rights are not either-or propositions.  They are "both-and" propositions.  The line of argument put forward in the Seanad and D&aacute;il debates concerning the Department's ability to act does not hold up.</p> <p>  In the context of the money message, as has been said the Bill does not appropriate public funds, compel the Government to provide for expenditure, set up a new Government agency or create a new body.  I am really concerned about the constant use of phrases such as "open-ended" and "opening the floodgates".  This is really worrying language.  This is the language that is always used in respect of migration and I am really concerned about it.  It is incumbent upon us as Members of the Oireachtas to challenge that kind of argumentation and language.  It is a fundamental misunderstanding of the legislation.  As we have all stated, the Bill does not give people an automatic entitlement to bring their dependent family members.  It simply gives them a right to apply.  Any cost related to this Bill would clearly  be incidental.  If this Bill requires a money message it is difficult to think of legislation that would not, as we have all said.  I note what the Senator says about a sense of elastic public service.  Perhaps some of my colleagues wish to respond and expand on that and other matters.</p></speech>

We can really forensically look at the cost and whether an additional cost arises.  Some 908 applications were received for the first round of IHAP alone.  Such numbers have never been received for a family reunification process in a normal year, even under the 1996 Act.  I cannot see where the additional cost would come from.  There are enough resources to deal with 908 applications, which is an extraordinarily high number.  The number we are looking at in the context of family reunification is between 300 and 400, which is significantly less.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.859" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#K00500"><p>I will repeat and clarify what I stated earlier.  The Bill creates a right.  It is likely that there will be applications, the number of which we can project.  However, the number of applications will depend on the number of refugees recognised by the State.  We can project that as well.  As Ms Finn just indicated, there is an existing infrastructure within the Department of Justice and Equality that considers these applications.  It is considering applications made under the two IHAP schemes, the first in June and the second closing on Friday.  The burden is on the applicant.  There is no legal aid for the applicant.  The State incurs no expense.  There is a clear test to be met, which is laid out specifically in the Bill, namely, "dependent on the qualified person or is suffering from a mental or physical disability".  The burden is on the applicant to show that they are dependent on the person or that there is "a mental or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully".  That test would have to be met.</p> <p>  To conclude, I will refer to the long-term benefits of family reunification to the individual.  This would require a hearing on its own.</p><p>It is often said that the final part of a refugee's integration into a country and protection against the persecution that he or she fears is family reunification.  It is that piece that allows the person to finally and properly settle for a period in the country that is giving him or her protection.</p><p> I understand the points made by Deputy Wallace and Senator Kelleher about the wider use of the money message in the D&aacute;il.  Even with that in mind, when we consider the standing order and the guidance stated in the note provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, we maintain that it is not appropriate for a money message to be given as there are no grounds for doing so and no tax is created.  In addition, we argue that the incidental cost is questionable, particularly if one takes a literal reading of the Bill.  </p></speech>

In some ways, the purpose behind the money message gets lost in these discussions.  Its purpose is to prevent legislators from introducing a financial Bill that would have major financial implications for the State.  That is a power which is supposed to rest with the Executive.  In this instance, the concept of incidental has been used to cover any policy change that would happen.  It is hard to see how any policy change introduced by an amendment would not result in some cost, even it is just printing the legislation, retraining staff in the Department or whatever else.  We argue that the money message has been bent out of shape and misapplied to block legislators from being able to bring amendments such as this one.  This particular case is a good example of how the money message has been used too broadly because we can only see a minor incidental expense in the form of more applications crossing the desk of a departmental official.  It is important to consider the provision in that sense because, if that is the case, a money message may not even be required and, therefore, the Government does not have a say in whether a money message is given.</p></speech>

We very much, as a committee, have echoed all of that.</p></speech>

In terms of dependence, before this meeting I perused our family reunification files for the number of applications submitted and the number of successful applications.  Historically, we provided a staggering amount of evidence, which often encompassed hundreds of money transfer receipts dating back years.  Every week, people in direct provision centres saved up the weekly allowance of &euro;19.10, as it was at the time, to send to family members.  The level of evidence in many medical reports was staggeringly high.  Our files show that the majority of applications are for members of the applicant's nuclear family.  Often, one person lived in the family unit who was not a nuclear family member, for example, a brother or sister aged under 18 years of age or a parent.  The new legislation means that such persons are left behind, which means one loses the person who is often responsible for bringing up the children left behind.  That issue needs to be considered because it breaks up rather than reunites families. </p></speech>

Is the money message for this legislation related to incidental costs?  For example, could the requirement to print a few pages be used to refuse a money message and block the Bill?  Does it go down to that detail?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#L00600"><p>It is our understanding that the fact that the Bill has come this far means it has been taken for granted that it is not an appropriation of revenue or public expenditure in that sense.  That leaves a question mark over whether there is an incidental expense, as Standing Order 179 also refers to &ldquo;including incidental expenses&rdquo;.  Incidentally, this wording is not used in Article 17.2.  Standing Order 179 does not explain what &ldquo;incidental expenses&rdquo; could mean.  Taking one view, it could mean anything, for example, recruiting an extra member of staff or setting up a large agency to oversee a new point of law.  Nothing in this Bill suggests this should be done.  We anticipate a minor and modest increase in the number of applications.  In light of the point made about the elasticity of the public service, such matters would normally be subsumed into the work of a Department in any case.  The Department of Justice and Equality will not be allocated an additional amount of money to cover this work.  Were that to happen, it would occur in a future budget, which would be the preserve of the Government.  In that sense, any possible incidental expense would be minor.  We could not quantify it because we are not the State but we imagine it would be minor.</p></speech>

First, I am advised that a determination was made yesterday that a money message would be required and that an application had been sent by the Ceann Comhairle seeking a money message to issue.  Second, Senator Conway received a notification that he was required in the Seanad and asked that I record his apologies for leaving and note his support for the passage of the Bill.  We welcome that from a Government Senator.</p></speech>

Comprehensive presentations were given by Senators Kelleher and Black and the witnesses, whose expertise is welcome.  I support this legislation.  Deputy Clare Daly might have wanted it to go further, but any mechanism to narrow discretion and provide impetus and hope for people is important.</p> <p>  Money messages are being used to prevent many Bills from proceeding.  Someone needs to take a stand, possibly by seeking legal advice and challenging the decision-making process in the Bills Office and the interpretation of Article 17.  The interpretation of incidental administrative costs is ridiculous and extends beyond Standing Orders and the Constitution.  It is outrageous.</p> <p>  Last week, I agreed with the Chairman's decision to allow an amendment to be introduced that was agreeable, would not have incurred significant levels of expense and was important for the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.  If external legal advice was sought and formalised to take a challenge, we could have this issue addressed.  In the past, Governments could block legislation by using their majority, whereas the current minority Government is using Standing Orders to block legislation.</p> <p>  I have concerns about the changes to the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  I am not speaking specifically to the Bill, but this issue relates to its progression.  We have created another layer of pre-legislative scrutiny and address.  Despite members agreeing with the Bill, its sponsors will face the roadblock that many other Bills have faced.  Under the new mechanism, Bills collapse if the Government does not agree to a money message within a short period.  As such, this Bill will vanish from the legislative programme despite advancing to this stage.</p><p>The new business changes that the Business Committee agreed will mean this Bill will be removed from the Order Paper, which would it be reintroduced.  Is that the position?</p></speech>

Perhaps it is time to challenge the legal basis for this.  There are issues with the memorandum of understanding and the interpretation agreed by the Government and Oireachtas via the Ceann Comhairle which need to be addressed.  I wish the Senators well with the Bill, which I support.  It is unfortunate that we are discussing a technical device that should not be used here.  It shows the nonsense of new politics.  The politics blocking this legislation are anything but new.  This is the use of old politics to circumvent legislation by using an old interpretation of a constitutional article which is outrageous and undermines Members' ability to have a Bill such as this passed.  It flies in the face of all the rubbish we have heard about new politics.  It shows new politics at their worst.</p></speech>

We received notification in respect of the money message in October 2017 after we moved the Bill in July 2017.  None of the arguments or cases we made was listened to.  That in itself is undemocratic.  Large majorities have been recorded in the Seanad and D&aacute;il in support of this Bill.  It is a modest proposal and it does not fit within the measures that cover money matters.</p> <p>  I will go back to the scale of the catastrophe.  We are discussing technicalities while people are in trouble in their lives.  When we do not do enough in this country, we impose burdens on others, for example, the Greek islands and parts of Italy.  We see horrific situations when we travel.  I saw a little boy of about seven years in a doorway in Paris two Sundays ago.  He was with another child, possibly his brother.  We could give out about France not doing enough but when we do not do enough, we are complicit because we are in dereliction of our duties as a country and we are failing to show solidarity as a member of the European Union by acting when people are in the most desperate of circumstances.</p> <p>  I am disappointed beyond belief and I will certainly consider the advice Deputy Jack Chambers has given us on taking a challenge to this ruling.  I am deeply disappointed, not just on my behalf given the work that has been put in to this Bill, but for the people who are being let down as a result of the use of this technicality.  None of the arguments has been listened to and we have not even been dignified by an appearance by the Minister.  The Government did not even wait until tomorrow to make the decision.  It is extremely disappointing, not just to me but to people such as Izzeddeen Alkarajeh and others all over Europe and the world to whom we have a moral responsibility to respond.</p></speech>

Last week, the select committee dealt with Committee Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016.  The Chairman of a committee is often given a direction to disallow certain amendments tabled by Opposition Members when, in the opinion of the Bills Office, the passage of those amendments could constitute an additional charge on the Exchequer.  Let us recall what the Bill we discussed last week was about, namely, miscellaneous provisions in the area of disability.  The first amendment on which I received a direction to refuse to allow debate was to include in the Bill a provision that all polling stations be wheelchair accessible.  I heard the words "democratic" and "anti-democratic" used, but the fundamental aspect of democracy is the right of all citizens to be able to exercise their franchise.  I was being directed to refuse an amendment on the basis that if any of the facilities currently employed did not have wheelchair access, it could mean having to find an alternative that would cost more or having to put in wheelchair ramps at schools, halls or other facilities.  My view, as Chairman, is that the utilisation of a school or any of these other facilities once in five years is not the basis for requiring it to be wheelchair accessible.  It just damn well should be - full stop and end of story.  I could be in a big bucket of hot water over all of this but that is the position that we took.  I thank the members of this committee who stood by me in making my judgment in the matter last week.  Deputy Jack Chambers has talked about interpretation.  I have shared that example to show how bizarre interpretation can be at times.</p></speech>

It is important to bear that in mind.  There are many questions and doors to be knocked upon.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.</p></speech>

I will touch briefly on the money message but also I have some questions on the specific content of the Bill.</p> <p>  On the money message, this has been very valuable because one could reference this ongoing discussion on radio, on television or in these institutions.  I believe the public might ask what are they talking about as this is just a procedural matter and they should just get on with it.  This has been useful, however, in underlining in the first instance the real implications for people's lives when valuable legislation is blocked.  It also has underlined clearly, and we are not under any illusion, that this issue has not arisen previously because we have operated with majority Governments.  Since we are operating with a minority Government at present, it is no longer in the same position to prevent Bills it did not like from getting through as had been the case previously .  It has found another way through the non-provision of money messages.  It is unfortunate that the Bills Office has taken decisions in some circumstances that a money message must be provided when that was a debatable point.  Many of these decisions can be quite arbitrary.  Although I am unclear as to the basis for it, there seems to be a higher threshold for the provision of a money message to go to Committee Stage than for a Bill to be put forward at Second Stage.  There seems to be a threshold somewhere in between the two to put forward an amendment that may have some incidental cost.  There is a lack of transparency in this regard and I believe Deputy Jack Chambers is correct that an action potentially could be taken on the basis of Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  It has never arisen before because previously, a clear Government majority existed.  I agree with everything that has been said to the effect that it is anti-democratic of a minority Government foisting its will on the majority through a procedural trick and that lack of transparency is unfortunate.  That has been well ventilated but it is useful and if people want to respond, they can.  If they have additional points that they wish to offer on this, they can.  My questions go back to the substance of the Bill.</p> <p>  The first concerns a useful briefing document from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service on this legislation, in which a point identified referred to research conducted by G&ouml;tzelmann on the legislation as it was prior to the most recent change to the Refugee Act 1996.  The point that this was making was that one of the primary difficulties that existed at that stage was what was described as the nebulous definition of dependency.  This was a point, I cannot quite recall, that may have been raised at Second Stage as well.  My question is whether we will see the full benefit of this; and we may.  If there are difficulties where it may favour the applicant or the Government's current position, that is, if it is insufficiently clear as to what is a dependant or what qualifies as dependency, will that potentially hamstring the intent of this Bill?  Alternatively it may lead to a more expansive understanding of it, I am not entirely sure.</p></speech>

It also has brought with it quite a strong body of jurisprudence on the issue of dependency.  The courts have looked at it.  While there is an element of discretion inherent in it, the courts have set down fairly clear guidelines as to who would be considered dependants.  It is not just a financial issue, there is an element of emotional dependency and the nature and type of dependency, which must be continuous and ongoing.  As that section of the Act has been in operation for ten years, there is quite a clear understanding of what we mean by dependency.  There is a lot of settled law behind that and I do not think this would present itself as a particular issue or barrier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.897" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#N00500"><p>On a practical level, Deputy Wallace raised earlier the issue that there is no legal aid for family reunification applications.  Refugees themselves may not know what the definition of dependency is.  That may lead to someone applying without knowing what standard or threshold he or she must meet.  If someone has access to a practitioner or comes to an organisation like the Irish Refugee Council or to Nasc Ireland, he or she can get that advice.</p> <p>  One issues that arises widely with the Department of Justice and Equality is that it is reluctant to put in place detailed policy or information as to what it is actually looking for.  It is up to the applicant to bring information and at that stage a decision is made.  That could go hand in hand with the Department being more transparent about what it would consider dependency to be.  That would resolve a lot of the issues and help people to access family reunification in a better manner.</p></speech>

I suggest this is the next best thing to dependency actually being spelled out in the Bill, in that we have a body of jurisprudence that includes a Supreme Court decision and practice of more than a decade.</p></speech>

I have been following the disgraceful way in which people from the Windrush generation have been treated in the UK.  The desire of the current Prime Minister when she was Home Secretary was to create a harsh environment for immigrants who would seek to settle in a country.</p> <p>It is a case of how one does things.  One can create, through obfuscation or lack of clarity, a position whereby one may have the law but the access to that law can be made as difficult or as easy as possible.  There is also the issue of the spirit in which regulations and laws are put in place and interpreted.</p> <p>  I am very disappointed with the way the Department has responded to this Bill since it was introduced.  Its spirit has been defensive and it has not given a listening ear to the arguments made.  I think that also is the case on the ground for people who would apply.  That is another worrying trend that has been evidenced through the progress of this Bill.  While this possibly has been noted by this committee, it might also be reflected upon in any report issuing from today's proceedings.</p></speech>

Iraq had the highest number of applications for IHAP that were refused because they were from an ineligible country.  Many Iraqis applied under IHAP, gave their circumstances and argued why they should be considered but were refused.  Another example is the Central African Republic, CAR.  It is extremely rare to meet anyone from that country in Ireland.  The countries covered by IHAP were not picked with an eye to what was happening in Ireland or reflecting those who needed family reunification here.</p></speech>

It allows for extended family members and has an additional category whereby one can apply for a vulnerable family member.  There is no guidance on that.  On the one hand, the State is talking about uncontrollable floodgates while, on the other, it is delivering two schemes that, albeit welcome, are temporary and <i>ad hoc</i>.  That tends to be the problem with how policy is developed in the immigration and protection context - it is <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.  The Bill brings a level of certainty for the State and refugees who are seeking to be reunited with family members.<br/><br/>From our understanding, one of the key drivers behind introducing IHAP was the need to fulfil the 4,000 refugees quota that we had committed to under the EU resettlement and relocation programme.  It was one of the mechanisms used to do that.  It was not born out of a need to support the refugees then living in Ireland.</p></speech>

IHAP is a good programme, but I am not advocating it as a solution to all of our problems by any means.  Rather, I am pointing out that the policy behind it is inconsistent with the Department's arguments against this Bill.</p> <p>  I will ask my final two questions.  The Seanad amended the Bill to add a section 57A to the 2015 Act.  I may have the number wrong, but it relates to the review.  It has not been discussed much.  Senator Kelleher or someone else might expand on this.  Is there generally a need to review how reviews and appeals in the asylum and immigration field are handled?  Do we need an overhaul of the legislation and the offices governing it?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses of the view that persons applying for family reunification should be entitled to legal aid?</p></speech>

For example, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 provides for a review to determine whether the measures contained in a number of its sections are achieving their intended consequences.  In family reunification legislation, though, there are unintended consequences.  What drove us to introduce this Bill was the fact that, on the ground, live issues of access to family reunification were arising as a result.  In Izzeddeen Alkarajeh's case, he missed an appointment.  It was cancelled.  Had he had that appointment, he might have been able to succeed in bringing his mother to Ireland but because it was cancelled and did not then happen until after the International Protection Act's introduction, he could not.  That is how arbitrary the legislation is and explains why review mechanisms are important.</p> <p>  In light of the points that Ms Hurley and Mr. Henderson made, legal aid is important.  It can steer people in the right direction within the parameters of what is legally possible in order that they avoid submitting claims that will never succeed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.914" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019020600002#O01300"><p>I agree.  I would not describe what is laid out in the Bill as an appeal mechanism.  For something to be an appeal, we submit it would be an appeal to the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, which is a statutory body created by the International Protection Act.  That Act would probably have to be amended to allow for appeals against a refusal of a family reunification decision.  The Bill does not do that, though.  All it really does is create an internal review within the Department of Justice and Equality, one that goes up the tree to a grade senior to the grade of the person who made the decision.  An official would only have to be one step more senior than the person who made the decision to consider the review.  This is consistent with changes that were brought about by the statutory instrument that was created last July to transpose the reception conditions directive into Irish law.  That instrument creates an internal review mechanism for decisions around someone's reception conditions.  The Bill's provision is similar in nature.</p> <p>  Legal aid is beyond the scope of this Bill but from our experience - I am sure it is the same with our colleagues in Nasc Ireland - it is essential that people get good legal advice at all stages of the asylum procedure.  If they do not, they may not ventilate a point that should be made or bring forward evidence that they have.  It can work inversely, in that someone may be pursuing an application he or she should not be because there is a remedy elsewhere.  Legal aid helps people to rehearse and corral their evidence.  As such, I agree with the points made.</p></speech>

In general, outside of an appeal or review mechanism like this, the default is always judicial review, which can clog up the courts.  This is a problem in the immigration-asylum area because the only remedy available to people often ends up being judicial review, which is expensive and causes delays for everyone involved.  For the reasons outlined by Mr. Henderson concerning the need for legal aid, though, these are often not the types of case that should be developed.  As such, the kind of appeals process contained in the Bill is in everyone's interests.</p></speech>

The new memorandum of understanding, MOU, for Private Member's Bills, agreed at the D&aacute;il Business Committee in December and in place from the start of this month states:</p> <blockquote> 	Under this MoU, the Bills Office will conduct a preliminary assessment in relation to Money Messages once the Bill has passed Second Stage.  However the assessment will not be finalised until Committee scrutiny is completed, and Messages will not be requested from DPER until after the Order for Committee Stage is agreed. </blockquote> <p>The fact that the Bills Office has made that decision in advance of this discussion is totally contrary to the procedure in the MOU agreed by all parties at the committee.  The remaining Bills awaiting Committee Stage should undergo scrutiny under the terms of the MOU.  Under the terms of the MOU, it seems that a decision should not have been taken before this discussion.  I wish to place that fact on the record.</p></speech>

I welcome what the Senator has read into the record.  It is likely due to the fact that this Bill was in the process and referred before the MOU was adopted.  I am only offering a possibility.  The clerk advises me that the MOU only applies to Bills referred after 20 January, so we will not be able to use that argument as I was suggesting.  As Senators Kelleher and Black know, we have had this for some time before.  That is the fig leaf that will be used to justify having proceeded without waiting for our deliberations here today.  It underscores all that has been said.  Has Senator Black anything to add?</p></speech>

Ireland has to play its part alongside all of the other countries in the world.  Family reunification is critical.  Being blocked here today does not mean that the refugee crisis has ended and it does not end Ireland's moral obligations, so it does not go away.  It is a shame that this avenue could not be pursued, because a small change would make a big difference to many people who have already suffered a great deal.  I am disappointed that we are not lifting that burden for people who have already had such trouble in their lives.  It is unimaginable trouble.  I cannot imagine a situation where I would have to choose between supporting a son and a daughter.  I do not think the committee has heard the last of us on this matter.  We will regroup and see what we can do.  I am disappointed that there has been such resistance to such a modest, humane and decent measure for people who have suffered in a way that we cannot even imagine.</p></speech>

However, figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that one in seven people have never used the Internet.  Such individuals cite a lack of skills and the belief that they do not need the Internet as the key barriers to using it.</p> <p>  At a foundation level, minimising the digital divide is about ensuring broadband connectivity for the population in the first instance.  Advances in 5G technology will enable wider geographic coverage.  Thereafter, basic foundation skills and literacy will enable people to discover the constructive applications of digital technology and content.  Addressing the foundations of the digital divide involves, in the main, reaching out to the most marginalised in society and helping them to participate in a digital society.  The digital skills for citizens scheme of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment provides basic digital skills classes to help people take their first step online.  However, classroom training alone will not suffice to tackle the problem, with the CSO indicating that approximately 16% to 18% of the population are affected.</p><p>Any new interventions must be sustainable to provide the ongoing supports required to address and maintain inclusion in a digital world.</p><p> Communities are at the heart of everything we do, be it digital or otherwise.  We are working across both Departments to provide communities with a better chance of making choices for themselves.  To succeed in developing communities where connectivity and digitisation are a seamless part of everyday life, partnerships between Departments, private industry and communities are necessary.  By working together and combining existing assets and resources under a shared vision, communities can maximise the reach and impact of schemes and programmes.</p><p> The smart community initiative is a new approach that will bring exposure to digital content and technology into the community and support the discovery of the value of digital technologies in the daily lives of people.  With this in mind, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, together with the Department of Rural and Community Development, engaged with senior representatives from organisations that had expressed an interest in this approach such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Bank of Ireland, Musgraves, An Post, the HSE, the library services and the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA.</p><p>All of these organisations demonstrated their willingness to be an active partner and a smart community action group was established.  The group agreed that every community faces different challenges and identified four key pillars to be considered, namely, basic skills, economic well-being, physical and mental well-being, and history, culture and heritage.</p><p> The action group agreed to pilot the smart community initiative in Tubbercurry, County Sligo.  Factors taken into account in selecting Tubbercurry included the presence of strong active community groups, a local presence of all the stakeholders in the action group, the availability of high-speed broadband, co-location of a post office and a SuperValu, and the existence of an open library, which has been funded by the Department of Rural and Community Development under the libraries capital programme.</p><p> A Tubbercurry smart community committee was established to test the feasibility of the initiative and develop a number of local activities.  The committee organised a launch event for the Tubbercurry smart community on 18 January, which highlighted some of the supports available locally and the opportunities provided by embracing technology.  One of these opportunities is the chance to promote Tubbercurry as a remote working location.  Ireland, like all other countries, is being increasingly affected by digital content and technology, with 6% of Ireland&rsquo;s GDP and 116,000 jobs being accounted for by digital technologies in the economy.  The opportunities digital technologies represent for Ireland are significant.  Ireland has the raw materials needed for success, including the presence of leading digital businesses, a young educated English-speaking workforce and high levels of international connectivity.</p><p> The Tubbercurry smart community committee is working with a volunteer movement called Grow Remote to host a conference in Tubbercurry on 16 April 2019.  Grow Remote is about connecting jobs to the people and creating a remote community.  It is about choice and when jobs are mobile it provides opportunities for communities to compete.  I welcome the representatives of Grow Remote, who will speak to the committee later.  </p><p> Over the coming months we will assess the impact of becoming a smart community on Tubbercurry, will record lessons learned and will develop criteria to identify key elements required to become a smart community, as well as a set of metrics to be used to measure success.  However, one pilot is not sufficient to test and build a robust, sustainable initiative, and we hope to trial this initiative in a further three locations this year.  The locations chosen will include at least one urban location to ensure that the model used for establishing a smart community can be adapted to meet the different needs of communities nationwide.  We will examine existing infrastructure, connectivity and will explore new ways of delivering Government services to enhance the user experience.  The Department of Rural and Community Development, which co-funds the employment of a broadband officer in each local authority to the tune of &euro;42,000 per local authority this year, will be key to rolling out further trials.</p><p>I recently met broadband officers and senior officials from each local authority and impressed upon them that they must play a vital role in promoting the smart community initiative and the work of Grow Remote.  </p><p> A smart community can be described as a community working together supported by local and central government, to bring people and technology together in time to capture and exploit the opportunities that new applications afford and broadband-based services can deliver.  Such focused and united community efforts create synergy, which allows individual projects to build upon each other and provide a coherence to Government supports and funding opportunities.  Digital is not an end in itself but is an enabler and each community has a different story to tell.  In order to develop as a smart community, activities must be community driven and supported by industry and Government</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.937" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracy Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019020600002#E00300"><p>On behalf of Grow Remote Ireland and our 40 chapters across the country, I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, for having spent his evenings supporting our chapter on the ground in Ennis.</p> <p>  I have a fundamental belief in the power of community when it is given space to be done right.  I have watched meetings of this committee and I realise the committee also understands this, as well as the challenges faced by communities, whether it is the housing crisis, congestion, carbon tax, the need for more and higher quality regional employment and the need to relieve the pressure valve on urban areas.  There is also a challenge to increase levels of employment and the quality thereof in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  We consider remote work as enabling decentralisation but for the private sector and by choice.  We work with three groups to make it a reality:  First is the companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, whose greatest challenge is securing access to talent and then retaining it.  Second is the talent, that is, the people themselves.  According to a Vodafone study, 77% of respondents say they want more flexible working policies in Irish organisations.  In a Wicklow County Council survey of commuters, 50% of respondents wanted to work and live in their home town.  The third, and my most important group, are the rural community groups, which need to ensure the economic sustainability of vibrant rural communities and which are building capacity to enable this new type of employment. </p> <p>  We started off by asking how we might drive it more.  Remote working companies have identified remote work as a skill in itself.  The first thing Grow Remote must do is uncover the highly talented workforce in Ireland which is already skilled in remote work.  Having located that skills base, Grow Remote can point to this as a place to locate.  Grow Remote has introduced a free scholarship programme for an accredited certificate in remote working.  </p> <p>  Creating jobs in the regions relieves the pressure on our major urban areas in housing, congestion and everything else.  Many people say that broadband in rural areas of Ireland is not sufficient.  It certainly is not, but it is not inhibiting big companies from hiring here now.  </p> <p>  The Grow Remote group began as a mobilised group of co-working managers, employers, and employees which saw an opportunity.  It slowly evolved into an organisation with the structure to deliver its aims nationally and locally.  It has 40 chapters across Ireland, as well as one each in Spain, Portugal and the US.  We had not anticipated this scale but we hit upon a basic need which, if fulfilled, would enable our communities to thrive, and scaling was a natural next step.  </p> <p>  A survey conducted by the telecommunications company, Blueface, found that there are 216,000 remote workers in Ireland.  Our first goal is to understand that figure more deeply, and to establish their location, who these people are, who they work for and the nature of their skills.  A recent Grow Remote event in a very rural location was attended by people from Dell, Pfizer, Wayfair, Shopify, Github and Hotjar.  These are not companies that hire in this location specifically, but those people live and work in that community and contribute to it directly.</p><p>When we mention rural jobs, we think of SMEs, and I am not asking that we let go of the SMEs.  A man stood up at the rural meet-up - John Horkan, who is owner of Horkan Garden Centre and employs 150 people.  It is a Mayo company, born and bred.  He spoke about how he was surprised to see the vast variety of skills in that room and how seeing that is fundamental to supporting the Horkan Garden Centre on its digital transformation journey to ensure that SME is sustainable for that community.<br/><br/>As to what we do, the idea at the heart of Grow Remote is quite simple in that we bridge the gap between remote work and local impact.  Our focus is on remote work for full-time employees, with all of the same benefits anyone would get with a local employer, simply without the office.  We separate the suppliers of remote work into two streams, first, fully distributed companies with no offices and, second, companies which are on the journey and which have <i>ad hoc</i>policies and, say, let people work in Castlebar or Tuam but which do not have a unified approach to hiring remotely.  Companies such as Shopify, Buffer and 10up are moving towards having no offices whatsoever.<br/><br/>How do we bridge the gap?  We operate in chapters on a platform called ChangeX.  It is textbook community development and equips communities with the tools and resources to make change in their own environment, which is what they are doing.  Our chapters range from communities on Arranmore island, which has a population of 465 people, to Dublin and Lisbon.  They all support each other in enabling each one to thrive.<br/><br/>It is relatively obvious why are we doing this but there are two main points.  The first concerns bringing economic life back to rural Ireland.  People need high-quality jobs in rural places and they need to be able to spend their earnings in the local community.  They want to do that and we just need to enable it.  The second is related to the perspective we came from.  Regional hubs are popping up all over the country.  They started off with a focus on anchor tenants, start-ups and SMEs and we believe the final pillar in enabling these hubs to thrive is enabling remote work and people who wish to work remotely, but not necessarily within their own homes.  This reflects the wider point in regard to these hubs, which is bringing life back to the main streets and central areas of our towns and villages.<br/><br/>What is the committee's role in supporting Grow Remote?  Our first ask is that we would like to commission an in-depth study of the opportunities remote working presents, and the challenges currently faced by companies wishing to pursue such a strategy.  Second, we would like solid co-ordination across Government agencies on the topic of remote work.  While we have had positive engagement with Government bodies on an informal basis, we are asking this committee to ask the Government agencies with responsibility for job creation, and beyond that to carbon emissions and that side, to work closely with our team at Grow Remote as we deliver the necessary supports.<br/><br/>To recap, as part of changing the narrative on rural Ireland, we need to show that there is an abundance of jobs in the most rural places in Ireland, the jobs that do not come with a ribbon cut and do not come in the usual way.  Such jobs are in brilliant international firms such as Shopify, Wayfair, Trello, Buffer, 10up, Scrapinghub, Nearform and others.  We can all think of a town in Ireland that has a pub, a shop and a GAA pitch - I am thinking of Ballinderry, County Galway - where a person growing up will think they can be a publican, an undertaker or a primary school teacher.  We want them also to think they can work for Expedia, Shopify or Wayfair, and just because we are no longer seeing them on the main street does not mean there cannot be brilliant career opportunities with these companies.<br/><br/>The proverbial win-win is normally too good to be true but this is happening in areas across Ireland.  It is a win for employers, which are seeing increased productivity and better brands that attract new employees, it is a win for employees, who are more productive and happier, and it is a major win for our communities which enables them to grow more.  While it is not a silver bullet and is not the single solution to our changing world of work and life, it is a smart, effective, economically viable solution that has yet to be fully embraced and become mainstream among employers and employees and communities.  The question is what else we have in our arsenal to drive job creation in Ireland and whether one of those elements is the driving of remote work as a serious solution.<br/><br/>A couple of weeks ago we launched Grow Remote in Tubbercurry with a fantastic local team with a brilliant track record in delivery.  I thank the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for its forward thinking and proactive approach to supporting that community on the ground and behind the scenes, thereby enabling it to thrive, in particular, Caroline Henry, Stephen Brennan and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  I thank the committee for their time.</p></speech>

This issue deeply interests all of us in terms of how we can grow enterprise and enhance social inclusion for those of us who live in rural Ireland.  The Minister of State has been on this side of the table advocating for rural Ireland and I know he is passionate about it.  This is an interesting engagement.  For once, we are starting to think outside the box, rather than going through the traditional streams of how we will get the networks into rural Ireland in regard to broadband, infrastructure and the various aspects of wireless technology, for example, the new initiatives from SIRO and the ESB, which are looking at ways other than the hard fibre that has traditionally delivered broadband in urban areas.  That is all happening in the background but, in the meantime, it is refreshing to hear Ms Keogh outline how she and her colleagues are thinking outside the box, utilising existing infrastructure and getting ahead of the game in engaging with employers, Departments, this committee, agencies and others.  I commend her and her colleagues for that.</p> <p>  It should not stop there.  Ms Keogh in her presentation mentioned the power of community and quality of life, which are the traditional strengths of rural Ireland.  We need to capture those, as she said, and direct them in a way that creates jobs and allows people to live at home, earn an income and contribute to their local communities.  That is what I am getting from her, in an nutshell.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  She mentioned enablers and this committee needs to help in identifying enablers to meet Grow Remote's aspirations and make them work.  She referred to access to regional hubs and to commissioning a study to identify further opportunities.  I ask her to elaborate on that, distil it down and tell us what specific opportunities she has in mind.  Should we bring specific employers before a committee such as this or try to assist Grow Remote in engaging them through its chapters?  There are the SMEs, ISME, Retail Ireland and all of the representative agencies and the larger brands and companies which mentioned.  Ms Keogh might identify some of the enablers we could assist in identifying.</p> <p>  I want to direct a question to the Minister of State, as I recognise the role he can play in being the champion for initiatives like this across Government.  As we know, the Government can often work in silos within individual Departments and it is very hard to get that recognition of how cross-cutting initiatives like this can work.  I refer, in particular, to the delivery of broadband and access to digital, which is of primary importance, and the Minister of State and his colleagues are doing their best to enhance that.  We need to engage the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and encourage its officials and representatives to engage with us to look at how we can assist organisations such as Grow Remote.  There is significant potential if this is managed in a co-ordinated way, and I am excited to hear so much work is going on behind the scenes.  We need to see more of that.</p><p>We could consider whether we should invite representatives of other agencies or Departments or employer representatives to see how we can channel them into thinking about Grow Remote and how we can improve the prospects for job creation in rural Ireland.  The committee would be doing a job in that regard.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for the presentation and I look forward to their responses.</p></speech>

They are much appreciated.  I will respond first on the report.  Many things could be done.  We have an e-workers grant, for example, but it is hard for remote working companies to administer and it is not well promoted.  There are various things but instead of coming to the committee and asking for one-off items like that or the e-visa that Estonia does very well - there are other models we could adopt from different countries - we would like to open it further and make sure that the things we ask for are viable and will have a meaningful impact.  The study is essentially to understand the current landscape.  For example, the figure of 216,000 workers is large, but is that the case or not?  Can we delve a little further into that?  Are there any infrastructure challenges that the Government can work on to support companies to hire outside cities and in more remote areas?  That is what we want to do.  It is broad, but as soon as the committee starts speaking to the companies we are speaking to, that will begin to firm up.  People have been thinking about this but they have not had the opportunity to appear before the committee, as we have been given today.  As soon as that gateway is opened, the committee will have floods.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.942" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Ellingstad" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019020600002#G00300"><p>I am an example of somebody who has been remote working for more than 15 years.  I have fortuitously been in the IT sector.  I have been working over 25 years since I started my career.  I have been living in Ireland and working for multinational companies in global jobs.  It started in Gateway 2000 in Europe and east Africa as well as global roles when I lived in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I moved to Clare in 2007.  I was able to do that because of the trusting relationship not only with my employer but also with my manager.  I find that while more people are building those relationships, that trust it is still not at a point where the culture and trust within organisations enable the potential we have today to be pervasive.</p> <p>  In terms of what the Government can do to support it, there is still a perception that remote working is about converting a spare bedroom into a home office and hoping there is good broadband.  It is about co-working spaces and how the Government and local organisations can support them.  If people are coming together in a co-working space, they have all the social interaction and the vibrancy of the community yet they are connected with their customers, employers or employees anywhere in the world.  It is about encouraging those spaces and, as Ms Keogh noted, going beyond the mindset that this is for small start-ups and trying to create new businesses.  That is definitely part of it, but there are so many people around the country and the world who have the capability to work in remote spaces and make their communities vibrant if they are given that opportunity and the process and trust are built with their employers and with the community.</p></speech>

The Tubbercurry smart community is an example of where a number of groups and agencies have come together.  When I was there, Sligo IT was very active as well, and, therefore, education comes into it.  Returning to what has been said about Grow Remote, I have been informed by the IDA that foreign direct investors want to know that their workers can work from home, not necessarily from the house but that they can work from Tubbercurry, Tuam, Ballinderreen, Gort or wherever.  They can work there and, perhaps, drive three miles home.  They have a better quality of life and we save significantly on transport costs, emissions and so forth.  Ms Keogh referred to win-win and I was impressed by what I saw in Tubbercurry in terms of collective responsibility and collective action on the part of a large number of people.  Having met Ms Keogh and her group, I believe wholeheartedly that we are working on something that will make a major difference to rural Ireland.  Ms Keogh said the lack of broadband in rural Ireland is not necessarily an inhibitor.  If we have places in towns that can take up the slack, we will be able to develop and keep jobs in the towns and villages.  That is the first step.  Rural broadband is another issue.</p> <p>  I am committed to this and I will be talking to other Departments to explain what is happening here and to get their input.  That is a big factor which is often missing.  Some Departments do not know what is happening in another Department.  There might be good initiatives.  Officials could be wondering how they will do something when it has been done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.944" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019020600002#G00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentation.  I wish to raise a couple of matters.  The first is the chapters, how they are set up and what mechanism a community project or group goes through to engage with them.  I am from south Leitrim.  Carrick-on-Shannon has a good broadband service and is the place where everything is happening, but there is very little outside that.  That is one of the difficulties.  I live in a rural parish where there is a pub and a shop.  There used to be a post office but it is not there anymore.  We will not discuss that today.  We have a football pitch.  The school was a three-teacher school but unless we attract another 16 children by next September, it will become a two-teacher school.  Once it becomes a two-teacher school, it will be on the way out.  In many rural parishes around the country there is no town.  There is a wire running on top of the poles from Mohill to Aghavas that is supposedly the broadband wire.  It has been there for three years but there is no broadband.  It is the same in many places.  I rejoice in what the witnesses are telling us, but we have heard so much of this for so long that many rural communities have become disheartened and have given up.  They have tried so hard but they find it very difficult.</p> <p>  I would like to have details on how these chapters can work, which businesses could be involved and how people can live at home in a rural area and go to the small village or town nearby and work from there.  If that can happen and there is a market for that and if something real can be done to change things around, that is wonderful.  However, we are hesitant in believing it because we have heard so many promises in the past.</p> <p>  The other issue is how to make this happen.  Communities have come together and have worked hard for a long time to try to make things happen, but it has generally ended up that these little development organisations have just become social clubs.  There is little at the end of it.  That has to change.  If the witnesses are saying there is an opportunity here in that regard, we must first get these broadband wires running along the top of the poles live and working.  We need to have not just one or two major towns in each county having good broadband but to get broadband everywhere.  I do not expect it to go down every boreen.  People in rural Ireland are not stupid.  They understand that.  However, there must be a decent broadband provision in most places.  If there is an opportunity for remote working for people living at home through many of the multinational companies or reasonably well established companies, as was mentioned by Ms Keogh, how is that accessed?  What is the A, B and C for doing this?  We must see the framework and the proof of concept.  We are sick of concepts and reports on how things could be done because when it comes to it, nothing happens.  That is the reality for many people living in rural areas where there is a three-teacher school being reduced to a two-teacher school.  They want to change that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.945" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019020600002#G00600"><p>I am sorry I was not present for the presentation but I watched it in my office.  Ms Keogh knows who I am because my good friend, Mary Fahey in Portumna, has done a great deal of work on remote working.  This week we were about to run it out of my office in the hub in Portumna.  Ms Fahey is also a Grow Remote chapter leader.</p><p>I am well versed in Grow Remote.  I once mentioned it on "The Tonight Show", and it is my most retweeted comment.  People who are in on this understand what it is about and they see the value in it, but we have to assist in getting the word out about it and how it works.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, rightly said that we have to encourage communities to work together.  This is about people who do not want to be in their offices or homes day in and day out because of the loneliness attached to it.  Employers take comfort in the fact there is communal working taking place.</p><p> In regard to LEADER funding, is there capacity for funding under this scheme to be ring-fenced for the conversion of buildings by the chapters, because this is a growing entity?  In Galway, the Abbey community was awarded &euro;50,000 under the town and villages renewal scheme to convert its community centre into a digital hub to facilitate people from that area.  As we know, there are broadband blackspots in Ballinakill, but that does not preclude people travelling five miles to work in this facility.  In areas where, in the chapters' experience, there are suitable properties to develop this community experience, chapters could be the lever in accessing funding under LEADER to deliver them.</p><p> Ms. Keogh's background is in Grow Remote but I assume she works for an industry or an organisation.</p></speech>

I was in with Mr. Ronan Hazlette who converted his building into a co-working space for Manorhamilton and called it Manor Hub.  Mr. Hazlette works all over the world.  He is a fantastic guy and he has such conviction and passion for his community.  I wondered how I was going to support this experience.  It is so difficult.  It is not an easy win.  I understand that communities have been doing this for a while because we are a community that has been doing it.  People may have heard about the things that do not happen but that is part and parcel of community.  Grow Remote has taken the energy from Tullamore to Gorey to Cork to Valentia Island to Arranmore Island and brought it together in a structure where we can get it to others and set out our coherent asks.  This ensures we do not turn into a type of social club.  On that note, when I was listening back to the committees, I heard one man speak about the importance of social enterprise in communities.  We strengthen groups by training them up and building competent communities.  As communities, we need the help of the committee around structuring our thoughts and opinions and the actions that we want to take.  We have received great support from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland.  Without Mr. John Evoy being at the other end of a telephone call for me, I would have been fairly stuck.<br/><br/>Deputy Kenny also asked about chapters.  We went to ChangeX and we set out what ever the community needs to do.  We built the guide to finding remote work so that people know where to find it.  The Deputy is right that 64% of people say they do not work remotely because they do not know where to find that work.  These jobs are not listed on the same sites as other jobs.  That was a core part of what we did.  We then gathered all of those tools together and brought them to ChangeX.  Communities that want to do this literally need only take five steps to set up a chapter.  The set-up process is pretty structured.  ChangeX is a tremendous organisation to enable this.  I am not sure if anybody here read the article by Mr. Pat Spillane in, I think, <i>The Irish Times, </i>in which he spoke about the schools, the three children and the three teachers and how when something goes wrong in rural Ireland, we say it is dying or that we must go to Dublin to get help to fix the problem.  He also spoke about a community, Kiltyclogher, and how it set out to identify its reality and restrictions and what it could do in that regard.</p></speech>

I had a meeting this morning with the telecommunications industry.  They have a clear understanding of what I want them to do.  As stated in the D&aacute;il by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and me, if the Deputy raises that specific issue with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, we will have it followed up and get back to him on it.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte spoke about CL&Aacute;R.  She also mentioned the town and village renewal scheme.  The Department has a number of streams of funding to which people can make applications, including the rural regeneration fund.  There is funding available to enable identified buildings, whether publicly or privately owned, to be brought back into public use.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Where we have libraries, we have a tool and a network.  We are investing in digital enhancement of libraries so that they can remain open.  These are called "open libraries" and they are open remotely from 8 a.m. until 10 p.m.  There is an open library in Tubbercurry and this provision is being rolled out across the country.  On the day I visited Tubbercurry library, senior citizens were being trained in computer skills, including how to send an email and how to access information online in regard to booking a holiday and so on, such that they are not left behind in their communities in the digital age.  There is a huge amount happening.  It is not always about finding new buildings.  There are libraries in many places that we should be utilising more.  They should not be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. only.  They should be open remotely and we are doing that.</p> <p>  This is the type of initiative and forward thinking we need in terms of utilising the assets we have.  In doing that, we will create the spaces we need.  Communities in villages that do not have libraries can access funding for the creation of these spaces through CL&Aacute;R, the town and village renewal scheme, the community enhancement programme, as well as the rural regeneration fund.  These funding streams will be of great assistance to such.  We all know of buildings that have been closed for years which could be opened up for this purpose.</p><p>That is what is happening.  We have also piloted six villages in the country where we have given funding for the community itself to come up with a scheme for what it wants to do to regenerate its town.  They probably will come up with six different proposals for each town.  The reason for that is because not every town is the same.  Their needs and wants are different.  Rural regeneration means that rather than Dublin telling us what we will give in Tuam, Claremorris or wherever, we will ask people to create the plan they want, ask them to bring that back up to us, and we will try to fund that.  It is a different, bottom-up approach.</p></speech>

I welcome Grow Remote here.  I went to a chapter meeting in Clarecastle, County Clare, and I saw how this works.  It was incredible.  I must compliment Ms Keogh and Mr. Ellingstad for doing this because they are making a real difference.  Every rural community in Ireland can benefit from Grow Remote.  It is such a simple idea but it works.  It is about bringing everything together.  Mr. Ellingstad hit on the core point stating that one needs a structure.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, was talking about town and village, the CLAR programme and other revenue sources.  There are 40 different chapters in Ireland and abroad.  We need to put together a package where Grow Remote could link in with SMEs or multinational companies - Mr. Ellingstad touched on it as well as a culture of trust between the employee and the employer where one is working remotely from his or her house or co-working space.  Dublin's urban sprawl would benefit from this as well as fewer people would be commuting.  There are the issues of housing in Dublin, pressure on schools and whatever else.  Working remotely is the way to go.</p> <p>  Ms Keogh mentioned producing an in-depth report on working remotely.</p></speech>

If one could live in Clare and work in Clare, it would be the best place to be.  Working remotely, one could achieve that.</p> <p>  Listening to Mr. Ellingstad, he works for a serious global company.  He is working from home in Clarecastle in County Clare.  I went to that chapter meeting on Thursday week last in Clarecastle, my own village, and was impressed to see the number of people who were there.  They were serious players and they are working remotely from home.  It is a matter of trying to join that up and get that message out.</p> <p>  I thank the members for agreeing to have this meeting today and for having Ms Keogh and Mr. Ellingstad attend.  We need to publicise the work they are doing in conjunction with the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.  This gives them this opportunity.

I had another meeting.  I got a lot from the questions and answers section.</p> <p>  I will speak about my own experience in Roscommon-Galway.  I attended the launch of a digital hub attached to the library in Ballinasloe at the end of January.  Obviously, it is a positive development.  Ballinasloe Area Community Development, BACD, is proactive in encouraging the exacting goals that Ms Keogh and Mr. Ellingstad were talking about with regard to trying to work with companies to ensure that a number of employees could benefit from working in this space.  We all know the challenges of travelling to Galway city, Dublin or wherever on a daily basis.  Galway County Council is supportive of this initiative as well.  The Minister of State will be aware that Mr. Michael Burke, CEO of the Chanelle Group, attended the launch and was involved in its promotion.  It has been there for the best part of a year and a half.  They had their first client at the end of 2018 for a number of weeks.  There is considerable potential but we are not harnessing it enough.  We talk a lot about the infrastructure that is needed but the infrastructure is there.  This is a space which could work for many people.  I will also give the example of our fabulous new &Aacute;ras an Chontae building in Roscommon town.  Similarly, there is a digital hub attached to that.  There is much more potential than is being currently utilised to support people to live in rural areas to enjoy the quality of life that we all promote and enjoy.</p> <p>  My point to the Minister of State and to the other individuals on the panel today is we should be doing more to ensure the fabulous hub over the library in Ballinasloe and the digital hub in Roscommon town are utilised to their maximum potential and we are not doing that currently.  I suppose all of us want to be proactive.  We want to work on the resources that we have or the resources that we can deliver on, but these are resources and infrastructure that are already there.</p> <p>  We need to communicate that more widely.  I was quite interested in what Mr. Ellingstad stated about how he began working from home and that his manager worked quite closely to encourage that.  What more do we need to do in our work with companies to make known the potential of these hubs?  I am only speaking about the ones in my region but I know they are underutilised.  I strongly believe more needs to be done to encourage employers or entrepreneurs to set up and benefit from the good facilities that are currently in rural areas.  Obviously, I am working closely with BACD, and in Roscommon, to promote that but there is another piece of work that needs to be done to finish off this jigsaw given the infrastructure that is there.  I would appreciate a response on that main point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.975" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1271" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019020600002#J01100"><p>I thank the Minister of State and Ms Keogh for their presentations here this morning.  For once, it sounds like a positive story and something exciting with significant potential for our communities and for those of us living in rural Ireland.</p><p>We tend to focus on negative developments such as post office closures.  They present a physical disadvantage, as we perceive it to be, in terms of the loss of another important building, business and footfall with respect to the opportunity to bring people into our towns and villages.  I am thinking of towns such as Kilnaleck and Killeshandra that have been affected in that way but, as Ms Tracy Keogh pointed out, there are probably other small towns that face different types of difficulties.  For example, Belturbet and Bawnboy in west Cavan are on the cusp of losing a secondary school.  It is a scary prospect for towns or villages to face a school closure and the loss of youth and footfall that would entail in terms of the families, students and staff who circulate in them.</p><p> The presentation made by Ms Keogh is about a positive development, about which I would like to know more.  I compliment the Minister of State who has been greatly involved in this initiative.  I would be interested to hear where the organisation's other chapters are located because I am not aware of this initiative.  Does it have a chapter in Cavan or Monaghan, which are the counties I represent?  Ms Keogh's message today is that two elements have been fundamental to the success of this initiative, namely, community and communication.  There are many voluntary groups in our towns and villages across the country, be it the town development association, the Tidy Towns committee, or those involved in the Community Alert programme, which all do different and important jobs.  They are the glue that holds our communities together.  The initiative Ms Keogh presented is an opportunity to bring all those under one roof and, more important, provide jobs in our small towns and villages.  </p><p> I travel the N3 to Dublin and back every day and it is evident we have a commuter crisis.  Commuting is what kills people and diminishes quality family life and family time because people spend many hours in their cars travelling to and from work.  That is the experience of many people in Cavan and Monaghan which do not have a rail service.  As the train is not an option, people spend two or three hours travelling to and from work every day.  They are exhausted by the time they get home and they do not have quality time to spend with their young children, spouses or whomever.</p><p> This is a positive initiative.  Will Ms Keogh expand on the point my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, raised regarding the funding opportunities that may exist to embrace this initiative?  Are local enterprise offices, LEOs, involved in this initiative?  Has there been a gender breakdown of the number of females and males benefitting from this initiative?  It would offer a major opportunity to women who have great career prospects but who have had to be put them on hold because of childcare expenses.  For most families, childcare can be as expensive or more expensive than their mortgage.  Couples have to weigh up whether it is sensible for both partners to work.  Women are the potentially untapped human resource that can be expanded.  This initiative provides a platform for women to work remotely.  Have any studies been done in this area?  Are there figures on a gender breakdown of who benefits most from this?  </p><p> Ms Keogh is right that we tend to jump on the bandwagon about what is wrong in our communities.  The subject of her presentation provides an opportunity that communities should consider.  As the Minister of State correctly stated, every town is unique in terms of its disadvantages but also in terms of its advantages.  It may be close to a motorway or it may have a secondary school or an education and training board in the locality that produces young graduates who ordinarily would have to go to college in Galway, Dublin or Belfast.  Perhaps this initiative would offer jobs that they could tap into in their communities and keep people - our most important resource - in rural communities.</p><p> I have two essential questions.  First, is the organisation working with the LEOs?  What other funding opportunities are available to Grow Remote?  I also asked about the gender breakdown.  Communication is key to this initiative.  The many voluntary groups working in our communities tend not to communicate with each other.  However, they are all passionate about working for the betterment of their communities.  This initiative would be a vehicle to enhance this.  I ask Ms Keogh to expand on her proposals in this regard.</p></speech>

Some hubs are not at full occupancy.  They need to be at 60% occupancy to break even and be financially sustainable.  Sometimes people have been quick to say they do not work.  In rural Ireland, we do not have the luxury of saying they do not work.  They need to work, so they are on a journey.<br/><br/>Senator Hopkins spoke about a hub targeting a company which could base a group of employees in its area.  It is probably looking at satellite offices, which is one stream, but if we consider the bigger trends, companies are operating without offices.  Some companies are being approached by centres in areas such as the Burren, Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Portumna asking them to open up satellite offices.  They are finding it difficult to do this, however.  Grow Remote came about precisely to provide support in such circumstances.<br/><br/>In terms of enabling hubs to reach their full potential, in many instances, they are definitely not there yet.  One of our chapters in Termon in Donegal is working on an EU funded project focused on how co-working spaces in rural areas enable rural areas to thrive.  It is building that blueprint.  To take up Deputy Smyth's point, I have repeatedly heard about the importance of building competent communities and enabling the sharing of case studies and things that work among communities.  Another organisation is also working on that blueprint, which I assume will be completed by the middle of this year.  This will help hubs identify what is best practice and adopt which elements are relevant to their area.<br/><br/>I thank Deputy Smyth for her kind words on our chapters.  She fundamentally gets our bigger mission and the purpose of it.  All our chapters and locations can be viewed on <i>changex.org/growremote/locations</i>.  We are essentially everywhere.  We have one chapter in Monaghan.  I was in the county yesterday and there is a tremendous local council in Monaghan.  It is very forward-thinking.  The first question I ask in every community is whether people know what Wayfair is.  Invariably the response is &quot;No&quot; and I think that is why the jobs are not there.  The difference between knowing about Wayfair and not knowing about it is the difference between having these jobs in an area and not having them in an area.  Monaghan is building out a particularly ambitious chapter and it sees a great opportunity in it.<br/><br/>On funding, going back to the foundations of Grow Remote we have found, as all community organisations find, that the landscape for funding for communities is a minefield.  I went to Brussels three times last year to try to understand the system.  I have asked counties about it and different counties seem to do it differently.  Wherever there is a fund open, we have submitted an application.<br/><br/>In terms of the local employment offices, everyone with whom we have been working has been fantastic.  In places such as Tullamore the LEOs have been great and very proactive.  However,  because we are a national organisation, it is hard to structure engagement with the LEOs because it tends to be one-off cases here and there.  That is one of the challenges we have.  We emerged nationally and it was not as if we were based only in Tullamore, Offaly or Galway.<br/><br/>On women benefitting from the initiative, that is very important to me personally.  We do not have any statistics on it.  I call tell Deputy Smyth about one women who was in our chapter.  She is a single mother who was living in Dublin.  She was renting and had to move out of her home.  It had not occurred to me but moving out means moving children from school.  This caused major interruption to the woman's life and she was certain she could not do it.  She moved to a commuter town, convinced her boss to allow her <i>ad hoc </i>to work remotely and, through Grow Remote, was able to get a referral into a bigger remote working company and secure a proper full-time remote working job.  That is the type of success we are seeing.</p><p> I do not have any statistics on the issue but Abodoo, an Irish recruitment company, is focused on unconscious bias in hiring.  Employmum focuses on bringing women who have been staying at home back into the workforce.  WorkJuggle is also focused on enabling that workforce to come back.  It is not the only part of this, but it is a major one.</p></speech>

Sometimes, this is because it takes a while to get it moving or to get the trajectory right.  The most important thing is that we now have a broadband officer in every local authority.  We will be looking to these officers to map the assets we have in order that we can say, for example, that in County Galway there is a hub in Ballinasloe, another digital hub in another location and open-access libraries.  We will have our assets mapped so that we can direct people looking for spaces to Ballinasloe or wherever else.  The hub in Ballinasloe is in a county council building.  The library is downstairs.  It is in the old convent.  It is a fine space.  We need to promote this hub through the local employment offices, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and so on.  Grow Remote will be engaging with the broadband officers.  Ms Keogh is meeting with them next month to see how they can collaborate with each other to make people more aware of what is available.</p> <p>  To return to Deputy Niamh Smyth's question about statistics on gender participation, the Western Development Commission has carried out and published research on the benefits of remote working and the gender balance in the region in which it works.  That might give the Deputy a flavour.  The research is on its website and we can get it to her.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the need for us to provide jobs for communities.  I differ with her on this point.  As legislators, politicians and policymakers, we have to provide the infrastructure to allow the jobs to be created.  Vibrant communities, of which we have many, need to be harnessed.  I have seen at first hand the example of Tubbercurry.  There are many moving parts, but they are all moving together in synch.  That is very important.  They are on the same page as the local authority, Sligo IT, An Post and all of the other organisations involved in that action group.  They are a solid block moving together.  It comes back to what Senator Coffey said about Departments being islands and not knowing what is going on elsewhere.  It is the same thing in communities.  Organisations need to work together and, in many cases, they are doing so.  We need to encourage more of that so that we are all moving the same way.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned funding.  As stated earlier, there are many funding streams available but we also have many existing assets which we do not realise are there or which are not used as they should be used.  I gave the example of the libraries earlier.  Where we do not have assets we can target buildings that are derelict and get them opened up.  That seems to be the high-energy part of the solution.  We should not be doing that unless we have sustainable plans for filling those assets afterwards.</p></speech>

In the context of what the Minister of State indicated earlier, it is very positive that companies providing foreign direct investment are asking questions about, and seeing the potential of, working from home.  We want to benefit from that potential in rural areas.  The Minister of State mentioned a sort of directory and the broadband officers.  That is important because there is a need for some level of co-ordination.  The word "communication" has been used quite a number of times.  It is about knowing where resources are, such as in Ballinasloe or in &Aacute;ras an Chontae in Roscommon town.</p> <p>  Work needs to be done with companies in this area.  This work could potentially, though not necessarily, be around satellite offices if the companies wished to establish them.  Work should be done with them on one-off working or further measures.  Work is definitely needed because the infrastructure in place is definitely under-utilised.  This is a point of which we need to take cognisance in the context of this committee.</p></speech>

Having worked in the technology sector for the last 25 years or more, I can state that the technology is very much the elephant in the room.  Everyone talks about the technology; that is what gets the attention.  The mouse that roars like the lion is the culture and the processes.  That is what is missing among the companies and employers.  They are looking at whether they have the broadband and the offices and whether they trust the employees.  If one looks at the Sunday business papers or at forums like the World Economic Forum, one will see hashtags like #thefutureofwork and people looking at artificial intelligence, AI, and robotics replacing human jobs.  Others are talking about digital transformation and the disruption of business models by companies such as Airbnb and Uber.  The mouse that roars is to get dialogue going about figuring out the processes and the culture both for employers and employees.  Customers have already moved to this.  Customers do not mind if a person is based in India or Timbuktu, yet we have very outdated and primitive processes and culture around allowing employees to live literally anywhere in the world while staying connected to their employer, their customers and their partners.</p> <p>  There are really four key ingredients to this that I have seen from inside the technology sector, namely, people, processes, technology and culture.  It is about taking a systematic approach instead of taking the silo approach to which Senator Coffey referred.  It is about optimising the system not only by looking at the technology, but by looking at the people, the processes, the technology and the culture that make remote working work for employers, employees, customers and, ultimately, communities.</p></speech>

The possibilities are limitless.  The last statement made, namely, that location is irrelevant, is probably 70% true.  There are so many potential variations on this theme that the only limitation is our imagination.  There is one irony in all of this, which is that decentralised Departments, apart from the Department of Education and Skills in Athlone and so on, were basically co-located working places.  The further the digital revolution goes, the more the arguments against decentralisation fall.  Did it really make a difference if, when one called the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, one thought that one was talking to a person in the Custom House when one was actually talking to someone in Ballina?  No.  It made no difference.  Did the person physically have to be beside the person they were working with?  No, not really.  All of us, as Deputies, operate in different locations all the time.  Most of us have our staff well away from where we are ourselves located.  The only limits are literally in our own minds.  I welcome the idea.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  The witnesses are talking about co-located places in Corr na M&oacute;na or wherever.  I am looking for something like that in Corr na M&oacute;na, but only for one reason.  Only 100 or so of the 400 houses around Corr na M&oacute;na have gigabit technology.  The rest are on 5 Mb and cannot work from home.  I know of many existing businesses that cannot get in the net so we need a co-located place within four or five miles so that they can be brought together and connected to gigabit Internet.  Those who have direct connection to gigabit Internet are working from home.</p><p>I have a question that relates to that and two other questions.  Everybody should have Internet access, that is, fibre to the home, with speeds of 1 Gbps.  Mobile technology is no good because it is constantly subject to contention.  It is great when one is out in the field or something like that but it is not a good basic technology when one wants to do work at home and everyone wants to work at the same time.  I am very much in favour of the fibre connection to one's basic place of work and the other supplementary service.  On what does the co-location part depend?</p><p> Who will avail of this?  It was very interesting to see a report in the local authority information we get every day on the web to the effect that Dublin is the second or third most expensive city to live in when the cost of finding somewhere to live versus salary is taken into account.  The obvious reason is that we are forcing people to live here.  It is not that they want to be here, as we know from the number of Civil Service staff requests to transfer out of Dublin, which are eight or ten times higher than requests to transfer to Dublin.  Businesses that employ high end people sometimes need to physically meet people.  I have been arguing about what will happen with our highly educated rural people who work in the cities.  It must be remembered that a higher percentage of people from rural areas have a higher level of education than people from urban areas.  The percentage for Dublin is approximately 40% but in many areas of rural Ireland 55%, 60%, 65% and 70% of young people have a higher level of education.  That does not show up in the statistics because when the census is taken they are all living in Dublin.  However, if we go back to where they grew up and the schools they attended, we find the statistics show that access to third level education, if we take the entire span of Dublin, is much higher in rural areas.  Why is that important?  Many people when they reach their mid-30s are doing the reverse of what they were doing when they were 18.  At 18 people want to live cities but when they reach their 30s they are thinking they would love to be living back in the country in a nice safe place and have their children attend the nice little school they attended.  My prediction is that if we can get in the proper technology and get employers to think outside the box, we will have many people coming to the city two days a week to have their meetings and then work from home on the other three days.  Most people now work six or seven days a week at home, on and off, because of access to computers.  What is the Government doing to encourage that?  It would sort out many of the traffic problems that are intractable in our cities.</p><p> Unfortunately, I was not here for the presentation because I was attending a meeting of the D&aacute;il reform committee.  The Government seems to be looking for jobs for people who do not have jobs.  It is telling companies in the market that Ireland has many top class people who could work for them but they live in "Ballywherever".  The solution it is offering, therefore, is to provide a centre in which jobs will be created.  We have many advantages as a people in terms of servicing multinational companies, including that we are English speaking, friendly and helpful.  Does the Government have a policy of telling IDA Ireland that the days of having to bring an entire factory here are over and that it could attract many jobs to Ireland, irrespective of location, be it from Tory Island to the corner of Wexford or from County Louth across to the tip of Kerry, without providing major infrastructure, factory buildings and so on?  Will IDA Ireland be given the remit to ask all these multinational companies if they want top class out-workers?  It is amazing that we are going back to the past when out-workers at home provided the big mills with product.</p><p> I will make one final point on what Mr. Ellingstad said.  I do not know if people share my frustration but I hate dealing with telephone companies and banks now because I am put through to a call centre and speak to somebody at the far end of the world who does not know my problem and cannot solve it.  I will be honest about that.  It is not because they are far away but because one can never get back to the same person if one rings again.  We need call centres where people can have human contact with someone who knows their file in the way bank managers or staff in telephone companies used to know our files 30 or 40 years ago.  It does not make any difference if that person is based in the Arctic or the Antarctic Circle, provided he or she knows our case and understands where we are coming from.  That will become the next selling point for companies.  When we have a problem we do most things online to deal with it but when we need to talk to a human to sort out a problem, we need a human who understands it and can sort it.  When we talk about no location, that might be physically true but it is not mentally or emotionally true.  The small nature of society here means we are particularly good at connecting with people and problems.  If companies were to go that extra step, they would do a fantastic marketing job for themselves.</p></speech>

I agree fully with the concept of people being able to work from a hub or from home.  As the Minister of State is aware, Internet access is poor in many areas, although in fairness some towns have been brought up to specification on that.  I will be fairly brief.  The Minister of State spoke about libraries and different facilities.  There are former technical schools, community centres or various buildings in towns that communities are trying to refurbish which could be used to encourage and facilitate people to set up a small office or whatever.  The first thing that has to be done is make sure it has Internet access.  Second, the building has to be into a proper state for use.  Some people have done that under the rural economic development zones, REDZ, programme but it takes a while to do this because of the funding streams required.  In fairness, some education and training boards, ETBs, are involved but they may have to go through LEADER, which is a long process.  Is there any way we can streamline the Department's rural development programme the specifically target smaller towns such as Glenamaddy, Ballygar, Strokestown and Castlerea?  In that way we could make sure we keep local people in local areas.</p> <p>  Broadband officers were mentioned.  One can ring them up to tell them the situation regarding broadband access.  Many small businesses in an area might call them to explain the position they are caught up in with regard to bad broadband service.  However, with the best will in the world, the broadband officers cannot do anything about that.  Until the national broadband plan is rolled out throughout the country, they are really only messengers.  There are small businesses in rural areas such as Ward &amp;amp; Burke Construction near me which do not have a broadband service.  Eir provided broadband extending one mile out of town but beyond that it was a case of to hell with it.  Ward &amp;amp; Burke Construction has 22 staff and requires broadband because it works with England, Canada and America.  The problem is that we do not have the infrastructure in place.  While it is great that private rather than public investment has made broadband more accessible for people to do their work in some towns, that is not the case in many other areas.</p><p>I ask that work is done on the LEADER funding especially to make it more available for such facilities to assist them to get up and running.  The REDZ project has helped some areas but one might need to spend between &euro;100,000 and &euro;200,000.  There is a payback because such schemes will help people to live and work in an area and not leave a rural part of the country to work in a city, thereby increasing the demand for housing in cities.  We can talk in circles all day about every bit of smart technology.  Down through the past 20 or 30 years many towns, between community centres and different buildings, have come up.  I am not saying that progress has not been made.  I ask that the final tin hat is put on this and make sure that we can get this facility thus encouraging people into those areas.  There is no point denying the fact that the scheme takes money.  A library has been mentioned.  We are trying to get the library to become a tenant in the technical school in Glenamaddy.  It takes money to bring a building up to specification, especially an older building, which the witnesses will know as they know about quantity surveying as well as anybody.  To get a kickstart is the big thing to facilitate the people.  It is like climbing a stairs; one must create the first step and keep putting in all of the steps to get to the top.  I want this work done quickly enough around the country in order to facilitate people.  </p></speech>

The issue has moved way beyond what he talked about in that the foreign direct companies are telling IDA Ireland that they want to see where people can work remotely.  We are moving away from having 500 or 1,000 jobs in a big building.  We are back to where the FDIs are asking whether we have the facilities for people to work in their own areas, like we have done in Tubbercurry.  FDIs are asking whether people can work remotely from Tubbercurry or other towns.  Working remotely is what it is all about.  IDA Ireland does not need a remit because the demand for remote working is coming from foreign direct companies.  We must provide the facilities so that remote working can be achieved, and that is the way it is working.  There is no point in us telling IDA Ireland what it should do.  Rather, we have to facilitate the FDIs.  </p></speech>

The FDIs are in that space where we have to provide resources, map what we are doing and identify what we have.  We must say that people can work remotely in Tuam or Glenamaddy, for example.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned broadband officers.  I agree with him to a certain extent that up to now one had to ring them to discover where one was in terms of the broadband roll-out.  The broadband officer concept is completely different.  Before the Deputy came in here, Senator Hopkins talked about how the accommodation over the library in Ballinasloe was vacant for 18 months after the place had been turned into a hub.  The broadband officer is there to co-ordinate our assets so that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland know what we have.  As I said earlier about Grow Remote, I will meet the broadband officers and seek more collaboration in terms of this concept.  The broadband officer role will expand and there will be an office within the local authority so that people can go into that office and get more information about where they can locate.  </p> <p>  In terms of Grow Remote, Ms Keogh can answer for herself.  Grow Remote is not a concept where we are trying to get companies because there are jobs.  Instead, we must let people know that the jobs are available and get them to apply.  A lot of the work concerns increasing the knowledge and understanding of what exists.  </p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned old buildings and the LEADER fund, and Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the issue earlier.  Where we have buildings that we can utilise, then fine.  Where we have buildings that are derelict in places where there is no library or whatever, then we should consider ways to bring them back into use.  Personally, I think the rural regeneration fund is the way to go because it takes between &euro;200,000 and &euro;500,000 to do up a building between fire certification and the whole shooting match.  That is where the money is.  We should identify buildings in towns that can be utilised for multiple purposes.  As I said earlier, library buildings should not only open between 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m.  The open library access is going on now.  In a large number of libraries we are rolling out a scheme where people can get a card that allows them to access the building between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. throughout the year; that is happening already.  Customers can check their books in and out by using a card.  All of this kind of stuff is happening.  </p> <p>  In terms of funding, people can apply for funding from the LEADER programme but the rural regeneration fund is probably where a lot more can be done and where the opportunities exist.  Under the rural regeneration fund, as much as &euro;1 billion will be available over the next ten years and there is &euro;315 million available for the next three or four years.  We need to examine all the means of funding.  Every town could have a different asset and need so we cannot give the same thing to everybody.  That is why we have a pilot scheme comprising six towns.  They can identify what they want from the ground up rather than people at central Government level telling them what they will receive.  We are trying to change the thought process when it comes to developing villages.  I believe that I have covered all of the questions. </p></speech>

Mohill is a town near to where I live.  The old vocational school building in Mohill has lain idle for years.  I approached the vocational education committee  about allowing a community project to use the building but the VEC said, "Oh, no.  We had an experience of that before.  We let community projects in and we could not get them out."  That is the kind of attitude one is up against.  I agree with the direction outlined by the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Let us say that a community in a small town or village owns a building, and many of these buildings are in disrepair.  Let us say a community wants a hub set up in a building.  How many work spaces are necessary to make the project viable?  Is it work space for ten or 20 people?  </p> <p>  Let us say a community agrees to do this tomorrow, meet on Friday night and submit an application on Friday week.  To whom do they send their application?  Where is the money going to come from?  How quickly can this be done?  I take the point that was made earlier.  I know about "Kilty Live" as I was involved with setting it up and I understand what the people of that community did.  We are trying to do the same in my parish but the problem is we do not have houses and there are no houses for rent anywhere.  Sometimes the reality on the ground is different and we need to imagine what that is like.  We need to be proactive and come up with imaginative ways forward.  We really need to have a very set line on how to achieve this.  I know that the Minister of State is a man that can do that and I encourage him to come up with a solution. </p></speech>

If somebody just wants to use the library that the Deputy mentioned on a Saturday or Sunday then they can or they will able to do that.</p></speech>

That is just part of the overall approach.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny asked how many desks are needed.  In Headford, it took two weeks to create ten spaces upstairs in a sports club in Moyvilla.  The organisation received &euro;2,000 from Galway County Council for the project.  The venue is now being run nice and quietly but within an existing sports complex.</p><p>There is no set way of doing it.  It is all about doing what one can with the assets one has.  If someone has a building, he or she may avail of the digital innovation fund to assist in developing innovation.  If the building belongs to a local authority, he or she may approach the local authority for assistance or funding.  Deputy Fitzmaurice will know that the former vocational school in Dunmore was renovated and is now an enterprise centre.  There are challenges.  If there is no other use for a public building such as the former school in Dunmore, common sense will prevail.  That may not always be the case but we will keep working on it.</p></speech>

A database of hubs has been made available by TechIreland, which is led by Niamh Bushnell.  Its database, available at <i>www.techireland.org/hubs</i>, lists all of the more than 200 hubs across Ireland.<br/><br/>I made notes regarding broadband but I am not sure if I want to address it.  I am 29 years old.  I decided to move back to the regions from Dublin and other areas.  I want to live in a place that does more than ask for broadband to be provided.  A bigger vision is needed.  Broadband is only an enabler.  We know from places such as Ballinasloe - we have a fantastic chapter in Ballinasloe - where broadband has been provided that it does not solve the world's problems.  We need to take a holistic approach.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about rural areas and people in their 30s.  A group in Canada that studies rural rejuvenation identified that people move back to rural areas in their 30s.  If one wants to target that demographic, one needs to speak to them about schools and target the children more than the parents.  Remote work levels the playing field.  A recruitment firm which utilises remote working stated that talent and intelligence are equally distributed but opportunity is not.  That gap is closing.  When jobs are not location dependent, rural communities can compete on a level playing field with urban areas.  People can make the choice to live where they wish to live rather than because of the area's proximity to jobs.  A previous meeting of the committee dealt with the opportunities offered by decentralisation.  As I previously referenced, remote work is essentially the result of private industries choosing to decentralise.<br/><br/>We work with broadband officers on an individual basis.  They do a tremendous job and look at everything that broadband will enable rather than just as a utility.  For example, Ciaran in Donegal played a significant role in getting our chapters up and running.  That subsequently led to people on Arranmore Island being trained in the skill of remote work.  My experience on the ground has been very positive.<br/><br/>It is great to hear that IDA Ireland is active in this area.  It probably played a major role in developing remote working here.  While I lived in Galway, it was announced that Shopify was to provide a certain number of remote jobs.  Overnight, people such as Aodh&aacute;n Moran began walking into our core working space.  I had never seen him before.  There are many catalysts to a company choosing to go remote.  I saw the power of what could happen.  IDA Ireland played a significant role in building and catalysing this momentum.<br/><br/>Remote working jobs are currently available.  That is one of the first things we point out to companies.  We encourage Irish companies who operate remote working on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis to start developing policies, procedures and the culture and technology that is needed to ensure it is sustainable.  If they keep going on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, those jobs would probably be the first to go if we dropped from full employment.While we are at full employment and there is a talent war, we must make sure that we are encouraging companies to urgently implement the tools and policies required to ensure sustainable growth into the regions.</p></speech>

Peatlands cover approximately 20% of the State's land area and their use has implications across a wide spectrum of public policy.  Intact peatlands produce an array of nature-generated benefits to society known as ecosystem services.  These services provided by peatlands include water retention, which can reduce flooding; water filtration and supply; climate regulation via carbon storage; and, cultural benefits.  Bogs are, of course, an important habitat in their own right and an important breeding ground for many species including highly threatened species such as the curlew.</p> <p>  Ireland's peatlands, occurring as raised bogs, blanket bogs or fens are unique on a national and global scale.  Ireland recognised the importance of these peatlands and took steps to protect the best remaining bogs through designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs.  Between 1997 and 2002, Ireland nominated 53 raised bog sites for designation as SACs.  Some 75 raised bog NHAs have also been designated under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 to supplement the raised bog SAC network.  Ireland has also identified 50 areas as SACs for the protection of blanket bog.  A further 73 sites containing blanket bog habitat have been designated as NHAs under Irish law.  Some 67 sites have been selected for conservation for one or more habitats directive annex 1 fen habitat in Ireland.</p> <p>  Ireland has approximately 60% of the remaining raised bog habitat in Western Europe.  The original area of raised bogs in the State was approximately 311,000 ha.  Most of Ireland's raised bog peatlands are no longer of ecological interest as they have been cut over.  It is estimated that 10% of the raised bog area is suitable for conservation.  For conservation purposes, there has been a need to restrict turf cutting on a number of sites to protect the best of our remaining active raised bog habitat.</p> <p>  The national raised bog special areas of conservation management plan 2017-22, approved by the Government and published in December 2017, sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  The national restoration programme for Ireland's raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas is contained within this plan.  It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within three cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.</p> <p>  Site-specific conservation objectives have been published for the 53 raised bog special areas of conservation and restoration plans drafted for these sites, to be developed further in partnership with stakeholders including landowners and local communities.  Site-specific restorations plans for the raised bog natural heritage areas are also currently being developed by the Department.  In order to help allay concerns on the potential impacts of restoration on areas of land adjacent to the protected bogs, the Department is in the process of developing drainage management plans for the special area of conservation sites as part of the national restoration programme.  Restoration measures on raised bogs involve the insertion of peat or plastic dams to block surface water drains to restore more natural physical conditions and the re-wetting of the bog to raise water levels close to the bog surface to restore peat forming conditions.  Raising the water table should not flood the land surrounding the bog but will ensure that it remains wet enough for the growth of sphagnum moss within the protected site.  Restoration measures may also include tree felling and scrub clearance.</p> <p>  Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4 million project called the living bog, which is co-funded under the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme.  The Department is managing this project and is contributing &euro;1.352 million as well as expert ecological resources and know-how, with the European Commission providing &euro;4.056 million.  The living bog project is the single biggest raised bog restoration project ever undertaken by the State and, as well as physical restoration work, there is a key focus on involving local communities.  A large scale community outreach programme is currently under way in towns, villages and schools, and community-led amenity provision is currently at an advanced stage.  The project will provide for sensitively designed amenities at a small number of the project sites such as walking trails, birdwatching facilities and signage.  The living bog project, which commenced in 2016 and will conclude at the end of 2020, aims to restore the favourable conservation condition and increase the area for active raised bog by 277 ha or 58% on the 12 raised bog special area of conservation project sites.  This will contribute to the national objective of achieving favourable conservation status for active raised bog in Ireland.</p> <p>  Restoration works were completed on two LIFE project special area of conservation sites in 2018 in Mongan bog SAC in County Offaly and in Garriskil bog SAC in County Westmeath.  Some 1,500 peat dams have been inserted, blocking some 16,000 m of open drains.  Restoration works are currently under way on three other SAC LIFE sites, namely: Carrownagappul bog SAC in County Galway; Ardnagullion bog SAC in County Longford and Moyclare bog SAC in County Offaly.  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is undertaking restoration works on State-owned lands within the protected raised bog network.  Restoration measures on State-owned lands were completed last year on two raised bog special areas of conservation, Kilsallagh bog in County Galway and Drumalough bog in County Roscommon.</p> <p>  The Department worked in partnership with Coillte to complete some of the restoration measures.  In addition, it liaises with Bord na M&oacute;na on the restoration and rehabilitation plans of that company.  Further restoration works on State-owned lands are planned to be undertaken in 2019 on a number of raised bog protected sites.  Landowners and other stakeholders are notified in writing in advance of the commencement of restoration works on land in State ownership.  All restoration works are being undertaken in line with best practice as set out in the guidance document, Best Practice in Raised Bog Restoration in Ireland, which was published by the Department in 2017.  As well as the LIFE project and restoration works on State-owned land in protected sites, between 2018 and 2019, the Department expects to invest around &euro;300,000 in community engagement projects.  This is in addition to the, on average, &euro;4.46 million per annum paid to turf cutters under the compensation initiative to conserve raised bogs.</p> <p>  Given the significance of Ireland's raised bog resource at an international level, conserving the best examples of our peatland habitats is, of itself, something Ireland should be doing.  It also fulfils Ireland's commitments under the EU habitats directive.  It will also have benefits for Ireland's commitments under international climate change targets by improving the carbon flux or balance, particularly in relation to carbon dioxide, methane and dissolved organic carbon in water and by providing a host of other ecosystem services such as flood attenuation, water regulation, amenity value and biodiversity.  Irish peatlands are a significant carbon store, containing more than 75% of all the national soil organic carbon.</p><p>On average, peatlands are estimated to hold about 1,500 tonnes of soil carbon per hectare, i.e., about ten times as much as a typical mineral soil.  Functioning peatlands capture, sequester, carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  When peatlands are drained or damaged, the peat oxidises and the carbon is released back to the atmosphere.  Peat oxidation can be stopped or reduced through the restoration of sites and hydrological management measures.  The least damaged Irish peatlands may actively sequester on average 57,402 tonnes of carbon per year over the whole country.  These are mostly bogs that have been selected for nature conservation purposes.  </p><p> The Department is working closely with other Departments and agencies to consider further the role wetlands restoration and rehabilitation can play in achieving the objectives of the 2017 national mitigation plan and potential synergies with other environment-led schemes.  A working group, including representatives from the Department, has been established by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to formulate how accounting for managed wetlands can be achieved in the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and in compliance with the relevant EU legislation.  I thank the members of the committee for their attention; we would be happy to try to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

I have been working on the conservation and restoration of peatlands since 1996.  I am joined by my colleague Stuart Conaty, land and property manager at Bord na M&oacute;na.  We thank the committee for inviting us here.  In light of the time, I will reduce some of the paragraphs of my statement so I invite witnesses to delve into it for all the detail required.</p> <p>  Peatlands are specialised ecosystems comprising a range of habitats and species leading them to being complex and unique areas of high biodiversity.  Peatlands are wetlands and when presented in a relatively natural state, provide a range of ecosystem goods and services.  In the late 1960s, Bord na M&oacute;na has recognised the value of bogs as habitats for indigenous plant and animal species.  This led to the purchase of a number of sites purely for the conservation of raised bog and fen habitat as well as blanket bogs in the west of Ireland.  </p> <p>  With the focus of the company clearly set on decarbonisation and the short timeframe for continued peat production, the company looks forward to working and collaborating for the significant benefits of peatland conservation, restoration and rehabilitation locally, nationally and internationally.  With that in mind, those remaining near-intact bog areas within the company's holdings - in the region of 4,000 ha of degraded raised bog capable of regeneration - are earmarked for conservation and the necessary restoration works to reverse the impacts of drainage.  These bogs will play an important role in the national peatland strategy and the conservation of active raised bogs in particular under the EU habitats directive.  Iconic species such as curlew and red grouse are using these bogs and their future management will be critical to sustaining these remnant breeding populations.  </p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has applied machines full-time to the restoration of this nationally and internationally recognised habitat.  To date, we have restored 2,000 ha of raised bogs and a further 2,000 ha are in the process of restoration.  These bogs are earmarked by the NPWS for designation to replace other special areas of conservation-natural heritage area sites that have been degraded since the time of designation by ongoing turf cutting in the margins.  This includes well known sites such as Abbeyleix Bog, Ballydangan Bog and the Clonboley-Killeglan group in County Roscommon.  </p> <p>  With regard to the remaining Bord na M&oacute;na lands, I will further discuss the nature of these areas against the backdrop of the wider national peatland resource.  Over the past centuries, peatlands were used for afforestation and drainage for agriculture in the 1900s.  According to the latest research on mapping peatlands from Dr. John Connolly of DCU, peatlands account for approximately 20% of total Irish land cover with 66% of those converted to other land use, including agriculture at 27%; forestry at 35%; and industrial peat, or active peat fields, production at 4%.  A further 20% of the national peatland cover is considered degraded leaving few remaining unmodified examples of the original peatlands.  </p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is the custodian of 80,000 ha of peatland in Ireland.  The company was established in the 1930s with the remit to use our natural resources to provide energy security for the new State and to support employment.  Since then, we have continued to do so - harvesting peat annually for energy and horticulture with small amounts harvested for animal bedding.  In 2018, the company CEO, Tom Donnellan, announced that peat for energy will be significantly scaled down as part of the company's decarbonisation strategy with limited continued production for horticulture.  The company is growing strong renewable energy and resource recovery businesses and developing other commercial options as part of its ongoing remit to provide employment in the midlands.</p> <p>  Of those 80, 000 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na peatland, approximately 50% is related to peat production, of which half consists of peat production fields.  A total of 15% comprises undeveloped margins, including bog remnants, areas birch, etc., while 5% is under forest cover and 30% falls into the category of cutaway bogs or bogs depleted of commercially viable peat resource.  When Bord na M&oacute;na was established, the view was held at Government and management level that once the commercial peat was extracted, the bogs could be converted to productive growing land.  Despite significant efforts that continue today, the bogs have proved to be largely inhospitable areas for crop establishment and growth.  That includes forestry, grassland, tillage and food.  We have discussed that at other Oireachtas committee sittings.  Some biomass trials continue on parcels of land in areas where we can manage those areas to establish willow and other biomass species.  This is in support of replacing peat with biomass in the peat-fired stations.  </p> <p>  Since the 1990s, larger areas of bog have been emerging as cutaway and the company has been working to rehabilitate these cutaway bogs to develop replacement wet peatland systems, i.e., wetlands and wet woodland systems, that can provide a range of ecosystem goods and services other than the traditional use for peat and-or land for agriculture and forestry.  The best example of extensive rehabilitation is the Lough Boora Discovery Park in County Offaly.  The rehabilitation work began in the 1990s and work is still ongoing at the margins of this extensive bog complex which stretches over 3,000 ha.  This former bare production landscape is now home to a documented 1,000 plus peatland species.  The mosaic of wetland and woodland habitats found there represents a range of ecosystem goods and services, most notably, space for walking and enjoyment of the outdoor for all levels of human ability.  It should be noted that these replacement peatland habitats are not akin to the former raised bog ecosystems that pre-dated peat production.  They do, however, comprise poor fen, rich fen, wet grassland, reedswamp, open water and wet birch woodland - all habitats that were present prior to the formation and that led to the formation of the great bogs.    </p> <p>  Where we can restore recognised raised bogs systems, we will continue to do so, as highlighted already.  The rehabilitation of the Oweninny Bogs in County Mayo has involved the re-wetting of up to 6,500 ha of industrial cutaway blanket bog that have now shown to be reverting to diverse peatland ecosystems as well as switching already from carbon sources to healthy carbon sinks.  </p> <p>  Once peat production is stopped in an area, or in the lead up to that time, the Bord na M&oacute;na rehabilitation approach involves establishing a detailed baseline ecology and drainage map of the cutaway bog followed by targeted internal field drain blocking and management of external outfalls.</p><p>The methods have been developed over 30 years of rehabilitation activities, working with local community groups, NGOs, including the Irish Peatland Conservation Council and the Irish Wildlife Trust, and statutory bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and local authorities.  To date, 15,000 ha of cutaway bog have been rehabilitated using this approach, with 5,000 ha in active rehabilitation, in the Littleton bog group.</p><p> Bord na M&oacute;na has highlighted that peat production will cease over a large part of its lands by the mid-2020s as peat burning is phased out.  In the interim, rehabilitation measures will continue to be carried out with the focus on re-wetting and rehabilitation of the cutaway areas in line with national policy such as the national biodiversity action plan, policy on climate change, and the water framework directive.  This will result in an extensive network of replacement peatland habitats, wetland and woodland systems, which will provide an expansive landscape for species and habitats otherwise marginalised by agriculture, forestry and peat production.  The new landscape also provides other ecosystem services such as water filtration or attenuation, and reduce carbon emissions from the formerly drained peat production lands.  Results from the work to date illustrate that, nationally and internationally, significant numbers of wintering birds are using the rehabilitated sites annually, and the breeding bird populations, particularly of wetland species within the sites and in surrounding areas, have also been enhanced.</p><p> We have brought copies of our biodiversity action plan, which is the main vehicle we use for consultation.  We are in the process of developing natural capital accounts for our lands.  This is using the UN environmental and economic accounting approach, and this will enable the company to demonstrate how its transition from active peat production to rehabilitated and recovering peatland systems in terms of water, climate, health and well-being can transform all our lands at this important time.</p><p> We thank members for their time.  We extend a warm invitation to them to view and explore the outcomes of our bog restoration work, as well as the fruits of the rehabilitation work at Lough Boora Discovery Park, to see at first hand what we have been endeavouring to portray in a five-minute presentation that was meant to be a ten-minute presentation.</p></speech>

I am representing the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, IPCC.</p> <p>  Peatlands are regarded as among the harshest environments on the planet because they are waterlogged all year round and species of animals and plants that grow in them need to be specially adapted to survive.  IPCC, however, says that peatlands are superheroes.  The reason is that they carry out important functions such as purifying water, sometimes mitigating flooding, and providing a home for rare plants, animals and biodiversity.  They beat nearly every other ecosystem when it comes to carbon storage.  On top of that, they are part of the cultural heritage and they have an immense recreational value.</p> <p>  IPCC contends Ireland has 275,000 ha of peatlands with conservation value, including fens, raised bogs and blanket bogs.  These are all peatlands of a kind that are rare or extinct elsewhere in Europe and the world.  The quantity of land represents 23% of the original peatland area in Ireland.  The rest has been man-modified by industrial and private peat extraction, forestry, grazing, land reclamation and other uses.</p> <p>  When Dutch peatland scientists came to Ireland in the 1980s and witnessed the extent and speed of the degradation of our peatlands, they took two steps.  The first was to encourage the formation of IPCC to campaign for the conservation of bogs and the second was to raise funds within the Netherlands to purchase three peatlands in Ireland.  Once the sites were purchased, they were donated to the Irish people as gifts with the simple message that we should conserve our peatlands while we still have pristine examples remaining.  The Dutch logic was that a peatland in pristine condition costs very little to protect and manage by comparison with a site that has been damaged and needs costly repair.  Dutch peatland managers ended up spending millions of euro trying to restore their lost heritage.</p> <p>  Despite the friendly Dutch advice, the current Irish peatland conservation scheme is not working.  We have reached the stage where we need to invest millions of euro to protect our peatlands or risk a future where a sod of turf will be a peculiar item on display in a museum cabinet.</p> <p>  Several factors have led to our present critical situation and are likely to drive certain peatland types to extinction if action is not taken.  My submission contains a number of pictures that illustrate the points I am making.  Damaging activities on designated sites occur due to inadequate regulation.  Figure 1 shows the extraction of turf using digger and hopper machinery on Slieve Tooey SAC in County Donegal.  Figure 2 depicts something that just happened over Christmas 2018, that is, not enforcing planning law, which allows developers to drain peatland for horticultural peat extraction such as at Doolistown Bog in County Meath.  This is occurring as we speak.  The third point I want to highlight is the provision of permission for a wind farm development within the Lough Derryduff-west of Ardara blanket bog SAC in County Donegal.  Figure 3 shows an aerial photograph of the intact blanket bog where the development was given permission.</p> <p>  On wind farms, IPCC have analysed ten years of its work on wind farm applications.  We are at a loss to know why, in all that time, a county council has never cited the intrinsic value of the peatland and its habitat as a reason for objecting to a wind farm development.  That tells us something about awareness of this issue.</p> <p>  The second significant point I want to make is that the lack of management of sites that have been designated is causing degradation to continue and this, in turn, is driving habitat and species losses.  The NPWS reports describe the peatland habitats as drying, shrinking, cracking, slumping and eroding.  Its Status of EU Protected Habitats and Species in Ireland reports from 2007 and 2013 shows that within the array of peatland sites, the status of bogs changed from bad to increasingly bad over the six-year period covered.  Figure 4 of our submission, which is from the report, shows raised bogs affected by the lack of consultation on restoration plans.</p> <p>  Owing to a lack of consultation on all the plans, etc., that have been written, we are still not able to get down to the process of managing all the sites.  That is facilitating further loss because the habitats are degrading as we speak.  Species such as curlew and large heath butterfly are at risk.</p> <p>  The final point I want to make is that the unprecedented delays in designating fens, raised bogs and blanket bog sites, engaging with the landowners involved and setting conservation targets for these ecosystems means that sites cannot be protected from damaging activities, nor can restoration begin.  This is perpetuating loss.  This seems to be due lack of Government commitment, a lack of personnel and inadequate funding.</p> <p>  What can we do to stop the loss of our peatlands?  On the positive side, the peatlands strategy and a raised bog management plan are in place.  Some communities are engaged in the process of managing sites, and a considerable body of knowledge and research is available about how peatlands work.  On the other hand, progress is constrained by the need for more staff in the NPWS to conduct surveys, consult landowners, set conservation targets and carry out management work.</p><p>Of course, we need more money to facilitate all of that. <br/><br/><b></b>The IPCC has been in existence for 37 years and our work on saving bogs is entirely funded by private individuals.  To date, we have spent &euro;4 million buying bogs, campaigning and educating children.  This must be proof, if any was needed, that there is a positive attitude among the public towards conserving peatlands but we need to commit to delivering peatland protection by engaging with people, bringing every voice into the process and being transparent in all decisions relating to the management of our conserved peatlands and peat resources generally.  This is what it will take to turn the tide and provide a future for Irish peatlands and their wildlife.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its invitation to this meeting but I feel that two groups are missing today.  The first is the largest owner of peatland in the country, namely Coillte, and the second is a large peatland user, namely the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association, TCCA.</p></speech>

The Irish Wildlife Trust, IWT, was founded in 1979 for the purpose of raising awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s unique wildlife and its importance to people, while also promoting better protection for nature through national policies and legislation.  We are a registered charity with a membership base of approximately 800 people.  We have a headquarters in Dublin along with branches in Waterford, Galway, Laois, Offaly, Kerry and Dublin.  Much of the work we do is undertaken on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>  The work of the IWT and similar organisations has become all the more pressing in recent years as the full scale of the planetary ecological crisis becomes apparent.  Scientists say that we have perhaps 12 years remaining to avert dangerous climate breakdown, while in October of last year a report from the World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London showed that 60% of large animals have disappeared from the Earth in the past 40 years.  Indeed, it is widely believed that we are in the middle of a mass extinction event, which is leading to the collapse of ecosystems and which has very uncertain consequences for us all.  This has affected Ireland as much as any other country.</p> <p>  Over many thousands of years Ireland&rsquo;s unique geography and climate has produced peatland and bog landscapes of global significance.  In historic times, they were home to a diversity of habitats and wildlife, including vast woodlands and wetlands with teeming birdlife and specialised plants.  These landscapes were also inhabited by people.  There is evidence that turf was harvested for fuel going back many hundreds, if not thousands, of years.  The IWT accepts that turf cutting for domestic use has a long cultural heritage and that people have well-established turbary rights, which should be respected.  However, we must also acknowledge that major changes have occurred in more recent decades that have had calamitous consequences for our peatlands.  It is no exaggeration to say that the raised bogs of the midlands are practically extinct.  According to the NPWS, less than 1% of the original area remains active or capable of growing peat, while no raised bog has survived intact.  The vast blanket bogs of the west and upland areas have fared little better.  Only 28% are deemed worthy of conservation and the remaining 72% have been drained for agriculture, turf extraction or are buried underneath a carpet of plantation conifers.  Even those blanket bogs within so-called protected areas such as SACs and SPAs have been subjected to overgrazing by sheep, uncontrolled fires and unregulated turf cutting, and these activities are leading to their deterioration.  Of 11 habitats on peatland listed for special protection under the EU&rsquo;s habitats directive, nine are in "bad" condition, one is "inadequate" and only one is "good", according to the NPWS.  With habitat degradation comes extinction and, according to BirdWatch Ireland, ten birds which are characteristic of peatlands are on the red list, meaning they have suffered catastrophic declines in population or breeding range, namely the golden eagle, red grouse, golden plover, dunlin, curlew, twite, whinchat, nightjar, meadow pipit and ring ouzel.  A number of other birds such as the skylark, the hen harrier and the short-eared owl are on the amber list.  The hen harrier is currently threatened with the prospect of more planting of conifer monocultures, which will destroy its habitats.  Wind turbines are being inappropriately erected on peatlands where their contribution to climate goals is likely to be less than the greenhouse gases being released by the degrading peat, while, at the same time, harming water quality and aquatic life downstream.</p> <p>  We have to acknowledge that conservation measures over the past 30 years, limited in extent and late in coming as they were, have been a colossal failure.  This has left us with serious challenges in meeting legally binding commitments on climate change, water quality and nature preservation.  More important than that, it is a tragic loss of heritage that today we cannot show our children what a healthy bog looks like.  It is a legacy for which few will thank us.  </p> <p>  The national peatlands strategy was published in 2015 and set out to comprehensively map a path towards the wise management of all our peatland areas.  It set out a path towards meeting conservation aims as well as the many other competing interests.  In our view, it failed to deal in a meaningful way with existing forestry plantations or upland farming but the IWT was broadly supportive of the strategy.  However, its implementation to date has been most disappointing.  While authorities were quick to de-designate 46 NHAs which were identified in the 1970s as being nationally unique for their biodiversity value, we have yet to see even the list of proposed new NHAs that were supposed to replace them.  We have seen no progress towards setting conservation objectives for blanket bogs and promised management plans have not materialised.  The NPWS committed to finding a way of accommodating turf cutters while ensuring conservation objectives in these areas could be met but we are no wiser in 2019 as to how this can be achieved.  Meanwhile, turf cutting and habitat loss continues.</p> <p>  The strategy committed-----</p></speech>

Hopefully it will secure the future of these special places.  We also commend the restoration efforts being undertaken at 12 of our raised bog SACs by the Living Bog Project and the CANN project, a &euro;9.4 million cross-border environment project, which aims to improve the condition of blanket bog habitats and to support priority species found at 25 EU designated SACs across Northern Ireland, the Border region and western Scotland.  We are encouraged by European Innovation Partnerships, EIPs, being run by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one of which is working with scientists and farmers in upland areas with the aim of restoring the hen harrier population in SPAs.  The community of Abbeyleix, County Laois has undertaken a remarkable project to rescue and restore their local bog, something which has been championed by President Higgins.  We would also like to commend the work of the Bord na M&oacute;na ecology team which has been working on the restoration of 15,000 ha of industrial cut-away bog.  The Lough Boora parklands in County Offaly show that large-scale ecological restoration is not only technically feasible but can also be popular with local communities while stimulating small scale sustainable enterprises.  Despite this, many communities remain in the dark as to what the future of their local area holds.  The IWT would like to see the ecological restoration of all of Bord na M&oacute;na's 80,000 ha landholding but we are keen also that local communities will be central to the decision-making process.  We have been told by local community groups that plans for a Shannon wilderness park have been stymied by lack of engagement from Bord na M&oacute;na and the drive for wind farms, which are unwanted by local communities.</p> <p>  Although the current state of our peatlands is not good, there remains an incredible opportunity if the right policies are put in place.  Fixing these important ecosystems can help us to clean our water, lock up carbon, regulate flooding, stimulate local economies and restore wildlife populations.  The IWT would like new solutions for upland farmers so they can make a good living while protecting nature.  We would like Coillte to convert its plantations to native woodlands or, where appropriate, to restore blanket bog habitats.  We would like Bord na M&oacute;na to be repurposed so that the midlands could be home to one of Europe&rsquo;s largest landscape and nature restoration projects.  There is an urgent need for the peatlands strategy to be energetically implemented.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Service should be leading an education drive to show people the wonders of our peatland wildlife.  To date, unfortunately, we have not seen the level of vision or enthusiasm required to meet these goals.  A cloud of neglect and apathy has smothered the natural world.  It is a terrible legacy that we are leaving to the next generation.  It does not have to be this way.  Legislators such as the committee members have the power to take action and give our children a brighter future.</p></speech>

What consideration is being given to these 500 people who have lost or are about to lose their jobs?  All Bord na M&oacute;na turf cutting is to cease by 2025 or 2026.  What provision is being made for jobs for these people, since there is still peat to be had and a need for it for people who use it to heat houses?  The other concern that I have is about blocking drains, raising water levels and going back in history.  In a place called Gneeveguilla, the bog moved, covered houses and did away with a whole community.  One child who had gone three miles to a neighbour's house survived.  That was a terrible tragedy.  How sure are we that something like this will not happen in the future?  Are we infringing on neighbouring landowners' farms?  If the level of water in one place is raised, it will surely be raised upstream if the water cannot get down to a certain level.  Will we cause problems for neighbouring landowners?</p> <p>  My other question relates to the hen harrier and designation of lands.  Where I come from, farmers have no problem with designations of hen harriers or any others if they are properly compensated for neutralising and making their lands worthless.  It is fine for anyone to say we should promote the hen harrier or other ecosystems, but they do not give consideration to people's fortunes, how they will keep going and provide for their wives or families, send them to college like everyone else, and put food on the table.  These ideas are all very grand.  We are listening to people saying we cannot eat meat, must ride bicycles and cannot have a pint.  Now we cannot heat our homes and must remain cold.  The only facility many people have for heating is to cut turf to keep themselves warm for the winter.  Generations have lived this way.  It is fine for people to make suggestions that it cannot be done any more but alternative, economical suggestions must be provided to the people trying to live in rural Ireland who are affected by these sometimes ridiculous suggestions.</p></speech>

We are conscious of the mandate from Government.  That mandate is first and foremost to create sustainable employment in the midlands and to support Government strategy and policy.  We have known of this transition for some time.  We have plans in place.  We developed our first wind farm in 1992.  We invested in a new business in resource recovery in 2007.  While the situation is now urgent, we are cognisant of the impact that the transition can have on employees and on the wider economy of the midlands.  We are actively looking to bring sustainable economic activity to those areas.  We believe we can do that in a way that is consistent with managing and living up to our obligations with regard to biodiversity.  We see a consistency in the type of commercial developments.  We are a commercial semi-State body.  We need to be commercial.  We will do so to support jobs in the midlands and to protect and enhance biodiversity as much as possible.  My colleague might answer the question with regard to flooding.</p></speech>

To facilitate milled peat production, when working with peatland systems, one has to dig drains to dry the peat.  We have an extensive network of field drains within our bog units.  Our aim is not to flood the bogs but to raise the water level to the peat's surface.  Within the topography of the cutaway bogs, there will always be depressions, so we inevitably get a mix of open water.  In other areas, this is just to bring the water level back to the peat's surface to encourage the establishment of those peatland species that are the target species that we want back on sites.</p> <p>  Our rehabilitation is generally done on a three-phase basis.  Before anything else, we do a flood risk assessment which looks at water levels.  As Deputy Healy-Rae rightly said, many of the drainage works on Bord na M&oacute;na lands have facilitated development of agricultural lands around Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  We carry out a flood risk assessment to see what will happen when we block the field drains.  The three phases are to look at internal field drains and slow down water movement within the peatland to trap water on site to stop the summer drying and to facilitate the establishment of vegetation.  After two to five years, the potential for blocking outfalls of the bog is assessed.  After that, we look at whether everything is okay.  At each of those phases, we have ongoing consultation with the communities and people on the edges of the bog.  It involves talking to farmers if they have concerns.  This is one of the ongoing activities in Littleton.  If we are doing any real wetting, we have to walk the land and ensure that people's concerns are heard.  We consider the roads adjoining the land.  All of that is combined with monitoring.  Sometimes the bog presents surprises.  In our history of rehabilitation of 20,000 ha, we have dealt with any surprises and have not had negative impacts on surrounding land.  That is to alleviate concerns in that respect.</p></speech>

There was an announcement on job losses and, unfortunately, there will be job losses among our colleagues.  This is something we are working through and we have an ongoing transition programme.  People will come out of jobs in the near future.  The company has engaged in a detailed support facility for our employees to look at other opportunities and upskilling.  We have a programme of benefits and facilities for employees.  This is something that is ongoing.  It is not a case that there will be a sudden closing of the gates and people will no longer be employed.  It is a more gradual process, albeit over a period of months, during which we will see, unfortunately, a significant number of people departing.  The company is giving them every support it can.  The key consideration for Bord na M&oacute;na is we must look at the wider midlands community and its economy.  We are actively looking at other opportunities to try to provide further, different and more sustainable employment for the people of the midlands.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Lucas.  I would like clarification because a damning allegation was made about someone engaging in illegal digging and hopper turf cutting on Slieve Tooey in Donegal.  This is a blanket bog in Donegal and not one of the 53 bogs listed.

Bord na M&oacute;na has been doing work on several bogs throughout the country.  It speaks about preserving bogs.  It is looking at Daingean where it has done a lot of work.  In the midlands it has made an application for wind turbines near Mount Dillon.  This will involve digging out a lot of bog and putting in roadways.  How is this going on when Bord na M&oacute;na speaks about conservation?  With regard to consultation, Bord na M&oacute;na is working on Attymon bog.  Farmers in the area have told me there has been no consultation with them with regard to bogs or land.  I have sent an email to Bord na M&oacute;na to ask it to engage with people in the area.</p> <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae raised the issue of the 450 jobs.  I believe there will be redundancies as I do not see any plan for other jobs.</p> <p>  In its land division, or its move from the west to put it bluntly, there will be no jobs west of the Shannon in producing peat for Bord na M&oacute;na.  With regard to the restoration of bogs, would it not have been a good idea to hold onto people in Derryfadda and other such areas who have had great expertise with machinery over the years?  Anyone who worked on a bog was driving machines.  Would it not be advisable to give them priority, even if it took only two or three years, and give them redundancy after that or they could get another job?  From my understanding, no headway is being made in the tonnage of willow and it will take seven years for the fish project.  There is no immediate rainbow on the horizon with regard to jobs for these workers, particularly in rural areas.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree we have moved to speaking about climate change and various issues but the habitats directive was the reason the 53 bogs were closed?  They were closed to preserve them because parts of Europe, as Dr. O'Connell rightly pointed out, had dug away all they had.  I want clarification on this.</p> <p>  I would also like the witnesses to comment on my next point.  We are at a stage whereby no problem in this country will be solved, whether the witnesses like it or not, unless they bring the landowners and communities with them.  Dr. Farrell spoke about 80,000 ha belonging to Bord na M&oacute;na but many private people have turbary rights or ownership of the bog.  In fairness to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, over the past two or three years, Mr. Lucas has tried to get relocation sites as close as possible for people.</p><p>I should clarify that I am chairman of the TCCA.  It is acceptable to move people from A to B, to where there is high-quality turf nearby, such as four or five miles away.  They are working on that.  </p><p> When the NPWS or other interests are trying to preserve those 53 - or 57, because a few areas, such as the River Moy, have multiple bogs - bogs, it is not helpful.  Do the witnesses agree?  Bear in mind, there could be a 3,000 acre designated bog and one might want 50 acres or 100 acres to give to the people.  Do the witnesses agree that it is not helpful to have objections being submitted?  It has been a problem particularly in Kildare in the past month or two, from what I have witnessed.  It is a problem whether people like it or not.  I own a bog in a so-called SAC, although I do not know if it is an SAC yet, as do other people around the country.  I will not leave it until I have the choice of another bog.  It is as simple as that.  If we want to solve the problem,  we must address the environmentalists who have objected and others.  If a refusal is issued every time there is an objection to move people from one of those so-called raised SAC, as they are known in parts of the country, we will not solve the problem.  It is bread and butter stuff.  The people need to be brought on board and, in fairness, the NPWS is doing that and have contracted RPS Group, for example, to review the sites.  </p><p> Allegations were made earlier about the science and it was claimed that less than 1% of the original area is available for growing peat.  What did we know we had?  Was there science to back it up?  In the 1980s, before the habitats directive was introduced in 1997, it is now estimated that our science was up to 40% wrong.  If I start doing something 40% wrong, I can never get it right.  In fairness, a full re-evaluation is being done of those bogs to establish where exactly we are going, what we can restore, what is degraded bog, what we can get going and how much active raised bog we have.  Do the witnesses agree that there should be some benefit given if one of those SACs performs well down the road?  Notwithstanding the habitats directive, if someone's bog ends up doing well, should there be a carbon credit or financial reward for it?  In fairness to the NPWS and its reweighting - and I presume Bord na M&oacute;na has done more than what I have been able to mention within the time - it is liaising with communities.  While there are problems in certain areas - there is no point in saying there are not - the NPWS is liaising with communities as much as possible.</p><p> Mr. Fogarty referred to sheep.  Farmers farmed the way they had to farm over the years.  There was a destocking of sheep on mountains and, as he noted, sheep destroyed the mountain.  That part of it is being addressed.  Is it fair that a farmer in Connemara, on a hill in Sligo or in Donegal who has a few cows or sheep on the side of a mountain and wants to erect new stakes must apply for planning permission?  I think it is wrong.  Under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's regulations, the farmer is obliged to prevent his or her cattle from mixing but is not allowed to erect a fence.  There are certain matters that the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht needs to get to grips with.  If there used to be a fence, a fence should be allowed to be put up.  We are putting people in their land through a type of torture in respect of planning permission, and then some genius will object.</p><p> On the raised bogs, Dr. O'Connell referred to the Dutch, and she is correct, as Queen Beatrix has a connection to Irish bogs.  The Dutch are mighty; they cut all their bogs away.  Is that not correct?  They then told us what to do and what not to do.</p></speech>

They cut their own away and plenty of them were trying to tell us what we could and could not do.  They are quite entitled to buy bog wherever they want.  I do not mind where they buy it.  Nevertheless, they cut their own away first before they ever realised the value.</p> <p>  In the same country where we tell people that there are cuts of five or six hoppers for their own houses, we are telling them what they cannot do and that they are criminals.  Meanwhile, Germany, England and several other countries, including the Netherlands, take different types of milled peat for sewage systems and so on around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1080" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019020600002#J00600"><p>There are two different issues, namely, the blanket bog and the raised bog.  I will address the former first.  If I remember correctly, quite a large area of blanket bog is designated SAC or NHA.  The level of turf cutting that takes place in the blanket bog does not have the same knock-on effect across the bog that the cutting of raised bog does because it tends to be much shallower and the drainage system tends to be different.  Will the witnesses confirm that?</p> <p>   What percentage of the total preserve blanket bog is domestic cutting of blanket bog?  As I recall, domestic turf cutting accounted for approximately 4% of the national total, while commercial cutting was approximately 96% of the volume cut in 1997 when we started.  Of blanket bog, how much is currently active turbary?  I have a suspicion that it will be relatively small.  </p> <p>  On the threats to the blanket bog, destocking was mentioned.  Some of the officials present might remember the initial destocking in 1997 or 1998.  We had the courage to take on what was not a popular issue.  I learnt one of my first lessons in irrationality in that process and why it is hard to make matters move forward.  The Government at the time, along with the Department, decided that the quickest way of doing a rapid destocking before we measured every bog was to take 30% of everybody's income and get on with the job immediately because Europe was putting the pressure on.  </p> <p>  I remember an extraordinary visit to Europe that taught me the danger of people making a principle out of practicalities.  We said the Government was willing to compensate farmers through Exchequer funding for the loss of income.  I thought we would be told that was great and fine but instead we were told that we could not do it because it would reward the polluter.  Under the polluter pays principle, the polluter cannot be paid.  I said it would be our money and that we were not seeking any EU money because we were willing to pay the farmers.  We could not take 30% of farmers' incomes and say it did not matter.  It was their livelihood.</p><p>While we paid them, it took seven years for the Department to get permission from Europe.  I did not give a damn.  As far as I was concerned, I was not going to take the bread out of the mouths of farmers up and down the west coast.  The agenda always seems to be that we want people to take the pain, but do not want to compensate them for it.  If ecologists want to know why their agenda is not working and why they meet resistance on the ground, the practical explanation is that if professionals in Dublin were told 30% of their income had to go for the greater good, there would be a fair few thousand people at the door of Leinster House.  In this case, it was clear-cut.  We were paying.  We were not asking Europe to pay.</p><p> There is a second issue with destocking sheep.  It is an argument I have had time and time again with the Department and others.  People who are knowledgeable about sheep agree with me that Europe caused overstocking in the first place through the headage payment.  That is a simple and absolute fact.  The EU said it would pay for every ewe a farmer had even if it never had a lamb.  What could one expect farmers to do but to put more and more ewes on the hills?  If one distorts the market, one will get a distortion.  When the EU went to destocking, it left the person who knew the individual hill out of the reckoning, namely the farmer who had been doing it right in most cases until the ewe premium came in.  How to farm those hills in a sustainable way was still within their knowledge.  They had been doing it for generations until the market was completely distorted.  We brought in a lot of people who were not used to hills but who were agricultural planners and gave them the job of deciding in some empirical way how many sheep a hill could sustain.  Departmental officials know that I have always believed that the complexity of the way sheep roam the hills was not taken into account.</p><p> It would be interesting to examine bogs to find out whether I am right or wrong on the next issue that arose.  Farmers on the hills, certainly in Galway and Mayo, were encouraged greatly to engage in supplementary feeding of ewe lambs and ewes in winter.  One of the problems with that is that one could keep more ewes on the hill.  Another problem arose.  From a very young age, ewes got used to be being fed.  I do not know if anyone here has a cat, but we have one at home.  Our cat does the odd bit of roaming around the area, but it will always sit on the window sill when I get up.  The cat is cute and it knows that if it sits on the sill for long enough, I will get up for my breakfast and give it a tin of food at the back door.  Luckily, the window sill is not going to wear away.  If one does the same thing with sheep, they will congregate on the lower, softer or boggy peatlands where the food is given out.  Hey presto, despite the fact that one has destocked the hill, a significant damage is done on those peatlands.  It has nothing to do with stocking levels, but is the result of something farmers were told was good farming practice.  Tradition did not do that.  Farmers loved the hill and ensured it handled what it could.  Certain grasses that die in winter on a hill determined stocking levels in the old days.  This needs complicated, farmer-involved answers.</p><p> That brings us to the next matter, which is State policy.  At another committee, a major issue arose during the week which was well reported, notwithstanding that I did not seek any publicity.  We go on with platitudes about high-nature farming and the value of the ecology, hills, NHAs and so on.  Many hills where sheep are present are NHAs, SACs or SPAs.  I have no problem with that.  I have a problem, however, if officials will only pay the single farm payment, basic payment scheme and greening based on production, which is to say the number of sheep a farmer can keep, while cutting that number.  The officials discount as economic value completely the high-nature value of the peculiar manner in which these farmers must farm to keep a sensitive ecology in balance.  If farmers fail to do that, they will destroy what we have there.  Until we realise that a Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine refusing payments for high-nature farming is undermining the NPWS and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, there will be resistance on the ground.  Joined-up thinking is needed.  Not only that, there will be land abandonment and depopulation.  Unless we get all of those ducks in a row, it will always appear to be a them-versus-us scenario.</p><p> One my last acts as Minister was to organise a meeting in Galway to say that if we were going to have all of these designations in the west, we needed to get all of the environmental organisations down to tell us how to make a few bob out of them.  We were told those designations were so important that all the people wanted to come and look at the areas involved.  I wanted to know how to get alternative employment for the people whose bread was being taken out of their mouths.  People need a livelihood.  This debate often ignores the fact that the main custodians of all of this are the people on the ground who must also live.  There are simple remedies, but the big vested interests in Ireland do not want to apply them because their attitude is that if a farmer is on bad land, he or she should do it for the cause.  If a farmer is anywhere else in the country, he or she should get paid for doing it for the cause.</p><p> The Chairman has been indulgent, but I want to make one comment on blanket bogs.  I had an aunt who was an ecologist and botanist 50 years ago.  She warned then that the midland bogs were in danger.  When S&iacute;le de Valera designated the bogs in 1997 or 1998, we took a lot of major commercial operators out and approached Bord na M&oacute;na to say there was more to be done.  We must recognise that Bord na M&oacute;na has moved forward and we need to keep working away.  The same principle arises.  There is a population there with a right to jobs and livelihoods.  If someone takes one crust of bread out of their mouths, he or she must show me where another crust of equal value, if not more value, is to be found.  It need not be in the same type of industry.  One thing I regret, albeit it was not in my constituency, was the mistake the community made in respect of the inevitable closure of the sugar factory in Tuam.  It tried to hang onto to the sugar company whereas if the community had looked to their children and the education they were getting, they would have insisted on getting a Government office for the town with 400 jobs.  Their kids were much more likely to work in a Government office than on the production line in a sugar company.  It should not be thought that we can walk out of the midlands, leaving it as a black hole.  All one has to ask is why Offaly has won hurling and football all-Irelands.  There was a population there to do it because, simply, of Bord na M&oacute;na.</p></speech>

We have to react so as to ensure future sustainability.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said that where we stop providing one crust of bread, we need to look to provide another and we are very conscious of that.  We are actively looking at other opportunities and we have made the announcement to transition out of peat over the course of the next decade.  That gives us time to find other opportunities, such as in aquaculture and inland fisheries, and we will not waste that time.  I am not sure where the seven years come from and it is not a timeline to which we would subscribe.  A pilot aquaculture facility is in operation in County Offaly.  We have started on the process and we will do everything we can to move it forward, as we will with other opportunities.</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na is looking for 450 redundancies but the people affected will be 450 people with families who may get employment somewhere else but will be statistically unemployed from the day they take redundancy.  They say in Offaly that the year they won the all-Ireland it was because so many of them were working in that area, either with Bord na M&oacute;na or because of Bord na M&oacute;na.  There is no magic wand but, so far, there have redundancies in those areas and nothing else.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the decarbonisation policy change, from both Europe and our own Government, is something markets have been forced to react to and that has an effect on Bord na M&oacute;na as a commercial semi-State business.  We are very conscious of our mandate, to the midlands in particular, and to sustainable jobs and we are making progress with alternatives, such as with our trial aquaculture programme as well as the trial of the utilisation of cutaway bogs for the production of herbs.  We will work very hard to provide the new crust of bread for the people of the midlands over the course of the next decade.  The transition will take place over time and we will work in that period to find the alternatives to which I referred.</p></speech>

In the transition phase, we will try to ensure jobs.  As an ecologist, I would love to say there will be wetlands, woodlands and restored bogs all over the place but we have to maximise the commercial use too.  Cutaway bogs present a good opportunity for renewable energy projects.  Instead of digging out loads of peat from an intact bog or an intact blanket bog in an SAC we could locate wind farms on cutaways where the peat is more shallow, where we already have the infrastructure and which are located next to the grid.  We have to pick the right sites for wind farms and the right sites for wetlands.  We are looking to reduce peat production and to have rehabilitation and restoration, as well as renewables, all of which are part of the decarbonisation story for Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p>  I would love to meet Deputy Fitzmaurice on the bog in Attymon.  We started a process there in November and my colleague, Barry O'Loughlin has been doing great work there.  We met the local co-operative and looked at the drainage of the site.  I was there last Monday morning to make sure any work we do does not impact on adjoining lands.  Water is flowing through the site and there is great potential for rewetting the peats for the regeneration of sphagnum and peat-forming habitats.</p></speech>

I was in Cloonkeen and I am aware that a constituent of the Deputy is interested in continuing to cut turf in Attymon.  On the integrated pollution control licence, we have a remit to rehabilitate all our peatlands after peat production to stabilise the ground in which peat production occurred.  This involves drain blocking and natural processes for the regeneration of typical peatland species, or whatever species will grow to stop further erosion and, ideally, further carbon emissions.  There is a legal obligation on the EPA to do this on every site, whether the locals can see this or not.  That is how it will happen in Derryfadda, whose bogs are out of peat production and where stockpiles of relatively deep peat remain on-site.  We need to decommission the bogs by taking off rails and plastic and by working with the people on site such as Paul Quinn, who has mapped every bit of bog in the area.  We do not want to lose the expertise of people such as him because they are critical for us.  There are four ecologists on our team and when we go out to map or develop rehabilitation plans, our first port of call are the bog lads - the men who drain the bog.  If one knows how to drain a bog, one also knows how to rewet it.  I would be quite happy to meet the Deputy at Derryfadda, too, because there is a lot to be learned from rehabilitation.  All of us, including Dr. O'Connell, Mr. Fogarty, Dr. O'Keeffe and Mr. Lucas, are working together to restore and get peat formation going on those sites.</p></speech>

Studies have proved that the rewetting of bogs helps with greenhouse gas emissions and is positive in that respect.  The Government needs to look at what that means for communities.  If landowners are actively managing their land to give a benefit to the carbon-balancing exercise, we would need to look at this.  The people making the sacrifice should not have to bear the responsibility entirely on their own.  There needs to be an acknowledgement, in Government policy, of the right to compensation for people who provide this service, which is valuable to the greater economy and, indeed, the world economy.</p></speech>

The reason I say so is that with compensation, some day people will come and state they are running short of money, it is only compensation and they do not need to give it.  A payment is something for goods produced and one gets paid.  It is a subtle question but it is one to note.</p></speech>

It is getting a system where we can start looking at payment for ecosystem goods and services provided by that hill farmer for ensuring good water quality for enabling those populations of freshwater pearl mussel and the same for the farmers on the edges of the bogs who might want to get involved with the restoration and rehabilitation and be part of a future network of peatscapes, which will assist the National Parks and Wildlife Service and all of us here in reaching our targets for nature.</p></speech>

Dr. Farrell knows as well as I do that the only thing blocking us all from this is the procurement process.  There might be a guy with a small digger beside a bog who Bord na M&oacute;na might love to take on but the problem is that the company must go through all of the procurement process involving transparency and that person may not be in that system.  That is the reality on the ground, where the bigger guy is more involved the pricing and procurement area.  In the case of procurement, I have seen it with all of the contracts that have gone out.  The procurement process is gone from the small guy who, say, would be coming from doing drainage work for a farmer, cutting a bit of turf or whatever.</p></speech>

It is an important distinction that the Deputy has made.

This is something that the Government has set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government.  There is recognition that turf cutters have a right to cut turf, which is balanced on the conservation obligations on the State.  In my presentation, when I talked about the national raised bog special areas of conservation management plan, I stated it sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and, just as importantly, how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  In terms of what the Department has tried to do, we have an annual payment scheme.  Under that scheme for cessation of turf cutting on the raised bogs, we have made over 18,000 payments amounting to &euro;27 million.</p> <p>  In my job, over the years I have met turf cutter representatives and I have met turf cutters quite a number of times.  Quite a few turf cutters say that they are getting their compensation and they are reasonably happy with that.  I should not say "compensation".  They are getting their payment and they are reasonably happy with that.  I have to say I meet turf cutters who say that they just want to cut somewhere and that turf cutting has been in their family for generations and they would like to continue that tradition.  It is not only for a source of fuel, although that is an important consideration.  I meet people who say that it is part of their culture and heritage and part of their family tradition.  In the national plan, we try to recognise that.  What the Government stated in A Programme for a Partnership Government is that we will try to accommodate people in non-designated bogs where we can.  We got planning permission last year to develop two non-designated bogs for turf cutting and we hope to develop those sites this year.  We have similar sites in the process.</p> <p>  What we have said as well - we set down this in the national plan, which is a published document available from the Department's website - is we see there being annual payments and accommodation in a non-designated bog.  If that does not work for some reason, because it can be quite difficult to get a non-designated bog for turf cutting, we will try to use the habitats directive.  There is an article in the directive that allows for cutting on an SAC so long as one does not damage the integrity of the site.  That is an important point to make.  One cannot damage or degrade a raised bog.  We set out in that national plan the sites that we are looking for to see would that work as an alternative.  Therefore, it is payments, accommodation in a non-designated bog or the use of Article 6.3 of the habitats directive.</p> <p>  Conservation came up in some of the questions about the targets.  For the raised bog network for the SACs and the NHAs, the target is to get to 3,600 ha of active raised bog.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice also brought up the issue of planning permission and fencing in sites.  It is an issue that I have had landowners raise with me over the years.  Generally, fencing would be exempt from planning permission.  The issue is, as I referred earlier, activities requiring consent.  In a designated site, it could be an activity requiring consent of the Minister or of another public authority.  Were somebody to come to the Minister looking for consent, we would have to carry out an appropriate assessment screening.  If the result of the screening was that the proposal to develop or maintain the fence did not require a full appropriate assessment, the Minister then would be in a position to give consent.  If a full appropriate assessment is required, it brings that activity into the planning system and that is where planning permission may be required.  A landowner once came to me stating he had been told by a local authority that he needed planning permission to put up a fence.  When I spoke to the local authority about the case, it stated it had engaged and had offered an invitation to engage in pre-planning consultation to see whether the activity might have screened out.  Therefore, it does not necessarily mean one would need planning permission to put up a fence in a designated site.  It would require screening and the result of that screening-----</p></speech>

I will explain where problems arise in the hills.  Somebody then complained about the exemption through An Bord Plean&aacute;la in Dublin and An Bord Plean&aacute;la then gave a ruling that might have related to scenic designation, as opposed to SAC, that all those had to get planning permission.  It is nothing to do <i>per se</i>with the NPWS but it is to do with the integration of all the different systems which means that on the one hand, one is trying to keep the sheep or cattle off the road and on the other, someone is saying one must get planning permission.  It all gets messy and one side does not seem to know what the other side is doing.  We are getting these independent bodies giving us decisions and they are getting crazy results.</p></speech>

If they must go down a route of getting an appropriate assessment, screening out or whatever, that will cost money.  We are dealing with farmers who are living on less than half the average industrial wage.  Those obstacles put in front of them will bring about an Ireland in which, whether the Department wishes it or otherwise, it will not be good, that is, an Ireland where one will see a certain amount of land abandonment.  Whether we like it or not, we come from a managed landscape.  When they took the ewe or, as we saw in the Burren, the cow off the hill, it was detrimental to it.  One must work with those communities to iron out those issues.  I refer not only to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It will involve the planning authorities as well.  If people keep objecting to someone putting up a fence to keep in his or her sheep or someone who wants a relocation bog for the betterment of the overall habitats directive, one should bear in mind one still is dealing with people in their own private property.  It is like a dog, in that if one keeps pulling its tail, it will bite.</p></speech>

There is wide recognition in that regard.  Some of the really big successes in nature conservation have been in the Burren programme which started off as a live project.  We have one going in County Kerry on the pearl mussel.  We had AranLIFE, which was finished a few months ago and is being replaced under the EIP scheme.  All of those projects are about harvesting the farm knowledge of the landowner and using it to get to where we want to get to and, going back to the point made about compensation versus payment, paying them for the service they provide.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we recognised that blanket bogs were generally more tolerant of limited cutting.  We do.  It depends on issues such as topography.  Sliabh Tooey was mentioned.  There was a serious landslide a few years ago.  It followed on immediately from sausage-machine cutting along the slope.</p></speech>

Work we have done based on aerial photography indicates that cutting has had little impact on a very substantial proportion of the blanket bog network.</p></speech>

Ireland's approach to conservation has been a disaster.  It certainly has not benefited nature conservation and the Deputy can attest that it has not benefited people living in the areas in question either.  The examples we have where nature conservation works are where local people and communities work with scientists and State agencies.  When they all come together, we have success.  However, it requires considerable work, political leadership and money.  None of these things has ever been granted to nature conservation because it is not seen as a political priority.  That is the root cause of all of the issues.  We need proper leadership and proper funding of agencies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service that can come up with management plans and engage in consultation with the people who live in the areas in question.  That is what should happen in the future.</p></speech>

There are two parts to the meeting.  In the first we will consider the heads of the Miscellaneous Provisions (Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019 insofar as they relate to transport, tourism and sport.  In the second part we will focus on the preparations for Brexit and its impact on the transport sector in Ireland, particularly in the event that there is a no-deal scenario.  Once we have finished with the heads of Bill, we will take a short break.</p> <p>  To address a query I received, the process at the committee is that we take questions from all members of the committee first.  Other Members are then welcome to come in and make contributions.</p></speech>

Could we take the heads of Bill, the briefing note and the Minister's statement together in order that we could ask all of our questions together, rather than divide up the session?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#C00200"><p>I am here to assist in the consideration of the general scheme for Parts 9 and 10 of the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill.  The general scheme was approved by Government for publication and has been submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in the Office of the Attorney General for formal drafting.  This Bill is commonly known as the Brexit omnibus Bill.</p> <p>  Before proceeding to consider the draft general scheme, it is important to recall some of the core principles set out in the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement.  The protocol is aimed at protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the important gains of the peace process, by underpinning continuing North-South co-operation, by guaranteeing that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland, and by protecting the all-island economy.  All this provides a critical backdrop to the discussion we will have here about the rail and bus parts of the Brexit omnibus Bill.</p> <p>  These rail and bus parts form part of our contingency planning arrangements.  We are all aware of the strategic importance of keeping channels open and maintaining ease in flows and linkages between people, communities and businesses across the Border.  Public transport provision is an important component, especially when we recall the symbolism of the Enterprise, a well-used rail service linking Dublin and Belfast daily.  Bus services are also key in linking communities.  Parts 9 and 10 of the omnibus Bill were developed to help ensure the continuation of the Enterprise and cross-Border bus services under future scenarios.  I am grateful for the support these parts have received so far.  I trust that we can continue to work together to advance the necessary legislation.</p> <p>  These parts set out the changes proposed in primary legislation to cover the future continuation of rail and bus services between Ireland and the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The committee will agree that the regulatory framework applying and the provision of rail and bus services operating in this country are of the highest standard.  This will not change.  However, post Brexit, the UK's changed status from member state to third country will mean that rail and bus services between Ireland and the UK will need to be managed under slightly different legislative arrangements.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, there is a need to consider the appropriate legislative basis to allow for rail and bus services between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, given the new context where the UK is no longer a member state of the EU.  As members will be aware, we need to make a small number of amendments to legislation to facilitate the running of public transport services into and out of a third country.</p> <p>  These proposed legislative changes will provide for the operation of cross-border rail services, principally the Enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line, and the operation of bus and coach services between Ireland and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.  My Department has engaged with stakeholders, including public transport operators, the Commission for Railway Regulation and the National Transport Authority, NTA, as well as with the European Commission.  These discussions have served to underline the importance of consistently complying with EU law while exploring and searching for pragmatic solutions to address new scenarios.  Some issues are being considered at an operational level and practical answers may emerge at different levels.  While it is clear that providing necessary underpinning legislation for new scenarios is an important step, it has also become obvious that other stakeholders have roles to play in progressing this critical agenda.  My Department will continue its engagement and oversight to help ensure that any necessary contingency plans are agreed and advanced.</p> <p>  I will speak for a few minutes on each of these parts, starting with bus and coach services.  Part 10 addresses bus and coach services.  A significant number of cross-Border bus and coach services support the needs of businesses and the surrounding communities.  These will rely on provision being made for the future continuation of cross-Border services once the UK leaves the EU.  I am advised that daily, between Monday and Friday, more than 300 cross-Border bus journeys are authorised by the NTA.  These services range from daily regular services to Local Link services.  They are operated by both private and public companies.  This figure does not take into account the occasional journeys which capture the once-off community-related bus and coach services.  These would include instances such as a GAA or rugby club near Clones, for example, which brings a team to participate in a Saturday morning blitz taking place across the Border.  In total, the number of cross-Border passenger journeys in 2017 is estimated at just under 2 million.  Members will agree that a significant number of people are relying on us to ensure continuity of service and to continue to take steps to ensure the highest safety and quality of service standards are maintained.</p> <p>  Legislative changes will be needed to allow for the future continuation of bus and coach services between Ireland and the UK as a third country.  Following Brexit, Ireland will be allowed under EU law to enter into a bilateral agreement with the UK for bus and coach services, as long as no existing bus agreement exists between the UK and the EU.  It is anticipated that Ireland will need such a bilateral agreement to allow public passenger bus services to cross the Border.  The heads in Part 10 will lay out the rules so that a competent authority may regulate services to and from a third country.  Those rules would then be considered as a backdrop once Ireland begins formal negotiations on a bilateral agreement for buses with the UK.</p> <p>  The NTA is currently Ireland's competent authority for regulating bus services with other member states.  These heads will make the NTA the competent authority to similarly regulate bus services between Ireland and third countries.  Similar to rail, the intention of this part is to maintain the strong regulatory regime that exists for the purposes of bus and coach services between Ireland and the UK.  The heads in Part 10 propose amendments to the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  Engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the bus heads has commenced.  It may well be that further amendments will be identified as needed.  For example, it is possible that there will also be a need to reference the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to expand the statutory functions of the NTA.</p> <p>  With regard to rail, the heads proposed would provide in statute that a bilateral or cross-Border rail agreement may be entered into to facilitate continuity of the daily Enterprise rail services running from Ireland into a state that is no longer an EU member state.  Article 14 of EU Directive 2012/34 sets down provisions on making a cross-border rail agreement between an EU member state and a third country.  The rail heads in the general scheme provide powers for the Minister to make a bilateral agreement and provide for the Minister to make regulations.</p> <p>  I highlight for committee members that discussions between the Department and the Parliamentary Counsel regarding these provisions are ongoing.  When engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding formal drafting of these rail provisions commenced, some matters came to light which required further consideration and legal advice.  Analysis is ongoing with a view to establishing whether these rail provisions are best made in the form of primary legislation or whether secondary legislation might be more appropriate.  Given the high priority attached to all Brexit-related legislation, we are deeply engaged to determine this.  Pending that, work is also taking place on the development of draft secondary legislation to address the contingency that a statutory instrument may also be required to supplement the provisions in the current heads relating to rail.</p><p>Our main goal here is to ensure that an appropriate safety regulatory regime can apply in the case of rail services into the North post Brexit.  I am committed to maintaining the same level of safety as currently applies to the now EU-regulated cross-Border rail services from Dublin to Belfast.  As I said earlier, it is evident that the Enterprise rail line is recognised as a symbolic and strategic cross-Border corridor, a key link between North and South.  Legislation is one of the important building blocks as we aim to ensure that this important rail service continues.  However, I can assure the committee that a range of measures are under consideration in the context of wider contingency plans.</p><p> The intention of these parts in the omnibus Bill is to provide robust primary legislation which in the event of a disorderly exit will help ensure the future continuation of rail and bus services between Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as between Ireland and Great Britain.  As I have said, given the Brexit timelines my Department is giving clear priority to working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to confirm a shared understanding and to advance the drafting of this general scheme as well as any other legislative provisions which are deemed to be required, whether primary or secondary.  I thank the Chairman for inviting me to make this presentation and look forward to hearing the views of the committee and to responding to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

There is no restriction on raising any issue at all.  I personally agree with getting the heads of Bill out of the way and then dealing with other issues.  It would probably allow a more helpful and focused response from the officials as well, given their specific brief.  However, there is no problem.  Can I get a consensus?  Will we discuss the heads of the Bill first?</p></speech>

I have a few formal questions.  I thank the Minister for his presentation on rail and bus issues.  What will be the practical experience of people on the ground?  The Minister seemed to suggest that there can be a bilateral agreement if there is no deal on 29 March.  How long will it take to get a bilateral agreement?  What will be the experience of passengers travelling on the Enterprise line or on a bus or coach trip between Northern Ireland and the Republic on 30 March?  That is the question I would like to see answered.  I refer also to the practical implications for people.  Efforts between now and 29 March will have to deal with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#D01800"><p>I have a number of brief questions on this.  Is this the only change to the Brexit omnibus Bill that will need to be made in the area of responsibility of the Minister's Department?  This is my understanding.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong.  It is very much a technical Bill.  It is very much about the regulatory environment of rail and bus operations as we shift from being part of one Union to a situation where Northern Ireland and the UK will have third country status.  The Minister has outlined the regulatory changes that are required and will be made.  Are we any wiser about the requirements for people and goods travelling over the Border?  What checks will be put in place for people and goods?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#D01900"><p>I saw somewhere that the Minister said he had met with his counterpart, the UK Secretary of State for Transport, some months ago in Britain.  My impression was that this was the last time he had met him and that was at the Secretary of State's request.  Regarding bus and coach services, the Minister's opening statement said that Ireland will be allowed under EU law to enter into a bilateral agreement.  That bilateral agreement requires bilateral talks.  What formal bilateral talks have taken place on the agreement?  What stage are we at in finalising the bilateral agreement?  When exactly can we expect it to be in place?  Have such talks taken place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#D02000"><p>Some of my questions are similar.  Between what parties are the bilateral agreements taking place?  The Minister said in his opening statement that Ireland will begin formal negotiations on a bus bilateral with the UK.  That suggests there have been informal negotiations.  We are acutely aware that the institutions in Northern Ireland are not in place.  Has that been an issue?  I presume there were informal bilateral meetings.  Were those meetings with British Government Ministers as opposed to their Northern Ireland counterparts?  I do not see how that will work.  Has that been thought about in considerations of the transition period, assuming that there is a withdrawal agreement?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to stakeholders in his opening statement.  This is relevant in drilling down and anticipating the issues.  Were the stakeholders that were consulted exclusively in the Republic of Ireland or were Northern Ireland stakeholders consulted as well?  How did this happen?</p><p>To add to the point made by Deputy Troy about goods and whether this covers the totality of what the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will be required to cover in this legislation, do goods come under a different Department or Departments and are there other transport elements?  As I find it hard to imagine there are no transport elements, should we expect to see further legislation or an expansion of this legislation?  It is very difficult to read about Northern Ireland being a third country.  It brings the enormity of the issue into very sharp focus when one sees in black and white how gigantic the separation will be.</p></speech>

The level of work and responsibility of the Minister's Department and his colleagues is fundamental.  In actual fact, compared to some other Departments, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport carries an awful lot of the burden in helping to make the process successful because it is all about the movement of people and goods.</p> <p>  I have a document that was issued by the British Government on 21 December last entitled, Partnership pack: preparing for changes at the UK border after a no deal EU Exit.  I have read it a couple of times.  To give a sense of the enormity of the task, on page 27, it states in referring to Northern Ireland businesses importing from Ireland that "We [the British Government] would recommend that, if you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make".  To me, that begs the question of what is being done.  It is there in black and white and it is not even less than satisfactory, it is not good enough.  I make those points in the context of the significant work being done and the contribution our civil servants and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are making to try to have the process as seamless as possible.  It is important that we weigh in and support each other at this time.</p> <p>  On the movement of passengers, I agree with the Minister that we have to start to look at Northern Ireland and what the relationship will be in the movement of passengers and freight.  There is a lot in the 120 page document about freight, including border checks, custom duties, tariffs and so on.  It goes back to the point made by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Troy.  When he is feeding back information to us, perhaps the Minister might give us a sense of how it fits into the overall picture.  That would be very helpful from our perspective because some of the questions overlap.  I understand why Deputy Munster made a request earlier and this may well be part of her concerns.</p> <p>  What will the position be for passenger to the North and to the South?  What is the Minister's view on whether they will require a passport at the Border?  I am thinking of passengers on buses and trains.  Does the Minister have a sense of what the requirements will be or will just normal ID be required?  Has he discussed the matter with any third party in Northern Ireland or the rest of the United Kingdom?</p> <p>  I am very interested in getting the Minister's views on the next step to be taken, namely, a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom, which is part of the bigger picture.  At what stage is the Minister in that regard?  I understand there are significant EU requirements and that the European Union does facilitate bilateral agreements.  I also understand we have to work within its terms and conditions.</p></speech>

I presume that on the issue of safety management systems, in particular, there will be uniformity across Europe, the United Kingdom and other countries outside the European Union on transport by vehicles, be they buses or trains.  I  presume there will be convergence of the regulations.  Will there an overarching regulatory body?  That is a reasonable question to ask.  The Minister can answer the questions asked in whatever way he wishes.</p></speech>

There are two objectives, as matters stands, one of which is that in the case of the Enterprise and rail and bus services, the amount of disruption should be kept to the absolute minimum.  Talks that are ongoing have that objective in mind.  I am pretty confident that in the talks that are ongoing between my Department and the British Government and NI Railways there will be a seamless transition in a no-deal Brexit.  There is enough evidence to suggest we will be able to do so where we will be able to introduce a bilateral rail agreement at an early stage.  There is enough evidence to suggest that in the preliminary talks which are not bilateral talks but exploratory talks we will certainly reach enough agreement between the companies involved, namely, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and NI Railways, such that we will have train services running on the same basis until we can introduce a bilateral agreement which is allowed by the European Union and can be conceded to by it at a very early stage after 29 March.  It is a very fair question, but we will not see passengers being turfed out at the Border or anything like it.  That will not happen.  We will have a situation where the process will be seamless because there will be an agreement and a contract in place between the companies and because the Governments will obviously be in favour of it also.  There will be minimum disruption because of the contract arrangements.  The practical experience in both cases will be similar to what is being experienced.  That is why we are looking at rail services as a matter of urgency because the Enterprise is absolutely a key symbolic link between the North and the South.</p></speech>

Operational matters will be left to the companies in question.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked whether I had met my counterpart in the United Kingdom.  I met my UK counterpart, the Secretary of State for Transport, Mr. Chris Grayling, MP, on Brexit matters on three occasions over the past 20 months.  I met him at my request in London on 26 May 2017 to discuss the transport implications of Brexit.  I met him again at my request at the margins of the transport Council of Ministers in Brussels on 5 December 2017 and, more recently, at the British Secretary of State's request, on 8 November 2018 in Dublin.</p> <p>  With the most recent meeting, the parameters of the discussion were clearly communicated to the Secretary of State in advance, particularly the need to respect fully the mandate of the European Union's chief negotiator as negotiating for the EU 27, and that the discussion could not stray into the area of negotiations.  At that meeting on 8 November, Secretary of State Grayling outlined the key areas of concern for the UK relating to transport.  I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including with respect to ports, aviation, road transport and cross-border rail.  I stressed the importance of finalising the withdrawal agreement, highlighted the importance of the UK landbridge as a route to European markets for us and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports.  I stressed that with the future EU-UK relationship, Ireland wants to see the closest possible links between the EU and the UK across a wide area.  I can also provide the Deputy with details of meetings I have had with other transport ministers if she so wishes.</p></speech>

The EU is negotiating on our behalf and I was not at any stage negotiating with my British counterpart.  That was not my job.  Of course, I was prepared to hear what he had to say and to express some concerns that we had.  The idea that we would negotiate was absolutely out of the question.  I met other ministers and I can provide the Deputy with some details.  Again, I did not negotiate with them.</p> <p>  In November, I met my French counterpart, Ms &Eacute;lisabeth Borne, and this was very close to the date on which I met Mr. Grayling.  In May I met Professor P&eacute;ter Bal&aacute;zs, the EU co-ordinator for the North Sea-Mediterranean TEN-T corridor and Mr. Brian Simpson, the EU co-ordinator for the Motorways of the Sea programme.  Brexit was a key point on the agenda and both co-ordinators were cognisant of the unique challenges facing Ireland as a result of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  In October 2017, I met the European Transport Commissioner, Ms Violeta Bulc on a visit to Ireland and raised with her Ireland's concerns on the implications of Brexit for transport and connectivity.  I also met these people on other occasions but they were not necessarily all formal meetings.  We met at Council meetings, for example, to discuss relevant matters.  I had met Commissioner Bulc at the transport Council meeting in Luxembourg in June 2017.  In September I held a conference call with Mr. Ken Skates, the Welsh Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Infrastructure and Skills, on Brexit-related matters.</p><p>In 2017 I met the Austrian Minister for Transport, Innovation and Technology to discuss Brexit and road safety.  I also met with members of the external affairs committee of the National Assembly for Wales on matters primarily relating to Brexit.  In May 2017 I met the Swedish Minister for Infrastructure, Anna Johansson, to discuss road safety and Brexit matters.  I also met the UK Secretary of State, Lynne Truss MP.  I can keep going.</p></speech>

The date of 29 March is critical for us.  We were facing some very serious challenges in the area of aviation.  Those challenges have not been resolved, but they are certainly less threatening than they were.  I will go into that in more detail in the second part of our discussion.  We faced some very serious challenges on road haulage as well, and again, while not resolved, we have escaped the worse case scenario in that area.  I hope that will also be the case in terms of landbridge and other areas.  I am not saying that everything is conquered.  I am saying that my Department has undertaken major work, and I am proud of the results we have achieved so far.  The worst-case scenario we faced a few months ago is greatly improved.  That was not achieved by sitting back and doing absolutely nothing.  It involved much work and a lot of talking to many people.  We spoke to the stakeholders and co-operated with the European Commission.  We impressed on the European Commission, particularly in the areas of aviation and haulage, where we faced very difficult scenarios, that it was in Ireland's vital interests that we made interim arrangements.  Those interim arrangements have been achieved.</p></speech>

That is great.  Europe has done this, and it is good that it is done.  It appears the Minister has simply taken EU law and transposed it into Irish law.  That is good as well.  I am not trying to make political points.  I come from a Border area.  I want to know what preparatory work the Minister has done, beyond holding informal meetings.  I have many questions to ask on every aspect of that.  It is great the Minister had informal meetings, and that the EU legislation has been transposed into Irish law.  However, this meeting concerns preparedness, and I have seen nothing thus far to give me or my constituents comfort on what the Minister has actually done to flag up issues and formulate the basis of an agreement to be included in a bilateral agreement.

However, we have found that we have been able to negotiate this particularly difficult path in its absence and have been able to produce some very complex legislation.  There have been preliminary talks between the Irish Government, my Department and representatives in Northern Ireland.  We achieved this result on foot of those negotiations.  I do not see any major legislation coming through, but that does not mean that we will not amend this legislation if it is absolutely necessary.</p></speech>

He will deal with freight and other areas, here and in the UK.  I am obviously very interested in aviation, and I look forward to the Minister's comment on that.</p> <p>  I very much appreciate everything the Minister and his Department, in particular, are doing.  It is not easy.  It is a tough job and as was clear from the document I read from, which was produced by the British Government, it has been landed in our lap.  The Minister said that the meetings he held with his British counterpart and others were neither formal nor informal.  They were just meetings.  It was never stated that they were formal, informal, on the record or off the record.  It is important to state that, because we spent over half an hour using the phrases "formal" and "informal".  I counted five occasions on which those phrases were used before I stopped counting.  Time is important.  I am keen that we have productivity.</p></speech>

It is essential that a legislative framework is in place.</p><p>The heads of the Bill did not come out of nowhere.  It came from teasing out some practical issues and examining the document that the European Commission published.  Some of the practical issues will not need legislation but will need consideration. <br/><br/>The Minister mentioned talking to stakeholders, and I asked whether the stakeholders were exclusively in the Republic or whether some stakeholders in Northern Ireland were consulted or whether that was even viable.  I fully understand that the 27 member states are the ones which are negotiating and while there is a great value in that for the unity of the European Union, there is a negative aspect because the Government has to postpone discussions on practical matters that must be addressed to function however we end up.  Whether there is a deal or a crash-out, we will have to live with the fallout.  <br/><br/>Some parts of the Minister's opening statement say something but one would nearly have to decode what it is.  Deputy Troy asked a question about the practical issues the Minister noted may emerge.  We need to understand why the Minister even referred to practical issues.  Parts of the opening statement were written in code and we are trying to read through it to understand what will happen in practice and what preparation has gone on within the limited scope available to the Department, given that there cannot be formal negotiations in advance.  There cannot be bilateral discussions, yet there must be agreements.  We are trying to get our heads around what preparation has gone on, what discussions have taken place, which stakeholders have been consulted and what Brexit will look like in practice.  The Minister answered some of those questions when he said he expected it to be relatively seamless because people will be able to buy a ticket in Belfast, get on the train, travel to Dublin and <i>vice versa</i>.  How does the Border becoming the European frontier fit with a crash-out?  Will it cause us problems in the future?  It may not be a problem immediately but could it cause us a problem eventually?  Will the legislation be sufficient to cover those areas or will more be needed?</p></speech>

Will that also apply to bus companies?  Is that part of the issue of practicality?  In the event of a no-deal scenario, will people be required to prove their insurance, whether in a bus, car, coach or whatever?</p></speech>

There is intensive ongoing engagement between the rail operators, Irish Rail and Northern Irish Railways, which have always had a contract with each other.  They are still in communication on the basis of that contract and they are considering a subcontracted solution on a temporary basis to overcome any temporary difficulties.  We anticipate an agreement will be reached and that there will be a bilateral agreement after 29 March.  It is a matter of keeping Enterprise and bus services going, and we will do everything we can to achieve that.  We do not foresee any insuperable obstacles but we recognise that there are difficulties.  That is why we are talking to stakeholders, which are currently Irish Rail and Northern Irish Railways, but everybody else will be involved under the legislation we addressed earlier, including the NTA as a regulator and the Minister for Finance, who will also make some regulations.  Furthermore, Departments, North and South, are in discussion, although it is important to make clear that they are not negotiating.  There is no negotiation taking place but rather there is a contract.</p> <p>  On the question about insurance and the green card, the UK currently comes within the ambit of the EU motor insurance directive, which allows all motor vehicles from member states to travel within the Union without carrying special documentation to prove that they have insurance.  If there is a no-deal Brexit, Irish-registered vehicles entering UK territory, including Northern Ireland, will be required to carry a green card, a document which proves that they have motor insurance.  Similarly, UK citizens wishing to take their UK-registered motor vehicles into Ireland will also require a green card.  In preparation for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and the motor insurance firms in the State have been preparing for the issuing of green cards on request from an as yet unspecified date in March.  The MIBI has issued public statements to this effect and the Association of British Insurers has issued similar public information.  It is a prudent measure; while no one wants green cards to be required, the insurance industry needs to be prepared for the possibility that they will be.</p></speech>

While I acknowledge that people living in west Cork might not cross the Border very often, those of us living in Border counties certainly will.  It is important, therefore, that people living in Border counties be automatically issued with one because they cross the Border day in, day out.  Otherwise, there will be delays on private business or commercial business.  It could be a significant adverse issue if it is not made mandatory before that date.</p></speech>

I do not know if we are waiting until the eleventh hour to deal with this but the 34,000 people who cross the Border daily need to know well in advance what they need, how they apply for it, when they will receive it, what they are covered for, whether it costs anything and how long will it take to get it.

There was a unified EU reaction to developments last Tuesday in Westminster.  President Tusk reiterated that the backstop is part of the withdrawal agreement and the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.  He reiterated that again today in even stronger and more colourful terms.  In a debate held by the European Parliament the following day, President Juncker emphasised that the withdrawal agreement was the best and only deal possible.  He said the Commission would continue to support member states&rsquo; work on preparedness.  Michel Barnier repeated that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, would not be renegotiated and that it offers the only realistic solution to the problems created by Brexit.</p><p>The Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal from the EU is to ratify the withdrawal agreement.  My Department and indeed all Government Departments have intensively advanced their preparations and planning for a no-deal scenario given the ongoing uncertainty in the UK.  I and my Department have been fully engaged on the very wide range of Brexit related transport issues, and tourism issues, ever since the UK invoked Article 50.  This includes working closely with other Departments and EU member states, meeting and working with the European Commission, and participating in technical EU level meetings in the area of transport.  Stakeholder engagement has also formed a very important part of our preparations and contingency planning.  I have met a number of my EU counterparts over the past two years, including recently my French opposite number, with whom I share many concerns.  I have also met the UK Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, on a number of occasions and most recently late last year, as I said during the earlier session today.</p><p>I cannot emphasise enough that it would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the almost seamless arrangements between the EU and UK currently facilitated by our common EU membership.  If the UK becomes a third country on 29 March without having ratified the withdrawal agreement with the EU, a very wide range of EU rules in the field of air, road, rail and maritime transport will no longer apply to the UK.  Of course, if the withdrawal agreement is ratified before 29 March, many of the preparations and contingency measures that I am about to detail will not be required.</p><p>We have already spent the first portion of this afternoon discussing cross-Border rail and bus services.  While there are many other Brexit implications for the transport sector, I will focus this statement on the other key risks that have been identified in a no-deal scenario.  These are our continued aviation connectivity; the ability of our international road haulage sector to move to and through the UK; the potential impacts on our ports and airports as a result of the significant increase in the control requirements of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and HSE, and the Revenue Commissioners to carry out checks on imports at ports once the UK becomes a third country; and the impact on the UK landbridge.  We identified our issues early on and have been preparing for a no-deal scenario in parallel with our preparations for the central case scenario.  We have made significant progress in recent weeks on some of our biggest and most serious challenges.</p><p>Ireland is heavily dependent on aviation links with the UK for trade and tourism.  Some 44% of all flights to or from Ireland, approximately 113,000 flights a year, are to or from the UK.  The sector contributes more than &euro;4 billion directly to Ireland&rsquo;s GDP.  The tourism sector is critically reliant on aviation connectivity and spending by overseas visitors is approximately &euro;5 billion, of which just over &euro;1 billion is from visitors from Great Britain.  Ireland would therefore be uniquely exposed by a no-deal scenario due to our heavy reliance on the Ireland-UK air transport market.  Ireland along with a number of other member states strongly made the case to the European Commission for action at EU level to ensure continuity of air services in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The European Commission last year put forward a draft legislative proposal aimed at ensuring basic air connectivity in a no-deal scenario.  This proposal is progressing through the Article 50 working party and will ensure continued air access between the EU 27 member states and the UK.  It is drafted on the basis that the UK will reciprocate the level of services, albeit for a limited period of 12 months.  The measures proposed will, subject to reciprocity, provide a large degree of certainty to the Irish aviation sector and the travelling public.  The proposals will help to minimise disruption to air services for business, trade and tourism and have been welcomed by our key aviation stakeholders.</p><p>As with all contingency measures that the Commission has put forward, these measures are not intended to, and cannot, mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario, nor can they replicate the full benefits of EU membership or the terms of the transition period as provided for in the withdrawal agreement, but we continue to convey our key concerns through the Article 50 working party.  The aviation industry is fully aware of the position that has been reached.  While not everything the industry would wish for will be possible, the very real fears that aircraft might not be able to fly are being addressed.</p><p>A fundamental legal principle of EU aviation is that air carriers wishing to operate in the single aviation market must be majority owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals.  Airlines which may not be majority owned and effectively controlled by EU nationals post Brexit, when UK shareholders are excluded, could lose their European operating rights.  The European Commission has been very clear that it is essential for companies that wish to be recognised as EU air carriers to take all necessary measures to restructure and to ensure that they meet this requirement in time for 29 March.  My Department has continually advised our aviation stakeholders of the need to examine their corporate structures to ensure they will comply with the provisions on ownership and control when the UK leaves the EU.  That said, it is recognised that the timeframe in a no-deal Brexit scenario is very limited and it will be challenging for community airlines to complete this restructuring as necessary in the time available.  In view of these circumstances, it is envisaged that the EU contingency regulation for air connectivity will provide an extension of seven months to allow airlines impacted by the ownership rules to implement their restructuring plans, subject to certain conditions.</p><p>Ireland, together with a broad range of other most affected member states, is seeking to address all aviation related issues so that difficulties for community airlines and inconvenience to their customers are minimised to the greatest extent possible while recognising that a no-deal Brexit cannot mean the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>and the advantages that would bring to the UK and its aviation sector without the obligations of EU membership.  Since the UK triggered Article 50, the Department has been engaged in extensive consultations and meetings with other Government Departments and agencies, and other public and private key stakeholders, in particular with the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, NCADF.  This increased and regular engagement with the NCADF has assisted both the Department and the industry in planning for and mitigating the risks associated with Brexit for the aviation sector.</p><p>Roll-on, roll-off traffic between Ireland and the UK accounted for 966,549 freight units in 2017.  Currently this trade into and through the UK by road is facilitated by the EU&rsquo;s community licence, which allows international hauliers from EU member states to move within EU member states.  In a no-deal scenario, up to recently, the Commission had maintained that the European Conference of Ministers of Transport, ECMT, multilateral quota system would be the only fall-back for journeys between the UK and the EU 27.  This system would only provide sufficient ECMT licences to cover between 5% and 10% of current UK-EU journeys, which would be wholly inadequate.  Following very strong representations from Ireland and a number of other member states, the European Commission announced on 19 December a proposal to temporarily adopt measures for a nine month period from 29 March to allow access for UK hauliers to the EU to ensure basic road connectivity.  This is also subject to the UK recognising EU licences and allowing access into the UK for EU hauliers.  The proposal represents prudent planning and is very welcome.  Ireland is very supportive of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal and is working closely with other member states and the European Parliament to ensure it is adopted in good time for Brexit.  There has been a lot of uncertainty about the legal framework for road haulage in a no-deal scenario.  Bringing the Commission&rsquo;s proposal into force in advance of 29 March would remove much of the uncertainty that has surrounded this issue to date.</p><p>While the proposed aviation and road haulage EU Commission measures are only temporary, they eliminate the immediate risk from March and allow time and space to find alternative and more permanent arrangements.</p><p> The establishment of the additional controls at ports and at Dublin airport is being co-ordinated by an interdepartmental group under the chairmanship of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with representation from a range of stakeholders across Government.  The group has focused on three locations for which we are heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK, namely, Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The Office of Public Works has been tasked with delivering the required facilities for agriculture, health and customs checks at these locations.  Work is ongoing in respect of both a no-deal and a central-case scenario.</p><p> I am concerned about the potential for disruption to, and our reliance on, the UK landbridge.  A substantial proportion of our exports and imports, including many time-sensitive or perishable goods, are transported by truck on roll-on roll-off, RoRo, shipping services to and from the UK for direct UK trade, but a significant proportion of our goods make their way onwards through the UK road network or landbridge to reach EU ports.  It is estimated that 16% of the RoRo or heavy goods vehicle, HGV, traffic between Ireland and Great Britain is landbridge traffic.  Of course, this all takes place at present in a relatively frictionless manner, as is the case across the entire Single Market.  However, if the UK becomes a third country from 29 March and there is no agreement in place, then additional customs, agriculture and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls will be required at EU continental ports that trade with the UK.  There has been much speculation that French ports may become congested and that there may be significant delays on the much-relied-upon Dover-Calais maritime route.</p><p> The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, carried out a study for my Department concerning the implications of Brexit on the use of the UK landbridge.  The study, which was published last year, indicates that 3 million tonnes of merchandise trade with the EU moves between Ireland and the Continent via the UK landbridge.  The IMDO estimates that this equates to approximately 150,000 HGVs each year, which constitutes a weekly average of approximately 2,880 HGVs moving between Ireland and the Continent via the landbridge, although there are peak times both weekly and on a seasonal basis.  The total value of our trade using the landbridge is estimated to be &euro;21 billion.</p><p> Certain sectors are very reliant on the landbridge route - this trade is largely time-sensitive products such as agrifood where the shorter journey times and high frequency of sailings allows a quicker route to market than direct sailings to continental EU ports.  The IMDO study concluded that the landbridge is a strategically important route to market for many Irish importers and exporters, including but not limited to agrifood, seafood and other sectors trading in time-sensitive produce.  These sectors would be particularly adversely affected by any deterioration in transit times or increase in costs, particularly in a no-deal scenario, and these sectors may not be able to opt for the direct maritime routes to the Continent given the longer journey times involved.  Many of these exporters are likely to continue to use the landbridge unless additional delays on this route are such that the route would become unviable.  Others may opt instead to transport goods from Ireland on direct shipping services to EU ports.  Existing available capacity on direct maritime routes to continental EU ports will mitigate somewhat our reliance on the UK landbridge.  This will of course depend on the nature of the product.</p><p> The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, through its own work and through participation in the landbridge project group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, continues to monitor the extent to which Government agencies at the port of Calais in particular are stepping up preparedness for checks on products from and flowing through the UK, which is critical for products that need the time advantage offered by the landbridge.  Last month, as part of the Government's preparations for a no-deal Brexit, I updated Government on the potential implications for east-west transport connectivity with the UK and our wider EU and international trading partners in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I set out my concerns relating to the landbridge and I also assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the landbridge, while recognising that the longer journey time on direct routes may not offer a viable alternative.  Based on consultations with those in the shipping sector and others, I consider that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from the end of March.  If demand for further capacity arises, the shipping sector can respond quickly.  I am keeping this matter under review and will report back to Government with a further assessment.</p><p> There are many other important issues which the Department continues to address and in respect of which it continues to prepare.  I think the ones I have covered are the most pressing, but I welcome questions on everything.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Before I take questions from members, I want to return to the point I raised before the break, namely, that it might be wiser if we could appeal to the Government through the Minister's good offices to recognise existing relationships in the context of insurance policies North and South, with no requirement to have a green card.  That would make the most sense of all, for the whole common travel area.  The green card would increase bureaucracy and cause significant delays, if somebody wishes to cause a delay.

It appears that travel in these sectors between here and Northern Ireland is not going to be as seamless as for rail and bus passengers.  A year ago, I asked the Minister whether flights would be grounded in the event of no deal and what he has told us today suggests that will not happen.  He mentioned a 12-month transition period, provided the UK reciprocates, a seven-month transition period for the airline companies to restructure and nine months for the road haulage sector to clear its issues.  This is very welcome because at least it means we will not fall off a cliff on 29 March.  I gather that these periods were granted following representations made by the Irish Government to the EU, and not by the UK, which is interesting and relates to the point made by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh about the suggestion to businesses in the North that they seek information from the South landing in our lap again.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that these arrangements would not mitigate the overall impact of a no-deal scenario.  Can he explain what will not be mitigated?  He indicated that the aviation industry was fully aware of the position but was also aware that not everything it wished for would be possible.  To what does that refer?  A change in the corporate structure of the airlines was mentioned.  Ryanair has taken steps in that regard.  Are many companies involved in such a process at the moment?</p> <p>  How does the Minister envisage the outcome as it affects the landbridge and the road haulage industry?  The throughput of road hauliers on the landbridge to the UK is a huge issue, particularly in the context of perishable goods.  How does the Minister believe that can be resolved satisfactorily?  I welcome the news that there will be transition periods in which to get these issues resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#O00500"><p>I acknowledge the good work that has been done by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to address some of the major challenges we are expecting at the end of March, particularly as regards connectivity for our airlines.  While the Minister acknowledged that it was not resolved there is, at least, a temporary arrangement that will ensure our airlines continue to fly.</p> <p>  I recently asked a parliamentary question relating to the TEN-T network.  With the UK leaving the EU, the network needs to be changed.  It is down for review in 2023 and the Minister replied to my question to the effect that he was liaising with the Commission.  Can he provide a further update on this matter?  It is very important from the point of view of maintaining connectivity within the EU.  I will not labour the point about green cards because the matter has already been discussed.  He said we were still awaiting a decision.  Is there any timeframe regarding when the decision will be made?  What is the processing time for the issuance of a green card?  If a decision is made that a card is necessary, is there any fear that we will not be able to process them in time for the people who rely on it?</p> <p> We received COM (2018) 893 today.  What consequences will it have for the aviation sector in Ireland?  We acknowledge that connectivity is going to be maintained under the transitional arrangements that have been agreed but my understanding is that these arrangements will not allow any further growth.  Can the Minister confirm that is the case?  If so, what effect will it have on Aer Lingus and IAG, which plan to expand business between Ireland and North America with Dublin as an international hub?  There is no mention in the Minister's statement of the application for maintenance certificates issued under EU law by the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.  Will Irish firms which conduct maintenance, such as Eirtech, Dublin Aerospace, etc., continue to be able to provide certificates or are we in danger of losing business to Singapore or non-EU eastern European countries which are already competing with us for that business?  Irish cargo operators such as ASL have major European and UK cargo distribution contracts.  Will the Minister confirm that, under the transitional arrangements, they will not be able to take on any additional work?  There is a cap in place on the amount of cargo they can carry to the UK and I am concerned as to the impact that may have on the pharmaceutical industry, which needs distribution capacity to be able to transport what is very sensitive merchandise.</p> <p>  My next question concerns the effects on the road haulage industry and on our ports.</p><p>The Minister mentioned that the OPW has been tasked with delivering the required facilities at our ports.  I visited Dublin Port recently and, to be fair, the work that must be done to adapt to the new requirements is well under way.  Is the Minister satisfied that the infrastructural changes that are required will be in place in time?  I have submitted repeated parliamentary questions about the number of officials required but the Minister always refers them to another Department.  While the recruitment of officials may not come under the Minister's remit, is he satisfied, from his engagement with Government colleagues, that the necessary number of officials will be in place?<br/><br/>In response to parliamentary questions on the haulage industry, and specifically on capacity in the ferry and shipping sector, the Minister stated that his Department has been meeting ferry and shipping companies to discuss their plans to deal with Brexit.  He also stated that he is quite confident that they are going to be able to respond appropriately should the need arise.  What shipping companies is the Department in consultation with and from where exactly will the additional capacity come?  It is my understanding that currently, between Dublin and Rosslare, there is capacity for 750 lorries per week to be transported to mainland Europe.  However, from Dublin Port alone, 1,000 lorries use the landbridge every day.  If the landbridge becomes problematic and there are large tailbacks meaning that the people who need to get their produce to mainland Europe can no longer use it, from where will the additional capacity come?  As stated, approximately 1,000 trucks per day leave Dublin Port for the UK.  If 80% of those are using the UK as a landbridge and travelling on to mainland Europe, where are we going to make up the gap in terms of capacity?  I wish to know with whom the Department has engaged.  I ask the Minister to commit to ensuring that Rosslare Europort will be utilised to the maximum extent possible and that we will have competition within that port to ensure that hauliers who rely on it in order to get to mainland Europe will have options available to them at the end of March.<br/><br/>The British Government has advised that it will not have transit offices established at its ports for at least six months after Brexit.  Irish operators must travel under the common transit convention, CTC, in order to get access to continental Europe while avoiding import/export procedures.  This programme is reliant on tracking when and where the load enters and exits a third country <i>en route</i>between member states.  If the UK does not have transit offices set up, how is France preparing to accept Irish loads using the landbridge?  I ask the Minister to outline the contingency plan in this regard and to confirm whether the CTC is workable if the UK does not have established transit offices.<br/><br/>The Minister stated that there has been a lot of stakeholder engagement with the Department in recent months.  Such engagement is critical in terms of developing effective contingency plans.  What meetings have taken place?  Has his Department met the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, representative bodies including the Irish Road Haulage Association and the Freight Transport Association, as well as importers and exporters?  All of these are key in terms of outlining Brexit related concerns and challenges and how they can be addressed.  <br/><br/>If there is a no-deal Brexit on 30 March, is the Minister confident that we will be able to carry out the regulatory checks on goods entering and leaving Ireland that will be required?  Will we have sufficient staff in place?  I do not think so, based on replies to parliamentary questions that I have received thus far and in that context, has there been any engagement on agreeing a transition arrangement for regulatory checks?  Will the EU allow a period of months during which we can bring our staffing levels up to those required in order to carry out all of the necessary checks?  If it is a hard, fall-off-the-cliff Brexit on 30 March, we will not have the key personnel in place to carry out the required regulatory checks.</p></speech>

Is there somebody in the room who wrote the briefing document?  Mr. Burke has indicated that he was involved, so my question is directed at him.  It is stated in the third paragraph on page 2 of the document that a range of other issues arise as a result of a no-deal Brexit but that if the withdrawal agreement comes into force, many of our preparations and contingency measures will not be required.  I ask Mr. Burke to outline the range of preparation and contingency measures referred to in the briefing document.</p></speech>

I just I wanted to find the person in the room who wrote the briefing document.  I ask for details on the plans and contingency measures.  Could those details be sent on to the committee, including for example, minutes of meetings, emails and so on.  I ask Mr. Burke to answer that question and to indicate whether all of that information can be furnished to us.</p> <p>  On the issue of infrastructure and controls at ports and airports, we know that the British Irish Chamber of Commerce has identified that the ports at Cork and Rosslare will need additional builds for agricultural checks.  Given that we are already aware of that need, how much has been allocated to ports over and above what was estimated in the budget?  Will an additional allocation be made in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  It is my understanding that the last budget was based on a deal being signed.  What extra resources does the Minister intend to bring to the table in the event of a no-deal scenario?  If he is not providing additional funding, cuts will have to be made elsewhere.  If that is the case, I ask him to outline where those cuts will be made.</p><p> I wish to comment on page 4 of the briefing.  The Minister's preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from the end of March 2019.  Deputy Troy touched on that.  Is that based on conversations?  What exactly is that based on?  The Minister gave the figure for trucks using the landbridge.  What percentage of trucks would use the landbridge going through to Dover?  What percentage of trucks would use the direct route to Europe?  Let us suppose, for example, that anywhere from 75% of truck operators use the landbridge and those operators are not prepared to sit in 17-mile tailbacks.  They may have perishable goods or they may have to transport factory parts and get to their destination as soon as possible.  If they are not prepared to sit in 17-mile tailbacks and decide to go through Irish ports directly, will there be sufficient capacity at Irish ports?  Is the Minister saying there will be no need?  I imagine we would have to lease ships.  Is the Minister saying there is sufficient capacity and there will be no need to lease ships to deal with the capacity?  Has the Minister or the Department looked at the cost of leasing a particular ship to deal with this?  I am keen to find out the cost of that and the predicted numbers in the Minister's plan needed to cater for that.  Is that capacity in place?  This comes back to my first question about preparation measures and contingency plans.  Can we see all of that?  Can we see how all the plans fall into place?</p><p> My other point relates to international road haulage.  I read about the European Commission announcement on 19 December of a proposal to temporarily adopt measures for a nine-month period from 29 March to allow access for UK hauliers to the EU to ensure basic road connectivity.  Is this regardless of a no-deal Brexit or is it part of the overall deal, as such?  I am curious about that.  If there is a no-deal Brexit and this does not stand, what is our plan?  Where is our plan?</p></speech>

The first is that the more I hear about a hard Brexit, the more difficult it will become and the more traumatised our economy may well become.  I welcome the progress the Minister and his Department have made in discussions thus far.</p> <p>  Another point that strikes me is that even if we had sufficient capacity in Rosslare, most of the time-sensitive goods that would otherwise have gone through the landbridge are going to perish unless we reach a significant concession with the United Kingdom.  That is of major importance.   That would be in the interests of the UK as well because no one wants perishable goods to be held up on entry to Europe or in coming across.  The whole thing is fraught with complexities.  People talk about going off a cliff, and that is exactly what it is.</p> <p>  I am keen to make some other points.  The committee has agreed to visit Rosslare, Dublin Airport and Dublin Port.  We will have a Border visit in the coming weeks.  We are concerned about all of this.</p> <p>  I have a question on the sports side.  I understand the future of Down Royal Racecourse may be in jeopardy.  There are concerns about Irish horses, which are the mainstay of that course as regards the free movement of horses up and down.  That is only a small indicator but it is significant for the people concerned.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice is next.  The air issue was raised by Deputy Troy.  He referred to COM (2018) 893, which we got today, and how it has serious implications for the aviation industry.  Have arrangements already been made between carriers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, for example, between British Airways, Aer Lingus and Ryanair?</p></speech>

On 10 January this year at the European Council a transport amendment was put to include more parts of Ireland in trans-European transport network or TEN-T funding.  The amendment came from the European Commission and set out Brexit mitigation proposals relating to the Atlantic corridor.  It includes the ports of Shannon Foynes, which was always included, as well as Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork.  They link to Brest, Roscoff, Cherbourg and four or five more places in France and other countries.</p> <p>  I presume the Minister will be in Brussels later.  The amendment did not go to a vote, which was unusual.  It was fully agreed and is not going to a vote of MEPs.  The Minister will be in Brussels for the trilogue &ndash; if that is the correct term &ndash; in the coming weeks with the European Commission.  Can the Minister make a commitment on this?  As has been pointed out by all Deputies, the likes of Donegal and the west of Ireland have been badly affected.  I presume the Minister is accepting the amendment to include Rosslare, Waterford and the other areas.  This comes under the same plan proposed in 2012 for the Atlantic corridor or the western arc.  Can the Minister confirm whether that is the case?  When the Minister goes to Brussels to discuss that amendment will he give an undertaking to include the rest of the west of Ireland?  This is something that has been committed to in the programme for Government.  My understanding is that in recent weeks the Minister received an email or letter from the Atlantic economic corridor task force to get the area included in the TEN-T maps.  Will the Minister comment on that and confirm that the area will be included?</p> <p>  We have to remember that this is relevant for Donegal, Monaghan, Sligo and other areas along the periphery of the Border.  Louth is included because it comes between Newry and Dublin.  If there is a hard Brexit, those areas will be hit ferociously.  Will all these areas be included, as in 2012 and as per the programme for Government commitment of some years ago?</p></speech>

One is a proposal linked directly with Brexit and involving a realignment of the North Sea-Mediterranean corridor from Ireland to the United Kingdom, through the Benelux countries, into France down to Marseilles.  With the exit of the United Kingdom, consideration is being given to how that corridor might be realigned such that it would be coherent. The Commission proposed that there be links from Dublin and Cork ports.  We have accepted this but have requested that Shannon Foynes Port also be included.  It would link into ports in northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p></speech>

As part of a regulation that is being brought forward, we have also asked to be linked with Le Havre on the Atlantic corridor.  Thus, we would be linked with two corridors.  The Commission has accepted that proposal and the French Government is very much in favour of it.  Under the regulation as proposed, there will be a link with certain French, Dutch and Belgian ports on the North Sea-Mediterranean corridor and another with Le Havre on the Atlantic corridor.  We can only connect to ports that are on the core network and they are the ports that are on the core network.</p> <p>  As part of the renegotiation of the funding mechanism for 2021 onwards, with Malta and Cyprus, we have sought to vary the initial Commission proposal only to fund cross-border projects on the comprehensive network.  The vast majority of the network in Ireland is part of the comprehensive network and would not receive funding.  With Malta and Cyprus, we have sought funding to be provided for the comprehensive network of any member state without a land border with another member state.  The Commission has accepted that proposal.  That means that in the next round funding will continue to be available for the comprehensive network, although it did not form part of the original proposal of the Commission.</p> <p>  On the remainder of TEN-T, we have asked the Commission to carry out a review of the network in the light of Brexit.  We have yet to submit a full request in that regard, but we have also raised it at a working party level.  In our discussions with the Commission we are conscious that Brexit has particular implications for connectivity from the island of Ireland to continental markets and that the withdrawal of the United Kingdom will mean that some parts of Ireland, particularly in the west and north west, will become more peripheral in getting to markets.  The Commission has been forthcoming in that regard, but we have asked for that review at working party level.  We must formalise the request by means of a formal submission that will take account of what we consider the implications of Brexit will be.</p></speech>

I presume Ireland could table a further amendment proposing the inclusion of places such as Killybegs, Galway Port and Ireland West Airport, Knock.

Some of the areas to which reference was made are not on the core network and, therefore, cannot be part of the realignments.  The corridors were set based on key urban roads in a territory, which, on the island of Ireland, are those from Belfast to Dublin and Dublin to Cork.  There is an offshoot to Shannon Foynes because of the maritime connection.  My understanding of what the Parliament has proposed is that the areas referred to by the Deputy are not eligible for inclusion in the core network.  We have raised this issue with the Commission.</p></speech>

The programme for Government committed to seeking such a review long before Brexit.  However, in the light of the imminency of Brexit, it is more crucial than ever that the TEN-T network designation be reviewed.  It is regrettable that no formal application for a review has been made, although I acknowledge the matter has been raised informally.  Perhaps the Minister might inform us of when it is intended to make a formal application to accelerate the review of the TEN-T network.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice stated, such a review would enable other ports and airports to be designated as part of the core network.</p></speech>

As recently as Monday, we talked with Rosslare in relation to the next funding call.  There is currently a call for funds and Rosslare is looking to see if there are projects it might do that would be eligible.  </p></speech>

We will not get into that.  However, if one looks at the amendment, it is now being put in under TEN-T and will become a core node.  If that can be done there, then surely in the context of Brexit, as Deputy Troy pointed out, it can be done on the west and north west with a core node including Killybegs, Galway and places such as Knock included in the frame.  This might be done through an amendment as they seem to have done in Brussels, and I assume that Ireland would welcome this with open arms.</p></speech>

I do not have a firm indication.  The insurance companies plan to begin issuing green cards in March in the event that no agreement has been reached between the UK and the EU.  A period of one month's advance notice will be required for the delivery of individual green cards.  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, will undertake a public communications campaign in the event that it proceeds with the issuing of green cards.  I share the Chairman's desire that they should not last forever and that the earlier we can take them out of existence, the better.  However, I have no indication that they cannot be done.  </p><p>Several members referred to COM (2018) 893, which was referred to in a note provided to the committee today.  It is just a revision.  On 19 December, the European Commission published a draft proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules ensuring basic connectivity with regard to the withdrawal of the UK from the Union.  The objective of this unilateral measure is to lay down provisions to govern air transport between the EU and the UK following the latter's withdrawal from the EU.  The measures are subject to reciprocity with the UK and will only apply for a period of 12 months or until such time as a comprehensive air transport agreement between the UK and EU has been concluded under the future relationship.  The proposal provides for a unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom air traffic rights to UK air carriers.  These rights enable carriers to overfly and make technical stops in EU territory, as well as to serve direct routes between the respective territories.  It is currently the subject of discussions at the <i>ad hoc </i>working group on Article 50.  As the proposal is evolving, elements such as the inclusion of fifth freedom traffic rights for all cargo services, co-operative marketing arrangements such as code sharing and issues related to aircraft leasing are still being teased out.  </p><p>Under the current proposal, the vast majority of flights to and from Ireland to the UK would still be able to operate post Brexit.  Furthermore, I understand that charter flights operated by UK charter airlines to other EU member states or beyond would no longer be possible under the current proposal as it does not cover services between two foreign states, that is, seventh freedoms.  Relevant charter operators and tour operators have been advised of this by officials from the Department and the Commission for Aviation Regulation.</p><p>The Department met representatives of ASL yesterday.  They have no real concerns about air freight.  There was a cap on freight at summer 2018 levels.  </p></speech>

It will be difficult.  The Government has tasked the OPW with establishing the necessary infrastructure based on the requirements of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and another Department, and the Revenue Commissioners.  Dublin Airport has been assessed and its current facilities as they stand deemed adequate for a no-deal Brexit.  In addition to the permanent facilities that are being developed, separate central case sites have been identified for the no-deal scenario.  Implementation work is commencing to provide these sites.  At Dublin Port this involves refurbishment works for inspection facilities and cold storage, parking and checking areas, staff accommodation and traffic management systems within the port.  Works in Rosslare Europort are to a smaller scale.  They will provide for inspection areas, parking, staff accommodation, modifications to existing buildings and traffic management systems within the port.  The OPW is already on site in Rosslare and Dublin ports.  My colleagues are working to ensure that sufficient staff in customs etc. are there to implement what will be necessary at the end of March.  </p> <p>  No one can say they are happy with the situation but I am very confident that everything will be done that can be done to ensure that we are in an optimal position on 30 March.</p></speech>

The Department has kept in close contact with road haulage stakeholders throughout the Brexit negotiations, such as the Irish Road Haulage Association, Freight Transport Association Ireland, IBEC, the Irish Exporters Association, and the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.  The Department also has been liaising with these bodies in respect of the Commission's no-deal road transport proposal.  On Monday, 21 January, the Department hosted a stakeholders' forum for road transport and maritime interests, including industry representative bodies in haulage to inform them of the latest Brexit developments.  The Department, together with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners addressed the group stressing the importance of attendees disseminating the information provided as widely as possible.  Similarly, departmental officials took part in a Brexit seminar for local chambers of commerce hosted by Chambers Ireland on 10 January, in order that local chambers could in turn brief their members on developments.  On Tuesday, 29 January I met representatives of Freight Transport Association Ireland.</p><p>My Department continues to work with the industry representative bodies to keep hauliers and enterprises informed of developments and prospects, in keeping with our long-established practice.  We will continue to update the information on the Department's website as further developments occur.<br/><br/>On the issue of the landbridge, there was a question about where capacity would be provided.  The landbridge is a problem.  We may well sort out all of the other problems to a certain degree, but this is a problem, particularly in the transport of perishable goods, as has been mentioned.  We do not quite know how bad it is going to be, but we have taken a lot of measures and precautions and done a lot of work in looking at the alternatives.  We are talking about ferries and the capacity to which Deputy Troy alluded.  If people stop using the landbridge for various reasons such as that it is too crowded or there are delays, where will they go instead?  My officials have met many of the ferry groups, including Irish Ferries, Stena, CLdN, Doyle Shipping Group - I think virtually every one - Brittany Ferries and P&amp;amp;O, to see what capacity is like.  Their conclusion is that there is certainly the capacity to substitute for the landbridge, if alternatives are needed.  Everybody knows about the <i>W.B Yeats</i>.  There is another ferry being bought also.  It is thought, therefore, that there will be plenty of spare capacity.  However, it is not an exact science because we cannot predict how many are going to move from the landbridge and what the effect will be.  They have looked at it very carefully and are confident that there is no need for a more dramatic intervention such as leasing, budgets or anything like it and that there will be capacity.  We will have to see how the individual companies will respond to what happens at the landbridge and whether there will be a danger to perishable goods, but there is obviously a difficulty and there will be disruption.  The landbridge is shorter and quicker as it stands, but there will be longer journeys on ferries.  Let there be no doubt, however, that this issue has been gone into in very great detail.  I think I will report back to the Cabinet in the month of February.</p></speech>

What will happen if there are problems with the landbridge, time delays, backups or long queues?  I have outlined the number of vehicles going from Rosslare to mainland Europe and the number of trucks per day which leave from Dublin Port and use the landbridge.  There is a significant number of trucks using the landbridge.  If there are problems, how confident is the Minister that there will be alternatives in place?  He says his officials have met the relevant shipping companies.  If a ship is needed to be put a service in place from Rosslare to France, do we know how quickly they will be able to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#T00500"><p>I very much regret what happened at Rosslare and the fallout.  It was regrettable, but it was a commercial decision made by a particular group.  In terms of its impact on capacity, the company's investment of &euro;150 million in the new <i>W.B. Yeats</i>to serve the Ireland-France route will still increase significantly its year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France and its summer tourism capacity by 20%.  If the capacity is provided, as it will be, as we can see with the <i>W.B. Yeats</i>, we will solve that part of the problem.  Of what we are not certain - it would be irresponsible and wrong of me to say otherwise - is that we will have an instant solution to the time problem.  I do not know whether we have because I do not know what the delays will be like in Dover.  We will have to wait and see.  I do not know whether if the transport of perishable goods will be affected at this stage, but we are going to do absolutely everything we can to ensure the alternatives will work.</p></speech>

If 80% use the landbridge to get to mainland Europe, that amounts to 800 trucks a day or 4,000 a week.  Only 750 trucks are leaving from Rosslare to travel to mainland Europe.  How will we increase capacity from 750 trucks a week to in excess of 4,000?  That capacity could potentially be needed.  The Minister keeps referring to the <i>W.B. Yeats</i>, but one ship will not be able to provide it.  What is its capacity?</p></speech>

The United Kingdom will have the same problem going the other way.  Its produce going to markets elsewhere in Europe will be delayed and what is being imported into it will equally be delayed.  I know that there is a different timeline from Ireland and that the UK timeline is more difficult.  However, there should be a meeting of minds.  Would it be possible for the Minister to seek a special derogation, even in the event that it would run off the cliff?  If they do not, there is no doubt that companies will go out of business.  Produce, particularly time-sensitive goods, will not arrive.</p></speech>

That is possibly the largest problem.  Neither would I underestimate our capacity to solve the problem.  That is what we are actually doing.  The strong view of shipping companies and the Department is that the State should not intervene directly at this time.  There would be all sorts of state aid and other implications, which would be very traumatic.  There have been responses from the shipping companies.  CLdN launched a new roll-on, roll-off, Ro-Ro, freight ferry, the <i>MV Celine</i>, with a capacity of 8,000 lane metres, on the Rotterdam-Zeebrugge-Dublin route in October 2017.  The Port of Cork has a new route, since May 2018, operated by Brittany Ferries to Santander.  We also have the <i>W.B. Yeats</i>.  That is a considerable increase in capacity and evidence of competition on the routes.  Shipping services are market driven and ferry operators have in the past responded to economic developments by increasing or decreasing capacity.  Any new initiative to enhance shipping services will continue to be market driven.  Where they see a gap, they will fill it.</p></speech>

We all know that the shortest route is from Rosslare to France.  The Minister is talking about from moving from a 16-hour to a 28-hour sailing on average.  Goods that might be transported on one route might not necessarily be transported on another.  That is not competition for somebody who needs to have quick and direct access.  That is why I am asking about capacity on that specific route.  It is the only one that can offer any alternative to the problematic landbridge.  Does the Minister accept this?</p></speech>

That Irish Ferries has pulled a route is deeply regrettable and very unfortunate.  It is something I wish had never happened.  The Department has not made any final decision.  It is monitoring the position on a daily basis and I will report to the Government on the matter before the end of February.

Yes, they were.  We faced a fairly difficult situation a few months ago when the European Commissioner was taking a line on both haulage and the airlines that nothing much would change and that in a no-deal scenario we would face serious difficulties.  That is now past in that we have got more time to come up with a solution, which we hope we will be able to reach in the time made available to us.  It will not be identical to the situation at present, but we are perfectly confident that the road haulage business and the airlines will be running a perfectly acceptable service that is very close to what we have at present, as I said.  I think that is going ahead.</p></speech>

What is not in there in this period?  What would be the practical effect?</p></speech>

They will now not be changed in time.  The aviation industry is getting an extension as well.  I think the Senator asked which companies are in the ownership and control process, which is now extended.  I think they are all in it: Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Stobart and the PSO ones.  All must fulfil the ownership and control conditions sooner or later.  If they are in the process, I think the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, will look at them.</p></speech>

They will all have to be included in it, and that is obviously very serious for Ryanair and IAG, which owns Aer Lingus.  They will have to comply with that, as will Donegal and Kerry airports, which are serviced by Stobart.  They are all in talks about how they will do it.  As far as I know, though, the indications are very strong that they are all in a process which will be successful.  I am sure it is not something they welcome but they are prepared to comply with it because they must do so to become European airlines.</p><p>We talked about road haulage and the resolution of the landbridge in my response to Deputy Troy's questions.  I repeat that the resolution of this is being looked at extremely urgently.  I do not want to go into too much detail, and the committee will understand why, but there are all kinds of alternatives being looked at and ways of ensuring the landbridge does not become a huge obstacle in any logistical way.  Those alternatives are being examined.  The ferries are obviously the primary issue, but if they are not fast enough, I think they will look at other ways of doing that.  I met the French transport Minister, and I think we were <i>ad idem</i>about the need to move trucks fairly quickly through Dover and Calais, so there is no reason to despair but there is reason for energy.</p></speech>

Regarding the 12-month extension or whatever to keep the flights moving, what needs to happen in those 12 months to allow that situation to continue into the future in the case of a no-deal?  In other words, will we face another cliff in 12 months if certain things do not happen within that period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-06a.1425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019020600002#U02400"><p>I suppose a UK deal with the EU would be some kind of prospect.  Obviously, the 12 months are to give us time to do that, and I do not anticipate that we will go over that cliff at any stage.  It would just be unthinkable.  I think we can be confident that a continuous arrangement will be made, even if it will be difficult.  I do not know what the shape of it or any other arrangement will be in the end.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked about budget 2019.  It was based on a withdrawal agreement and a transition period.  In a no-deal scenario, the Government will look at any need for Exchequer funding for the OPW when those costs are clearer and timing is known.  The Government will look at that.  The Deputy will be aware of the fact that budget 2019 was based on a withdrawal agreement.  That is true; she is right.</p> <p>  I have the figures relating to the percentage of trucks that use the landbridge to Dover.  It is 16%.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about haulage as well.</p></speech>

Some 16% of trucks use the landbridge.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about haulage and the contingency on road haulage.  It is a nine-month contingency.  It is for a no-deal scenario.  If there is a deal, there is a deal, but if it is a nine-month contingency, it is purely for a no-deal scenario.</p></speech>

I will say the following.  Everything is being looked at and all alternatives to the landbridge are being looked at in order to get goods from one place to another as quickly as possible without too much obstruction.  That is absolutely the case.  All alternatives will continue to be looked at.  At the moment, we have decided that there is no intention for any direct intervention on the part of either the State or the Department.  That is under constant review.  I will report to Cabinet about that again at the end of February.</p></speech>

The vast majority of the work we have discussed here today will fall into that category and it will all be for nothing, and that will be good because there will be a withdrawal agreement.  A withdrawal agreement will mean that we will buy time and a transition period to the end of 2020 and we will go immediately into negotiations with the UK, at EU level, about what the future relationship will look like.  Nearly everything we have discussed here today will fall away if there is a withdrawal agreement.  As the Minister said, much of this is a no-deal plan.  These are all contingency measures for a no-deal scenario.  Much of the work that has gone on, particularly over the past few months, has focused on the types of issues we have discussed today.</p> <p>  We have not released those types of documents because this is still an ongoing piece of work and part of the negotiations.  That is even the case for freedom of information requests because they are the deliberations of a public body at the moment.</p></speech>

Post Brexit, we could have controls and checkpoints for live exports of cattle, especially calves, that would delay movement.  This will have repercussions for animal welfare on the boats and cattle trailers.  What measures is the Minister taking to ensure we will have a free flow of exports of live cattle out of this country?  Will the movement of livestock be given any preference or priority?</p> <p>  The Minister touched on the transport and travel network and upgraded infrastructure and said he would go to Europe and look for funding to upgrade some of the other ports in the country.  Will the Department's section of Project Ireland 2040 in the national planning framework have to be reviewed?  For example, Cork Port is dependent on the delivery of the N28 in Ringaskiddy and the Dunkettle interchange at the Jack Lynch tunnel.  That project already six months behind.  Should we not be bringing that forward and fast-tracking it if there will be extra activity through the port in Cork and to encourage more activity?  </p> <p>  Access to infrastructure will play a primary part in the case of a no-deal Brexit and movement of transport would be in a different direction, as such.  As opposed to going to Belfast or Louth, transport will be coming down towards Rosslare and Cork.  Will the Minister and his Department have to go back and review their plans?  Should work on the M20, in the western corridor between Cork and Limerick, be fast-tracked?  Would some of the infrastructure and road networks have to be upgraded sooner at the expense of other projects?  Will the Minister have to reprioritise the road network infrastructure development programme?</p></speech>

It is included among a number of major national road schemes identified for development during the period of the national planning framework.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland has provided an allocation of &euro;2.15 million to Limerick City and County Council this year to advance planning and design work on the scheme.  The council is currently procuring the appointment of technical advisers for the scheme.  It is anticipated that this appointment will be made early this year.</p> <p>  The proposed project seeks to link the cities of Cork and Limerick with a high quality transport corridor, as Deputy O'Keeffe knows.  The existing route is deficient in both safety and capacity.  Agreement has been reached between the Limerick and Cork local authorities for Limerick to be the lead authority for this project.  Limerick City and County Council will, therefore, need to assess all feasible options before a preferred route can be identified.  The estimated cost of this project is &euro;900 million.</p> <p>  We will co-operate with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in any way we can on the animals issue that Deputy O'Keeffe raised.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has set live animal checks and approved live animal hauliers and that is its business.  Vehicles that transport live animals attract 100% inspections and compliance is high among approved hauliers.</p> <p>  I hope I have answered Deputy O'Keeffe's questions.  We are going ahead with the Cork to Limerick road link.  That is a commitment we intend to keep.  We will have to look at it again if there are blockages or obstacles because the roads are inadequate.</p></speech>

I am making the point that Project Ireland 2040 assumed that we were all happy members of the EU but that might change.  I give the example of the Dunkettle interchange that is being upgraded at the Jack Lynch tunnel.</p><p>It is already six months behind schedule.  When there is the potential for a no-deal Brexit, we should be bringing it ahead of schedule by six months.  </p><p> I refer also to the N28, the road linking the South Ring Road in Cork city with Ringaskiddy, thereby connecting a major industrial estate with the Port of Cork.

T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm go raibh orm imeacht ar feadh c&uacute;pla uair.  I will keep my few questions very short because everyone has been here since 1.30 p.m. or earlier.  </p> <p>  I will focus on three issues, the first of which is the landbridge which accounts for &euro;21 billion in trade annually.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but, from memory, 70% of all imports and exports pass through the United Kingdom.  Is that correct?  The Minister may or may not have the information with him.  Obviously, if that is the case, it is an issue of huge magnitude.  I also support Deputies Fitzmaurice and Troy and Senator O'Mahony in making their earlier points about the European Commission.  They were very well made.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to VAT which may not directly be a matter for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Irish coach operators have a big disadvantage.  Irish-based coach operators are outside the VAT net, meaning that fuel, maintenance and repair costs are not reclaimable.  However, coach companies in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom and Irish coach companies which only deal with tourists can claim back VAT.  That is a significant disadvantage for many coach operators, particularly in rural Ireland where private coaches are very important in connecting communities and getting people from A to B.  This question is somewhat separate but related in some ways.  I would really appreciate it if the Minister looked at it and got back to me on it.</p> <p>  The third issue is that of EU airlines.  The Minister probably knew that I would raise this issue in one way or another.  I have a document from the European Commission Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport in Brussels, dated 18 January 2019.  It was sent to all stakeholders and relates to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  It states that "as of the withdrawal date, the EU rules in the field of civil aviation safety will no longer apply to the United Kingdom".  European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, rules will not apply to the United Kingdom.  We are talking about having two totally different sets of rules and guidelines, which is not the case at present.  That will have serious implications from an EU and, particularly, an Irish perspective.  On the second page of the document it is stated that, because of these differences, UK licences will no longer be valid from the date of withdrawal from the European Union.  This is of particular concern as it means that pilots with UK licences will not have the same standing after the date of withdrawal.  It may also mean that licences issued to Irish pilots by the Irish Aviation Authority will not have the same standing in the United Kingdom.  The document states pilot licences, pilot medical certificates and so on issued in the United Kingdom will no longer be valid.  Certificates for air operators, attestations of cabin crew, engineers and certificates for aerodromes will also be affected.  The document lays out a few more areas.  This will have deep repercussions for Irish airlines, their employees and, ultimately, passengers in Ireland.  It is a very significant issue.  </p> <p>  I am sure the Minister has a copy of the document.  Will he share his thoughts with us on the issue?  Has the Department considered it?  Has it helped the aviation industry in Ireland in the transition, perhaps through discussions at EU level?  We have a far higher percentage of UK-licensed engineers, pilots and so on employed in the industry here than in France, Germany, Spain or Italy.  It will affect us a lot more.  It could mean that aeroplanes would have to be grounded because there would not be the proper licences for them to fly.  That is a worst-case scenario, but I do not know what the position is or what is happening.  The document talks about third country status such as that of the USA from an aviation perspective.  We were in a position where a commercial pilot holding a US licence could only fly in Ireland or elsewhere in the European Union for up to 12 months before having to sit examinations to gain a valid European licence.  That was pulled and stopped a number of years ago.  If the same was to apply to UK licence holders, it could cause a serious issue for the aviation industry.</p> <p>  The next part of my question is related to ownership, an issue the Minister raised in his earlier deliberations.  If the majority of the shareholding - I understand 51% - is non-EU, the airline is not regarded as being an EU airline.  Aer Lingus is not Irish-owned and will be outside the net.  Ryanair may well be; I do not know.  It depends on the percentage of the shareholding held in the European Union.  It is a publicly quoted company, but in actual fact there is only one, really small, Irish airline.  There is not really any Irish airline in the country.  The airlines here are all owned outside the European Union, which could become a particular issue of concern.  I would appreciate it, therefore, if the Minister and his colleagues in the Department could consider it because it could be a very significant issue.  </p> <p>  Those are my thoughts.  Again, I apologise for having to leave earlier.</p></speech>

The airlines are aware of it.  Regardless of Brexit, the ownership and control issue is a feature of airline licensing, not just within the European market but also across the world.  With respect to their articles of association, airlines' bread and butter are keeping their licences in conformity with the regulatory rules for ownership and control.  It is nothing new, but obviously Brexit will have a big impact.  Airlines are making the necessary arrangements to be compliant from 29 March.  They have sought a time extension.  Supported by other member states, Ireland has pressed the case for flexibility with the European Commission in order to reflect current circumstances, that we are in the middle of February and still there is still no clarity on status after 29 March.</p><p>The Commission has agreed to a new provision within the contingency connectivity regulation to allow a seven-month grace period subject to certain onerous, although not insurmountable, conditions to allow sufficient time.  The airlines have welcomed it as providing a little bit of breathing space.  There is a commitment on the part of the airlines to remain compliant with the rules.  It is a highly regulated sector and the airlines concerned are highly compliant with all of the rules and regulations related to their licensing conditions.  We are reasonably confident.  We have had many consultations with the airlines concerned through the national civil aviation development forum.  We have also consulted the European Commission and CAR, which is the national competent authority, and will continue to do so until we are certain there is no risk involved.  We are currently reasonably assured that there will be no disruptions of services as a result of the ownership and control rule.</p></speech>

There will be a derogation to allow entities in the UK that do not have the power to change their safety certificates and approvals to apply in advance to the EASA for those certificates to be extended.  There are plenty of mechanisms available to aviation entities with the ability to transfer - such as pilots, for example, who can transfer their licences - to transfer licences to any national authority across the EU 27, including the  IAA.  On the Irish airlines, it is my understanding that the vast bulk of pilots operating Irish routes with the two main carriers are licensed through the IAA.  A limited number of pilots holding Civil Aviation Authority licences need to transfer to the IAA or any other national authority in the EU 27 in good time.</p></speech>
