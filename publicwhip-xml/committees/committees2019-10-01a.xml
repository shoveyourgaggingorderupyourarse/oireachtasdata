    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#J00500"><p>The IFA provides for direct engagement and support services to farmers who experience difficulties on their farms, including issues associated with the current TB programme.  The TB eradication programme implemented in Ireland remains the single largest animal health cost for Irish farmers each year.  Since the implementation of the wildlife control programme in the early 2000s, significant progress has been achieved.  Unfortunately, the ever-increasing burden of additional controls imposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on farmers has contributed to increased costs and losses for those experiencing breakdowns or contiguous to breakdowns.<br/><br/>For the current programmes the total direct costs provided by the Department are just over &euro;90 million per annum.  This costing does not include the enormous labour cost associated with the TB programme for farmers, which the IFA estimates at a further &euro;20 million annually.  Irish farmers contribute a total of &euro;55 million each year to the TB programme - &euro;27 million in annual TB testing costs, in excess of &euro;7 million in disease levies, and &euro;20 million in labour - when facilitating the testing of more than 9 million animal tests a year and implementing the disinfection protocols following a disease outbreak.  In contrast, for the &euro;55 million investment, farmers receive only just over &euro;18 million in compensation for animal and production loss and maintenance costs.  Between 2012 and 2018, the level of farmers' direct contribution to the programme increased by 15%, from &euro;30.641 million to more than &euro;35 million annually, while over the same period, the level of contribution from the national Exchequer has reduced from &euro;45.825 million to &euro;45.536 million and the contribution from the EU has reduced from &euro;11.085 million to &euro;9.748 million.<br/><br/>Farmers in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales do not pay for annual TB tests or contribute to disease levies.  They receive similar compensation to Irish farmers with the exception of &euro;3.5 million in consequential loss and hardship grant scheme payments, which are unique to the Irish programme<b>.</b></p><p>Eradication of the disease within the shortest feasible timeframe must be the objective.  With this in mind, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed, established the TB forum involving all stakeholders to develop a strategy to achieve eradication by 2030. </p><p> The IFA agreed to participate in the forum on the basis it provided the platform to have the key issues and shortcomings of the current programme addressed for farmers.  These issues were identified and outlined to the Minister in advance of the forum being established and have been raised directly at the forum meetings by the IFA.  They are addressing the shortcomings in the compensation schemes; and reviewing the effectiveness of existing controls.</p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in written communication to the forum, stated it would not support increased compensation for farmers in the TB programme.  This clearly shows a lack of understanding from the Minister and his officials of the impact the TB programme continues to have on the livelihoods of farmers and their families, which arises through no fault of their own. </p><p> The forum's report to the Minister proposes additional controls and costs on farms with no proposal to reduce the enormous cost burden of the programme for farmers. </p></speech>

A critical component in achieving and maintaining this support is the provision of fair and appropriate support measures to the farmers most impacted by the programme requirements.  The current TB programme fails to recognise the importance of fair levels of compensation and the investment and compliance of farmers with the programme who, through no fault of their own, experience a TB episode.</p> <p>  Farmers who have taken all reasonable precautions to protect their animals from TB must be fully compensated for all costs and losses associated with the TB programme.  In this regard, changes to the TB compensation schemes are required to ensure that the cost burden imposed on farmers is fairly and appropriately addressed, and the full investment of farmers to the TB eradication programme, both directly and indirectly, is recognised in the programme.</p> <p>  Irish farmers contribute &euro;35 million annually directly to the TB eradication programme through annual herd test costs and disease levies.  In addition, the labour cost associated with herd testing for farmers and the income loss from the removal of animals must also be recognised as a farmer contribution.  This contribution is credited to the farmer in the TB programmes implemented in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales and is the only farmer contribution to these programmes.</p> <p>  In return for the additional &euro;35 million contribution made by Irish farmers towards the programme, which is not provided by farmers in the countries I mentioned, Irish farmers receive approximately &euro;3.5 million in supplementary schemes.  This leaves a surplus of &euro;31.5 million in farmer contributions which must be used to address the issues I will outline.</p> <p>  There are four compensation support schemes available under the TB eradication programme: the live valuation scheme, the income supplement scheme, the depopulation grant scheme, and the hardship grant scheme.  All four schemes are fundamental components of the TB eradication programme in seeking to compensate farmers for the enormous burden of TB outbreaks.  All four schemes have significant shortcomings, however, that must be addressed in the TB programme.</p> <p>  To provide all farmers who experience a TB breakdown with the opportunity to have their animals assessed and valued independently, a number of changes to the current live valuation scheme are required.</p><p>The IFA agreed an independent live valuation scheme with the Government in the early 2000s to provide all farmers with the opportunity to have their animals assessed independently to determine the price they would be expected to attain if offered for sale on the open market.  Through the subsequent inclusion of administrative controls by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine such as penalty points for valuers, bureaucratic non-market reflective guidelines for categorisation of animals and the compilation of guideline prices by departmental personnel from inappropriate data sets, the independence of the scheme has been eroded by the Department.</p><p> In order to re-establish the independence of the scheme, the IFA is calling for the independent valuers to be allowed to independently value the animals in the scheme without interference from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The summary of market prices must be compiled from an agreed appropriate data set independently of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The income supplement scheme and depopulation grant scheme must be amended to better reflect the actual income loss incurred by farms experiencing TB breakdowns where animals are removed and cannot be replaced until the restriction is lifted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These losses are particularly acute on dairy farms where cows are in full production and on suckler farms where cows rearing calves are removed.  The IFA has carried out a detailed analysis of the impact of these events on income, based on information from the Teagasc national farm survey over a three-year period from 2015 to 2017.  The respective losses over a 12-month period are &euro;1,320 for dairy cows, &euro;672 for suckler cows and &euro;432 for other animals.</p><p> The current payments in these schemes are not reflective of the actual losses incurred by farmers, do not pay for all animals removed and only pay from the date the animals leave the farm.</p><p>The IFA proposes that the income supplement and depopulation grant scheme rates have to reflect the full extent of income loss experienced by farmers.  These rates must apply from the date animals are identified as TB reactors on the farm, must be paid on all animals removed from the farm and must be paid for the entire period of restriction under both schemes.</p><p> The current hardship grant scheme provides for a payment of &euro;38 per month for each suckler cow and &euro;25 per month for each dairy cow or other bovine animal retained on the farm, subject to a maximum payment of &euro;250 per month.  Payments are for a maximum of four months and are only available within the period from 1 November to 30 April.  Farmers with an off-farm income are not eligible for these payments.  The IFA proposes amending the hardship grant scheme to reflect the full extent of costs incurred by farmers due to the forced maintenance of additional animals.  </p><p> Dairy farmers must be supported in dealing with the restriction on the sale of newborn dairy calves through the provision of financial assistance with rearing the calves or the grant-aided removal of the calves from the farm under the hardship grant scheme.  The TB forum has failed farmers by refusing to recognise and deal with the impact of the TB programme on farmers and their families.  This refusal by the Minister and his Department is jeopardising the ongoing support of farmers for the TB programme, hindering progress on important enhancements to the programme and ultimately delaying eradication of the disease.  Clearly, protecting the 97% of herds that are free from TB each year must be the priority.  However, attempting to achieve this by ignoring and further compounding the impact on the 3% of farmers who, through no fault of their own, experience TB breakdowns is a flawed and unacceptable policy position.</p><p> I will now hand over to the IFA's animal health chairman, Mr. Pat Farrell, who is a suckler farmer himself, to outline the IFA's proposals for additional policy measures and reaction to key points in the TB forum interim report. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#P00200"><p>As a member of the TB forum, I would like to say it has been extremely frustrating and difficult to make any progress in having the issues that impact directly on farmers addressed in the forum and to make any real progress in tackling the disease.  We have provided the committee with a detailed submission of the proposals made by the IFA to the TB forum.  I now wish to give you a summary of the key points in the IFA submission.</p> <p>  The effective management and control of wildlife susceptible to TB is vital in eradicating the disease from the country.  This must continue to be the key policy in the enhanced TB programme.  The existing wildlife control programme must be appropriately resourced to ensure timely and effective captures take place surrounding all TB outbreaks where wildlife is associated with the breakdown.</p><p>The programme must be extended to reduce densities of wildlife proactively, including deer, in advance of major infrastructural works and deforestation commencing to protect cattle from TB outbreaks that have been all too common as a result of wildlife disturbance throughout the country.  Badger density reduction must continue to be the primary focus of the wildlife unit, with no further expansion to vaccination areas until concerns raised as to its effectiveness have been appropriately addressed.  A national deer management strategy must be developed and resourced to reduce deer density throughout the country to the levels that are sustainable within their natural habitat and at which they are not a disease threat to farm animals.  The Department must provide the supports and oversight to implement a deer population reduction programme surrounding TB outbreaks.</p><p> All controls imposed on farmers in the TB programme must have a sound scientific basis, contribute directly to the eradication of the disease, and be fully compensated for where they impact on the normal functioning of the farm.  TB breakdowns do not recognise county or regional office boundaries or veterinary inspector district electoral divisions, DEDs.  The Department&rsquo;s management of TB breakdowns should be based on a breakdown area under single management to ensure consistency of approach and immediate access to all relevant information associated with the outbreak.</p><p> A detailed and thorough investigation of all TB breakdowns involving more than one animal must be carried out to identify and remove all sources of the disease in the herd.  The Department must target resources and controls at the cases deemed to be the highest risk to remove the disease from the farm.  These farms must then be allowed unhindered access to the open competitive market for their animals.  These farmers must be fully compensated for all costs and losses incurred during the restriction.</p><p> Included in addressing the TB problem on these farms must be earlier consideration, if agreeable, with the herdowner of depopulation to return the farm to normal functioning in the shortest feasible timeframe.  Farmers must be supported in removing high-risk animals from their farms if the Department data identify these animals as being at a higher risk of infection or likely to contribute to further TB breakdowns.  All herds, once derestricted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and following intensive investigation, testing and disinfection, must be allowed free unhindered access to the marketplace.</p><p> The most suitable tests and testing approach for Irish conditions and disease levels based on solid scientific data must be used, including determining the feasibility and value of environmental screening for TB.  The Department must ensure it has the oversight and effective monitoring systems in place to ensure all TB testing is carried out accurately and correctly.</p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine should issue detailed biosecurity advice to assist farmers in reducing the contact between cattle and potentially TB-infected wildlife.  Where infrastructural on-farm changes are necessary, the Department should provide financial supports to farmers to implement these changes.</p><p> The Department has identified a number of factors that contribute to TB breakdowns.  In response to these risks, and in particular the findings that herds that experience breakdowns remain at higher risk for prolonged periods, the Department has proposed herd categorisation as a tool to address the risk and expedite eradication.  The IFA has strongly rejected all three proposals by the Department on herd categorisation to address this risk.  The IFA does not dispute the Department's findings on this risk factor.  The objection is to the proposed approach in addressing this risk.</p><p> The Department's herd categorisation will only serve to increase the enormous financial burden of the controls on farmers, benefit opportunistic buyers in the marketplace having devalued animals from these herds, and fail to address the substantive issue of the ongoing disease risk left on farms or in the environment.</p><p> The IFA supports additional measures in higher risk TB breakdown herds that are scientifically based, practical and feasible to implement and that expedite eradication of the disease.  These herds must be fully compensated for the losses and costs imposed by current and any additional measures in the TB programme.</p><p>The Department has identified that herds with previous TB history are at a higher risk of future breakdowns with TB.  This is clearly the result of Department controls on investigations at the time of the breakdown failing to identify and remove all sources of TB from the farm during that episode.  The Department proposal to address this issue by categorising these herds and only allowing trade with herds of a similar or lower status is not acceptable to farmers.  It is also not feasible to implement for a number of reasons, including severe disruption to the market for live animals.  This would potentially include serious implications for the vital live export trade for dairy farmers and suckler farmers and have devastating consequences for those farmers.</p><p> All farmers purchasing cattle must have confidence that the cattle allowed for sale by the Department, having met the requirements of the EU trade directives, are at an accepted low risk of being infected with TB.  It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure all measures necessary to remove the disease from a farm have been implemented before the farm is allowed to trade.  The effect on farmers during this process must be fully compensated for the impact of controls on their farm.  </p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in detailing the costs of the TB eradication programme, fails to recognise the full extent of the costs incurred by farmers.  To advance the discussion of the costs and benefits of the TB eradication programme in a fair and accurate manner, the Department must first recognise the full contribution of farmers to the programme.  The key and substantial contribution by farmers to the programme, not being recognised by the Department, is the cost of labour incurred by farmers in assembling cattle for TB testing, the associated production loss and disinfection requirements prior to derestriction.  It is notable that the only contributions made by farmers in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England and Wales to their TB programme are the contributions outlined above, which are clearly accepted and recognised by the relevant authorities in those countries.  It must also be recognised that Irish farmers are unique, compared to farmers in those countries, in contributing, directly, an additional &euro;35 million annually to the programme in the form of TB testing costs and disease levies.   </p><p> The labour and other associated costs incurred by farmers in Ireland's TB programme must be fully recognised.  TB testing on most farms extends to more than the assumed two days due to larger herd sizes and the dispersal of animals on fragmented holdings on smaller farms.  The annual TB test imposes additional labour requirements and, in some cases, time taken off work to facilitate testing.  Additional labour and costs are also experienced by herds where breakdowns occur in carrying out the obligatory disinfection.  The Department requires farmers to facilitate almost 9 million animal tests each year.  This can involve farmers assembling animals on up to ten occasions in a year.  All of this requires significant time and labour inputs.  The costs of labour alone, assessed conservatively at the minimum wage, provided by farmers the testing and disinfection components of the programme is &euro;20 million.  </p><p> It is also accepted that convening animals for TB testing impacts on the productivity of the animals and increases levels of animal health issues experienced on farms.  In addition, farmers are required to provide and maintain handling facilities to allow their entire herd to be tested in a safe manner.  All these incurred costs must be recognised as contributions made by farmers to the current programme.  The costs outlined show an additional &euro;20 million contribution made to the TB eradication programme by farmers which has not been recognised in the Department's published costings.  The real cost of the TB programme, therefore, is &euro;110 million annually.  Of that total cost, farmers contribute some 55%, the Department 41% and the EU 9%.  Farmers' direct contributions have increased since 2012 by &euro;4.513 million or 15%, while the national Exchequer and EU contributions have reduced by &euro;289,000 and &euro;1.337 million respectively.  When the benefits of the programme are assessed this level of funding leaves farmers with an unfair and disproportionate share of the costs in the TB programme.  </p><p> The suggestion that the benefits of export market access and improved productivity are solely farm-based is incorrect.</p><p>To estimate the value of a programme which supports a sector, it is necessary to look at the impact expenditure has in the sector in its entirety.  In addition, the benefits of eradicating TB from the national herd from a human health perspective must be included when identifying the beneficiaries of TB eradication and, by extension, the appropriate funding levels of all stakeholders.  The committee is aware of the income crisis on farms, in particular, suckler cow and beef farms.  There are a number of factors that are contributing to it that require significant Government intervention.  The current TB programme imposed on farmers by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is further compounding the severe income problem on these farms and can be avoided.</p><p> In addition to the proposals from the TB forum, proposals contained in EU Regulation No. 2016/429 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down rules for surveillance, eradication programmes and disease freedom from certain listed and emerging diseases have the potential to dramatically increase the cost of the TB eradication programme in Ireland.  The draft regulation lays down rules for surveillance, eradication programmes and disease freedom from certain listed and emerging diseases that will impact directly and primarily on farmers and their livelihoods.  In the draft regulation the European Union is proposing a 30-day pre-movement and post-movement test for TB for all animals from herds that are over six months tested in order for herds to maintain TB free status.  This targets the lowest TB risk herds in the country for additional controls.  There is no justifiable scientific basis for this measure in TB eradication.  In addition to the absence of a justified scientific basis for this measure to eradicate TB, the measure severely distorts the normal marketing of animals within Ireland and removes vital competition from the marketplace when associated additional costs and management practices are applied.</p><p> The Irish cattle herd consists of a large number of small-scale family farm establishments, with an average herd size of 66 animals based on the latest published Central Statistics Office, CSO, data.  These establishments are heavily dependent on the vital competition provided by the live trade for their animals.  The costs associated with a pre-movement and post-movement test requirement, or both, renders the live trade for the vast majority of these farmers unviable, removing vital competition from the market.  Most of these farmers sell less than five animals.  A pre-movement test will impose an additional cost of approximately &euro;100 to the sale.  For these low income farmers, this is economically unviable.  This requirement will impact severely on marts and throughput in mart sales as the additional costs and inconvenience will drive more farmers directly to factories, removing vital competition to the benefit of factories.  This proposal is not scientifically based and will be a major impediment to the competitive marketing of animals.  It could cost the Irish TB programme up to &euro;20 million a year, putting Irish farmers at a competitive disadvantage in comparison to other farmers throughout the European Union.</p><p> Irish farmers already incur a disproportionate cost burden under the TB programme in comparison with all other farmers throughout the European Union and will not accept this additional cost and anti-competitive measure imposed on them that will not contribute to eradication of the disease.  The 30-day TB pre-movement and post-movement test criteria for the movement of animals within member states must be removed and member states must be provided with the flexibility to apply appropriate measures, based on epidemiological risk assessments of the situation within their country, to determine how herds maintain their disease-free status.  The regulation must be consistent with the EU policy of simplification and member state autonomy.  It has to provide flexibility for individual member states to apply appropriate and practical measures based on the unique circumstances that pertain and the huge variation in production systems in each country.  The only beneficiaries of this proposal will be vets and factories at the expense of farmers, marts and the vital live export trade.  The proposal must be rejected outright in the interests of Irish farmers and scientifically credible TB control measures.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, his officials and Irish Members of the European Parliament must reject the EU proposal to impose a 30-day pre-movement test for animals leaving farms that are over six months tested.  </p><p> I will hand back to the president to conclude.</p></speech>

Farmers have supported and continue to support the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in eradicating TB from the national herd at an enormous direct and indirect cost.  However, continuation of this support should not be taken for granted if the key issues we have outlined are not addressed.  The IFA is demanding the eradication of TB from the national herd in the shortest feasible timeframes.  However, this cannot be achieved by further increasing the already enormous and disproportionate cost burden imposed on farmers under the programme.  The main contributing factors identified by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to the current stagnation of progress towards eradication can be addressed in a more practical and effective way that takes account of the farming dynamic in Ireland and the critical importance of animal movements and live exports.  This will require upfront investment by the Government in the short term in order for all stakeholders and beneficiaries to accrue the long-term benefits of early eradication of the disease from the national herd.  Our submission sets out in detail how this can be achieved.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their attention.  We look forward to taking questions.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Hugh Farrell from the ICSA to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#T00300"><p>I am joined by Mr. Eddie Punch, our general secretary, and Ms Nessa Fitzgibbon.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving us the opportunity to appear before them.</p> <p>  The ICSA is firmly committed to the goal of TB eradication, as is every other stakeholder at the forum.  However, we are adamant that TB policy cannot succeed if the collateral damage caused to farmers unlucky enough to find themselves with a TB outbreak is excessive.  We do not disagree with the target of being TB free by 2030, but all farmers are entitled to fair play.  More importantly, individual farmers cannot be expected to pay an unfair share of the cost of achieving TB eradication.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine presented a particular view of where the TB programme should go.  Some of it is a reflection of the TB experience in Australia.  Key ideas put forward by the Department included the highly contentious proposal to put herd TB history on mart boards.</p> <p>  On the farm representatives&rsquo; side of the table, the key issues were fair compensation, using the on-farm market valuation system; allowing independent valuers the freedom to do their job; improvements to other elements of the compensation programme such as the hardship grant and the income supplement; a more comprehensive strategy to deal with the role of wildlife, with a particular concern that wild deer were being ignored; improvements in efficiencies in collecting reactors; better communications to farmers on TB outbreaks and also to explain the measures and strategies underpinning the TB programme; and an acknowledgement that the farmers&rsquo; share of the TB programme cost was much higher than official figures when the labour costs associated with testing and other tasks related to TB were taken into account.</p> <p>  The key principles that must underpin any TB programme are as follows.  Compensation must be fair and reflect 100% of the loss sustained.  Wildlife factors need to be fully researched and the results acted on accordingly.  All farmers must be treated fairly and those who have outbreaks cannot be isolated or expected to carry an unfair burden.  Farmers pay a significant portion of the cost of the programme, but the benefits of TB eradication are much wider and benefit processors, livestock exporters and the economy in general.  These benefits should be reflected in the allocation of costs.</p> <p>  The information on TB status is sensitive and can devalue a farmer&rsquo;s livestock values.  Therefore, any sharing of such information must be approached with caution in an era in which data protection standards are becoming much more stringent.</p><p> We greatly appreciated participating in the TB forum.  There was considerable difficulty moving forward at times.  It felt one-sided at times where it was all pain and no gain for farmers.  I respectfully suggest that, while lessons can be learned from Australia, comparisons are limited by the scale of difference in farm and herd size, systems of farming, and climate.</p><p> The TB forum met seven times and there were also a number of bilateral meetings.  Arising from the process, an interim report was submitted to the Minister.  Our concern is that this interim report will be implemented while the outstanding issues on compensation, cost-benefit analysis, wildlife, including deer, and how to handle herd categorisation remain unresolved.</p><p> The ICSA is supportive of the elements of the interim report that were agreed, including the provision of biosecurity advice, breakdown communications, black spot action plans, and the importance of the badger programme.  However, the association believes that the outstanding issues are critical for farmers.</p><p> The first outstanding issue relates to wildlife.  While the introduction of culling of infected badgers has been the most significant development in TB policy for many years, the ICSA is still uncomfortable with badger vaccination as a medium-term replacement for culling.  The association also believes that higher levels of badger testing are necessary.</p><p> Our greatest concern is the Department's approach to deer as a factor in TB.  Its mantra is that there is no evidence that deer are a significant factor in the spread of disease.  Yet deer are undoubtedly a problem in black spot areas such as Wicklow.  The prevalence of TB in deer in Wicklow has been shown to be between 8% and 16%, according to two studies.  Outside of Wicklow, only three out of 73 deer tested were positive, which is a rate of 4%.</p><p> The ICSA cannot understand the Department's reluctance on this issue.  We believe it is urgent to conduct targeted research in this area with a view to developing a programme for more sustained deer culling in badly affected areas.  Even in Wicklow, where farmers are adamant that deer is a significant factor and where research shows higher than normal levels, the Department's approach is to leave it to voluntary culling, without any official intervention, which is not good enough.  The association believes we need urgent research into the role of deer and an appropriate Department-led programme to cull deer if research results warrant it.</p><p> Another issue is compensation and cost benefit.  The stakeholders&rsquo; forum did not resolve outstanding issues on compensation.  A proposal on herd information being put up on mart boards was highly controversial.  However, the amazing thing is that this proposal came from the Department, which did not seem to realise this meant decimating the value of livestock for farmers who had TB in the past but who are now clear.</p><p> No TB strategy will be acceptable or workable unless compensation is seen to be fair.  It was unfortunate that any credence was given to the notion that less than 100% compensation was the optimum strategy for TB eradication.</p><p> I refer to what the ICSA sees as the main points of disagreement on compensation.  There is concern that the Department is putting pressure on the independent valuers and second-guessing their valuations, in addition to the fact that both sides are entitled to appeal.  Upper limits on certain categories of breeding stock are unwarranted and lead to unfair outcomes for farmers.  The &euro;500,000 spent on sending departmental officials to marts to report on prices was utterly wasteful given that this information is widely available and could be done as a desktop exercise.</p><p>Limitations on the supplementary payments are a hardship in certain cases.  Income supplement should apply regardless of what proportion of the herd is removed, and the payment should apply from the date of restriction.  <i>Pro rata </i>payments should be made in respect of part months for income supplement in order that each day of restriction is paid for.  The income supplement rate for suckler cows of &euro;38 and for all other animals of &euro;25.39 needs to be increased significantly.  The hardship grant, which is to help with additional winter feed costs, is not payable to any farmer with off-farm income, which we believe is very unfair.  The forum has decided to get an independent report on cost benefit analysis of the TB programme and the on-farm market valuation, OMFV element.<br/><br/>The ICSA has outlined its view that farmers, in addition to their &euro;32 million financial contribution, also contribute a massive amount in terms of unpaid labour.  We have assessed the labour costs farmers incurred in testing cattle to be in the order of &euro;12.5 million.  If bookwork and other TB-associated tasks are taken into account, the figure is even higher.  The association believes that Department costs of &euro;26 million can be reduced.  Unfortunately, even though we looked for it, we did not get a breakdown of this substantial sum.  The association believes much money could be saved in this regard, through, for example, greater use of technical agricultural officers, TAOs, rather than vets, forcing factories to pay full market value for TB reactors that still end up in the food chain, and elimination of unnecessary duplication in staff deployment.<br/><br/>The next issue is herd categorisation.  Fortunately, the forum did not accept the idea of putting TB information up on boards.  However, we are concerned that herd categorisation needs to be managed carefully to ensure data rights are not infringed upon and that livestock in TB-free herds is not devalued.  It is unacceptable that codes are appearing on letters to farmers that indicate their herd risk status when most farmers have no clue what these codes mean.  It was agreed to review this, and a new coding system has been suggested, but we remain wary about what use these codes might be put to at a later stage.  The ICSA is also dubious about whether it is appropriate to look back seven years or more at a herd that has not had TB since and to infer that such a herd is less secure in terms of its TB risk.<br/><br/>The association is not happy that the interim report is now being taken as agreed without the outstanding issues being resolved.  We went to the forum on the understanding that everything would be dealt with and that nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed in full.  The ICSA wants the forum reconvened to examine the conclusions of the independent consultants on cost benefit and OMFV.  Outstanding issues relating to compensation need to be faced up to by the Minister.  Eradication of TB will not be possible unless there is a more robust response to wildlife infection such as the deer problem in Wicklow.  I thank members for their time.  We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that TB has cost farmers and the industry a significant amount over many years.  We have previously planned to have TB eradicated by certain dates, and a significant amount has been spent since those dates were put in place.  The latest date to be put in place is 2030.  Is that date achievable?  I ask the representatives of the IFA to respond first, followed by the ICSA.</p></speech>

The 2030 target is ambitious without the required level playing field.  The only people being continuously asked to increase their contributions are farmers, who are getting very little in return.</p></speech>

My neighbour has gone down with 110 animals since March in four tests.  He had one test in March, a blood test in May, a second test in July and another in September.  He is getting there, and currently only two of his animals are gone.  He operated a closed herd and never had TB.  Following an investigation, the Department thinks badgers are the cause, but we are still not sure.  That farmer is down &euro;20,000 a month in his milk cheque, but he only gets &euro;5,000 from the Department.  That is just an example of what is going on in everyday farming life.  Everyone seems to be paid out of the TB programme, including departmental staff and vets.  Farmers do not want to be paid for their labour, but it is not even recognised.</p></speech>

I understand the staff point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#W01000"><p>The target is certainly ambitious.  It is achievable if farmers' support for the programme is maintained, but it will require significant buy-in from those who are putting significant resources and finances into the programme.  That is why the proposals from the forum have been so disappointing for farmers, because they want to achieve eradication of this disease more than anyone.  It is disappointing that no effort has been made to bring them on this journey and implement the necessary measures to prevent outbreaks, which would require significant proactive investment in wildlife work, and deal at source with the problems on farms when first identified.  It is clear from the breakdown map of the country over the past ten or 15 years that outbreaks primarily occur in the same areas, as the Chairman will be well aware from his part of the country.  The Department's claim, therefore, that animal movement contributes significantly to the disease does not stack up based on the figures.  An environmental issue remains in those areas.  If the Department's claim were true, we would have significant problems in the fattening counties, but that is not the case.  Instead, we are finding TB in the Burren in Clare, a suckler area from which weanlings are sold, in Wicklow and in other areas with similar demographics.  The 2030 goal is achievable if the Department is prepared to invest in putting the necessary structures in place and support farmers on that journey.</p></speech>

However, that means equal partnership, where the wisdom and understanding of farmers who have suffered this disease for nearly 60 years is given equal respect.  They know what is going on.</p> <p>  I refer to the wildlife question.  In the past, we saw a step change and improvement once the badger issue was addressed.  There had been a continuous curve on TB, which stepped down significantly when badgers were dealt with.  We are now experiencing a similar problem with wild deer.  As has been mentioned, the same issues crop up in the same counties.  Our members are adamant that deer encroaching on land coincides with many black spots.  The Department is burying its head in the sand.</p><p>The phrase it uses - let us be careful about it - is that there is no evidence, but there is never evidence unless we look for it.  The ICSA is stating we should look back at what was done with badgers when important research programmes were undertaken in County Offaly, about which we all know, but, first, we have to establish whether there is a problem and then what would happen if we were to cull and get results.  The position is now the same with deer.  On testing, only three deer out of 73 were found to be reactors.  It is a ridiculously small amount of testing, but it still represent a 4% rate of TB.  It is the same as is in the cattle population and we all accept that there is still a problem among the cattle population.  The level of TB in deer in County Wicklow is lot higher because of a <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude there.  A committee has been set up and I hope some culling will take place, but this is not good enough.  There has to be a programme.  We do not say we should work away and that people can cull badgers if they like.  That will not solve the problem.  Is it achievable by 2030?  There has to be a major change in mindset to move to a partnership model.<br/><br/>These are small details, but they are significant.  We continuously come across members who say they cannot eradicate TB and that they need full herd depopulation.  Although, in theory, the Department is in favour of this, in practice it seems to be reluctant to grant it.  It is very frustrating for a farmer whose herd is breaking down repeatedly.  Of course, it is awful to lose an entire herd, but if a herd continuously goes down for a number of years, the farmer knows that it is not working.  If his or her view is that full herd depopulation is the solution, we find it strange that the Department is reticent to agree.  There should be a partnership.  Farmers should not be told what to do.</p></speech>

It may be for the Department to step up a gear with regard to biosecurity.  It is always on to farmers about biosecurity, but it does not move fast enough to deal with big or new breakdowns and lets the problem lie.  There can be a break of one or two months after a herd is tested and found to be clear, but the Department does not go back and use the history of the farm to depopulate it.  Is this led by cost control issues, rather than by the need for eradication?  We need to be very strong on this issue.  If the Department was prepared to spend more initially, instances similar to what happened in counties Monaghan and Cavan and others could be controlled.  A herd of 42 may leave a farmer's yard from which perhaps other cattle should also be taken, but the Department is reluctant to take them.  That is a question with regard to what is achievable by 2030.  Perhaps biosecurity standards might change the programme.</p></speech>

A huge amount of money has been spent on TB eradication over 70 years.  I think back to the eradication of brucellosis which was achieved by taking hard decisions and farmers having to spend a serious amount of money.  Thankfully, we did get rid of it.  It is fairly certain that if we continue what we are doing in the same way, we will not get rid of TB.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to a number of areas where I see huge difficulties with the scheme, as it stands, and where farmers suffer huge losses.  Young stock must be sold to feedlots.  We have live valuation of reactors, but I know of a couple of cases in my constituency in which the price offered for young stock is derisory and there is no comeback.</p><p>Thankfully, fodder is extremely plentiful as we head into winter, but many farmers do not have the infrastructure to carry young stock through it.  They do not have slurry storage facilities or a way to carry stock through it physically, even if there was enough food available.  If stock must be sold from a farm where there are reactors, there is a need to have a proper evaluation system.</p><p> The live valuation system agreed to ten or 12 years ago is not the same as what is being implemented now.  There is most definitely too much departmental interference.  The live valuation system should be independent.  It was introduced to give what the animal would make at the mart on a given day.  The categorisation of animals bears similarity to the beef grid.  It is a way of reducing the payments made for animals.  The live valuation system for reactors must be independent.</p><p> Badger vaccination has been mentioned.  Approximately 20 years ago there was a pilot project was in County Offaly and the results were remarkable.  The incidence of TB was greatly reduced.  Badger vaccination must be stepped up and increased.  If we are serious, we must stop badgers from being a transmitter of the disease.</p><p> I have raised the issue of deer culling on numerous occasions and cannot understand the Department's attitude to dear.  Yesterday I read in a newspaper that concerns had been raised about the amount of deer culling taking place and the figure of 41,000 was given.  I do not know whether it is accurate, but farmers in west Wicklow would have been delighted to see that figure.  A substantial number of farmers in west Wicklow have stopped keeping bovine animals because they could never be clear of the disease.  There are no longer statistics for the system because they do not have cattle to test.  The only conclusion on the Department to which I can come is that it is putting its head in the sand because of the cost of deer culling.</p><p> We will have a debate later on the amount of forestry we need because of climate change.  Forestry brings its own livestock and wildlife challenges and deer are definitely among them.  I have been on farms where there have been major breakdowns in the past 18 months and a large number of reactors have been taken out.  In all cases deer had grazed on the farms in previous months.  To say, therefore, that deer are not an issue is to ignore the reality.  The number of post mortems carried out on deer is extremely low.  Where they are carried out TB shows up.  If the rate is 3% or 4%, it is more than enough to cause the spread of TB throughout the country.  Deer travel over vast distances.  They can travel ten or 12 miles without any problem.  It is said badgers carry the disease and that deer transmit it, but it does not matter.  They are a vehicle for spreading the disease.  Therefore, if we are serious about controlling TB, the deer issue must be tackled.</p><p> If a herd is classified as being clear of TB, it is clear of it and there should be no second-class status when it comes to selling animals.  If there was TB in a herd six or 12 months ago and there have been two clear tests since, no other question marks should be placed over that herd.  If the Department is placing a question mark over it, we should look at the Department's door because if it had done its job correctly and the source of the infection had been cleared out, it would not be an issue.</p><p> To go back to the eradication of brucellosis, it was the pre-movement test that helped to get rid of it.</p><p>The pre-movement test got brucellosis out of the country.  I see in the submissions of both groups mention that cattle that are six months post testing should be subject to a pre-movement test.  I would accept that as long as the Department carries the cost of it.  What we have been doing until now has reduced instances of TB to a certain level but no further.  There is a 12-month period, after a test, for a person to sell his or her animals.  If the Department thinks this initiative can bring about a significant improvement, let it carry the cost.  It might be money well spent in the short term.  It will actually probably increase the number of reactors in the short term, but if the Department think this is a tool worth having, let it carry the cost of it.</p><p> The testing would obviously create an inconvenience for farmers.  Brucellosis was dealt with in the past at a serious cost and inconvenience, but we got rid of brucellosis and enjoy brucellosis-free status.  Some people said to us in the past that we would never achieve that status, but strenuous and rigorous testing got to it.  It cost farmers a fortune to get rid of it but it was successfully got rid of.  If the Department feels that cattle, six months after the test, are posing a risk to the health of the national herd, it should carry the cost of the pre-movement test.  I would like to see instances of cattle that have been moved into another herd and shown up as reactors, coming from a clean herd.  If that is the view of the Department, I would not rule it out completely as long as it carries the cost.</p></speech>

I would like to take the Chairman's question a bit further and ask both groups to elaborate a small bit more on the TB forum and the target of 2030.  Has the setting up of the TB forum enhanced the chances of eradication by 2030?  I am getting an impression from some of what I am reading here that there is perhaps a sense of "us" and "them" between our guests and the Department.  Is that hindering the process to an extent?  Is there a bit of a stand-off?  Is the forum a worthwhile exercise at all or is it a toothless tiger like previous fora we have had?  Is it making any impression on the ultimate aim of eradication?  If it is not and if our guests were in the driving seat or had more power in determining its agenda and functions in the future, what changes would they like to see?  As I say, from reading the reports of the IFA and the ICSA, the forum seems to be a talking shop where our guests and the Department are on opposite sides of the fence and not much progress is being made.</p> <p>  Compensation and the wildlife issue aside, which both organisations have documented very well here, is there one particular direction our guests would like to see the eradication programme going in?  What do they think would be the most effective change or direction for it to take?  We all know the issues when it comes to compensation and what it is costing the farmer.  We all know about the well-documented wildlife issues that seem to be the kernel of the issue in many areas, in particular the deer and the badgers.  Is anything else being missed, from our guests' deliberations within the forum, in particular?</p></speech>

No more than Senator Paul Daly, I want to hear our guests' thoughts about the forum and what they think it has achieved.</p> <p>  Has anything been addressed through the forum in the line of hardship money?  I know that people with a small farm might be working and, because they are working, they are out the door, so to speak.</p> <p>  I will address the issue of the badgers and deer.  There were eight or nine deer, eight or nine years ago, one of which went down with TB, and they were all got rid of at the time.</p><p>Let everyone who is watching understand this.  We are not saying that we need to get rid of every deer in the country, but if they were allowed to run wild and loose, they would take over a country.  Everything in moderation, even moderation itself.  We must make sure there is a certain amount of culling every year, especially in the blackspots.</p><p> The pygmy deer is a new deer in our country that I think originated from the East.  It has landed into places in Ireland and is causing more problems even than TB by frightening the daylights out of people.</p><p> What are the views of our guests on forestry?  Do they think the two things are running hand in hand?</p><p> I would like the thoughts of our guests on the following.  I have seen people who have been zero grazing over the past two or three years.  The cows would not be going out at all and large parts of their herds have gone down, which is baffling.  I do not know if the problem is the fresh grass that is coming in, or whatever.  Has any research been done on that?</p><p> We keep hearing there is plenty of money for destocking.  On the other side of it, I know one farmer who lost 40 cows and then lost 16 more.  A person must cut to the chase, sooner or later, and decide if he or she is going to destock.  At this time of year, considering the lengths to which a farmer has to go to stay destocked, he or she will be looking at next year, to put it simply.  Will he or she be back milking or another type of farming?  Farmers seem to be dragging their feet and saying that Dublin has to decide.  Dublin is getting the blame for it, that it is not coming up with the money.  Are our guests hearing that and facing it?  Are clear decisions being made around the country?</p><p> I agree with Deputy Cahill about testing.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  An animal could be sent to a factory, or whatever, and they could be told they had lesions even though they were clear on a test.  There could be another animal for which nothing showed up and, a few months later, it is a different story.  Many farmers just cannot get their heads around what is happening with the whole TB scenario.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#AA00200"><p>Deputy Cahill asked numerous questions.  Selling young stock into feedlots is an issue I brought up because many of them are worth very little.  Feedlots are generally buying strong cattle that will finish within 90 or 100 days and do not have risk attaching to them.  These ones here are taking the full risk.  Compensation, as was being spoken about, needs to be put in place where they are valued and sold in as if they were going down a reactor into a feedlot status.  On the other hand, perhaps compensation should be in place for feeding the remaining cattle on the farm, if they are young, if it is a suckler herd or a calf-to-store system.  They do not have the option of selling on.  It would preferably be compensation on going to a feedlot status and valuing a cow the same as a reactor would be valued.</p> <p>  The live valuation system was great when it was brought in and I question the changes that have been made in recent years.  There was a lot of resistance at the forum, more than there was at bilateral meetings.  Some &euro;500,000 might be spent by the Department just gathering information.  The valuers are qualified people, doing their jobs, like anyone else who is doing a job.  They are able to do the job they are licensed to do and that should be acceptable.  We have to accept farmers in a mart who are selling for us or whoever else, so the Department should not be questioning their valuations.  They are questioning the capability of those people as a trader or valuer.  We should not be tolerating that.  It is costing the taxpayer far more than it is gaining money for them.</p> <p>  Badger vaccinations are in certain counties at present.  They were perhaps supposed to have contributed a bit to the outbreak in Monaghan.  We are not sure of that, but it was mentioned at the time.  The vaccine is being given to the badgers that have been snared.  A vet then has to try to come out and give them that vaccine, and maybe an anaesthetic as well in case someone gets hurt.</p><p>All of that needs to be addressed.  The vaccine being administered is not freely available within the EU.  If it was, then anyone could administer it.  A proper cage or the like would save a lot of expense and may be more appropriate.  Another issue is that, when badgers receive a vaccination, an anaesthetic is used and they are left to recover, but hypothermia can set in during the winter or cold weather and some may die.  Since they have been given a live vaccine, a concern is that the cattle around them will pick it up.  We do not know enough about this.  Our greatest fear about administering a live vaccine has to do with the fact that the badger itself has never been tested, which means that we do not know whether it is carrying the disease.  If it is given the live vaccine on top of the disease, is that only spreading the disease further?  I do not know whether live vaccinations are<b></b>a good idea.<br/><br/>A deer cull was mentioned.  We have been pushing hard on this matter for a long time.  Some &euro;3.5 million of the TB fund is being given to the wildlife section.  That section never sat on the forum at any stage.  It never spoke for itself.  The Department spoke for it instead.  It is us - the ICSA - who need to take responsibility.  First, the wildlife section should control the number of deer in the country regardless of disease.  Second, deer are spreading the disease.  As we have heard around the table at this meeting, they are seen as contributing to it everywhere - Clare, Tipperary, Cork and even Mayo.  This needs to be taken into account.  There needs to be a project, just as there was in respect of badgers in Offaly, to identify and deal with the issue.  The Department needs to take responsibility for the deer situation.<br/><br/>In terms of the 3% or 4%, if there is a TB breakdown but a farm gets two clear herd tests, then it must automatically wait for six months until the next test.  At least, that is what farmers always believed.  I know of a man who went clear in November.  In January, he got a new letter stating that he would have a test by 3 February, but he had until 3 July.  Once 3 February came around, his herd was automatically locked down again even though he did not get a six-month break.  His income supplement was cut off because he was classed as having a clear herd.  A six-month break following two clear tests was always the wording used to describe a clear herd.  The herd has to be identified and the status needs to be removed.  Either a herd is clear or it is not.  People's incomes are being destroyed.  One is told that one has a window of two or three months in which to sell animals.  In his case, it was Christmas time and early January so there were no sales.  If he had gone looking to sell, the prices would have been bad.  The current timeline is unrealistic and must be reconsidered.  We must examine this issue and revert to the previous situation.  I do not know from where the law came.  It is not on the regular books.<br/><br/>I agree about carrying the cost of pre-movement testing.  We will push that matter further.<br/><br/>Senator Daly mentioned the TB forum.  I thought it was valuable to a certain extent.  It opened different views or doors.  Perhaps Mr. Punch will elaborate further.  There were groups with different vested interests around the table.  As time went on, we found that, where compensation or other real issues were concerned, only a certain element of people were willing to take money out of their own pockets - the farmer, the Department and the EU.  Why were veterinary, wildlife, forestry and other bodies, including Bord Bia, around the table when they were putting nothing into the programme?  They were able to help determine where the forum went.  That needs to be addressed.  The forum needs to be tightened up so that more people can have a say on the issue and the forum can continue.</p></speech>

It should be reconvened to discuss the cost-benefit analysis, on-farm market valuations and the wildlife issue.</p><p>To a considerable extent, however, TB eradication is a matter for farm organisations to thrash out with the Department.</p><p> I agree on several points raised at this meeting, for example, off-farm income being taken into account in the hardship grant.  A limit of &euro;250 is unacceptable.  Someone whose herd is locked up for the winter has a substantial additional feed cost.  The existence of a small off-farm income is not enough reason to say that a person has not been impacted by a TB breakdown.</p><p> The TB forum has been a useful exercise, but how it would arrive at decisions was not properly defined.  At many meetings, there was no consensus or the views of people who did not have skin in the game were taken into account in a way that should not have happened.  The farmers were paying a substantial part of the bill, so their views should have carried more weight.  We would raise questions about the forum.  For example, outside expert opinion might be useful to the forum, but it should not be a voting part of the forum.</p></speech>

A lot of time was put into it.  A professor from UCD attended and different issues were discussed.  It was all based on what happened in Australia in terms of catheterisation and the mart boards.  Every day it was conveyed, from different angles, that this was the way forward.  Too much time was spent at that instead of listening to the farming organisations, which pointed out that such an approach was not suitable for farmers in this country, and moving on.  We spent too many days repeating ourselves and a lot of time was lost.  We were never going to make up ground using that approach because it was not workable.  The numbers were too different - it was ranches against farms.  Much of the forum's downfall was the insistence on pushing that approach.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about forestry.  There is a grant for fencing forestry.  Normally, that fencing is only maintained for the first five years or so, especially where there is tree felling, but it should be maintained the whole way through because wildlife moves.  The grant even covers cheap fencing to stop small wildlife from moving across farms.  It should be compulsory.  Many of the farms in question are able to claim farm subsidies and the maintenance of a hard boundary should be scrutinised the same as on any other farm and addressed in terms of forestry.</p> <p>  Regarding zero grazing, a farm in Offaly lost a lot of cows.  The farmer maintained that it was because of the wildlife that was travelling across the farm.  A herd has the choice of where to eat in a zero grazing situation, as the grass is cut and brought in.  That is the biggest sign.</p> <p>  As Mr. Punch said regarding the hardship grant, &euro;250 is of no value to any farmer in today's world, particularly when off-farm income is included.  That income element will have to be removed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s Bourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019100100002#CC00300"><p>Senator Daly and Deputy Fitzmaurice asked what the IFA's view on the TB forum was.  To give some background in advance of the answer, when the Minister announced that he was setting up the forum, the IFA identified the key issues for farmers that it would have to address.  Fundamental was addressing the shortcomings in the compensation schemes - the hardship grant, the income supplement scheme and the live valuation scheme.  While the objective is to protect the 97% of herds that do not have TB, it cannot impose a higher cost burden on the 3% unfortunate enough to have it.  This feeds into the question of how we solve the problem.</p><p>We solve the problem by looking after the 3% and focusing the energies and the resources on supporting those men, not by stigmatising their animals or their herds, by categorising them and half-opening the gate to allow them trade with some farmers and not with others.  The onus is on the Department to rid that farm of the disease, as Deputy Cahill mentioned, and then allowing free trade.</p><p> The IFA's view is that the TB forum has failed farmers because it has failed to address the key areas on their behalf.  Furthermore, because of that it has failed to put forward reasonable or necessary control changes to attain the ambitious date of 2030.  The interim report published by the forum makes only two recommendations referred to as significant policy changes.  One is continuing the wildlife programme, which is already in existence.</p><p> In response to Senator Daly's question about what we would see as the most effective changes, there has been a lack of focus on proactively preventing outbreaks caused by wildlife.  That includes deer and badger that are being disturbed and stressed throughout the country by road developments, wind farms, afforestation and deforestation.  They cause outbreaks downstream in the places they move to.  As a result, farms throughout the country have new outbreaks every year.  If we are serious about eradicating TB, we have to stop new outbreaks occurring.  The Department must focus proactively in these areas and reduce the density of wildlife that is susceptible to TB and is infecting our farms.</p><p> The second point is heavily dependent on the Department investing in what it believes to be the solution.  The Department has put forward proposals that it says will achieve eradication by 2030.  If it is as confident in its proposals as we are, why does it not invest in the short term in supporting the farmers its proposals will affect?  Everybody would accrue a benefit in the long term if these proposals are to be so successful.  They need to go further.  If there are problems and difficulties on farms and in areas that have a poor history, these farms need to be fully supported and helped to farm their way through this.  They do not need to be stigmatised in the marketplace or derestricted, which reduces their eligibility for support payments, and restricted again three months later, which means the slate is wiped clean and the State has a significant saving in compensation.</p><p> It is the same for depopulation.  There are continuing outbreaks among farmers who are restricted for significant periods, derestricted, and restricted again, and there is a continual refusal to depopulate these farms.  Let these men clean out, disinfect and get back to normal farm practice.  Unfortunately, the decision seems to be based on finance rather than the veterinary view.  Nobody could say the Department is successfully addressing a TB outbreak that has continued for two or three years with maybe a two or three-month window of derestriction in that time.  TB is not being addressed on that farm.  That farmer is being held to ransom by the failure of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is not acceptable.  If that disease is in those animals, they all need to be taken out and the man let restock to kick off again.</p><p> As for zero grazing, I am aware of the herd owner who has been depopulated in Deputy Fitzmaurice's area.  It may or may not be a contributory factor.  The ultimate issue is that regardless of whether the herd owner was zero grazing, there was obviously TB in the vicinity, whether it was brought in or the wildlife got access to where the animals were being fed.  Zero grazing almost replicates what happens for six months every winter-----</p></speech>

The sale of young stock to feedlots has two effects on farms in a TB outbreak.  One is the restriction, which results in additional animals being maintained which adds enormous cost and difficulty.  The second is where significant numbers of animals have been removed and there is a significant income loss.  In the first instance, the IFA proposal is that the hardship grant scheme would recognise the additional costs associated with that and support the farmers through it, allowing them then to choose whether to sell the animals at a significantly reduced rate to the feedlots, which is their only option, or invest the support in managing and maintaining them.</p><p> The IFA position on badger vaccination is reserved, considering the experience in Monaghan.  The reduction in the numbers of badgers throughout the country has been very effective and has significantly contributed to the health status of the badger since the early 2000s.  It is hoped that vaccination will be the next phase.  We are concerned, however, because of the experience in Monaghan, which has continued for the past 18 months to two years with little indication of a significant improvement.  We have asked for a detailed analysis of the situation and for a detailed investigation to identify what has contributed to it, because unfortunately that area is consistent with the vaccination area in that county or the most difficult part of it.</p><p> The pre-movement test is an EU proposal for the clearest herds in the country.  A farmer in a problem is in a four-month test cycle.  This proposal precludes any of those herds from having to do that.  The highest risk areas in the country are not required under this proposal to do a pre-movement test.  In the areas with the lowest incidence, where there is only one test a year, no TB breakdowns, and the farmers are not contiguous, they are exposed to a pre-movement test obligation.  The Department's figures show that only 7.5% of breakdowns in the country annually are related to animal movements.  We are concerned about the return on investment of potentially up to &euro;20 million on a pre-movement test when we are looking for significantly less to address the compensatory deficiencies that will allow us to put in place meaningful measures in the problem areas to address this in the ten-year window set out.</p></speech>

We came from a high of 110,000 reactors in 1965 to 40,000 a year in 2001, when the wildlife programme was implemented, and we are now down to 15,000.  The Department representatives on the TB forum seem reluctant to deal with some of our problems.  All the farm bodies asked if the money could be front-loaded, because if the objective is to get rid of TB by 2030, it would surely cost less between 2025 and 2030 and that money could be front-loaded in the programme.  The Department was reluctant to do that even though the costs and benefits would decide who would pay what into the programme.  We found that incredible, and because our issues have not been addressed, we have not given our blessing to the interim report, but the TB forum seems to have gone ahead.</p> <p>  The Department was told that if the inconclusives were such a problem, it should take them out and compensate the farmer.  The Department was totally reluctant to do that.  If it is leaving the inconclusives behind, it is not serious about getting rid of the disease, because if there are problems in them, they will only resurface later.  There were six pilot areas for badger vaccination, Monaghan being one.</p><p>This was the area in which the incidence of TB exploded.  It was interesting to note that, after a while, it cleared more quickly in areas outside the vaccination area than inside it.  For that reason, we would be reluctant to give our blessing to the vaccination programme because there is something going on.  If badgers are being vaccinated in an area and the area beside it that it is equally as badly affected by TB seems to be cleared of the disease more quickly, that has to be explained, but it has not been.</p></speech>

The first deals the substantive issue of TB as it affects the national deer population.  A national deer management forum was established with an independent chairperson.  It held a number of meetings up until about 18 months ago.  Unfortunately, it has not convened since.  Its purpose was to establish, as suggested in the title, a national deer management programme to sustain deer numbers at levels that could be maintained within their natural habitat and to avoid increased interaction with cattle and increased disease risks.  The first component that must happen at the higher level, effectively outside the TB component and ERAD, to some extent, is the management of deer.  We must re-establish the national deer management forum and have some meaningful output from it.</p> <p>  The second proposal, in respect of which there has been some activity stemming from the forum before it ceased, was for targeted pilot areas.  Clearly, where deer are associated with a TB outbreak, the same approach applied to badgers has to be applied to deer, involving a density reduction surrounding the breakdown area.  It has to be co-ordinated by State agencies that have access to all of the information required.  Unfortunately, as referenced, deer cover a huge hinterland.  Therefore, there is no point in trying to manage deer on one or two farms specific to the TB outbreak.  One has to take in a far broader area if it is to have a meaningful impact.  That has to be done before we work on the national strategy because these instances are happening and have huge health implications on farms.  This second component needs to be addressed because we are aware of five to eight regions where the density of deer is at an unacceptable level because they are encroaching onto farmland.  If we fail to address the national deer population, when we sit here year next year, we will have double the population.  Ten years ago deer were specific to County Wicklow and one or two other regions.  Now there are very few counties which do not have some area iin which there is an issue with deer encroaching onto farmland, causing huge damage to crops, trees and fences and increasing the risk of disease.</p></speech>

Coillte also owns land and has indicated that it is unhappy with deer encroaching onto its forestry plantations.  There is an interesting question about who is responsible for the fencing of land.  Traditionally, if his or her stock encroached onto someone else's farm, a farmer would have said it was his or her responsibility to maintain or repair the fence.</p><p>Coillte does not feel it has any responsibility to fence its forests to stop deer coming through its plantation and going onto farmland.  We take a different view.  We believe Coillte must take responsibility.  It is a very profitable company.  Coillte says it does not own the deer so therefore it is not responsible for fencing them in.  The issue must be looked at.  It is a bit of a cop-out.</p></speech>

We made the strong representation that Coillte could not just wash its hands of it and allow its fences to fall down.  It speaks to the fact that if there is to be more afforestation the burden of fencing around forestry must be designed in the expectation that deer will be a problem.</p></speech>

Many forests tender out the culling of deer to various groups.  In the course of being hunted the deer are racing and they break down many boundary fences.  That is a big complaint coming from many farmers.</p> <p>  In response to what Deputy Stanley said on deer, our proposal was that the Department with responsibility for wildlife, through the TB programme, must take responsibility for the national deer herd and stop the expansion of the deer herd which is spreading the disease to farms.  We addressed the issue earlier.  This issue continues to arise because nobody wants to take responsibility.  It is not the responsibility of farmers.  If it were any other bovine we would all be responsible for them but wildlife is classed in a different way.  Someone has to take it on, whether that is the National Parks and Wildlife Service or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Pressure should be applied in that regard.</p></speech>

We have played along with it and supported it in every way we could.  That support from farmers cannot be taken for granted.  The cost to farmers currently is disproportionate.  It is up to the Department and the Minister to act.  If there had been an adequate response from the Department in time to bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, we would have addressed it at this stage but there was not.  We can at least learn from that.  It is up to the Minister and the Department to do something.  We have outlined what needs to be done in our submission.  Farmers will not be found wanting if the support and infrastructure are put in place by the Department.</p></speech>

The committee began the conversation on TB last February.  The farm organisations, including those present, requested that they would come before the committee.  We decided at the time that we would wait until the interim report issued.  Following the wait, we now see exactly whether progress has been made.  The departmental officials were in earlier.  We will bring them in again as soon as we can to see if we can get more answers from them on issues that remain unanswered today.  We have a clearer picture of the questions that need to be answered and how to progress to the next stage.  I hope we can hold such a meeting in the coming weeks to progress matters.  I thank the witnesses very much for their attendance today.  It is very much appreciated.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my acting chief executive officer, CEO, Ms Marion Kelly.  I am happy to answer any and all questions the members of the committee might have.  Ms Kelly and I have been working closely on this project and she will intervene wherever appropriate.  Our aim is to ensure that questions are answered fully and accurately.</p> <p>  The Irish Banking Culture Board was established to regain public trust in banking.  The only way banks can regain this trust is to earn it.  Rebuilding the confidence of wider society in the industry will require time, patience, courage and commitment.  I believe the board can play a key role in this process, through our own activities and through supporting and partnering with other relevant organisations.  I view the establishment of the board as a positive development and an opportunity not to be missed.  It is notable that 85% of the public and stakeholders who contributed to our public consultation exercise supported the establishment of the board.  </p> <p>  The board is a unique body.  Nothing like it has ever been established in Ireland previously.  The board is comprises individuals with very different perspectives and backgrounds.  All of them are stakeholders in the banking sector who have, for the first time, agreed to work together to improve banking culture.  We have created a structure that represents the best means to contribute to real and authenticate change in a way that delivers for the citizens of our country.  The fact that the banks are represented on the board, but in a minority, represents, to my mind, the best of both worlds.  The non-bank majority, who are representative of a cross-section of society, will ensure that the voice and perspectives of the public will be heard.  I believe that the changes necessary in banking culture have a far greater chance of being delivered because of, and not in spite of, the five member banks having representatives on the board.  </p> <p>  I am not of the banking world, so how did I come to be the chair of the Irish Banking Culture Board?  I read an advertisement in the newspaper, almost exactly one year ago.  It stated that the five retail banks in Ireland had resolved to establish such a board to act as a transformative influence on culture within the banking sector, focused on earning the public's trust.  It sounded to me like a very good idea and one not before its time.  I replied to the advertisement.  My appointment was entirely independent of the banks.  It was conducted by way of an open competition.  A selection panel was chaired by Dame Colette Bowe, the then chair of the United Kingdom Banking Standards Board.  She was joined by Sir Callum McCarthy, the former head of the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in the UK and our own Dr. Martin McAleese.  </p> <p>  I was appointed and commenced in the role of chair in January 2019.  My first task was to select and appoint the members of the board.  This selection process was, again, entirely independent.  The criteria, in my mind, as I was selecting and appointing the board included ensuring that its membership would reflect the feedback received during the extensive public and stakeholder consultations, while still remaining at a manageable size.  I was clear at the outset that each of the five founding banks had to be represented on the board by the most senior bankers.  Why did I take that view?  It was because the banks own the problem and they must own the solution.  I am convinced that it is through vigorous, open dialogue and concerted action between these senior bankers and the non-bankers of the board that true, lasting and meaningful change will occur.  </p> <p>  The composition of the board was announced at our launch on 15 April 2019.</p><p>It comprises 14 members, and committee members have had biographies of these people circulated to them beforehand.  Along with the five senior bankers, there are seven non-banking members, who represent a wide range of stakeholders in the banking sector.  They reflect what we heard during the public consultation process.  They are as follows, in alphabetical order: Ms Angela Black, chief executive of the Citizens Information Board; Professor Blanaid Clarke, a leading authority on corporate ethics from Trinity College Dublin; Mr. Padraic Kissane of Padraic Kissane Financial Services; Mr. Gareth Murphy, head of industrial relations at the Financial Services Union; Mr. Philip O&rsquo;Leary, managing partner at FitzGerald Legal &amp;amp; Advisory, chair of the Legal Aid Board and a lifelong advocate for consumer protection; Ms Sue O&rsquo;Neill, chair of the Small Firms Association and board member of Microfinance Ireland and; Mr. Martin Stapleton, chair of the national farm business committee of the Irish Farmer&rsquo;s Association.  Mr. Stapleton is a dairy farmer from Limerick.  The five senior bank representatives on the board represent a range of different skill sets.  I asked for that and I got it.  This includes a chief executive officer, a chief risk officer, a chief operations officer with IT and artificial intelligence expertise, a head of human resources and a head of consumer banking.</p><p> I refer to what we intend to do and why.  From the outset, we have been conscious that it was critical to ask for and, listen to, the views of societal stakeholders, including banking staff, and bank customers on current banking culture and how the Irish Banking Culture Board can work to change this for the better.  During our establishment phase, we conducted the extensive public and stakeholder consultation I have referred to.  We received 747 submissions from the public via an online survey, and we commissioned a survey of more than 25,000 bank staff.  We conducted 38 face-to-face interviews with individuals and organisations from right across society, including consumer organisations, small and large business, farmers, charities, youth groups, students, trade unions, rural interests, older customer groups, media, politicians and regulators.  Some of committee members contributed to these proceedings and we thank them for that.</p><p> Our objective in determining what the board should first focus on was to reflect the concerns and suggestions we heard from the public, stakeholders and bank staff.  We promised to address these concerns and that is what we are doing.  Our work programme up to April 2020 comprises nine key themes, each of which has been identified from the findings of our public consultation.  These themes are customers in a vulnerable position; services to bereaved customers; respectful and transparent communications; financial education and awareness; small medium enterprises, SMEs, including farmers; support for community and society; speaking up; embedding ethics and behaviour and; staff resilience and pressures.</p><p> During our work, we will partner as appropriate with the expertise in our member banks, with other relevant industry bodies such as the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, and the Institute of Bankers, as well as with other relevant bodies, to achieve our aims as efficiently and transparently as possible.  However, we will always be protective of our independence and our overall goal of being a trusted, independent voice and a transformative influence on banking culture in Ireland.  We will call out poor conduct when we find it and we will acknowledge good things when we can identify them.  The chief executives and boards of the five founding-member banks of the Irish Banking Culture Board have clearly and repeatedly committed to me their full support for the board and its activities.  The leadership of the banks recognises that this board is independent.  We do not speak for the banks.  We speak for the stakeholders of the industry.  We see ourselves as a critical friend to the industry in many ways.  We will promote an environment in which ethical behaviour lies at the heart of banking, values are restored, and a reputation for competence is rediscovered.  We will hold the banks to account on their progress.</p><p> I accept the scepticism that exists around this endeavour.  I am also a sceptic.  It would be difficult to spend 42 years in the practice of the law without developing a healthy degree of scepticism.  I have encountered a lot of bad places and bad people in my time as a judge and barrister in Ireland and as a judge at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  However, I have never lost my faith in human nature.</p><p>I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish men and women who work in the banking industry are decent, honest, honourable people who wish to serve their customers and their country well, to be an example to their families and friends and to feel proud of the work they do as guardians of a great national interest.  Our task is to help and empower them to regain public trust in the banks by pursuing the highest ethical standards and levels of competence and by ensuring the fair and humane treatment of customers.  </p><p> This is just the beginning.  A long road lies ahead but I believe that we have made a good start.  Identifying and changing culture is difficult for us and society.  We must dare to believe that we can do this.  Irish society and culture have changed dramatically over the years and bank culture must also change.  People today demand better of everything, including their banks.  We see ourselves as being part of this change in the banks, change that is not before time.  Embedding ethical behaviour in banking culture is an ideal whose day has come in Ireland and around the globe.  We dare to believe that we can do this.  We can and we will.  </p><p> Finally, should we be invited to return to this committee next year to update it on our activities, we would be delighted to do so to answer members' questions regarding our progress.  I again thank the committee for the opportunity to present the IBCB to the committee this afternoon.  We are very happy to take its questions.  </p></speech>

There has been no booing or clapping.  I am sure they will behave themselves.  The IBCB is a small group and I expect it to remain a small organisation.  One of the ways I want us to proceed is to be able to use the resources of the banking members of our board to press forward with our various working groups.  We are already doing that.  We have three working groups and another coming on Thursday.</p></speech>

It has changed radically from that.  It is almost what most people would call a full-time job for me.  As this board becomes established and settles in, this may tail off a bit.  When I was interviewed by the selection board for this, I was not asked to do so but I said that I would not take on any other work until this board was fully established and this is exactly what I have done.</p></speech>

The Deputy will appreciate that we needed to get the company incorporated etc., before we could hire full-time employees but that is the intention.</p> <p>  We are fully funded by the five founding member banks.  The contribution is in proportion to their relative size.  Our establishment has been fully funded by all five banks.  The establishment costs were of the order of &euro;1.6 million.  That was primarily to fund the consultation processes we entered into and to operate an office.

Her assistance in setting up the board has been outstanding.  She is a fairly senior banker and her knowledge of the banking industry has been of immense assistance to me.  Quite recently I made representations to try to have her kept on until we replaced her with a permanent chief executive.  I am very glad that I have been assured that will be done.  I cannot think of anybody who could have helped so much in setting up the board.  Had I brought in somebody new, he or she would have needed a long time to settle in.

Culture and ethical conduct are matters that are difficult to identify, difficult to strive for and difficult to achieve, maintain and monitor.  Doing the best that we can, it seems to me that if we can achieve openness, transparency and fair outcomes for customers we will be achieving success.  I honestly do not know at this stage to what extent we have to go in that direction in order to achieve success.  We are starting off a completely new project.  As I said, nothing like this has ever been established in Ireland before.  We are feeling our way.  We are going to learn to walk before we run but that does not mean that we are not going to be ambitious.  Our work programme might show that.  If anything, it might be called over-ambitious.</p></speech>

It begs the question as to what needs to change, arising from the handling of the tracker mortgage scandal.  From Mr. Justice Hedigan's perspective, what was wrong in terms of what the banks did and how they handled it and what should have been done differently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice John Hedigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100100002#H01100"><p>It should not have happened.  It was a truly terrible situation; that after all of the trouble we had had back in the early days with the collapsing banks and with efforts being made by everyone to try to regain some trust in the banking sector, that something like this should suddenly arrive.  The Deputy is quite correct.  I think it was the catalyst.  There was talk of setting up a banking culture board because the UK had set one up in 2015 or, interestingly enough, a banking standards board.  We see ourselves as somewhat different.  We do not focus so much on the staff, which is what the UK does, we are focusing on the customer, which I think is a better approach.</p> <p>  There was pressure on the banks to do something in terms of setting up a culture board and I think the tracker mortgage scandal situation sparked that and was the catalyst for it.  In terms of recent events in that regard, when I became aware of the letters that had been sent to the committee by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman concerning the invocation of time limits, I immediately emailed all the five banking members of our board in order to find out the facts of the situation.  I asked them which of the banks were invoking those time limits.  I asked those who were to please contact me to discuss what I described in the email as "this troubling issue".  Over the following days - it was less than a week - I was very pleased to see that all of the banks made public statements saying that they would no longer invoke the time limits.  Subsequently, Ms Kelly and I met the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to see what was going on, from his perspective.  He seemed to be satisfied with the way things were going.  I do not want to speak for him; he can speak for himself.  We got the impression that he seemed to be satisfied with the way things were going.  I hope that we played some part, perhaps in backing up the committee's interaction with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p></speech>

The Central Bank launched its investigation into the tracker mortgage scandal in late 2015, and since then there has been much foot-dragging by the institutions concerned.  What does that tell Mr. Justice Hedigan?  Even at the tail end of the process, the right of consumers to bring cases to the independent ombudsman and have a hearing with no predetermined outcome was being rigorously contested by some institutions.  Does that underline to Mr. Justice Hedigan the scale of the job he has to do?  It is a cultural issue.  The whole <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>for the IBCB was the tracker scandal, and yet its handling of it, right up to the present day, has not been satisfactory.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, but I got the impression that there might be a disconnect between the executive and legal levels in the banks.  To that end, at our most recent board meeting we resolved to set up a small group consisting of Mr. Philip O'Leary, a senior solicitor and the chairman of the Legal Aid Board, Professor Blanaid Clarke, and myself.  We will meet people from the legal services on an informal basis to find out what is happening, what the problem is, and what we can do to sort it out.  I understand the difficulties in-house lawyers have from my own experience both in practice and as a judge.  They are told to defend their clients, and then they are told not to, so it is a difficult situation for them.  This situation is not without the possibility of a satisfactory resolution.  I want this small group to get together in an informal way, try to hammer things out, and figure how to proceed in a way that would prevent executive people feeling like they are at war with the legal staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100100002#J00300"><p>I have two further points to make on areas I suggest Mr. Justice Hedigan and Ms Kelly look into.  One is the question of how banks deal with the breakdown of relationships.  We as politicians often encounter couples, whether married or unmarried, separating, and they might have a joint mortgage, for example, which can cause major problems.  It is a complex and difficult area in which communication is a big issue.  Problems also arise when one person wishes to remain in the home.  Though that person is prepared to pay the mortgage and is trying to get the other person removed from it, the bank will say that it is an entirely new mortgage and that the person staying has to qualify in his or her own right.  There are many issues around that.  I have made this point to the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland, BPFI, as well.  Banks should have an agreed protocol or mechanism for dealing with relationship breakdowns, particularly when it comes to joint mortgages, because it often involves a family home and children.  It can get very difficult.  It would be positive if the IBCB could play a role there.</p> <p>  One of the nine areas the witnesses are focusing on is customers in a vulnerable position.  The Mental Health Commission made recommendations in 2011 about providing specific training to staff within the financial services on dealing with vulnerable customers.  Based on the work Deputy Browne has done, those recommendations do not appear to have been fully followed through on.  We are often contacted by people in vulnerable positions, and the nature of the communication from the bank, even down to the way they are spoken to on the phone, can leave much to be desired.  I ask the witnesses to look into that as well.</p> <p>  I wish both the witnesses and their staff well, as they have a difficult task ahead of them.  There is much scepticism about this issue, which they have acknowledged.  However, it is a worthwhile effort, and my party and I support their efforts and hope they succeed.</p></speech>

Like Mr. Justice Hedigan, I, too, am a sceptic on this matter.  That being said, anything that might improve the culture within banks is to be welcomed.  However, I am very sceptical of this because it is about the banks and the industry trying to get out first.</p><p>It came about in light of the major tracker scandal, and when it eventually came to a head close to the Christmas period, this was one of the solutions put forward.  It allows for stopping more invasive action by the Oireachtas in respect of dealing with the culture within banks.  If one is in industry, it is always better to get out ahead so that one can control the game.  That is where some of my scepticism comes from.  Despite the bank having a number of very senior representatives from the industry, I note the board also has a number of capable and well-intended members.  I am sure the staff it employs are similar.  I ask the witnesses to outline initially for the committee their view of the current culture within banking in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have been in very dark places.  There were times when we thought we would not make it as a country and an economy, but we managed to come through.  I said at the time, and I still believe, that in respect of all the trouble we had, which we should not have had, right up to the present time with tracker mortgage scandals, I would like to think that that is yesterday's story and that today and tomorrow's story is what we are doing.</p> <p>  I share the Deputy's scepticism.  He might be more sceptical than me, although from what he said not much more.  However, it came into existence, and I am sufficiently cynical to agree with the rationale the Deputy put forward for the reason it came into existence, but here we are and we have a pretty powerful group of people.  Some of the heaviest hitters on consumer advocacy, particularly regarding banks, are on that board.  We would be very difficult to ignore at this stage.  The banks have had to create something, and we are it.  I have great hope that we will be able to effect considerable change.  Am I happy with the way things are now?  I can only say that all of the bank people I have met so far, from the highest to the lowest, seem to be very committed to the project in which we are involved.</p> <p>  In the course of my preparation for the selection process, I read of events around the world.  I studied very carefully what the UK Banking Standards Board was doing, and it was impressive.  I looked at what the Dutch were doing.  Apparently, they are the leaders in this area of cultural change in the banking world.  I looked at what was happening in Hong Kong.  I read the Australia Royal Commission report, which is scarifying, about how the banks were operating in that country.  I read what the people in New Zealand are doing, and I have read the reports from the New York Federal Reserve Bank's annual conference concerning matters of this sort.  That is why I said that effecting cultural change in banks is an ideal whose day has come, both here in Ireland and around the globe, and it does appear to be so.</p> <p>  So far, I have reason to be cautiously optimistic.  I am assured by the chief executives and the chairmen of the banks that they fully support this endeavour.  I have been told that, in effect, anything that we reasonably need in terms of financial backing we will get to do this.</p> <p>  All the staff that I have met seemed to be very enthusiastic.  I refer to the workshops we have had, especially in respect of bereaved customers.  There are 50,000 bereaved customers across the banking industry every year and a great deal of trouble occurs in that respect.  We want to have one standard level of care for all of those people so that, for instance, they do not have to keep ringing different people and explaining again that their husband or wife has just died, or much worse.  When we met, three people from our board volunteered to be the nucleus of that working group.  Each of the banks sent their people along who were expert in that area.  It was a truly uplifting discussion.  The sheer vigour and enthusiasm of everyone and the knowledge of the people who were there about the problems that arise in cases of bereavement was very impressive.

He spoke about the banking crash, banking culture, the tracker mortgage scandal and what he referred to as yesterday's story.  Given that the board's <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>is to effect culture change, we need to understand where the board believes the culture is within the bank at this point.  One could be forgiven for suggesting, as Mr. Justice Hedigan did, that the issues are yesterday's story and that the culture is fine.  CEOs have appeared before the committee and told us their companies are all people centred, customer focused and so on.  If that is the case, what is the point of having a culture board?  Is the culture in the banks toxic, as some people have described it, or is it at a level less than that?  Where does Mr. Justice Hedigan consider it to be?  What is the rationale for the existence of the body if he believes there is not a serious problem with culture within banks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice John Hedigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100100002#L00300"><p>I did not say that.  There is a serious problem with culture but I meant that we are looking to the future to try to do something.  Nobody understands better than the seven non-banking members of the board, to whom the Deputy referred, the disastrous situation that has occurred.  When I was a judge sitting in the courts, particularly when I was a member of the High Court, people appeared before me in tears.  I fully acknowledge that Deputies are closer to the coalface than we judges are, given that Members hear about such cases all the time from their constituents, but I have had some distressing experiences in court with poor devils in terrible situations and I understand all the trouble there was.  Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a pragmatic idealist, an optimist, and someone who has not lost his faith in human nature.  I believe we can turn the matter around.</p> <p>  As for the current banking culture, I can only say the bankers I have met at the top level, that is, the chief executive officers and chairpersons, have assured me they are fully committed to it.  I can believe that because even if there was not a moral element, the Shearman &amp;amp; Sterling report on banking conduct, which was published in March 2019, stated that between 2009 and 2017, financial institutions globally paid &euro;345 billion in fines and penalties.  That is no way to do business.  It is just total incompetence and has to be addressed.  If one wishes to take a hard-nosed view, bankers have good financial reason to change, irrespective of any moral dimension.  I believe they do have such a dimension, however, although I will not name names.  The chief executive officers I have met have assured me culture is at the centre of their thinking because it is the only way to regain public trust, which they have to do.</p></speech>

Two of the senior directors in the banks to whom Mr. Justice Hedigan referred, and which fund his organisation, used obscure arguments to try to frustrate their customers' attempts to make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  The customers were entitled to make the complaints because of legislation, which I brought in and which was passed virtually unanimously by the House, that allowed them to make such complaints, which the banks had told us they would facilitate.  Do CEOs tell the IBCB, on the one hand, that they are pro-culture and in favour of the board's work while, on the other hand, they fight the banks' customers?  How can the IBCB square that circle?</p></speech>

We conducted two detailed consultation processes in advance of establishment to get the baseline in that regard.  We carried out a detailed survey of 25,000 bank staff, which is the full staffing across the five founding member banks, asking them about the current internal culture of their own organisations.  We have a whole series of findings from that which we published in a report.  That forms the basis of what we are going to do.  Likewise, we carried out extensive public and stakeholder consultation and asked people their current view of the culture within Irish banking, what they thought needed to change and what they would like our organisation to focus on.  Again, the findings from that consultation form the basis of our work programme.  That is what we are hoping to address pragmatically in the coming months.</p></speech>

I note what was said about the board's intervention regarding banks fighting the ombudsman on allowing those cases to be heard.  KBC was fighting 27 cases and Bank of Ireland was fighting 50.  I assume that when the board contacted the CEOs of the banks, they said upfront that theirs were the banks involved.  The board contacted each of the CEOs or each of the banks.  Did they indicate to the board immediately that theirs were two of the banks involved?</p></speech>

I circulated an email to the five members of the board asking them to let me know whether their banks were invoking these time limits and, if they were, to contact me because I wanted to discuss this troubling issue.  In the following week, all five banks announced they were not.  In fact, I discovered subsequently who was and who was not involved.  It was only at that stage that it was clear by a process of elimination.</p></speech>

The intervention is helpful from Mr. Justice Hedigan in that regard.  Where I differ from him, however, is in the statement that he issued.  In his opening statement, Mr. Justice Hedigan said the financial institutions and banks needed to regain trust.  He referred to the scepticism because his board is funded by the five main banks.  It is an industry initiative.  Therefore, the board must also gain trust with the public.  Putting out a statement that the culture board welcomed the bank decision to waive the mortgage complaints timeline was wrong.  There was no ability for them to do that.  They were fighting the ombudsman and had no legal basis to do that.  It was never actually determined in law whether they were right or wrong.  The legislation is very clear and provides that it is three years from when one becomes aware not three years from when one had suspicions of the event.  It is three years from when one became aware.  The KBC and Bank of Ireland idea that a person ringing up ten years ago to say he or she thought he or she might not be on the right tracker rate had awareness is not correct.  That was not awareness, it was a suspicion.  However, the board came down on the side of the banks on this.  It came down on the core argument to suggest there was a problem.  I would welcome Mr. Justice Hedigan's insight as a judge in that regard because if there is a problem with the legislation, we need to address it.  The board did not call out the culture of the banks when they were trying to argue a point of law which had not been adjudicated in court and on which the financial services ombudsman had a different view.  As the author of the legislation, I also have a different view.  However, the board dealing with the culture of the banks did not call that out.</p><p>That was a serious first mistake because it showed the culture of the banks in the here and now.</p></speech>

Our aim is to learn from our mistakes.  As I said, we want to learn to walk before we run, but I am not sure I agree with the Deputy's analysis of the situation and I do not think the Ombudsman does either.  The situation that was made quite clear to us was that unless the Ombudsman was told that his jurisdiction was not being challenged under section 51 - the time limitation - he was obliged to investigate whether there was a delay involved.  The complaint he articulated to Deputy Michael McGrath was that it took him as long to do that as it would take to conduct the investigation.  I do not know if there is a misunderstanding at work, but I do not agree that we came down on the side of the banks.  The banks made no representations to me.  As soon as I heard about this affair - I was deeply troubled when I did - I emailed all those who were invoking the time limits and asked them to come and talk to me about this troubling issue and said we would see where we would go from there.  The whole issue then evaporated because they made their statements indicating that they would no longer do so and I am happy enough with that.  Whoever was responsible for it, whether the board, the committee or members of the committee alone, I do not mind as long as what happened happened.  It is a good step forward in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to labour the point that anybody who reads his statement could infer that the banks did a good thing by waiving that right, but the banks were completely in the wrong.  They were in the wrong as opposed to being consumer-focused and customer-centred.  I will not labour the point, but, if one wants to build trust where there is a clear issue of inappropriate culture at very senior levels of the bank, one must be willing to call it out, regardless of who is sitting in the courts or supplying funding.  One must be willing to call it out in a way that will gain the trust of the public.</p></speech>

If that is the way he perceived it, others also perceived it in that way, although that was certainly not what was intended.  As far as we are concerned, the board does not come down on anybody's side, other than that of the customer.  We have things to learn as we go along.  The Deputy is right that we have to earn the trust of the public and that we must be careful about what we say.  I assure him that there is no possibility, as it were, of our coming down on the bank's side on any issue.  We are on the side of the customer.  That is also what we demand of the banks.</p></speech>

There are 1,200 cases before the Ombudsman and others are and will be before the courts.  Those cases, although yet to be adjudicated on, involve people who, rightly or wrongly, feel let down by the system and the banks.</p> <p>  The customers of some banks have challenged them legally.  The banks are settling out of court with a confidentiality clause that means that there will be no knock-on effect on the other cohort of customers who fall within the same category.  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman has no insight into any of this.  It has no information.  One person may reach a settlement on the steps of the High Court, including a confidentiality clause, and the bank probably does not acknowledge that it has arrived at a financial settlement.  Mr. Justice Hedigan and I both know that means that the bank is, at least, reducing its risk, or it thinks it may lose in the courts.  Another person may go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman the following day with a mirror image of that case and the Ombudsman has no idea what is happening.  The banks are not offering the same settlement to the other cohort of customers.  Does Mr. Justice Hedigan have any concern about that type of culture which is as much about the bank reducing its liability as it is about what the banks tell us they are about and doing the right thing on behalf of their customers?</p></speech>

I find it a troubling issue and do not like the sound of it.</p><p>It is something I would like to look into further and is the sort of thing I hope to be able to discuss with this small ginger group that I am talking about.  This will get together initially to have a good conversation about what are the problems that lawyers in the banking sector deal with.  That is certainly one of the topics I will raise with them.  I have not come across that being mentioned before in the context of banking and the tracker mortgage situation.</p></speech>

Is this more an issue for the Central Bank?  I am conscious that the board does not want to be flooded with what other agencies of the State can deal with.  On the broader issue, there have been settlements on the prevailing rate and on the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.  All of the other thousands of customers do not know this because those settlements are confidential,</p></speech>

We are not a complaints or disciplinary body or a regulator.  We are going to be small because I believe that is the best way to be effective.  When we are sent details from a particular person of a complaint against the banks, we have a protocol worked out and we have a liaison name in the case of each bank.  We pass that complaint on to that particular person and we ask the member of the board from the bank in question to come back to us at some stage to let us know what has actually happened here.  We then notify the person who has complained that this is what we have done.  Is there any other aspect of this that we need to know about?</p></speech>

If there is an issue of a lack of fairness and transparency, that is clearly something we should and could look at.  As the chairman has mentioned, we are setting up a working group with the legal departments from the different banks.  One of the things we want to explore in that process is that while the letter of the law may say one thing, what is the right thing to do by customers.  This might be a good example of something that we could look at in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100100002#O00500"><p>I will finally ask a question on the tracker mortgage issue.  Some of these cases will be dealt with on a legal basis and it is to be hoped that others will get satisfactory resolutions at the level of the ombudsman.  In 40,000 cases, the banks have had to put their hands up, state they had wrongly taken money from their customers and to pay that money back and compensate them.  Many of the cases before the ombudsman relate to the level of compensation or the rates onto which the customers were put back.  On the culture of the banks, I probably speak with personal experience as one of the first people to challenge one of the banks on the tracker mortgages issue.  The reason for this was that an extended family member of mine was one of the first victims who came to the ombudsman on this issue.  They are still with the ombudsman after all of this time, even after the bank has acknowledged the wrongdoing but it has not dealt with it properly.  There are many people like that.  I understand, as Mr. Justice Hedigan has mentioned, that as a judge, one will hear the cases.  When one sees this material at first hand, however, when one sees what opportunities people missed out on, when one hears what happened and one lives through or shares part of that, one can then see the damage the banks have done.  After all of their apologies, we still have a large group of people who have taken cases the ombudsman.  We have 1,200 people who have taken cases to the ombudsman.  Before this tracker mortgage investigation started, there were only 18.  If some of these cases are resolved by the ombudsman, thousands more will go in because not everybody who is unhappy is taking a legal case.  What can the board do to satisfy itself that the culture that currently exists within the banks is the appropriate one?  Mr. Padraic Kissane, who has appeared before this committee many times, has talked about banks that have put customers back on the prevailing rate.  Indeed, I imagine he is representing some of the those who are taking cases to the ombudsman.  These are people with serious financial experience, who understand all of the detail and sit on the Irish Banking Culture Board.</p><p>Is there something the board can do to satisfy itself that the cases it is fighting through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman are appropriate to the culture Mr. Justice Hedigan believes the bank should be adopting?</p></speech>

He indicated that they had speeded up the process for dealing with cases.  It is disturbing, therefore, to hear about the Deputy's relative's experience.  I do not understand it, but he can rest assured that Padraig Kissane's interest in the tracker mortgage scandal has not been diminished one whit because of his membership of our board.  They are all heavy hitters and I listen to every one of them, but when we talk about tracker mortgages, his voice is the one one tends to listen to.  We are certainly hoping to bring our influence to bear as favourably as we can to ensure fair customer outcomes in this matter.  Several of the CEOs involved in the tracker mortgage scandal have made clear to me that they want to get this thing off their desks.  They want to have it sorted out and the only way to do that is to provide fair outcomes for people in order that they can move on.  We are pushing an open door.  I would certainly use the skills of somebody like Padraig Kissane who understands more about it than most people to try to resolve it.</p></speech>

I would never question whether Padraig Kissane, as a member of the board, was in any way a less passionate advocate for consumers.  I know that Mr. Justice Hedigan was not suggesting that, but it is not a question of how speedily the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman deals with complaints.  The issue is that the banks have not resolved these issues and that their customers believe they must go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, something that will take time and something the banks will fight, although that may be the wrong word to use.  They will provide strenuous arguments against their customers as to why they should not be put on a certain rate or offered additional compensation or deemed to be affected by the tracker mortgage scandal.  The banks will fight their customers.  Is there a role for the board to go back to the banks to ask whether, looked at from the point of view of the culture it expects of the banks, all of these cases should be fought through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, as opposed to being dealt with as if a bank was customer and consumer-focused?</p></speech>

We do not have a group that is dealing specifically with tracker mortgages, but I hear what the Deputy is saying and there may well be a way by which we might perhaps bring more pressure to bear in that regard.  That is what the banks are there for.  That is what I want them there for, in order that the non-banking people can bring pressure to bear on the banks to come up with solutions and explain them to us and in order that our board members can say it will or will not work or suggest a better way.  We may be able to focus more on this issue.  It is part of the reason we were very keen to come here because I understand the parliamentarians in our democratic system are probably closer to the people than in any other democracy of which I am aware.  Therefore, at the coalface they hear a lot more than we do.  I am grateful for the Deputy's comments in that regard.</p></speech>

We do not underestimate the challenge in trying to change culture in any organisation but particularly the banks which have been coming before the committee for several years.  It reminds me of trying to shovel the snow while it is still snowing.</p><p>There are many outstanding things that need to be dealt with.  I am aware that the board does not have a regulatory role as such, as does the Central Bank, but I believe that the easiest and fastest way to change the culture is for honesty and admissions around what has gone wrong and where it went wrong.  As for the behaviours we are trying to change now and the behaviours that make up that culture, we must remember that in other countries, people are serving time in jail for those exact same behaviours.  This is why the witnesses will forgive us for having some degree of cynicism around all of this.  Mr. Justice Hedigan spoke of the board trying to achieve and promote an environment in which ethical behaviour lies at the heart of banking.  This is what we all want to achieve from here.</p><p> I have a couple of questions to frame that.  The committee received evidence on 28 June that contained an admission by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales that its advice to British and Irish banks on accounting for non-performing loans did not comply with company law.  We approached the Irish banks about this and they advised members that they were not concerned about it and there was nothing to see.  This is astounding given that as a result of this flawed advice, Irish banks were forced to sell mortgages and home loans to vulture funds at substantial discounts.  If the banks are taking this attitude, is it reasonable to assume that the culture of the banks remains as "let us see what we can get away with regardless of the consequences for the consumer"?</p></speech>

The issue of the sale of non-performing loans gives rise to a lot of very complicated and difficult problems.  On the one hand the European Central Bank requires the Irish banks to bring the percentage of their non-performing loans down to below 5%.  The banks are having to do a lot of sales in this way.  I am aware of the fact that the rights and privileges under a contract will move to the new purchaser, the so-called "vulture funds", but I am also aware of the fact that it is much harder to try to organise a restructuring of a mortgage with a vulture fund.  Such funds do not seem to be quite so able to do that as are the banks.  On the other hand, if a person just wants to settle a loan, the vulture funds are much easier to deal with.  The inability to restructure has recently come into question and I have been told that in fact the funds are in a position to do that.  This leaves me in a position where I am not sure what the situation is.</p> <p>  To be honest with the Senator, it is news to me about the advice the banks got from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.  I had not heard that before and do not know anything about that.  It is very interesting to hear, but I had not heard it before.  As far as the non-performing loans are concerned, it is a worry, but on the other hand I can see the problem that is there.  The so-called "securitisation" process, by which banks operate the sale of sections of their portfolios, has long been regarded as a way of controlling their exposure to risk.  That gives rise to problems where, after the loan has been sold, a person might want to restructure his or her loan but finds that it is much more difficult to do.</p></speech>

We do not have any role there.  That is directly between the banks, as a commercial operation or if the regulator is looking at it.  This topic came up quite frequently during the public and stakeholder consultation engagement.  Concerns were expressed about how people understood what was happening, for example, if their own loan was being sold as part of a sale of a portfolio of loans.  One of the working groups we are establishing is on respectful and transparent communications.  It is one of the issues we want to make sure is clearer for people and that if these types of activities are happening, that the process is explained clearly to individuals in order that they understand exactly what is happening, how it is happening and who they need to talk to - if they need to do so - as to what rights they still have on foot of the transfer.</p><p>As a lot of the feedback we received was that this had not been communicated appropriately, that will be a key part of our working programme going forward. </p></speech>

This committee always has tried to encourage the position that NPLs would not just be sold off but that banks would try to work with the customers to work things out.  The witnesses have noted that members know a lot about this matter.  The same applies to the witnesses in respect of their role and in terms of the judicial system.  I have sat in on these court cases and they have first-hand experience of what it is like to deal with some of these banks and how the banks would choose to sell loans at a hugely discounted rates rather than to give it to the original customer or give him or her a discount.  I am sure the witnesses will be familiar with all of those behaviours. </p></speech>

The Senator has made a very good point.  When I first came across such instances, I could understand the degree of bitterness that people felt at not being given the same discount.  I do not know the answer.  Perhaps it is very difficult to do that on an individual basis as opposed to putting together a whole portfolio.</p> <p>  Certainly, one thing we are focusing on in every issue we come to is fair outcomes for customers, that is, that they be treated fairly and respectfully.  There always will be repossessions.  That is the way it is going to work.  I have had people in front of me for whom I would have loved to do something but I could not.  The one thing that I could do was to adjourn the case for six or eight months but that would do them no good and would only put off the evil day.  Extremely serious moral dilemmas like that face everyone involved in these matters and I am very sensitive to that issue.  The question as to why one does not get the discount that vulture funds get is a very good one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-01a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019100100002#R00400"><p>Another question is on why they are not obliged to pay tax on that, which is a conversation for another day.</p><p>I know that the witnesses cannot comment on specific cases that are before the courts but my next query is relevant to Mr. Justice Hedigan's previous role.  We have heard evidence from one group, which gave very strong evidence before this committee and subsequently supplied affidavits that were lodged with the High Court, which successfully secured a judgment when the judge outlined the following in his ruling:</p><blockquote>As an aside, I would have thought that a competent mediator could bring sense to bear and mediate a solution to the dispute between the parties.  If the parties are committed to doing business with integrity and in accordance with the regulatory requirements that exist, then what possible obstacle stands in the way of both sides starting on a new page even if some re-arrangements and compromises are required of both sides?  Large banks and financial institutions, and smaller ones, wish the public to forgive the past and to move on with a positive attitude.  They should lead by example.  What the parties have enjoyed in business together ought not to be lost if it can be salvaged.  That exercise in itself might serve to help restore in the public mind the trust and confidence and faith that they should have in banks and financial institutions and which is being slowly rebuilt with effort over and above any required to solve this ongoing dispute.  That may be a high minded and naive recommendation on my part but it is something I would urge on both sides in any event.</blockquote> <p>That sounds like an imminently sensible judge.  Indeed, officials from the Central Bank also told the committee that after examining the evidence in this group provided, that &quot;clearly there were cultural issues there and there was pressure on selling&quot;.  So we have culture, integrity and a judge giving sensible advice on this matter.  The ruling dates back to February, which is almost eight months ago, and since then no attempt has been made by the bank to mediate.  Surely this is a perfect opportunity for banks to take the judge's advice and show the public they are changing?</p><p>I cannot understand why the banks would refuse to take that very strong suggestion from a judge to sort out and resolve some issues.  As the witness has said, we have to move on.  The people involved in this, however, cannot move on.</p></speech>

I cannot comment on any individual case.  That would not be appropriate.  For the last seven or eight years I represented the Irish courts at EU level on the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary.  I worked on a number of different projects around improving mediation and alternative dispute resolution.  It was my intention when I retired last October to turn around the other way from regulation of the area at a European level to becoming a mediator.  I got myself accredited by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution, CEDR.  I am a big believer in mediation as a way of solving problems.  It is infinitely preferable to almost any form of dispute that would come before a court for all parties if they could only realise it.  I would certainly encourage banks or any other parties to look at the many different alternative dispute resolution systems that are in existence, and try to avail of them.  I remember when I started in the Law Library my master used to say that very few people regret a case they settle but many people regret a case they fight.  If one can possibly mediate, do it.  I could not agree more.</p></speech>

I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

I said that I had only one question: "Who appoints the board?"  Dame Colette Bowe replied: "You do, if you get the job".  It was made clear to me that I was, effectively, going to design this old-new system.  I had plenty of examples to look at.  I went to London and met the people there to see what they did and what we could learn from them.  I had been given a reasonably good steer in that we were calling our board an Irish banking culture board.  This was a very different thing from an Irish banking standards board.  Ireland had plenty of banking standards and regulations and it did not stop all of the trouble.  It was a cultural thing, what was inside people's hearts and what people do when no one is looking, that was causing the trouble.  Other than that, because it was set up as a banking culture board I had an open page to do whatever we wanted.  I believe that what we have set up is the most effective way we can bring our influence to bear on the banks through the five banking members on the board interacting with the seven non-banking members, where we can raise all of the problems that arise in the industry today.</p></speech>

We do not want it to have any teeth.  Our job is to work with the banks and essentially to move hearts and minds.  That is the role of this board.  It is a unique body and nothing like it has ever been set up before.  It is the way culture is being embedded in the banking system around the globe.  Trying to work with the banks is the approach being adopted.  This is why I said that we plan to be a critical friend.  This was a phrase that came from one of our workshops.  One of the people who had a lot of problems with the banks and who wanted something to happen suggested that this is the right approach, to be a critical friend, the kind of pre-Christian anam cara person who created modern confession - or at least modern since medieval times - a friend to whom one would confess all of ones sins and discuss all of ones faults and failings.  Always remember, however, that for confession to have any meaning there has to be a firm purpose of amendment.</p><p>That is our role.  We are trying to persuade people and to move minds and hearts.  I am optimistic that this will happen.  From all I have seen so far, the pragmatic and idealistic approach seems to be effective.  We will see.  Time will tell.</p></speech>

The regulator is the body to deal with the kind of thing referred to by the Senator, namely, being given false or wrong information.

As I mentioned, I am aware of the fact that for some it is beneficial.  If someone wants to get rid of a loan completely, he or she can avail of a great write-down by a vulture fund that one will never receive from a bank, but if someone wants to restructure, it is a big problem.  I have been given to understand, quite recently, that may be changing and that some of the so-called vulture funds may actually be introducing ways of helping to restructure.  That is something on which we need to keep an eye, but, as far as we are concerned, insofar as it falls under the heading of fair outcomes for customers, it is an issue in which we are interested.</p></speech>

It is hugely important that we see the type of change they have outlined for us.  Five banks are involved - Bank of Ireland, AIB, PTSB, KBC and Ulster Bank.  Someone asked how much each bank contributed.  I think the answer given was that each bank made a contribution, according to its size.  It would be worthwhile letting people know the actual amount each bank gives.  The banks also give to the Irish Banking Federation, IBF.  When we asked each of the CEOs of the banks to tell us how much they gave to the federation, every one of them, except the CEO of KBC, stated in writing that they gave to many such organisations but that they would not tell us the amount.  KBC told us that it gave &euro;127,000 a year.  Let me explain the reason it is important to put the figures in the public domain.  It helps people to understand exactly what is going on.  Ms Kelly said the establishment costs were &euro;1.6 million.  How much does each bank give each year?  My question is reasonable.  It is information that should be in the public domain.</p></speech>

I want to put my experience on record.  As bad as the banks are, and I believe they are very bad, the vulture funds are even worse.  One cannot get through to them by phone.  One cannot speak to a human being at any stage during the course of this.  It is almost impossible for the ordinary citizen of this State who wants to resolve his or her affairs to deal with a vulture fund.  They are untouchable.  I can give Mr. Justice Hedigan several examples of attempts that I made on behalf of people - not my constituents but generally throughout the country - to try to help them to resolve issues.  The banks in some cases do not even tell the client that their loan is sold.  The major problem we have is that the banks are outsourcing their dirty work and are allowing the vulture funds to appoint receivers and go to the courts for eviction orders.  They are using the courts and the courts are not helpful to individuals who appear before them.</p> <p>  Recently, I was in the High Court with a family, and I have been there a number of times as well as to the Appeals Court, and it was shocking.  I thought that it would be conducted in a far different way.  For a friend or supporter of people who attend the court, even though it is moral support, to be denied any right of audience or any comment in an extremely difficult situation is something that judges should review.  I am not saying this because Mr. Justice Hedigan is a retired judge and is here before us.  It is a view that I have having examined and been present in the courts.  It is not a recommendation I would make to any individual to go to court.  I found it so disturbing for families how justice is administered, and I would have great concerns.</p> <p>  I would love to find a vehicle that was independent like the IBCB that would look at all the stakeholders.  The IBCB has a firm on board with it from the commercial-legal end of things.  The judges should be asked as well.  Again, this is not just because this is Mr. Justice Hedigan's background, but I have seen cases where the paperwork from the banks has been appalling, and yet they will not admit it.  They allow a lie to be compounded by another lie or misleading fact or whatever it is, and the citizen, who is relying, perhaps, on a McKenzie friend, has no advantage or support whatsoever.  The banks use this for referring their cases to the courts and then they are almost forgotten about.  The legal process, the solicitors and the barristers take their own course and the banks are sometimes not even familiar with it.  They do not even know the hardship that they are dishing out to their own customers, customers who perhaps tried to settle their accounts or reach some settlement with the banks.  Once it goes to court, they do not have the money.  They are a beaten docket when they go to court and they are often beaten down by the banks that bully and harass them, and it is still going on.</p> <p>  I admire the work that Mr. Justice Hedigan is undertaking but he is in quite a pit of company that he would not normally work with, I would say.</p><p>That is why I go back to the issue of transparency and the cost of the operation.  The judge said that when he was involved in Amnesty International, his motto was "as unthinkable as slavery".  What is happening to Irish citizens is as unthinkable as slavery.  The judge may think that is harsh, but I deal with it at the coalface every day and the culture that has been established and passed on to the next generation of bankers is shocking.</p><p> The vulture funds have hired young people who are learning the business.  I sat in at a meeting with a vulture fund to make an appeal for a family and the young woman said, "You owe us X and we want it."  The man was trying to explain his situation and settle, but she did not care from where he got the money, whether he had to ask his neighbour, friend, mother or father or the credit union.  She just said, "We want money, money, money."  I will never forget it.  I thought not only was the culture out of control but that it was being passed on to a new generation of bankers.</p><p> When the bankers come here, they say with a great presentation of sincerity, "My God, we don't do business like that."  They do.  They are shocking and hate being called out, but they have not changed.  I am not lecturing the judge about this, but it upsets me greatly when I see what they are still doing and I cannot get over the fact that they are still getting away with it.  I understand how people are sceptical about the work the delegates are doing because of how the banks have infiltrated every place.  I would like to hear the judge's view on some of my thoughts.</p><p> I have learned so much at this committee and it has been a steep learning curve.  One of the things that shocked me at the beginning of the tracker mortgage crisis was that the Governor of the Central Bank told us that there were 3,800 affected.  It turned out that there were more than 30,000.  Some families have been treated so appallingly that they are broken.  Some have special needs children and made special cases to us.  They have had to pour out their hearts.  They are the very people in the banks with whom the judge now finds himself dealing.  I will not be going for a pint with them.</p></speech>

I hear what he is saying.  I understand entirely that the Deputies are at the coalface and meeting their constituents to discuss their problems.  As a judge, I did not have quite the same level of exposure, but, like some of my colleagues, I had people in tears in my court.  When I could not do anything for them, I called them up to the bench to let them to tell me their whole story in order that they could see a human being had actually listened to them.  That was the best I could do in some circumstances.</p> <p>  All I can say in response to the matters raised so well by the Chairman, with such obvious personal pain, is that we will do the best we can to try to improve the culture in the banking sector.  That is our challenge.  We dare to believe we can do something good and move things on.  It is a global phenomenon.</p><p>We are not on our own but we are very close to the head of the posse because not too many other countries have set up anything like this.</p><p> At the beginning of August we were invited to Stanford Graduate Business School's principled leadership summit.  That was the first international recognition of our existence as a board and it was at the highest possible level.  We were the only organisation like that there.  Present were some of the biggest banks in the world and some of the largest companies, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and so on.  I took that also as a vote of their confidence that our board could do something.  I can assure the committee we certainly are going to try our level best.  That is why I said that if I am invited again I would be happy to come back here next year to answer any questions the committee may have and to outline our progress during the year, including some of the problems we may have encountered. </p></speech>

All the feedback we have received has informed the basis of our work programme for the first year, considering how people are communicated with, how they access information, what happens if they are in a vulnerable situation, for example, if they are in arrears, have lost their job or have a personal issue that affects their relationship with their bank.</p> <p>  We also focus on ethics and behaviour to make sure staff at all levels in the bank are trained in what is appropriate and ethical behaviour from the top down to new people coming in the door.  That is in our work programme.  We work very closely with the Institute of Bankers to make sure those training programmes are delivered throughout the banks.  Our chairman mentioned earlier that we also intend running sessions with the legal teams of banks, so that they understand not just the letter of the law but what should be done for customers.  That is very important in showing the cultural change we are committed to supporting.</p></speech>

I do not want to over-egg this but I do want to make clear that our experience here is that bankers are a heartless bunch, they do not know how to spell fair and their mindset is so trapped in beating up the customer that I do not know how the board will do them the favour of releasing them from that kind of make-up.</p> <p>  Maybe I should not do it, but I read a lot of the papers that clients of banks bring to me and see what they have tried to do with the banks.  What strikes me is the amount of information that banks send out to their clients in answer maybe to a freedom of information request.  It is never all of the paperwork.  Without going into any detail the Bank of Ireland recently gave out so much paperwork on a second occasion that the case the client had against the bank was proven.  The bank had been sitting on it all the time.  It then said to its customer that it would not write to him anymore and he was left to battle as a lay litigant.  That brings us to the courts and the McKenzie Friends issue and practice direction 72, introduced by, I think, Mr. Justice Peart; it is in the public arena so I do not mind saying it.  It needed to be talked to.  I am mightily impressed that the judge would engage like that with individuals in his court and try to show them the two things that are never mentioned in this room by the banks, humanity and compassion.  They do not have a clue what they are doing and they are wrecking society.  They are still at it.</p><p>He should not underestimate the banks.  As he is doing this, they are outsourcing their dirty work, they are still condemning people to a lifetime of poverty and they are reckless in their abuse of their position in the face of families in society that are crumbling.  It really disturbs me.  I wish Mr. Justice Hedigan well.  He is welcome to come back.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the Data Protection Act was enacted on 25 May 2018.  On foot of that Act, it is necessary to make updated regulations under section 60 to provide for certain restrictions on obligations of controllers and rights of data subjects for important objectives of general public interest in respect of the work of the Central Bank of Ireland.  Similar restrictions that the Central Bank relies on are in place under the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 5(1)(d)) (Specifications) Regulations 1993 and, on foot of the resolution sought, they will be replaced by the draft regulations before the committee.</p> <p>  The proposed regulations restrict, in limited circumstances, the rights and obligations provided for in specific provisions of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  These restrictions apply only where necessary and proportionate to the need to safeguard specified important objectives of general public interest pursued by the Central Bank of Ireland "relevant objectives" set out in the regulations.   </p> <p>  These relevant objectives include, for example, regulating financial service providers and markets, protecting the best interests of consumers of financial services, supervising or enforcing compliance with financial services legislation, carrying out monetary policy functions, and contributing to the stability of the financial system.</p><p>The regulations provide the bank with the necessary powers to protect the public against harm arising from dishonesty, malpractice, breaches of ethics or other improper conduct by, or the unfitness or incompetence of, persons currently or previously authorised to work in the financial services industry.  <br/><br/>To give a very real life example, these regulations are vital to allow the Central Bank of Ireland to investigate whether individuals in regulated financial services providers have committed wrongdoing to customers, and to record where they have found breaches by individuals so they can be prevented from taking on similar roles in the future.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2018 Act, the Department consulted extensively with the Data Protection Commission and the Minister for Justice and Equality throughout the drafting process in order to assess the necessity and proportionality of the measure, and to ensure compliance of the proposed measure with EU law on data protection.  This consultation involved a cross-functional liaison group led by officials from the Department of Finance and consisting of officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Data Protection Commission, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and the Central Bank of Ireland. <br/><br/>Following that consultative process the Data Protection Commissioner wrote to the Minister for Finance to confirm that pursuant to Section 60 (11) of the 2018 Act, the commission has identified no matter which is of significant concern in relation to the proposed regulations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has also acknowledged his agreement with the proposed regulations.  Section 6(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Act provides regulations may be made only if a draft of proposed regulations is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  I thank the Chairman for the time of the committee here today.</p></speech>

The example we gave was that these restrictions could apply where the exercise of the right may interfere with the prevention, detection or investigation of breaches of the enforcement of compliance with financial services legislation.  These regulations are vital to allow the Central Bank to investigate whether individuals in regulated financial service providers have committed wrongdoing to customers.  The restrictions could also apply where, for example, the exercise of the right would disclose that the Central Bank of Ireland is carrying out certain tasks and that such disclosure may prejudice the achievement of a relevant objective.</p> <p>  To put this into context for the Senator, if the Central Bank is investigating an individual, and the individual may know of this, that individual could require under the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, to have all data relating to that person deleted.  The issue here is to ensure that the Central Bank is allowed to investigate and to see somebody's financial services' past.  It is something that is essential.</p></speech>

It is a very important piece of Brexit legislation relating to the stamp duty that applies for the trading of shares.  There is a quite an amount of money, potentially, on the line.  Would the Chairman consider the matter for pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee, please?</p></speech>
