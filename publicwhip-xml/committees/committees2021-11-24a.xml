    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#A00200"><p>I welcome members participating in today's committee meeting in line with the exceptional measures that we have to put in place due to the pandemic.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and they will notice that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge people not to move any chair from its current position.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation in this.  Any member participating remotely in the meeting can only participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Paul Murphy, Louise O'Reilly and Matt Shanahan.</p> <p>  Today's business is to resume our discussion of the general scheme of the sick leave Bill 2021.  At present, there is no statutory obligation for an employer to pay for a medically certified absence of an employee due to illness.  While many employers provide such sick pay, employees who do not receive it are disadvantaged.  We also know that it may encourage such employees to attend work even though they are ill.  In the context of the current public health situation, this is particularly undesirable.  The proposed Bill will provide for the creation of an entirely new right to sick pay, which will be legally enforceable through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the courts.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  From IBEC, we have Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employer relations, and Ms Pauline O'Hare, senior employment law solicitor.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, we have Dr. Laura Bambrick, social policy officer, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Today, however, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised that they make take legal advice on this matter if they think it is appropriate.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions that are given.</p> <p>  The opening statements from IBEC and ICTU have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Ms Maeve McElwee to make opening remarks on behalf of IBEC.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#A00300"><p>IBEC welcomes the opportunity provided by the joint committee to comment on the sick leave Bill 2021.  In addition to the statement we will make today, we intend to provide the Department with a more detailed submission setting out the views of our members on the Bill as it progresses.</p> <p>  IBEC contends that the introduction of statutory sick pay poses a significant cost to employers, particularly small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and those sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  We understand that it is the Government's intention to develop a scheme that is fair and affordable with minimum complexity and administrative burden for both employers and the State.  However, IBEC submits that the introduction of statutory sick pay, in the manner proposed, will give rise to a disproportionate cost burden to employers.  This is at a time when businesses continue to contend with the challenges posed by both Covid-19 and Brexit.  There are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.</p> <p>  While the Bill provides an exemption for employers that already operate a company sick pay scheme, the criteria for determining whether an existing scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay are so stringent that they will likely result in many employers being faced with the cost of administering a company scheme in addition to the payment of statutory sick pay.  For this reason, IBEC submits that the Bill as currently drafted will place excessive costs on employers, regardless of whether businesses have existing company sick pay schemes in place.</p> <p>  The Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of prescribing the daily rate of statutory sick leave payment.  As the regulations will not be published until the Bill has been enacted, we do not have full sight of what the prescribed rate will be.  However, we understand from the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, and the general scheme of the Bill that statutory sick leave payment will be at a rate of 70% of the employee's normal rate, subject to a daily earnings threshold of &euro;110.  The daily threshold is based on 2019 mean weekly earnings of &euro;786.33 and equates to an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16.  The Department has stated in the RIA that setting the rate at 70% is to ensure excessive costs are not placed on employers, which in certain sectors may also have to deal with the cost of replacing staff who are out sick at short notice.  However, the proposed payment is undoubtedly favourable when compared with sick pay schemes in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland where statutory sick pay is paid at a rate of &pound;95.85 per week.  Further, while the Government's stated intention in setting the sick pay entitlement at this level is to provide a minimum level of protection to low-paid workers who may have no entitlement to company sick pay schemes, basing a statutory sick pay entitlement on an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16 goes beyond protecting those who are low paid.</p> <p>  The Bill provides for an entitlement to three statutory sick leave days, which may be increased by ministerial order.  IBEC understands from the RIA that the Government's intention is to increase the number of statutory sick leave days to ten by 2025.  While the phased introduction of this cost is to be welcomed, IBEC submits that a potential increase in costs of &euro;1,100 per employee per annum is excessive.  This amount does not recognise the costs to the business of replacing staff who are absent on sick leave, often at short notice.</p> <p>  The entitlement to statutory sick leave in the Bill is granted on a per annum basis.  IBEC submits that this entitlement should be specified to be within a rolling 12-month period rather than in one calendar year.  This is a common feature of company sick pay schemes.  Should an employee take three statutory sick leave days at the end of December and then become entitled to another three days of statutory sick leave a week later, in the new calendar year, this would be financially difficult for employers.  The extension to ten days, as indicated, will exacerbate this issue for employers, with greater challenges again for those with peak trading over December and January.  This is particularly the case for SMEs which do not already operate a company sick pay scheme and therefore may be disproportionately impacted.</p> <p>  The Bill provides that the entitlement to statutory sick leave arises once an employee has completed 13 weeks of continuous service, which is a significant reduction from the six-month service requirement proposed in the general scheme.  This is a matter of concern for IBEC and its members as many company sick pay schemes do not take effect until an employee has six months of service and-or has passed a probationary period.  A recent survey of IBEC members found that 60% of the 307 respondents who operate a company sick pay scheme had a six-month service requirement in place.  Of particular concern is that the exemption in respect of company sick pay schemes only applies where the company scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay.  As a result, employers with a service requirement in excess of 13 weeks will be required to pay statutory sick pay of up to ten days per annum in addition to any entitlements arising under the company sick pay scheme.</p> <p>  IBEC welcomes the principle of the non-application of the obligations under the Bill to employers which operate company sick pay schemes.  However, section 9 as currently drafted undermines its effectiveness.  IBEC submits that an exemption from paying statutory sick pay should apply where an employer operates a company sick pay scheme that is no less favourable than statutory sick pay.</p><p>Where the employer&rsquo;s scheme is at least equivalent to the statutory entitlement, it should not be required to pay twice.</p><p> Second, the matters which are stated to be taken into consideration when determining whether a company sick pay scheme is more favourable are overly stringent and will exclude many employers that may operate very generous sick pay schemes.  Specifically, as noted, company sick pay schemes often include a service requirement of six months or more.  Company sick pay schemes often do not apply until the fourth day of absence, in line with the payment of illness benefit, and they often operate on a rolling basis, whereas the statutory entitlement set out under in the general scheme is based on a calendar year.  While the general scheme states that the benefits must, as a whole, be more favourable to the employee, it appears likely that very generous company sick pay schemes may fall outside the scope of this section 9 exemption where certain terms of the scheme differ from the statutory sick pay requirements.  This could result in employees who already have generous sick pay entitlements under their contracts of employment receiving an overlapping increased sick pay benefit at a disproportionate cost to their employer.  The unintended consequence of this wording is that employers will likely seek to mitigate costs by reducing benefits over the statutory requirement or offering lesser terms to new employees.  This in turn would threaten industrial relations stability in the longer term.</p><p> IBEC and its members are concerned that although the Government intends the statutory sick pay scheme to be fair and affordable, for many companies, above all SMEs, the introduction of statutory sick pay will present a disproportionate cost burden, particularly in the current environment.  That cost will only be heightened where companies have the additional cost of replacing skills, with little or no notice, lost during a period of sick leave.  While IBEC supports the exemption of companies that already operate company sick pay schemes from the obligations of the proposed Bill, it appears from the current drafting that many employers who already operate sick pay schemes will not be in a position to avail of this exemption, which is of great concern to our members.  IBEC submits that any statutory sick pay scheme that is introduced must be sustainable and not represent a disproportionate cost.  In this regard, as much of the detail that will affect IBEC members will be set out in the subsequent regulations, IBEC will be seeking to engage with the Department on their drafting.  It is vital that IBEC is consulted in order to ensure that any proposed statutory sick pay scheme is fair and affordable, as well as manageable and operable, for employers across the board.  The scheme should include the introduction of tools for managers to be able to operate the scheme, manage and address issues that may arise around sick pay, none of which is currently included in the legislation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#B00300"><p>On behalf of ICTU, I thank members of the committee for their invitation to input in to the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the sick leave Bill 2021, which provides for statutory sick pay.  My colleague Mr. Liam Berney will join us later following his meeting with the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, if time allows.</p> <p>  First, the congress wishes to acknowledge the work of Department officials and the collaborative approach taken throughout on the design of the new scheme, including by this committee.  In the brief time available for my opening remarks, I will focus on key outstanding issues for ICTU and highlight differences between what is provided for in the draft Bill and what was indicated as intended in the general scheme of the Bill, which was published in June of this year.</p> <p>  Section 2 of the general scheme provides for the meaning to be ascribed to terms used in the body of the proposed Bill.  Like all employment legislation, the scope of what is provided for extends only to those employed on a &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;.  The definition of that term, for the purposes of this legislation, is taken from the Terms of Employment Information Act 1994.  This is a narrow definition and confines the scope of the proposed Bill to those employed on conventional contracts of service.  ICTU recommends a better and broader definition of a contract of employment, namely, those provided by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  Both definitions are much wider than the one now proposed.  Paragraph (b) of both definitions extends to atypical forms of working arrangements and is more akin to the notion of a worker in European law and the definition of a worker in UK law.</p> <p>  Section 5(2) of the general scheme provides employees with an entitlement to up to three days of paid sick leave per year.  While ICTU acknowledges that it is the clear intention of the scheme design that after 12 months, the three days will automatically move to five, then seven, and ten days in 2025, we are concerned that three days, not ten, will always be written into the legislation.</p> <p>  Section 5(5) provides that the service qualification for entitlement to statutory sick leave is 13 weeks&rsquo; continuous services.  Head 6(2)(a) of the draft scheme provides that the entitlements created by the proposed Bill will commence when an employee has completed six months of continuous employment.  Both cannot be right.  The congress recommends that the qualification period be kept to a minimum so as not to stall labour market mobility or create a perverse incentive for employers to dismiss workers before they come into qualification.</p> <p>  We are further concerned that the proposed Bill provides that the service qualification be based on continuous service.  Certain groups of workers routinely have their service broken by their employer.  One example is the thousands of early years professionals working in early childhood care and education, ECCE, or preschool services on 38-week contracts, who are forced to sign onto social welfare during the summer.  ICTU recommends that the wording be deleted or amended to ensure such workers do not have to build up their entitlement year after year and are repeatedly left without coverage for months on end.</p> <p>  Section 5(8) provides that all sick leave must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.  While the requirement to have the sickness certified is common practice in statutory sick leave schemes throughout the EU, Ireland is unusual in that workers have to pay for primary healthcare.  Very few people in employment are covered by a medical card or a GP visit card.  The Healthy Ireland survey wave 5, commissioned by the Department of Health, shows that an estimated 14.6% of people, or one in seven, aged between 18 and 64 working for payment or profit - that is, employees and self-employed people - hold a medical card, while a mere 3.6% hold a GP visit card.  In recognition that the out-of-pocket expense for a GP visit will create a barrier for workers exercising their new right to paid sick leave, the congress recommends that the final version of the Bill include provision for limited periods of self-certified sick leave.  Self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick leave.</p> <p>  Section 7(2) merely provides that the daily rate of statutory sick leave, and the maximum daily amount payable, are to be prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister.  However, head 7(1) of the general scheme provides that the daily rate is to be 70% of the employee&rsquo;s daily rate, subject to a maximum of &euro;110 per day.  This can be varied by the Minister by regulations made under the proposed Bill.  We recommend that the legislation further require the Minister to consult with the social partners annually on the adequacy of the daily rate, income cap and income floor to ensure adequacy and its interaction with occupational sick pay schemes, and to report to the Oireachtas on the outcome of this consultation.</p> <p>  Section 9 of the draft Bill provides, in effect, that the obligations imposed on an employer are not applicable where the employer provides employees with a sick pay scheme which is more favourable than that prescribed by the Bill.  Many contractual sick pay schemes provide for waiting days, typically meaning that no payment is made for the first three days of illness.  ICTU recommends that, rather than excluding the application of the legislation completely where more favourable contractual schemes apply, obligations under the Bill would not apply in respect of any day on which the employee is entitled to be paid by his or her employer under the terms of a more favourable sick leave scheme.</p><p>Section 10 of the Bill provides for the granting by the Labour Court, of an exemption from the requirements of the Act.  This is now a standard provision.  Congress recommends that in such circumstance the employee is fully compensated from the Social Insurance Fund and a debt is raised against the employer in the same ways as when a payment is made under the redundancy and insolvency payment scheme with employers that are still trading. </p><p> Having convinced the Government of the necessity to introduce statutory sick pay, the priority for congress is now to ensure that the new scheme will protect workers' health and income and bring a basic employment right in line with European norms.  It is this that informs our recommendations to the committee today.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to take any questions. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#C00200"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  This is a very welcome discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in very much welcomes the introduction of a sick pay scheme.  It is long overdue and it is good to see employers and unions working collaboratively to achieve this goal.</p> <p>  Could both witnesses comment on why Ireland has been an outlier for so long when it comes to the provision of sick pay?  We quite rightly often hear from IBEC in terms of making sure we are not an outlier in respect of investment in research and development compared to our European colleagues but we have been an outlier for decades on the subject of sick pay.  Why has this been the case for so long?  </p> <p>  One of my key concerns about this Bill is the practicalities of it, particularly regarding workers requiring certification from a GP.  Let us be practical here.  Right now, if a worker is sick, he or she is not going to get an appointment with a GP today.  In fact, he or she will be lucky to get an appointment this week.  That is the reality we must recognise.  We must also recognise that unlike our colleagues across most of Europe, where there is no charge to access a GP, here we are looking at anything between &euro;60 and &euro;80.  This means that the first day's sick leave pay is effectively gone because the person has had to pay it out for a doctor's certificate.  This is clearly a barrier to workers accessing the scheme.  Would it not be better to go for a limited self-certification period for the first couple of days not just because it would be the right thing to do in terms of not punishing workers by having them pay &euro;60 but also because it is simply not practical to expect a worker to be able to access a GP on the same day he or she is sick?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#C00300"><p>Regarding the reason why we are out of line with Europe, I know the issue of statutory sick pay has been reviewed over many years.  This is not the first time it has come up for broader consideration.  I presume that as with any of these issues around employment rights and terms and conditions that apply, all of these things get looked at.  They look at the principle around our social protection system, the fact that illness benefit was always paid by the State and the fact that there are other provisions to support employees that may not necessarily be in place in other states.  There are probably a very significant number of factors that give rise to that.</p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s point about certification on day one is of considerable concern to us as well.  Like the Senator, we recognise the challenge for people getting access on day one to certification in a non-emergency situation.  Nevertheless what is really important to recognise here, particularly when we are overlaying a statutory sick pay scheme on existing company pay schemes is that most company sick pay schemes do require certification after the waiting days, which are typically three.  They always require that certification to be produced on day three and do not accept backdated certificates because technically, it is very difficult for a GP to know how sick someone was three days ago so that certification always comes on day one.  </p> <p>  It was recognised in a number of the initial consultation papers we received that management of sick pay also helps to manage absence and it was introduced as a positive consideration about the introduction of statutory sick pay, in that it would assist employers in managing absence.  However, there are no provisions in this Bill to assist employers in managing absence and address concerns employers may have around the veracity of sick leave taken, how it is taken or whether there is an abuse of sick leave that is ongoing.  Other pieces of protective legislation recognise that these situations do arise &ndash; not all of the time but they do arise and they do need to be managed and addressed.  This is probably the only piece of management support within this legislation as it currently stands and I know employers would be very concerned to see it removed, albeit we do recognise the challenge around a medical practice being able to issue a certificate on the same day.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#C00400"><p>The last time the introduction of statutory sick pay was looked at was when the troika was in town.  When it went through our books to look for potential cost savings - to put it diplomatically - it looked at how we provide workers with sick pay.  The troika identified that we are really unusual throughout Europe in that our Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost of workers&rsquo; sick pay from day one &ndash; day one minus the waiting days.  In other countries, the employer is entitled for a short period.  If the illness lasts longer than that, the Social Insurance Fund then kicks in to cover it.  The push-back was very similar to what we are hearing today, which is that now is not the time to introduce it and the country is going through so much that it is important to keep labour costs low.  One of the recommendations of the troika was that statutory sick pay be introduced because the existing situation was placing a risk on the State because the Social Insurance Fund is not a fund.  It is a cost that is taken out of the day-to-day outgoings of the State.  That is the last time this was looked at.  This time, we did not need the troika arriving in town.  It was a global pandemic that brought us to this space.</p> <p>  Regarding the GP certificate, we must go back to the origins of this Bill.  It concerned Covid clusters in meat factories.  Employers in this sector are very wealthy with a mostly migrant workforce.  How would that migrant workforce function under this Bill?  The majority of them are on a minimum wage.  The Bill will provide them with 70% of their daily rate.  That is lower than the average cost of seeing a GP, which is &euro;60.  Seventy percent of an eight-hour day on the minimum wage is in or around &euro;57 so already they are out of pocket by &euro;3.  They are also based in really rural communities.  The chances of seeing a GP in a built-up environment such as Dublin are already difficult, so seeing a GP in a very isolated area would add further expense involving in travelling to see that GP as well as the practicalities of having GP certification on the first day.  They would be the concerns of congress, which is why we recommend that a period be introduced where someone can be self-certified in order that people can have those one or two days and then on day three, have the time and knowledge to know if this is a sickness that will require a further period of recuperation.  </p></speech>

The meat factory workers are an excellent example of how, unless we move to a limited period of self-certification, this sick pay scheme will not work.  It will leave them out of pocket, as Dr. Bambrick has said.  Clearly, that is not what any of us wants to achieve through this Bill.</p> <p>  I have another concern that I want to raise with both parties, which is how we write the legislation.  As Dr. Bambrick has said, it is going to be written in with just three days leave and the idea is that regulations will increase that.  As we all know, there is no guarantee that those regulations will come into force as planned.  We all know that there is likely to be a pushback whenever the next cycle of session comes around.  Would we not be far better to write the schedule of days and increases into the legislation to ensure that we end up with a worthwhile scheme?  While that would not put us on a par with our colleagues in Europe it would at least bring us some way towards that.</p></speech>

On the other hand, it is reasonable that there is flexibility to adjust the days without having to fully amend the legislation on every occasion.  I mean that the regulations give a little bit more flexibility rather than primary legislation.</p> <p>  I wish to take up a couple of points.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that we are saying keep wages low and do not bring in sick pay now.  I wish to correct the record and I acknowledge that it might just have been the way I heard Dr. Bambrick.  We are not saying not to bring in sick pay.  We are saying that there are some really challenging issues and very significant costs for lots of employers at this particular time.  Certainly, we are not talking about keeping wages low.</p> <p>  When we come to that issue of writing the days into the legislation, I think what we would all recognise is that once those days are in the legislation and are operated by contract with the employee they rarely, if ever, move back.  It is not IBEC's normal operation to see those days move back on an across the board basis.  For example, at the time of the national minimum wage changes many years ago, in response to the financial crisis, IBEC did not support that move at all.  We do not expect to see that type of change would come about.  We do recognise that it is important.  It is covered in the Bill as it is currently stands.  There are exemptions and exceptions albeit that they tend not to be particularly useful to employers individually but they are at least there for individual different circumstances.  I am not sure that having it as a regulation or definitively in the primary legislation might necessarily be any different.  We would not expect to see that being clawed back but it would be normal that regulations could amend legislation.  Also, any increases could be looked at and maybe amended or introduced more slowly in the event of a negative economic situation at any particular point in time.</p></speech>

We absolutely understand the need for it to be gradually introduced but we assumed that it was taken as a given that it would never go below ten days.</p> <p>  Similarly, but for different reasons from Ms McElwee, we do see the benefits of regulations.  I mean that if changes are to be made, it would not require the Minister having to go through the hoopla of getting primary legislation changed.  I guarantee that every budget submission from now on will include a request around statutory sick pay.  We will be looking at how well the economy recovers.  In the same way as Ms McElwee&rsquo;s members will be seeking a slow-down of the scheme&rsquo;s introduction, we will be seeking for it to be brought forward.</p> <p>  To echo Ms McElwee, there are benefits to using regulation but our concern is that the ten-day period is not mentioned in the primary legislation.  That period is an absolute floor to this right.</p></speech>

I noted comments from the Chartered Accountants Ireland this week to the effect that, given that it is just a few weeks away, it would be impossible for employers to implement this scheme from 1 January 2022, particularly businesses using payroll service providers, as there would not be enough time to develop or adapt software.  Providers of payroll services have stated that they would need a six-month lead-in time.  Will Ms McElwee advise us on whether she has similar concerns?  What are her thoughts on this matter?</p></speech>

While I am not a payroll specialist, I know that there are considerable concerns among members about the timescale for the legislation&rsquo;s introduction.  There are undoubtedly any number of challenges that would arise for organisations in its implementation, how it could be managed and how employers would integrate the statutory sick pay scheme, given the complexities they already deal with in running their existing sick pay schemes.  Many employers, particularly those that have grown over many years, perhaps by acquisition, do not have a single sick pay scheme.  We could identify multiple schemes in a number of our larger members that have not had the opportunity to amalgamate them.  There could be ten or 15 schemes still running.  That poses a major challenge to trying to integrate a statutory sick pay scheme, particularly where so many questions remain.  In section 9, for example, no clear understanding can be taken from the current wording as to whether an employer&rsquo;s scheme can be considered better in the round or who can consider it to be better.  Would one or two days&rsquo; difference in a current private scheme make it better than a scheme that the WRC adjudicated on two days earlier?  The Bill provides no clarity or guidance whatsoever.  For employers trying to integrate a scheme like that into their overall payroll programmes would be problematic.  I can see where the body is coming from in that regard.</p></speech>

As has been outlined and as far as I am aware, the most common protocol in the private sector is that sick leave must be certified if it extends beyond two days.  Would ICTU like to see limited periods of self-certified sick leave being included in the Bill?  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

We can see that it costs about one tenth of the cost of the sick leave scheme to have those limited period of uncertified days and it would be the difference between falling ill on day one and day two and giving a worker the opportunity to see if it is something that will require a GP and an extended period of sick leave.  A worker would not get those one or two days every time he or she goes on potential sick leave.  It would be limited to a number of days every 12 months, as Ms McElwee suggested.  A limited number of the ten days would be uncertified to allow people to see whether this was an ailment that would develop into a sickness.</p></speech>

This is a big change for Ireland and we are pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this with all the actors involved because we want to get it right.  Ms McElwee spoke about the sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  She might expand on that and explain what those sectors are.  She also mentioned in her presentation that there are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.  Is it not the case that regardless of sick leave some employers would have to replace skills if somebody was out sick?</p> <p>  We need to explore the question of existing schemes being more favourable than statutory sick pay.  I agree with Ms McElwee that we need to drill down into that because I do not see how people could be paid on the double.  The witnesses from IBEC said they would give us more information and I would like them to give us an indication as to what sick pay schemes are out there already, how they are operated by various companies and how they work.  That would help us to examine this.  Ms McElwee mentioned in her presentation that 307, or 60%, of respondents came back and said that they operated sick pay schemes.  Ms McElwee mentioned more than once that the bigger companies seem to be operating a sick pay scheme or maybe more than one scheme in some instances and the smaller companies will be under pressure.  We are all agreed that we do not want to put pressure on SMEs to the extent that they cannot operate this.  We need to find a way around that but big companies can well afford it.  I have also been looking at some research, which I am not sure if IBEC has been looking at.  The research maintains that paid sick leave is good for business.  Rather than impacting on business, if it is done properly it can increase worker productivity, reduce the spread of contagious illnesses, keep businesses open during Covid-19, as was the case in some states in America and reduce worker turnover.  There are huge positives to paid sick leave and some of the larger companies that operate such schemes probably recognise this and understand that happy workers lead to better productivity and so on.  We might need to talk about that.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Bambrick as well.  I would like to further explore the issue of bogus self-employment.  I was speaking with some employers recently and they maintained that were they to operate various statutory schemes like this one, they would be competitively disadvantaged by other companies that operate bogus self-employment.  I would like to hear Dr. Bambrick expand on bogus self-employment because some employers I spoke with were concerned about that.  The 38-week contracts are another issue we need to explore further.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick pay.  Where does that statistic come from?  I have looked at what the HSE and others do and the HSE provides seven days of self-certified paid sick leave in a continuous two-year period.  If it is self-certified then how is there a cost?  Maybe I am missing something here and excuse me if I am.  Dr. Bambrick also mentioned that the Social Insurance Fund should be used in some instances, which is interesting and curious, even though others have said that should not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#E00400"><p>I will take the Deputy's questions from the beginning.  He asked which sectors might be most affected.  We will see it in many sectors, including in our experience economy, which has been hugely impacted by Covid.  The introduction of sick pay schemes there will undoubtedly create an additional burden of cost.  Any businesses that do not have sick pay schemes will feel the cost but our experience economy will be hardest hit.  It is also coming into its most difficult trading period early next year and there are huge challenges around the sector at that time of the year anyway and putting this on top of that provides a significant cost.  There are other sectors across the board where we know that wages tend to be set at a particular rate, whether that is the national minimum wage or whether there are sectoral employment orders or joint labour committee rates in place.  There will also be a requirement for us to look at how we will realign all of that so there is a significant impact across those sectors as well.</p> <p>  There are a couple of things to look at in the issue the Deputy raised around replacement costs and employers having to replace costs.  We also have a significant challenge in respect of the availability of labour in all sectors.  Not alone is it difficult to replace individuals but it is expensive to replace them.  We also have considerable challenges in the negative context and climate around short-term work contracts and agency working, whereas in fact they are an important part of our workplace flexibility.  The ability of employers to offer and appropriately provide statutory entitlements like sick pay, carer&rsquo;s leave and parental leave relies on that flexibility.  It is important that we do not perpetuate the negative narrative that these are poor employment options.  They often provide a first step in the door for many individuals but it is difficult and costly to replace skills that are particularly unique.  Where you might have somebody in a stand-alone role, there is an additional cost.  That person will have to be replaced; otherwise the company bears the cost of either lost production or significantly reduced production over time.  Employers that are not paying sick leave already bear that replacement cost or productivity loss but now they will also in many cases bear the productivity loss or cost, which is excessive in many cases, and the statutory sick pay cost as well.  The more days that are introduced as we move through the system, the more costly that can become in the long term.</p> <p>  Looking at how sick pay schemes operate, the vast majority of members who we have surveyed tell us they have waiting days in place.</p><p>There is initially going to be a service element.  Most employers do not start incorporating people into sick pay schemes until they have passed their probation, which is typically six months.  After that, there will be service days and, therefore, there are waiting days where people can take a couple of days' sick leave without the requirement to be paid but also without the requirement to produce any certification for those particular days.  They are still considered to be authorised leave, however.  They are out sick and that is recognised.</p><p> When we look at organisations and how sick pay works, however, the Deputy is quite right.  Employers see sick leave as being a benefit.   They see it as an opportunity to attract people to their organisations where they can afford to put something in place.  It is not just larger companies.  Many smaller companies offer sick pay benefits to their employees where, again, they can afford it.</p><p> The challenge, particularly with this proposed Bill, is that in terms of offering a benefit, it often has to be managed so that it is not actually just a right, it is a benefit of one's employment and it operates to be beneficial and fairly and effectively.  There is nothing that employees hate more than that sense that people are getting away with stuff where others are operating very effectively.  We know that the unions support and have always supported employers on this piece.  As a result, it will be critical to look at sick pay schemes and say that almost every existing sick pay scheme has a disqualification cause; a reason to say that an employer is not actually operating the scheme fairly and we are disqualifying them from it.  There will be clauses within it which state that the company will review a person's sick leave if it feels that there is a pattern to it or that there is an ongoing problem with the potential to be able to restrict a person's usage of it.</p><p> There are abuse clauses, as there are in other items of statutory legislation, relating to people who it is felt are not operating it in line with the principle that it is there to support.  All those things are very important clauses in the context of sick pay.  Then there are other situations where organisations will run sick pay.  There will be issues around whether a person will be eligible to earn a bonus, what schemes are in place and other company benefits that will be dependent on sick pay, particularly where the sick pay is going to be put on a statutory leave footing and how that will interact with other company benefits and schemes, such as, for example, those relating to attendance bonuses.  Were we to suggest that a person is not deemed to be absent on a day that he or she is on statutory sick leave, how will that have an impact?  There is much complexity regarding how sick leave schemes operate within the environment at present.</p><p> On the Deputy's final point to the effect that big companies can well afford it, big companies that have put in place sick pay schemes can afford the schemes they have budgeted for and are operating.  If we are now layering on additional costs, that will be challenging for many organisations if we are now referring to day one and, again, the lack of clarity around section 9 as to whether it is better in the round or on the whole and how that will operate may actually increase costs.  The last thing we want to do is to be seen through statutory legislation to drive a race to the bottom where employers step back and say they have actually put in place some significant benefits for employees, including sick pay but often many other benefits.  If this is layered on top and represents an additional cost, employers may say they are able to afford it but are being penalised for putting more favourable policies in place because everything that comes a statute is now layered on top of it instead of being taken in the round, which I think the proposed Bill is trying to do.  That really needs to be made clear because, otherwise, employers will retrench and say that if the cost is going to be added on, they have to be sure and have some certainty regarding what the cost will be.  If, therefore, there are no management clauses in the legislation and no overarching ability to be able to say that an employer has something that is better overall, then employers, quite reasonably, will rely on the legislation and say that that is what they will implement.</p></speech>

We do not want to have a situation where we have ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to schemes.  That needs to be very clear.  I am not sure if Dr. Bambrick wishes to come in on the question I asked with respect to the 10%.  I am just curious about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#F00300"><p>I will comment quickly on the questions put forward by the Deputy; I know we are short on time.  Our two big concerns for trade unions in winning the right for statutory sick pay, forgetting about the details of the proposed Bill, are what Ms McElwee talked about whereby it could lead to a displacement of existing occupational sick pay at company level, which, at ten days, actually has ended up being more generous than what is in the proposed legislation.  All of a sudden, instead of the proposed legislation becoming a floor it becomes a ceiling.</p> <p>  The second issue we had, to which the Deputy drew attention, is whether this will incentivise more bogus self-employment because there will be an incentive for some employers to avoid the costs that will be imposed on them.  That is why we made our first recommendation in respect of changing the definition in section 2 as to who is covered.  That would take in many of those workers who are providing services rather than under a contract of employment.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to people who are working in ECCE, also known as the free year or playgroup year.  If early years professionals are working for the service providers that just provide those playgroup years, they have to sign on for the summer.  They do not have continuous contracts of employment because the facility is not getting the funding through the Government scheme.  Under this proposed Bill, they would have to build up their entitlement again.  A person who starts back in September would not be eligible until December under this Bill.</p> <p>  The reason self-certified sick leave is still creating a cost in respect of the scheme is that the worker would still get paid for those pays but he or she would not be obliged to provide the employer with a GP certificate.  Self-certified and uncertified days still operate the same costs to the scheme.  The difference is having to provide a GP certificate for those days or not.  That is where the 10% comes.</p> <p>  On the Social Insurance Fund, as I mentioned earlier, it is recommended - and we support this - that where an employer has shown an inability to meet the costs of the scheme, they can go to the Labour Court.  To ensure that the employee is not left out of pocket, however, in the same way that we do with redundancies in the context of companies that are letting workers go but are still trading, the Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost and then the charge is imposed on the employer.  Over time, the Department works with that employer to ensure that the money is paid back.  This means that neither the employee, in the first instance, nor the Social Insurance Fund, in the medium to long term, are out of pocket.</p></speech>

As I said at the previous meeting, I am relieved and frustrated in equal measure that we are eventually having the pre-legislative scrutiny of this important proposed legislation.  Enormous credit goes to ICTU and to my union, SIPTU, in terms of putting this issue very much on the map some 12 months ago.  My big regret, perhaps, is that it has taken until now for us to talk about introducing this proposed legislation.  Nonetheless, we are here today.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  It is important for me to mention the importance of hardwiring some of the detail into the legislation, which I believe Senator Gavan, the ICTU and others also spoke about.  I am very supportive of that.  I will turn to IBEC first regarding the question of replacement costs and productivity losses or, as Deputy Stanton alluded to, long-term productivity gains.</p><p>I note that IBEC undertook a survey of its members with regard to sick pay arrangements within their workplaces.  Was a question about the replacement cost of a person being out of work because of illness asked in that survey?  It is important that we understand there is a replacement cost but we must also understand the extent of that replacement cost in any one workplace.  </p><p> As a follow-up to that, has IBEC looked at research on the productivity loss from staff members being out ill?  Is the loss linear?  To me, the loss from a staff member being out one day is not the equivalent of his or her being out six days.  It seems to me the loss would be much greater if somebody was out of work for a protracted period of time as opposed to one or two days.  I know that the productivity loss is a concern to IBEC.  What research has it looked at to quantify the scale of the loss within workplaces?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#G00200"><p>I think that question was for me.  We did not specifically ask member companies in that particular survey to try to quantify the productivity loss because we understood that a different number would have come back from every respondent.  The scale of productivity loss would depend on the role each company was trying to replace and the specific skill set involved.  It also might depend on the area of the country the company is in.  What we know is that depending on that skill set and depending on the availability of labour, it can be a very different cost and a difficult challenge for many employers.  That is the case now.  It was also the case before the pandemic and it remains the case since the loosening of some restrictions.  The availability of talent continues to be the number one concern for employers.  The absence of people within that talent pipeline in the organisation does matter.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether a longer, more protracted absence is more difficult and costly to manage.  In actual fact, many employers find that short-term absences are much more disruptive because staff members are much harder to replace.  If we know somebody is going to be unwell and out of work for a longer period of time, it is easier to make sure a replacement is in place.  It is easier to plan and manage if somebody is likely to be out for six days, ten days or whatever it might be than it is if somebody is out for multiple, very short periods, which tend not to come with a great deal of notice.  There is a cost associated with bringing in somebody from an agency, moving somebody within the business or just doing without and addressing the productivity loss.  It is different depending on the role but short-term absences are much more disruptive for organisations.</p></speech>

I would like to understand a little more about the timing of that.  I am conscious that there was a quick turnaround between the invitation to appear before the committee and our guests' appearance.  I appreciate there are many calls on their time.  However, this has been the subject of many discussions at the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, over many months.  When does IBEC propose to make that submission to the Department?  Some of us believe there is an urgency with regard to progressing the Bill.  Is IBEC going to produce the submission quickly or is this going to delay the overall passing or progressing of this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

Looking at the Bill as it is currently drafted and given the lack of clarity we have, we feel a lot of information is missing.  As I have already outlined, there are a number of clauses, including anti-abuse clauses and companies' ability to be able to manage this system appropriately, as one would expect any organisation to manage an absence policy, in which there is a lack of clarity.  The definitions within sections 8 and 9 are very unclear.  We are expecting that as the Bill moves forward, we will see more clarity around its drafting.  We hope that as a result of our interventions at the committee today, some of the concerns we have around the lack of clarity in the legislation will be reflected as the Bill progresses and it will be amended and updated to address some of those concerns.</p> <p>  I have listened to the points Dr. Bambrick has raised this morning about, for example, the definitions within the initial sections.  We have a different sense and a different feeling around the whole issue of who is going to be captured by it.  We have had some discussion around bogus self-employment and who would be captured.  The real concern for employers is that we do not have a definition of "worker" in Irish legislation.  One is either an employee or is not an employee.  We have plenty of case law and legislation that allows us to determine who is an employee and who is not.  We have adequate and ample mechanisms, in our view, for how that gets done.  The challenge with legislation like this is that if we have people who are not in a traditional employment contract, that opens up a whole question as to how an employer would understand to whom they have responsibilities.  How would the employer apply existing sick pay schemes to somebody who is not on an existing contract of employment, as we understand it?  How are we going to deal with people who have multiple part-time roles, that is, people who are not just in the employment of one employer?  What happens when a worker's illness might arise from an injury or occupational illness suffered while working for one employer?  How are we going to manage such a situation, even for payroll or reporting purposes, and determine who is paying that sick leave and how it will be structured?  We have no clarity at all around how part-time sick pay is going to be managed, accrued or calculated.  To answer the Senator's question, there is still a major absence of information that will require remedy before we think this Bill is ready to be enacted.  However, we do not intent to delay it.  We will continue to bring forward all of the concerns, as we have been doing, to try to make sure we have the best and most appropriate legislation when it passes.</p></speech>

I want to finish with IBEC.  I will turn to the issue of financial sustainability, which is, of course, something we must look at.  Ms McElwee said in her opening statement that it would be financially unsustainable for a worker to take three days' sick leave at the end of December and three days' sick leave in the new calendar year.  How is that different from a person taking three days' sick leave because he or she falls ill in September, that person having taken another three days' leave in July?  I ask that mindful of Ms McElwee's previous comments about six days' absence being easier to plan for compared with a day here and a day there.  I want to understand more about what makes the last week of December and the first week of January less financially sustainable, relative to taking sick pay at other times of the year.  I apologise if the answer is obvious but I think it would be useful to clarify the point.</p></speech>

From our perspective, I am probably looking at particular sectors that were impacted here.  There are two issues.  One is the fact that most sick leave schemes, as they currently operate, are on a rolling basis.  This entitlement arises every year from January to December but it rolls, depending on when sick leave might have been first activated within the rolling period.  The calendar period presents a unique challenge for many sectors, particularly those in our experience economy and those in retail because many of them have extraordinarily busy times.  During those times, those employers would not offer annual leave on a regular basis.  Taking retail as an example, that would be true as we come into the Christmas trading period and the new year's sales period.  It is often a challenge for other employees when people are absent or not around.  Three or four days' absence is disruptive during that period.  If sick pay is available for ten days, somebody could potentially disappear for ten days before Christmas and another ten days during the January sales period.</p><p>We were looking at it in the context of the experience economy element across entertainment, hospitality, retail, restaurants and bars, with all those sectors hitting that critically important trading period in December and January.  All these things wrap back up.  That covers the issues of the rolling 12 months and the absence of any management clauses within this proposed legislation that all lead to it being problematic.</p></speech>

Senator Sherlock&rsquo;s time is up.  That concludes the first round of questions.  Does anyone want to indicate and start the second round of questions?  Senator Ahearn has indicated.  The Senator will have seven minutes.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McElwee and Dr. Bambrick for their contributions and for their work on this matter.  The draft legislation is important and welcome.  As previous speakers said, it is about time we discussed it and tried to get it put in place.</p> <p>  To pick up on Ms McElwee's response to Senator Sherlock, I do not think anyone is trying to delay legislation coming through the Houses.  This is about working together to make sure it is right.  The intentions on both sides is to make sure this is done correctly.  Ms McElwee expressed concerns about the draft legislation and ensuring it is right.  She gave the example of a person who has two jobs who gets injured in one job and how would that would affect his or her other job.  All the examples she gave would have happened in other countries when sick pay was introduced.  How did they manage?  Has IBEC researched how it has been managed in other countries in the context of the various concerns Ms McElwee raised?  Are there good examples of how other countries managed in that regard?</p> <p>  This is a question for Dr. Bambrick and Ms McElwee regarding medical certificates.  One of the main concerns about getting a doctor&rsquo;s certificate is the cost for the employee.  Almost 50% of people either have a medical card or a GP visit card.  It would not be 50% because many retired people would have medical cards.  Has any research been done on the percentage of employees who hold a medical card or a GP card?  I know from my constituency office that many people who are entitled to a GP card are not aware of that.  Perhaps we need to get that message out.  It certainly protects the lowest paid.  When we talk about the cost of paying a GP for a medical certificate in respect of sick pay being a significant barrier, I would be interested to know the percentage of employees who hold a GP card or a medical card.  If it is 50%, which is the highest it would have ever been in the history of the State, common sense dictates that we have probably the highest percentage of employees who have ever held a medical card or a GP card.  That goes some way to supporting employees.  I would interested to hear our guests&rsquo; comments on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#H00500"><p>I can respond on those figures.  As the Senator said, we have good coverage of the population as a whole with respect to medical cards and GP cards.  The officials mentioned the working-age population in this context last week.  Many people in that cohort are outside the workforce.  I refer to those with disabilities and many lone parents.  If one&rsquo;s youngest child is under the age of eight, one is not required to be looking for work and one is therefore not counted as part of the labour force.  The Department of Health conducts a Healthy Ireland survey every two or three years of a sample of 7,500 people.  It is representative, which means it is similar to the Red C poll one would read about on a Sunday.  It is a snapshot of the population.  We can note from it that one in seven people who are actively working, being either self-employed or employees, has a medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  When we narrow it down and examine the people not only of working age but who are in employment or self-employed, it is very narrow and the reason for that is the income is based on the household, not on what the individual earns.  We know from research on minimum wage workers that many of them do not live in low-income households because they are either living with their parents, who have their own income, or they are living with a spouse, and the minimum wage earner is a second earner who might have a part-time entry job.  We have very few people who are in work who have the cost of going to a GP covered.  One in seven of them has a full medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  Many people of working age have a medical card but very few of them who are actively working today will have the &euro;60 cost of a GP visit to get medical certificate covered.</p></speech>

I will check that.  There may have been a time lag in doing one.  The figures I quoted are from 2019, when those data were collected.  There may have been a delay because of Covid-19 because of the way those data are collected.  Unlike the financial crash, during Covid-19 we have not seen a big increase in the number of applicants for medical and GP cards.  That is to do with how comparatively generous our Covid income supports were.  Even if one was in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment, one was still not eligible because that &euro;250 level would have pushed one over the income allowance even if one was not in a low income household or was living with other people.</p></speech>

She said one in seven people has a medical card and one in 27 has a GP card, which seems very low for GP cards when it should be easier to get that card.  What were the figures going back two, four or ten years?  I do not have the figures but it seems obvious that if we are issuing more medical and GP cards to the nation, more employees will have them.  I understand that someone's GP card or medical card takes account of the household income.  There is an obvious reason for that.  Dr. Bambrick gave the example of a person who might be living with a parent.  People who live with their parents often might not pay rent and their expenditure would be less.  Has the number of employees with a GP card or medical card increased during the past ten or 20 years?</p></speech>

The extension of coverage with respect to medical cards has tended to be include the very youngest and the eldest, the over-70s.  GPs cards were introduced for people with both a State pension and an occupational pension.  GP cards were also introduced for under eights and moving on to the under-12s.  A single person living on his or her own with an income over &euro;184, is not eligible for a medical card.  If one is on the minimum wage and one works more than 17 hours, one is not entitled to a medical card.  If one earns more than &euro;304, one is not eligible for a GP card.  If one works 28 hours, long part-time hours, one is not eligible for a GP card.  Hands off, we have been very good at expanding coverage but the coverage is not hitting the working population.</p><p>A big working age population is included in it but those people are outside the labour market.  We hear conversations about work disincentives, such as the fear of losing a medical card because that is a gateway into many other services such as the back to school allowance, transport and so on.  People are reluctant to take on work because of that expense.  To drive home that point, it is not necessary to earn a great deal of money not to have primary healthcare covered in this country.</p></speech>

She said in her submission that additional costs are involved in the replacement of skills with little or no notice which are lost during a period of sick leave.  If a person is sick, he or she will not be able to go to work regardless of whether we have schemes in place or not and that will have to be replaced anyway.  Can Ms McElwee tease out what she means by that particular statement?  If a person is sick surely we should not encourage him or her to go to work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#J00300"><p>If somebody is sick and really needs not to be at work then of course he or she should be on leave.  When we talk about the costs for employers of replacing somebody, particularly for short periods of time, we are not talking about serious illness here, there are challenges.  It depends on whether somebody can be moved from another area, or there may be a skills training issue.  Generally there is some loss of productivity and cost to the business as a result.  There is a management cost of moving people around, potentially a replacement cost or an agency cost if someone is brought in externally.  There is also an administration cost of addressing and person-managing the salary, engaging with the agency, paying it and so on.</p></speech>

Whether or not we introduce a sick scheme of any sort, if a person is sick he or she cannot go to work and should not be there.  Am I right in saying that introducing this particular scheme should not have an impact in additional costs involved in replacing skills?  If people are sick, they should not be at work.  If they have to go to work their productivity will probably drop, they will probably be quite upset and also may infect other workers.  I just do not get that.  If someone is sick, he or she is sick and needs to be out and that is that.</p></speech>

What we are trying to reflect and recognise here, particularly where it is important that we see this brought in on a phased basis, is a recognition for employers that it will be a significant additional cost because they would not ordinarily be paying the second salary if they do not already have a sick pay scheme in place.</p></speech>

Okay.  The other question is, with respect to the current sick pay schemes in operation by the companies Ms McElwee cited earlier, are there any reports of abuse of those schemes?  Would that be a concern?  Would Ms McElwee give us an indication of what that is?  I have looked at some of the international research here which indicates that when good relationships prevail between workers and employers that abuse does not happen.  In some instances in America these schemes have been expanded because it was found that productivity went up.</p> <p>  Regarding the other point Ms McElwee mentioned in regard to competition for workers, would some employers use the presence of a sick pay scheme as an extra way of attracting workers to their companies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.55" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#J00700"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy that sick pay schemes are a benefit and an attractive feature in many organisations.  I would also say that there can be increased productivity where there is good management of those schemes and where there are good relationships, but I would also tell the Deputy that the bread and butter of the IBEC executive's role is often dealing with the day-to-day issues that arise around absence and absence management.  Without a doubt we regularly have issues and concerns that arise around ongoing sporadic absences.  They may be around managing issues where perhaps somebody has an underlying concern but often they can be linked to other issues.  It is an ongoing matter for employers to deal with.  It is important that they deal with it fairly and have a process for dealing with it but there is no doubt these are the daily questions that come through around managing that sporadic absence.  Questions arise on how to implement the company's sick pay scheme if people are not providing medical certificates, if employees are always missing on a Monday or if somebody is routinely gone after a bank holiday weekend?  HR departments are occupied with such issues on an ongoing basis and that is one reason we say it is so important that there is governance, because the management of those schemes appropriately and fairly within a process is what makes them work.  It is what makes them attractive and makes other employees feel that everybody is being treated the same way.  Everybody knows when somebody is abusing a sick pay scheme.  When employers do not deal with it it becomes a really significant industrial relations problem.  That is why schemes can be seen as a benefit.  Where they are well managed they address those issues.  Where people are not operating in good faith they can be managed within the provision of the scheme.</p></speech>

She might come back to us later and let us know if they have carried out any research with respect to abuse.  I ask Ms Bambrick, in light of what Ms McElwee said, to outline the position of the trade union movement with regard to abuse of schemes.  If a person in a company is abusing a scheme and we do not know to what extent that might be, that other workers actually have to pick up the slack and might feel discommoded which may lead to people being disgruntled which is understandable.  Would Ms Bambrick comment on that please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#J00900"><p>I will qualify my answer by saying I am not involved in industrial relations and unfortunately my colleague who would be better able to answer this, is dealing with the State pension at the moment.  As Ms McElwee mentioned earlier, trade unions are very supportive when there is genuine abuse happening because these have to date been voluntary arrangements by the employer and so we wanted to see these schemes work both for good worker-employer relations but also to protect the sustainability of the scheme.  I will also point to other international research.  The findings are somewhat paradoxical.  They show that the more generous a sick pay scheme is, the fewer waiting days, the higher the replacement rate cost, the easier it is to access it with those uncertified days, and the less absenteeism we see.  It sounds contradictory, that if one gives people easier access to paid days off, the expectation might be that they might abuse it and take the time.  What the research finds when it digs down is that it allows people to take days off when they have a minor ailment and it stops the condition festering into something more serious that a longer spell of absenteeism is needed to recuperate.  This is what we have seen during the outbreaks of Covid-19.  People had minor coughs and colds, were not sure if it was Covid-19 and took the gamble to go to work because they did not have the safeguard of a sick pay scheme, and within that time whole companies had to be shut down.  Real research exists which says that a generous scheme can be more beneficial and less costly than being very tight about who can access it and the terms under which they can access it.</p></speech>

I was glad the interaction between Senator Ahearn and Dr. Bambrick on clarifying who is entitled to a medical card and GP card took place.  It was really useful.  Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a number of comments two weeks ago that were not reflective of the reality on the ground with regard to the working age population and their entitlement to medical cards.  I thank Dr. Bambrick for providing the detail on who does and does not qualify and on the number who have an entitlement or have qualified for the GP card.</p><p> In her submission, Dr. Bambrick mades a number of very important points on who the legislation would apply to in terms of the definition or the relevant benchmark legislation.  The definition of "employee" and the comments on self-certification were very important points.  I ask about the minimum service period because she raised that concern as well.  There are certainly those who have a break in their employment in a particular year.  When the Labour Party put forward its Bill on sick pay last September, there was a provision for a four-week minimum service period.  Dr. Bambrick made the point that effectively a period of 13 weeks is too long.  What does congress propose the minimum service period should be?   What is it recommending?</p></speech>

However, I hope it helped the him in his deliberations.</p> <p>  When we talk about the minimum service, we absolutely acknowledge the need to establish a relationship between the employer and the worker.  We accept that is a principle that is already established in other legislation.  Our concern around this is the wording of continuous service.  That is where it causes difficulties.  Our colleagues in SIPTU, who represent the early years, drew our attention to the thousands - we are not talking about a niche group here - of workers in the early years whose employment does not exist for 52 weeks of the year.  Under this existing draft legislation, they would start off again as a new entrant employee even though they have established that relationship with that employer.  They would have to build it up from 1 September, not coming into qualification until December, if the 13 weeks are accepted.</p> <p>  Where we lie on what the appropriate minimum of service is, we wanted to emphasise that we identified the difference between what was said in the draft that was published in June that suggested six months and what is proposed now.  We came out strongly against that initially, saying it was too long and it would lead to some employers letting people go before they built up their entitlement.  We are glad to see it has been reduced down to 13 weeks.  We want to put it on the record of this committee that it was not an oversight.  We think less time is better and we are not at this stage looking for it to be narrowed down again.  Our emphasis, though, is on that wording on the continuous period of employment.</p></speech>

A discussion took place earlier on the 70% replacement rate.  Of course, for a minimum wage worker working a full day at &euro;56 per day of gross income, one day's wages is not even sufficient to pay for a GP visit.  Of course, there is a need to have a floor or certainly a minimum guaranteed entitlement.  Dr. Bambrick talked about the importance of consulting with the social partners and certainly from a Labour Party perspective we would very much echo and support that.  She talked about the need to consult with the social partners and to report back to the Oireachtas.  Should those details be delegated by way of that consultation and then regulation by the Minister or be hard wired into the legislation?</p></speech>

Ms McElwee highlighted much of the potential around how this Bill will interact over at least the next four years as it is gradually introduced.  It will be important to look ahead.  Hopefully, we are pre-empting much of this now.  Once this gets out into the field, many things will arise and it will be important there is an opportunity in this regard, rather than us of each separately having to lobby the Minister to say that something is an issue.  For example, we might find that some workers will be worse off than they would have been if they had got the illness benefit after day four.  We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences.  It is not the intention of congress to see employers who moved early and established good company policies being in any way penalised by this legislation.  That would be a big concern.  Equally, bogus self-employment, which was mentioned earlier, would be a concern.</p> <p>  For some people the 70% replacement rate will be a disappointment.  However, we are comparing it to the replacement rates in European countries that have had those schemes in place for decades, and some for centuries.  The schemes we are looking at today did not exist from day one.  The really important part of this legislation is it is putting in place the principle that employers are responsible for their workers for a fixed period of time if a worker is too sick to work.  We can look at tinkering around the edges and hopefully improving the scheme in terms of replacement rates, the timing and the certified and non-certified days as it progresses.  We think it is important, especially in the four years as the scheme is rolled out, that there is a commitment that the social partners will be listened to and our opinions taken into account, even if it is done through this committee.</p></speech>

Members are covered if they are in the Houses.  If they are joining the meeting remotely then they may not have full privilege.</p> <p>  Today we are dealing with the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances and Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service, PAS.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  We will now commence the examination of the Supplementary Estimates.  I invite the Minister to give his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for taking these Supplementary Estimates today.</p> <p>  I will present to the committee a proposal for: a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 resulting in a gross Estimate of &euro;34 million in respect of Vote 12 &ndash; superannuation and retired allowances; and a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;3.665 million in respect of Vote 17 &ndash; PAS.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2021 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;700.3 million gross and &euro;339.9 million net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly due to higher costs than forecast for the year under the pension scheme for established civil servants as a result of a higher than expected number of retirements for 2021.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the PAS Vote will bring the total gross allocation for the Vote to &euro;20.455 million in 2021.</p> <p>  The additional allocation of &euro;3.665 million sought for Vote 17 includes &euro;800,000 of additional current expenditure to enable PAS to provide additional recruitment services to the HSE; and an increased capital allocation of &euro;2.865 million in 2021 to allow for facilities upgrades, which have been carried out over a quicker timeframe than was originally envisaged.  This increased capital expenditure in 2021 will not increase the overall cost of the project, but it will enable works to be concluded over a shorter timeframe.  I understand that further detail on this request for Vote 17 has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  On Vote 12, pensions and lump sums paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants make up 91% of total gross expenditure and, therefore, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for a number of reasons, including the following: the majority of established civil servants will have a compulsory retirement age of 70; a number of people under age 60 retire each year under cost neutral early retirement or on grounds of ill-health; each year a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement; and the average pension benefits of lump sum and pension that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.</p> <p>  The 2021 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;666.3 million, which was based on a forecast of 1,650 retirements from the established scheme.  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Subhead A4 is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure variance on the Vote in any given year.</p> <p>  At end October 2021, &euro;118.6 million has been expended from subhead A4 compared to the original 2021 full-year estimate of &euro;109.8 million.  Further expenditure of up to &euro;23.2 million by the end of the year is expected, resulting in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;32 million on the subhead.  It is now estimated that total gross expenditure on the Vote for 2021 may be in the region of &euro;700.3 million, some &euro;34 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;666.3 million as voted previously by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  Appropriations-in-aid for 2021 were estimated at &euro;326.4 million.  Receipts with respect to the single public service pension scheme are ahead of profile year to date.  Total appropriations-in-aid are now projected at &euro;360.4 million by year end, which is &euro;34 million more than originally expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants expected to retire up to the end of 2021.  Approval for the Supplementary Estimate - Vote 17 will also enable the PAS to deliver additional demand-led recruitment services to the HSE and conclude an upgrade of their offices in a shorter timeframe than previously envisaged.  I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the committee and I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

It is always good to have the Minister in front of the committee, and I thank him.</p> <p>  On Vote 12, will he indicate how much was paid out in total last year for what is called "golden handshake" payments, and what was the highest single payment?  What was the average payment in this regard?  Will he confirm which Departments paid out most in this regard?</p> <p>  On Vote 17, what fees have been paid to external interviewers in the past three years?  I have a number of other questions but I put those two questions first.</p></speech>

I do not have the outturn for 2020 with me because we are dealing with the 2021 Supplementary Estimates.  I can, however, answer a number of the questions she has put.  For example, the average annual Civil Service pension last year came in at just under &euro;24,500.  That is up from a figure of &euro;23,000 in 2019.  The average Civil Service lump sum payment, in the year to date in 2021 to the end of September, was &euro;73,100.  For 2020 it was just under &euro;69,600.</p><p>That is just to give the committee an indication of the average.  As members knows, the lump sum is typically three times the level of the pension in respect of an individual person.  I will obtain for the Deputy the figures for 2020 by way of the outturn.  I believe the gross provisional outturn for 2020 is approximately &euro;628.4 million in respect of the superannuation and retired allowances for Vote 12.  Did the Deputy have another question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#B00200"><p>I also have a question about the Commission for Public Service Appointments, the statutory body which sets standards for recruitment in the public service.  It is also, in effect, the regulator.  Does the Minister believe the regulator should be able to comment on matters relating to the regulation of public service appointments?  I ask because of the remuneration of a particular Secretary General, as was recently reported in the media and debated at different committees.  I wrote to the commission to ask its views and it told me it was not appropriate for it to comment.  To be honest, I thought it was unusual, in some senses, that the regulator could not comment on matters pertaining to the regulation of public service appointments.  I would like to hear the Minister's views and comments on that matter.  Does he see a stronger role for the committee, in light of the recommendations made in the report that was recently published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  In terms of day-to-day operations, the Public Appointments Service operates independently and the level of interaction I have with it on a day-to-day basis is limited.  The Supplementary Estimate, in particular, arose as a result of the additional recruitment of medical and clerical staff, especially in the health area.  The majority of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the ongoing works to upgrade and modernise the offices in Chapter House.  That includes, for example, the modernisation of interview suites to include increased options for digital services and to allow for social distancing in face-to-face interviews and so on.  For any individual recruitment campaign for a particular post, it is a matter for the Public Appointments Service as to whether it wishes to comment.  I imagine the service is constrained in its ability to comment on any individual recruitment campaign but that is a matter for itself.  I am happy to take any questions arising from the committee's report.</p></speech>

I am going to have to listen back to it.  I apologise.  It is unfortunate that I missed what the Minister said at the start of his reply but I gather from what he said at the end that he is happy to take questions with regard to the report.  As he knows, 14 recommendations were included in the report, including the establishment of a formal process of interim and permanent appointments to senior posts and for that process to be followed in all instances.  It also recommends the establishment of a body to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service, and to develop a process for how those appointments are made.  The report also stated that the ministerial power to set individuals' salaries should be reviewed, with a view to ensuring transparency and oversight.  Can the Minister inform us what action he is going to take with regard to the three recommendations I have mentioned?  I hope there will be action relating to those recommendations because it is important they are implemented.</p></speech>

I hope she is hearing me okay.  I welcome the report.  I am still working my way through it because it is a lengthy report which gives a lot of food for thought.  I have looked at the 14 recommendations that were provided by the committee.  Those recommendations will be given serious consideration.  I have had an initial discussion about the recommendations with my officials.  There are some stand-out recommendations, in particular the recommendation to establish a body similar to the review body for positions with a higher remuneration in the public sector.  The report suggests that body is established immediately to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service and develop processes and procedures governing appointments to senior posts on interim and permanent bases.  I will give consideration to that.</p> <p>  I will make the point that until July of next year, the pay level for senior posts will be generally governed by the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The final unwinding of the long tail of FEMPI will occur on 1 July 2022, in accordance with the legislation.  Once we get beyond that point, the question arises as to what is the appropriate way in which pay issues can be examined at senior levels.  At the moment, as the Deputy knows, and in line with the legislation in place, it is a power that falls to the Minister.  We must consider that if we reconstitute a body similar to the one that was stood down in 2009, we may not always like its recommendations.  It may come forward with recommendations in respect of pay levels that far exceed what the committee or I, as Minister, might be willing to entertain.  We must consider that point.</p> <p>  As Minister, I am accountable.  I have attended before the committee in respect of the matter that was the subject of the report.  I am before the committee again today.  It is important that we have that level of accountability.  We would need to consider carefully exactly what the terms of reference and the role for such a body would be.  Would that role be to make recommendations and it would then fall to the Minister to make a decision on individual pay levels?  That requires careful consideration.  I am giving a commitment to the committee that I will consider the report and I am happy to engage with the committee on that particular recommendation and the others, which I am happy to answer questions about.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to three recommendations.  To which three, in particular, was she referring?</p></speech>

The third was the review of the ministerial power to set individual salaries.  It was those three in particular on which I focused.</p></speech>

I know this committee commented on the role of TLAC in its report.  I have informed the Government that I intend to review the role and composition of TLAC.  If the committee has any detailed proposals or suggestions for the role of TLAC, I would be more than happy to engage.  Until recently, TLAC had 13 members.  A lot of work is going through the committee at the moment and there are many vacancies across senior levels in the Civil Service for which recruitment processes are under way.  We must bear in mind that membership of TLAC is a part-time role.  Following consultation with the Chairman, we have increased the membership from 13 to 16.  I acknowledge the need for a wider review.  It has, generally, served us well.  I believe TLAC has been operating for almost 40 years at this stage and it has played a crucial role in supporting the appointment of senior posts, from assistant Secretary General level up over that period of time.  In general, the role has been performed well but it is now timely to conduct a review.  I am studying the report this committee published last week.  I am also consulting my officials and will consider any proposals the committee wishes to make in that regard.</p></speech>

The Estimates we are discussing today relate to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and do not involve direct payments to employees outside of its own body.  Of course, the issue of pensions relates to the Vote on superannuation and retired allowances.

I wish to begin by asking the Minister about the Estimates in terms of the pensions and lump sums.  He may be aware that it is now no longer permitted for his Department to publish details of the pensions that former Ministers are receiving.  Does he believe that this is something that needs to be rectified in the legislation?  I am conscious that he also oversees the freedom of information legislation.  Surely, when money is paid out of the public purse to people in positions such as those which the Minister now occupies himself, the public has a right to know about the pension provision?  Perhaps the Minister can explain to us what has changed, because this information was previously always readily available.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the change arises from a ruling by the Information Commissioner following a freedom of information process that ultimately made its way to his desk for a decision.  It is a decision that was made by him and one that we have to comply with and be consistent with.  I should make the point that we are doing a review of the freedom of information Acts.  We have commenced an initial scoping exercise, on which there has been very strong engagement.  We have received around 300 submissions already.  It will be a comprehensive review that will run well into next year and will ultimately shape proposals that I will bring to Government and hopefully, to the committee.  I know that members of the committee and other Opposition parties are interested in bringing forward proposals in this area.  That particular issue will be examined as part of the review.  However, my understanding is that currently, we have a ruling from the Information Commissioner and we are essentially bound by it.  If we are to revert to publishing information at the level of the individual, it raises the question of where to draw the line.  Do we publish the pension information of retired senior civil servants and retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the health service, or is it just politicians that we are interested in?  That is a question that we need to answer if we are seeking to address the issue in legislation.</p></speech>

The approach was always that information in relation to the Garda, nurses or teachers was not published.  However, I think there is an additional responsibility on those of us who are in public life and are in the privileged position of being elected to office.  I am not sure if the Minister shares that view.  I would be eager to hear the Minister's personal opinions on that.  Does he believe that that information that was made public in the past should be made public in the future, through this review?</p></speech>

It is not something that I have given a great deal of thought to because we have that ruling from the Information Commissioner.  It is not a decision point for me at this moment in time.  It is an issue that we should consider in the context of the legislation.  In his comments, the Deputy drew a distinction between elected officials and unelected officials.  We have to consider whether that is an appropriate line to draw in terms of a distinction between people who were formerly elected.  For example, we have to consider if we would include former judges in that.  I take it that the Deputy would say "No" to that, but "Yes" to including politicians in that.  We have to consider whether or not it is appropriate to have a system that is solely applicable to politicians rather than to other persons who served at senior levels across the Civil Service and public service.  That does require some thought.  We want a situation where we continue to attract people into politics and to apply for senior roles in the civil and public service.  It requires some thought, but I am happy to give it thought and to engage on it as part of the review of the freedom of information legislation.</p></speech>

In relation to the appointment of medical professionals, there is a serious issue in respect of the recruitment of medical professionals, including for consultant and other posts.  Has the Minister engaged with the PAS on the process, the length of time it takes and the delays?  I have engaged with local hospital managers and senior management staff within the hospitals and my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has visited most of the hospitals across the State in the past two weeks.  From my engagement and the information relayed to me by Deputy Cullinane, I have learned that the current recruitment process is not fit for purpose, particularly for regional and rural hospitals.  For example, when recruiting a consultant for a post in Letterkenny, the PAS could offer the position to a person who is located in Dublin and has no intention of relocating to Letterkenny.  The PAS has to go through the process of sending the offer, it being considered and rejected, then must look at the list of candidates again and offer the post to another candidate, and so on.  The PAS might get to the fourth candidate on the list, who is somebody from the region who has an interest in the region.  It is not just about that person moving to the region and taking up a position; it is also possibly about a partner, a husband or wife, who would need to relocate his or her job, and so on.</p> <p>  There are no regional panels here.  If there were regional panels in relation to the suitability for appointments, it could fast-track the process, instead of the PAS going through a process that is not fit for purpose and offering positions to professionals who have no intention of taking them up in the first place.  I ask the Minister to comment on that and on the need for a localised campaign.  The centralisation of recruitment in the health service is important in terms of costs and quality.  Indeed, in the review that has been done on the PAS, concerns have been raised and recommendations made in terms of ensuring that it recruits the proper staff.  However, we can see the benefits where hospitals have been able to engage in their own localised recruitment process.  I think we can all accept that there is an emergency in terms of staffing of our hospitals, not least now with Covid-19.  Surely, this needs to be looked at in a way that is about more than just giving resources to PAS, but actually looking at how we are recruiting, why there are no localised panels and allowing our hospitals, within certain parameters, to organise localised recruitment initiatives.  My understanding from the regions is that the ones that are bearing most fruits are those introduced to recruit nurses, in particular, as well as other professionals at higher levels.</p></speech>

Having said that, a lot of progress has been made.  Last year, over 6,300 additional staff were recruited, which included over 1,700 nurses and midwives.  This year, so far, just under 4,500 additional staff have been recruited.  Therefore, between last year and this year, approximately 11,000 have been recruited.  In such a relatively short period of time, it is the most significant level of recruitment that the HSE has ever embarked upon.  The figures look challenging but from the information that the HSE is conveying to us, I understand that it expects that the figure of 4,500, which is quite possibly the position to the end of September, will rise to close to 7,400 by the end of the year.  There will be a budget to continue with that recruitment next year.  The key point the Deputy made is about the system and the pace at which recruitment is taking place.</p><p>All I can say to the Deputy is that this is an issue we have discussed at the Cabinet committee on health.  We have provided the funding and we want to see the staff recruited to improve the quality of the healthcare we are providing to our people.  It is a combination of the work of the PAS and the HSE&rsquo;s internal HR system and the operation of that.  We have asked that information would be brought back to the Cabinet committee on health and I would be happy to share whatever information I get once we receive it.  The Deputy has made a particular suggestion about localised panels to increase the prospect of somebody being offered a job actually taking it up, which is a fair point, and to allow as much discretion at the local hospital level as possible.  We will take those two points and convey them to the HSE.  I want to repeat the point that the HSE has recruited about 11,000 people between last year and this year so far, which is a significant increase in the overall staff resources it has.  It will be doing more before the end of the year and into next year but there is a need to see if we can make the system more efficient.  Localised panels and more local recruitment at hospital level offer some potential and we will take that on board.</p></speech>

We are recruiting people and that is great and we are competing internationally as others are also trying to recruit but the timeframe is all wrong.  The Minister needs to get under the bonnet of this, look at the steps that are being taken and strip away or shorten some of the time within this.  We have had scenarios where hospitals have told us they have applied for maternity cover for a particular speciality at an early stage, they have since been granted the cover and they are delighted about that but the baby is born and is one-year old and the person who gave birth is back in the position.  That is what is happening in our hospitals.  When we ask our hospital management and staff to indicate at an early and advanced stage that they may be taking maternity leave, which they have no obligation to do, we must streamline that process.  If it is taking that long then there is a serious problem.</p> <p>  We may be talking about the length of time it takes to recruit but if that is a speech and language therapist, that means there are dozens of children, whether they have autism or other speech impediments, who are not getting a service in cases.  It means that their educational ability and attainment are curtailed because they have dropped out of a service that they needed during that period or because there is a delay in the service.  It is life lasting and it has a serious impact on the development of a child.  It could be a case of life or death in other specialties which cannot be carried out or in which there is a delay because the position is not filled.</p> <p>  The issue is the time it takes to fill a consultant post.  The average time it takes to fill a consultant&rsquo;s post is 513 days.  I recognise that some posts are filled in a shorter period of time but some also take longer.  We have evidence to suggest that positions are being offered to people who have no interest in coming to more regional hospitals.  A localised pull would help to curtail some of that but there are also a number of other suggestions.  Giving more money to the PAS is one thing if it needs it but the process needs to be looked at.  If it is still going to take the guts of two years to employ somebody then that is a problem.  It should never take that long.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will hear this if he is engaging with hospitals and they say that where they are able to do a localised recruitment campaign, they are able to attract the nurses in.  Letterkenny University Hospital is a case in point.  Dozens of additional nurses will be going into the hospital through a localised recruitment campaign and they will be in place in January.  There is a new ward lying empty in Letterkenny University Hospital because there are no staff to work in it.  That is the problem with the PAS system and the centralisation of recruitment.  We have capital investment in a hospital that is not staffed, that is lying empty and that can accommodate dozens of patients yet the staff to maintain that ward are not there and will not be there until the new year.  That ward is only open to hold the beds when there are 30 or 40 people in the accident and emergency department.  I am sure that is not unique to Letterkenny University Hospital but is replicated elsewhere.</p></speech>

We should also acknowledge that in many instances the PAS is finding it difficult to get the candidates.  The average figure that the Deputy quotes of over 500 days is not solely down to the system.  I acknowledge that there is a need to streamline and improve the system and that is an area of work that the HSE is focused on because I know it has been discussed at the highest level at the Cabinet committee.  There is also an international challenge in attracting candidates into different disciplines within healthcare.  It is not always the case that there are willing candidates but the system is not quick enough or able to assimilate them.  To put the figures in context, at the end of September we had about 130,600 whole-time equivalents in the health service and sanction is in place to increase that to over 141,000.  This is a dramatic scale-up in recruitment across the HSE because we recognise that we have to improve the permanent capacity of the healthcare system.  We have hired about 11,000 new staff across last year and this year and there is more to go.  We will continue to put the resources into this and we will focus on the system to see if there is a way in which we can improve it, while also acknowledging that there is a general problem in attracting candidates to certain posts across the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#D00400"><p>The other way to help to attract people to positions, whether it is nurses or other healthcare professionals, is to send a clear signal that they are valued.  In that context, where is the bonus for front-line workers?  It has been five months since the Taoiseach made an address in New York to say that the Government would bring forward a bonus for front-line workers.  It is two months since he said that it would be finalised shortly.  The Minister has said to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that this needs to be dealt with well before the end of the year and next week we will be into December.  These nurses are in the middle of a fight against Covid in their hospitals again and they are understaffed and looking at Christmas and wondering what leave, if any, they will get.  They are going through another year with no bonus and the Government has not announced a bonus.  How long does it take for the Minister and his colleagues to figure out that our front-line workers should be recognised with a bonus?  The Government has had five months since the Taoiseach publicly made that commitment.  How long more will it take?  This rests on the Minister&rsquo;s desk and it is him who is ultimately responsible for this.  Can the Minister inform the committee when a decision will be arrived at on a bonus?  Has a decision been arrived at or has the Government just dropped the issue?  What will the bonus be?  What will it cost?  Front-line workers in our hospitals are fighting the pandemic every day and we ask them to turn up and put themselves in the bearna baol for the rest of the community.  Surely to God the Government should have made this decision well in advance of coming into this Christmas period.</p></speech>

We are continuing to work on this issue because we need to get it right.  If we do not get it right it could result in unnecessary divisions being opened up and we should seek to avoid that.  There are a number of elements to it, as the Deputy knows, and many of them have been publicly discussed on a number of occasions.  We need to find an appropriate way to remember and commemorate the fact that well over 5,000 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 so far.  As the Deputy knows, the issue of a public holiday has been under consideration and there is the question of the timing of that.  It would have an impact on employers and we need to make sure that adequate notice is given as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about who should get a recognition payment, how much it should be and when it should be paid.</p><p>We are considering these issues and it is being actively worked on, not just by me but by a number of colleagues across Government.  We are really conscious that at this very point in time, those front-line workers are once again working in incredibly difficult positions.  Our focus is to help them, and to provide as many resources as we possibly can and do all we can as a Government to stem the tide of this pandemic and get on top of the situation again.  There will be an appropriate moment soon when we can confirm how we are going to address all the issues I touched on.</p><p> I assure the Deputy and all the front-line workers in our healthcare system that this has not been forgotten about.  It is very much a live issue.  Government has been focused on the immediate response that is needed with regard to booster campaigns and adding capacity as best we can across the system.  This issue will be dealt with shortly, however.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach used the same words two months ago.  The Minister said this will be decided well before the end of the year.  There are three weeks of sittings left in the D&aacute;il.  When is this going to be decided on?  Can the Minister outline the work that he is doing?  He has asked all the questions that others are asking but he is the Minister.  What does he need to do to get to a point when he can announce the bonus for front-line workers?  Will this be announced in the next week, or two or three weeks, or is "soon" still a number of months away?</p></speech>

What I will not do is give half an answer.  We will give the full answer when we are ready and when we have all this fully worked through.  It is being actively worked on right across Government and a number of Departments are directly contributing to this work.  It does not sit within any single Department.  As the Deputy indicated, I have said publicly that it should be dealt with well before the year end.  Today is 24 November.  We have a number of weeks to go.  This is actively being worked on.  It will be done shortly and it is a priority for Government.  I am not going to give bits of an answer to different elements of it.  When we confirm the position, it will be the complete and final position.  It remains a work in progress, therefore, and we are almost there.</p></speech>

Before we go into the formal acceptance of the Estimates and so on, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to report No. 42 from 2007 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service and non-payment to health service senior managers, serving and retired.  That report was provided to Government but there has been little or no action on it.  The individuals concerned, many of whom are retired now, have written numerous times to senior officials and, indeed, some Ministers, to get some sort of action with regard to the implementation of the recommendation.  That was in 2007.  It has continued since then.  There was a Labour Court ruling on it in 2011.  All these individuals are still campaigning on the solution that was found through the Labour Court process, which was recommended by the review body on higher remuneration.  When are these individual likely to get paid, given that the Minister is bringing forward Estimates now that will bring us to the end of 2021?  They do not seem to be included in this either.</p></speech>

He will have to forgive me for not being familiar with report No. 42 of 2007 from the review body.  I believe it relates to orthodontics.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It affects payment to health service senior managers, serving and retired.  The recommendation was made and, as I said, it went through the Labour Court hearing.  It was upheld and both sides seem to have accepted it.</p> <p>  Since then, what I find very disturbing about the whole thing is that senior officials do not even bother to respond and Ministers over that period did not bother to respond.  Surely, former employees of the State should be at least extended the courtesy of a reply to explain why an accepted report is not being acted on and why they are not being paid.  I met them again recently and it stuck in their craw, as they say down the country, that one Secretary General's pay was increased by &euro;80,000 on a nod yet those who served in the service were denied it; not to that extent of an increase but they were denied what was recommended.</p> <p>  I understand why the Minister would not have this information with him and I did not advise him either that this matter was going to be raised.  Therefore, I accept what he is saying.  I ask in the context of fair play and good manners, however, that the Department should at least reach out to them.  I ask if the Minister to please undertake that.</p></speech>

If there was a Labour Court hearing, it is the practice of the State, where the State is a party to a Labour Court hearing and a recommendation is made, to honour and implement that recommendation.  I will, therefore, take that away.  We have noted report No. 42 of 2007.  I will investigate that and come back to the Chairman directly.</p></speech>

With regard to the overall performance on the Estimates and given the challenges of Covid-19 and many other issues, has the Minister identified any challenges to the public spending targets so far this year insofar as he can see into the future?  The European Commission and others have commented on inflation and the possible impact on budgets, for instance.  Does the Minister see that as a particular problem?  Is it manageable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#E01000"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan very much for his question regarding the public finance position within the current year.  As the Deputy knows, on budget day we published our updated budgetary forecasts and also our updated macroeconomic forecasts for the next number of years.  It is fair to say that we have witnessed a strong rebound in the Irish economy in recent months.  That has resulted in very strong revenues across a number of different tax heads, in particular VAT and income tax and, of course, corporation tax receipts continue to be particularly strong.  In addition, we have had some underspends in the system but it remains to be seen precisely what the year-end position will be in that regard.</p> <p>  In overall terms, the expenditure that we forecast on budget day for 2021 was of the order if &euro;89.25 billion.  We anticipate that we will come in below that figure; not by an enormous amount but by perhaps &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million.  It depends how Departments complete their programmes between now and the end of the year, particularly on the capital side.  The forecast deficit for this year is significantly reduced from budget day, however.  I believe we estimated it would be of the order of &euro;13 billion versus the figure of approximately &euro;20 billion that was estimated earlier in the year.  Similarly, for next year, there is a significant improvement in the forecast position.  We are, therefore, working on the basis that the recovery of the economy will continue.  If one looks at the forecasts in terms of growth, both modified domestic demand and GNI*, we are forecasting steady and sustained growth over the next number of years, which will result next year, for example, that we will only be borrowing for the public capital investment programme and not even for all of it.  Some of it will be resourced by Revenue for collecting.</p><p>We estimate that we will be back to having a balanced budget position by 2024.  Certainly, we are in a better position than we thought we would be several months ago, but we also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  We are all witnessing that, including with the continuing challenge being posed by Covid-19 and the impact that inevitably has on the Irish economy.  We remain optimistic regarding inflation.  It is posing many challenges, not least for the people we represent and for businesses.  Costs and household bills are increasing for the public, and that is a real challenge.  The overall forecast is that inflation will peak this quarter and then begin to moderate.  As the committee will be aware, we forecast on budget day that the average inflation rate across next year will be just over 2%, at 2.2%.  The European Central Bank, ECB, believes that the underlying inflation position remains stable, and that it will moderate.  It is confident that the rate of inflation will stay within what the committee members will know is the bank's overall objective of containing inflation to no more than 2% in future.  </p><p> Overall, then, there are many challenges.  From representatives of businesses, I am hearing about staff shortages, increasing costs, global supply challenges and rising energy bills.  Those are the main issues that will present challenges for us in the short term.  We are, however, seeing a strong recovery.  Therefore, we are optimistic, but we must also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  In addition, we also have the issue of Brexit to deal with.  The threat we have heard in that regard from the UK Government concerning the triggering of Article 16 is another potential downside risk for the Irish economy, depending on how that plays out in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which was referred to this committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, and his officials to the meeting.  They are joining the meeting remotely from committee room 1 via Microsoft Teams.  As the Minister of State is present, officials should not speak in public session.  The opening statement and other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  In most instances Oireachtas Members and witnesses may now be physically present in the committee room, or they may join remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to attend where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, members who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I ask members to please identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  Members should mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that they use the raise hand button when they wish to contribute because we do not have a speaking rota for this.  If there is something about which they have a particular interest, they can indicate to me and I will take them in that order.  I remind all those present to switched off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  I now ask the Minister of State to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021112400002#A00400"><p>I am joined by my colleague Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, assistant secretary general, with responsibility for sport and tourism.  As committee members will be aware, the sports sector has been and continues to be severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Throughout this time, Sport Ireland and the Department have been continually engaging with the sector, and we know sporting bodies and clubs have been severely hit in every aspect of their operations, not least financially.</p> <p>  Last year, the Government approved a Covid-19 package of &euro;88.5 million that helped ensure our sporting bodies were in a position to maintain operations, avoid insolvency and prepare for a return to activity.  The package benefited all levels of the sports sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for this year.  In terms of sports clubs, the 2020 funding provided support for more than 166 rugby clubs, more than 400 grassroots and League of Ireland clubs, along with more than 33,000 Gaelic games teams.  In addition, support was provided to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by local sports partnerships, and 310 swimming pools were supported in reopening.</p> <p>  The financial impact of the pandemic continues to be a challenge for many sporting bodies and clubs, with losses and additional costs putting a severe strain on their finances.  Many organisations and clubs have lost significant amounts of revenue owing to the restrictions put in place for much of this year.  The indoor sports sector has been particularly hit, with indoor sports only resuming in October.  Many challenges still lie ahead for sports organisations and clubs in encouraging all members and volunteers to return, as well as attracting new participants.  We need to support participation programmes and initiatives now to ensure the long-term sustainability of clubs' structures and for the health and well-being of the nation.</p> <p>  The Government has approved a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;35 million towards a Covid package of up to &euro;65 million this year, and the rest will be provided from savings from within the Department's Vote.  This funding will allow Sport Ireland, through a number of different schemes, to assist sporting bodies and clubs that are in greatest need as we strive to ensure our sporting sector is supported at every level across the country.  The schemes will be run by Sport Ireland and the funding will be distributed through the national governing bodies of sport, similar to last year.  The schemes will ensure that grant aid will only be provided by Sport Ireland and that the governing bodies are satisfied this funding is absolutely required.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland is currently assessing funding applications from sporting organisations with a view to funding allocations being announced and paid in December.  Funding will be allocated as follows: field sports funding to support the main field sports, that is the FAI, the GAA, and the IRFU; a reliance fund to support the national governing bodies of sport other than the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU; a sports club resilience fund to support clubs from all sports; a swimming pools and facilities fund; and a resumption of physical activity fund that will include indoor sport.  Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26.3 million already provided to Sport Ireland, this will mean a total of &euro;91.3 million will have been allocated in addition to the current funding to support the sports sector in 2021.</p></speech>

I went through sports capital in a previous meeting and this does not relate to that.  In terms of Sport Ireland, the funding position next year will merge in the increase and some of that embeds some of the Covid funding as well.  I am not sure where the Deputy saw that reference.</p></speech>

What the Deputy referred to could be related to some of the Covid funding, but I will check that out because I do not have the figure she has referred to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021112400002#A01400"><p>The Minister of State could perhaps get back to us on that.  On the resumption of the sport and physical activity fund, will he explain what that is about and how it works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021112400002#A01500"><p>It is split between the three main governing bodies for the field sports, the other governing bodies, and the club resilience fund for clubs.  The resumption of sport and physical activity fund is targeted through many local sports partnerships.  It also looks at opportunities around additional physical activity in hard-to-reach groups, such as those in disadvantaged areas, people with disabilities and indoor sports as well.  A similar scheme was run through the local sports partnerships last year.  I can provide the funding amount for that.  Last year, in the Covid-19 package that we funded, &euro;3 million went to local sports partnerships schemes for small grants for clubs and community groups and innovation and restart schemes.  More than 1,600 clubs benefited from that across 28 local sports partnerships.  We also had supports for disabilities, older adults supports and a restart and renewal fund.  It will be similarly funded this year.  There are opportunities in areas of biggest impact.  This year, we want to avoid the scarring effect particularly among indoor sports.  There will be a big emphasis on indoor sports that were closed for the majority of the last 15 or 16 months, as members know.  We want to limit the scarring effect on that.  There will be targeted support through the local sports partnerships and the governing bodies.  That is why we are running this through a number of funding streams.</p></speech>

They have been engaged with by Sport Ireland directly on funding opportunities and new activities.  They tend to target hard-to-reach groups, such as in disadvantaged areas or those with disabilities.</p><p>From last year's announcement there was a specific and even a geographical breakdown within different counties of different initiatives being funded by this Covid-19 fund.  All local sports partnerships would have been engaged with Sport Ireland around what different initiatives they might like to fund relevant to their local areas as well.  The Deputy previously served on a local authority, like me, and there are local sports officers who shape a local sporting initiative relevant to a local community, engaging with volunteers and trying to create something that would make a difference to local communities around sport.  That gives flexibility within local sports partnerships to act.  There will be further opportunities this year.  We can send on the specifics for Louth to the Deputy.</p></speech>

With regard to the part funded by the national lottery in the Revised Estimates, will the Minister of State indicate how much that is?  Is it part of the good causes scheme?  Will he provide some detail on that?</p> <p>  I certainly welcome the Minister of State's support in levelling the playing field with regard to the Women's Gaelic Players Association and its merging with Gaelic Players Association with equality of treatment and the grants associated with that.  It is a very important step and I commend the Minister of State on that action.</p></speech>

It sends the right message to all women and girls around opportunities in sport and participation, particularly in Gaelic games.</p> <p>  The majority of the Sport Ireland budget is funded directly from the Exchequer.  I do not have a breakdown but it would be a very minor amount funded by the national lottery.  I do not have the figure to hand but we can get that for the Deputy.  I have the combined amount for Sport Ireland in subhead D5 of &euro;104 million and it will be &euro;105 million next year.  I do not have the specific breakdown on the national lottery.  I can get that for the committee.  The vast majority of the amount is direct funding from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

This is very welcome and needed.  After nearly two years, it is only recently that sport has kind of opened up.  I would like to get the exact figure on the national lottery as well, particularly what it does and how much it takes in.  What proportion of its money did it give to Sport Ireland?  Will the Minister of State send me the specifics for Wexford?</p> <p>  Recently a few constituents asked me about the organisation for pony racing in Ireland.  I know little about it.  Very often this produces top-class jockeys and it is where they start.  It receives no funding whatever and I was told that even this year, insurance costs were &euro;30,000.  I was told that from the same programme, meanwhile, a golf club in a certain area got &euro;50,000 for a lawnmower.  Pony racing in Ireland should be represented because, as I said, it produces top jockeys and uses all those technical skills.</p></speech>

We can send the detailed breakdown of all counties and local sports partnerships so everybody on the committee can see the specific initiatives relevant to their counties.  That will allow them to see the detail under the figures.  We can do the same when we make our announcements.</p> <p>  On the national lottery point, the amount from the national lottery comes into the general Exchequer balance and sport is one of a number elements that receives an allocation across multiple Departments.  The number is not broken down as to what is specifically national lottery funding but if we can get further detail, I will provide it.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about pony racing and I will follow up with Sport Ireland on that.  What was the Deputy's specific point?</p></speech>

It is a serious sport and it is probably in every parish in Ireland.  It also helps children with autism etc.  As I said, it often produces top-class jockeys, and this is where they start.  It is their first experience in dealing with horses.</p></speech>

One of the criteria to get funding from Sport Ireland is to be a registered and recognised national governing body.  I will have to check if the organisation in question is such a body.  It could be a case of the organisation formalising the arrangement with Sport Ireland, registering as a national governing body and then applying for different funding streams.  I could ask Sport Ireland to send a note to the committee on that.</p></speech>

As a sports person and on behalf of all sporting organisations, I thank the Government for the funding.  The &euro;88.5 million last year was a lot to keep operations going.  It was very good for health and well-being.  This is my first opportunity to wish Mr. John Treacy, chief executive officer of Sport Ireland, the best of luck for the future.  He has done a fantastic job being involved with the organisation since 1999 and since the establishment of Sport Ireland in 2015.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland has distributed money to all levels and the three main national bodies.  I have a fear and I asked this question before.  I have spoken to people in grassroots clubs and as I said, it has been a tough two years.  Many of these clubs have done much fantastic work in the local community.  Is there any way we can audit or check to ensure money is being distributed correctly?  I know a certain amount goes to the three main organisations but there is much money.  Are we following this money?</p> <p>  There are many clubs involved with the three main sports.  I have spoken to people in clubs involved in all sports and some seem to find it very hard to get the money to survive.  What mechanism do we have to examine this?  This is money from the Government and the taxpayer and it is going to the right places but how do we know it is being distributed fairly among organisations?</p></speech>

It has grown as a structure around sport to see Sport Ireland as it is today, with a very professional structure that oversees sport and delivers policy outcomes.  I welcome the Deputy's remarks on funding.</p> <p>  As part of the application process for Covid-19 funding, there is a sport club resilience fund for grassroots.  The three main governing bodies are the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA and within their application process they are asked to be very clear about what supports they are seeking for grassroots or what schemes will be developed so clubs or local organisations can apply for the various supports.</p> <p>  There were supports given as part of last year's package.  I know many football clubs that benefited and it was the same for the GAA.  The GAA made a decision so much of the funding from the Covid-19 package covered basic insurance costs faced by every club.  Maybe people did not connect the Covid-19 funding with the reduction in insurance costs that faced different clubs.  It was one element of the funding package from last year that was directly supported by the State.</p> <p>  There is strong oversight provided by Sport Ireland.  Every aspect of funding is overseen so it goes directly to where it is being sought.  There is a structure around managing and overseeing the process being run by Sport Ireland to ensure the funding goes to where it is sought.</p></speech>

I thank members for their work and the excellent interim report they have produced.  I look forward to the publication of the final report later this year.</p> <p>  I thank the various witnesses who have shared their perspectives with the committee.  The committee provides an important platform for voices from across politics, business, community groups and civil society.  Continued engagement from across these spheres illustrates just how relevant and important the outworking of Brexit remains for all of us.</p> <p>  Almost 12 months ago, we welcomed the finalisation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  This was the final element in a sequence of agreements negotiated to allow the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU and underpin the framework for future relations.  Since then, the work of the joint implementation bodies under the agreement has begun.  In June, we saw the first meeting of the partnership council of the TCA and its subsidiary bodies continue to meet, including, for example, the trade partnership committee which met on 15 November.</p> <p>  The TCA, like the withdrawal agreement, was jointly agreed by the EU and the UK.  Through its joint implementation, we want to maximise the opportunities presented by the TCA.  We want to see the future relationship with the UK develop positively.  To achieve this the parties must work together in a spirit of partnership and trust.  When trust is compromised, progress is threatened.  The recent UK approach to the protocol has, unfortunately, called that trust into question.  I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum towards agreeing a constructive way forward through compromise and partnership on the protocol.</p> <p>  The EU has an unwavering commitment to the people of Northern Ireland and the implementation of the protocol.  Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has repeatedly stated, including before this committee, that the Union's number one priority remains to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is protected, a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided and the integrity of the EU Single Market is maintained.</p> <p>  In October, following extensive engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders, from political leaders to businesses and a cross-section of civic society, the Commission published a package of proposals setting out creative and practical solutions designed to help Northern Ireland deal with the consequences of Brexit.  These non-papers cover the issues of customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, medicines, and improving engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders and authorities.  Since their publication, the EU has been in dialogue with the UK with the ambition of achieving agreed solutions that can ensure greater stability and certainty for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I remain in close and regular contact with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and we met last week.  He remains committed to finding credible and durable solutions for the genuine concerns raised with him by people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  Last week, I also met Lord Frost and reiterated the need to engage constructively in this process, grasp the current window of opportunity and agree a deal that can address the real-world concerns of people in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I believe the remaining issues can be resolved.  However, to do so, we need to get to a much more positive, stable and trusting EU-UK relationship.  We have some way to go to get there.  I assure the House that the Government will not stop doing all it can to help develop, support and sustain such a relationship in the interests of all of the people on this island.  I look forward to members' questions and comments. </p></speech>

I listened to it in my room due to the Covid regulations.  The whole issue of Brexit and where we will go and how we will move forward in the next few months is important.  How will this affect the agricultural community, in particular?  I mention the origin of Irish products and how Irish products could be affected by any disruption of trade.  Some 40% of the North's milk comes South to be processed.  How will that be looked at in the long term regarding the Brexit negotiations?  It is a significant issue for an industry that is worth &euro;19 billion to the economy.  That would be the all-Ireland milk processing potential we have.  It is one of the major drivers in the economy.  How will we work with the companies involved in cross-Border activity regarding the processing of milk products?  How can that be looked at going forward and how will that be affected?</p> <p>  Can the Minister update us on how the ports have handled themselves over the last six months, including on tariffs and the implications of and the work that is required to get through the port network?  A significant amount of product now goes directly to the Continent, which is a step forward, but there is still a major proportion using the land bridge through the UK.  Where is that process at the moment?  What are the failings and positives regarding how we could appropriately manage those issues?</p> <p>  The last issue has to do with cross-Border healthcare and how it could be, or is, affected by Brexit.  There is an issue regarding the cross-Border directive that allows for patients to go to a European Union country and this has been slightly changed regarding Northern Ireland and how that fits in.  There was a temporary situation put in place last year for it.  Can the Minister update us on where that issue will go?  It is a significant issue for many people, particularly in the northern half of Ireland but even in my own constituency as well, who would avail of the scheme.  How will that scheme work its way through the system so we can have an appropriate scheme where people can get cross-Border healthcare?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021112400002#D00500"><p>Let me start in reverse.  First of all, it is welcome that the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme and transition cross-Border directive arrangements have been successfully in operation since 1 January.  Both these measures continue to ensure that patients have access to healthcare in Northern Ireland and, in limited circumstances, the UK.  While the scheme has been operating on an administrative basis to date, the Government intends to place the scheme on a statutory basis.  An extensive examination of options to inform the drafting of the general scheme is currently being undertaken by officials in the Department of Health, and that work continues at pace.  Effectively, there has been an <i>ad hoc</i>arrangement in place since 1 January, but we will put that on a statutory footing and the Department of Health is looking to finalise how to do that.</p><p>On ports, it might be good to put a number of things on the record.  Initial difficulties in adjusting to the new trading environment have largely settled.  The vast majority of goods movements are now green-routed, which means they are not checked at all and are permitted to leave the port without any interaction with customs or the other regulatory authorities.  Well over 80% of goods are green-routed now.  Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the HSE Environmental Health Service are actively working together to streamline processes and reduce the administrative burden for traders as much as they can, while continuing to meet our obligations under EU law.  Work is under way to improve inter-agency communication, increase data sharing and reduce duplication and to streamline processes as much as possible while ensuring that the necessary controls are performed.</p><p>The committee raised the issue in its interim report, in that it wanted State agencies to effectively be in one location in ports.  To be fair, they are trying to do as much of that as they can.  There have been a number of developments since the start of the year and further developments are intended to address the key requests of traders.  For example, a key request from trade was to provide an interface that allowed system-to-system communications between traders, customs systems, and the Revenue RoRo system.  This has been delivered and has removed some of the manual work involved in completing the pre-boarding notification.  There are limits to what can be done in terms of co-location of authorities at ports.  At Dublin Port, for example, there are space and layout limitations.  In addition, certain checks such as animal health checks or food safety checks may require dedicated infrastructure to ensure that such checks can be safely undertaken, like stables in Dublin Port, for example.  That said, the agencies continue to work together to identify ways in which the passage of trucks through Dublin Port, in particular, can be streamlined.Since the start of the year we have seen a very significant increase in the traffic from Dublin and Rosslare directly to mainland Europe, into France, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>We have seen quite a significant reduction in the use of the land bridge, but also quite an increase in UK-Northern Ireland trade, with product coming in through Larne and Belfast.  A significant amount of Northern Ireland product would previously have come through Dublin.  Approximately 40% of product coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain would have come through Dublin Port, and some of that has now been diverted directly into Larne and Belfast.<br/><br/>There has been a dramatic shift to direct ferry routes.  There are about 36 direct ferry routes a week now.  That figure would have been less than a dozen this time last year, so it happened in the space of a short period of time.  We had conversations about whether the State needed to subsidise direct routes and our response to that was that we believed the market would respond.  If you subsidise it, you could undermine market forces in terms of the viability of that.  To be fair, the advice from the shipping companies was not to subsidise these routes.  If it makes sense to do it from a commercial perspective, it will happen anyway.  That is exactly what has happened, and it continues to grow.  If anything, we are investing in port infrastructure in mainland Europe to streamline a number of those routes.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, has visited a number of those ports in relation to the investment that is taking place.  The port infrastructure story is a positive one.  While there much focus in Northern Ireland on the problems in terms of checks and goods coming in from Great Britain, the ports in the South have just got on with making the changes and trying to make it work, and some of the supply chains have changed accordingly.<br/><br/>In terms of an update on agriculture and on Brexit in general, having a trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, in place is hugely important for agriculture.  A big part of our agricultural trade is with Britain, but a big part of Britain's food trade comes to Ireland as well.  It is an &euro;8 billion trading relationship back and forth across the Irish sea.  It sells much food to us.  It is not quite as much as we sell to them, but it is still a very significant figure.  Therefore, avoiding tariffs on that trade with a TCA was, and is, hugely important.<br/><br/>In terms of the protocol, anyone in the food industry in Northern Ireland, and certainly the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland, recognises the value of the protocol.  Whether you are nationalist or unionist, the capacity for seamless all-island trade in terms of the food industry is really important, and the protocol guarantees that.  However, one of the problems with that has been the country of origin rules.  What was clear through the Brexit debates was that even though the protocol effectively extends the EU Single Market for goods to Northern Ireland, <i>de facto</i>, the country of origin issues were not solved by that.  If a dairy product is produced in Northern Ireland, it is Northern Ireland product.  It is not EU origin.  Even though it is produced to EU standards and it is produced within the EU Single Market, it is not EU origin.  This has allowed that product to be sold into the EU Single Market seamlessly.  However, if the product is going to take advantage of EU trade agreements with other parts of the world, because it is not origin EU but origin UK, that creates a difficulty.  <br/><br/>I have been raising this issue for three years.  We wanted to try to get it resolved in the Brexit negotiations but it was not possible to do that.  There was not a big ask from the UK Government to solve this issue.  Many dairy processors, such as Lakeland Dairies, source a significant portion of their raw material from farmers in Northern Ireland.  That is really important for Northern Ireland agriculture.  I would like to see a situation where the EU works to accommodate Northern Ireland produced product in future trade agreements and to look at whether it is possible to amend existing trade agreements to facilitate Northern Ireland product being considered as EU product of origin, because it is EU standard.  Therefore, if we are going to have Northern Ireland as part of an extended EU Single Market for goods, then one of the upsides of that is to benefit from EU trade agreements in terms of origin.  We have to find a way of doing that that does not undermine the UK origin as well, in terms of potential future UK trade agreements for product produced in Northern Ireland.  That is tricky and it has not been solved yet.<br/><br/>The truth is that it has not been that disruptive to the dairy industry.  Dairy prices are strong at the moment.  Senator Lombard and other dairy farmers will know that.  That has not been a big issue yet because there has been a strong demand for dairy products across the EU Single Market.  This will only become an issue if you are relying on that product, or mixed pools from North and South, being sold under EU trade agreements to other parts of the world.  Companies have managed that in a clever enough way so far, and it certainly has not undermined price or market access so far.  However, it is something that the dairy industry would like to have resolved.  It is not just dairy; it is other product as well, including beef, sheep meat, poultry product or whatever.  We import a lot of poultry product across the Border from Moy Park and others.<br/><br/>It would be useful if we could facilitate a sort of dual labelling, if you like.  If a product is produced to EU standards, it should, therefore, be seen as part of the EU system, but of course it is UK product and should, therefore, be facilitated as UK product in the future as well.  That is a tricky issue that is not resolved yet.  If we can get the protocol settled in terms of its implementation on the basics through the negotiations between the &Scaron;efovi and Frost teams, then hopefully, through partnership, we might be able to find ways of dealing with that country of origin issue over time.  Luckily, for now, dairy prices are strong so the industry has managed to cope with that country of origin issue, from what I have heard.  It is not an anomaly; it is a real issue.  This could be problematic if there were an oversupply of dairy product in the EU and people were looking to rely much more on access through trade agreements and so on.  Those are the long answers to three short questions. </p></speech>

I understand you were discussing the House of Lords letter before I arrived.  It raises some very interesting questions about pharmaceuticals, medicines, licensing and the like.  Are we running into any difficulties with British medicines imports in the Republic?  Is it causing any difficulty at our ports and for our health system?  Boots operates in the South as well as the North.</p><p>Is it suffering difficulties?  Are we aware of that and has any of that come to our attention?  It cannot be only a Northern problem.  We must be having some problems too, certainly in relation to over-the-counter products.  Many of them used to be made in Britain, and a lot of British products are available in Ireland.  On pharmaceutical and quasi-pharmaceutical products, there are chains like Boots functioning in both jurisdictions.  Are we suffering problems that are different from those being encountered in Northern Ireland?  Would the outcome of the current negotiations, including the possibility of arriving at some middle-ground solution, have any implications for us in this State?</p></speech>

Certainly, there is a fear that certain drugs may not be able to get into Northern Ireland because they are certified in Great Britain and that certification would not be recognised by the EU, and therefore that product coming into the EU Single Market for goods would be problematic because it is not certified by the EU.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has committed to a proposal that would resolve that issue.  In fact, it very much mirrors a UK paper that was presented to the Commission in March, and that is effectively the basis for the solution the EU wants to provide.  It will effectively change EU law to recognise UK certification for Northern Ireland, therefore guaranteeing a seamless supply of medicines into Northern Ireland.  There has been much talk about that.</p> <p>  My understanding is that as of yet there has not been a significant shortage of medicines in Northern Ireland, but that was a fear that could develop.  This was a big fear about a year out from when Brexit was likely to take effect.  There was quite a lot of discussion with the pharmaceutical industry on this issue.  It was not just about human medicines, but it was about veterinary and animal medicines as well.  To date, there has not been a shortage.  I have yet to see empty shelves in any Boots stores.  There is one across from my office in Carrigaline, in my constituency.  This has not been an issue.</p> <p>  The solution the EU is putting together is a solution for Northern Ireland, not for the EU as a whole.  What we are seeing is the industry responding by altering its supply chains.  There may be some changes in some brands and the use of generic drugs in terms of certain types of drugs and so on, but I am not aware of any concern or panic in the industry that this will lead to a shortage of drugs here.  It has had quite a long lead in time to be able to change supply chains and to ensure EU certification.  I will ask Mr. Karl Gardner to comment on that, but that is my understanding.</p></speech>

Is there any difficulty for Irish pharmaceutical manufacturers selling into the UK market?  This should be considered at the same time if we are going to have a common branding for Northern Ireland.  There is a possible risk that people might transpose their manufacture to Northern Ireland to avail of the best of both worlds.</p></speech>

If you take my constituency, for example, which probably has the second largest cluster of pharmaceuticals in the EU, all the big brands are there and nearly all of those companies have a big footprint in the UK as well.  The manufacturing systems effectively relied on Ireland and the UK seamlessly interacting on ingredients, packaging and research and development programmes and so on.  Some of that was restructured recognising the likely outcome of Brexit and ensuring that products being produced for the EU market were being finished in the EU.  Every company is different, but that is my understanding of what many of them have done.</p> <p>  I am not aware that the UK is looking to ban EU certified medicines coming into the UK.  However, the reverse is not the same.  Within the EU, because of its size and scale, it essentially does not recognise approval bodies from third countries.  I would be very surprised if the UK were to reciprocate and only to be able to access medicines that are certified in the UK.  Maybe I will ask Mr. Gardner to come in to make sure what I said is accurate.</p></speech>

One area we are working with the Commission on is to ensure continued market access to what they call the small member states of Cyprus, Malta and Ireland and which are English speaking small member states.  It does not want any fallout from any impact the hubbing and the warehousing of products would have in the UK.  As we saw with a number of issues, goods are brought in and dealt with in the UK and then are redistributed.  That is an area we are working with the Commission on and it is well aware of it and it is in train.</p></speech>

That redistribution centre covered the UK and Ireland.  They were not even re-boxed; they were just redistributed from the UK.  They then became stateless in terms of origin because they came from the UK into Ireland.</p></speech>

They could not be treated as UK product because they originated in EU.  Those redistribution centres have had to change their systems quite fundamentally.  Many retailers in Ireland now access directly through hubs in France, the Netherlands, Germany and so on.  However, it is not as easy to do that for medicines.  It is not like a box of corn flakes.</p></speech>

There are many more upsides than downsides to the protocol.  All of the political focus has been on the negative, in terms of the number of checks required, the limitations and the chilled meat issue, which became sort of an identity issue of British sausages coming into Northern Ireland.  More and more people are starting to look the positives.  When you speak to business leaders, they are very clear on two things.  First, they think the protocol needs to stay, but we have got to make it work a bit better and, second, they do not want Article 16 triggered because they think that is going to have a knock-on consequence in terms of the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  The ask that I get from Northern Ireland, apart from some unionist political leaders, but certainly from business leaders, is that the protocol is not perfect, but let us make it work as best we can, and let us start talking about the upside, because there is very significant upside.  Northern Ireland has this unique opportunity to access a very large UK single market and also the much larger EU Single Market.</p><p>If you ask anyone in the agrifood sector, in particular, and many other manufacturers in Northern Ireland, the protocol for them is very exciting in terms of business opportunity.  As Senator McDowell said, there is potentially a pull factor into Northern Ireland in terms of foreign direct investment.  If the protocol is stable and predictable, you could access both markets very efficiently from Northern Ireland.  You might have some country of origin labelling issues, but if your target market is the EU Single Market and-or the UK as a single market, you have a very attractive opportunity for seamless trade into both, which you do not have south of the Border.  </p></speech>

It seems that <i>a priori </i>it is not a huge advantage if you are thinking of making a big investment and the whole thing could be radically different.</p></speech>

One of the asks of the British side was that the protocol should and could never be imposed on Northern Ireland against the will of the majority there.  That is something I absolutely agree with.  As much as I think the protocol can work, if the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want it, we have to accept that.  The are extraordinary consequences if we do away with the protocol.  It raises all sorts of questions around the all-Ireland economy and a whole range of other things. However, there needs to be a democratic endorsement of what is effectively an international agreement.</p></speech>

If there is a large majority of more than two thirds, then the next vote can be put off for eight years.  My hope would be, and this may be naive, is that if we can get compromise and flexibility in a way that allows business and many in the unionist community to accept the protocol, then we could get to the point where there is a very strong endorsement of it and then it does not need to come up again for eight years.  Although for now, it is every four years.</p> <p>  While of course you would like cross-community support, you could credibly have a situation where a minority of people in Northern Ireland could do away with the protocol when a majority of people want it.  Cross-community support is part of the Good Friday Agreement on issues that are devolved to the Executive and the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  Cross-community support is not part of decisions for the UK Government, in terms of international decisions.  The principle of consent is about what the majority want and cross-community support is a separate and important issue in Northern Ireland.  The protocol issues relate to a British Government agreed international agreement, and therefore it would be a very perverse approach to say that because of the need for cross-community support, you could have a minority of people deciding the future of the protocol against a majority.  That does not mean we should not look for cross-community support; of course we should.  That is why, despite the fact that many in the unionist community think that I have been very unreasonable in relation to the protocol, its construct and so on, we are probably the strongest advocates for flexibility and compromise on the EU side to try to respond to the legitimate concerns that many have raised.  </p> <p>  We should be able to significantly  reduce the checks burden on goods that we can show are staying in Northern Ireland and are at no risk of crossing the border into the EU Single Market or into the EU.  That is what we have been pushing Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on, and to be fair, he has responded.  On the food side, he thinks we can reduce sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks by 80%, as long as we can show those goods will be sold and consumed in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, on the customs side, he thinks that we can reduce the burden by 50%.  That is the space for agreement.</p> <p>  Lord Frost wants more than that.  What he is asking for is that all goods that are being sold in Northern Ireland and are staying in Northern Ireland that come from Great Britain should be exempt from any form of checks, customs declarations and so on.  That is a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver and it is not consistent with the protocol.  However, the EU can go a long way with it to reduce that checks burden significantly in what Lord Frost would describe as inter-UK trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  That is the space in which the teams are currently talking.</p></speech>

We will see if the communications are back running.  We still cannot hear him.  Senator Gallagher, if you want to send your question by the chat function, I will ask it for you.  I might ask the Minister a question while Senator Gallagher is doing that.</p> <p>  At our last meeting, we had Vice-President &Scaron;efovi before our committee and he gave us a very comprehensive update and was quite candid in his contributions.  He was questioned around the accuracy of the current proposals on reducing checks by 80%.  His remark was that we know the Single Market and the customs union.  He was quite strong in his remarks that what it has offered is good and doable.  When pressed on what might happen if there is not a resolution or if Article 16 is triggered, he said that the EU was ready to take whatever steps are needed.  A week is a long time in this process.  What is the current state of the negotiations?  Do you feel that there is a mood there to try to resolve this?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021112400002#G00700"><p>I have not received a briefing from today's discussion.  Generally what happens is the two teams meet on Wednesday and Thursday, and it is every second week in Brussels and London.  Then the two principals meet on Friday to assess progress, or not, as the case may be.  Two weeks ago, there was a noticeable change in tone coming from the British side, which certainly suggested to the EU that the negotiation was worth investing in.  Before that, the negotiations were going nowhere.  Last week was difficult, but at the same time, substantive in terms of the discussions.  The Lord Frost and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi meeting was professional and constructive.  Let us wait and see what happens this week.</p> <p>  There is no secret in this because in Lord Frost's briefing of party leaders in Northern Ireland and other stakeholders, including business leaders in Northern Ireland, he has shown much scepticism as to whether or not the &Scaron;efovi or the Commission proposals can deliver what they say they are going to deliver; that is, the 80% reductions in SPS checks on food and agrifood products coming in to Northern Ireland and staying in Northern Ireland and the 50% figure on customs checks.  I have put that directly to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and his team and they are very clear and strong on that, in that they believe they can deliver those numbers.  Not only that, but they are looking to work with the British Government to show how it can be done.  Of course, that will involve input from the British side too, in terms of the sharing of data and labelling so the EU can fully understand that there is a trusted trader system that both sides can see in a transparent way.  A company like Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, for example, has systems that can show where a product is distributed from in Great Britain.  The product comes into Northern Ireland and it will be able to show the shelf from which it has been sold.</p><p>If information like that is shared, then the EU can get much reassurance around trusting that a product is staying in, sold in and consumed in Northern Ireland, and therefore the checks burden on us should be reduced dramatically.  That involves partnership between both sides in terms of sharing information and data and potentially labelling as well.  That is what Vice-President &Scaron;efovi means when he says we can deliver this, but we need partnerships with the British Government and the British regulatory system to make it work.</p><p> I am more hopeful than I have been.  I spoke to Lord Frost last week and it was a good conversation.  He reminded me that they still regard Article 16 as a perfectly legitimate tool to use.  I do not believe Article 16 was ever designed to set aside large parts of the protocol.  It was essentially a safeguard clause in an emergency situation to make a temporary amendment, but then to return, in time, to the normal functioning of the protocol.  I do not believe that is what the British Government is suggesting it would use Article 16 for.  It is effectively suggesting that if it cannot get the compromise that it is looking for from the EU, it may act unilaterally and use Article 16 to set aside elements of the protocol that it does not believe are necessary.  If it does that, I do not believe the EU will respond well; in fact, I know it will not.  The EU will respond very robustly and it will regard it as a fairly serious breach of good faith in terms of the protocol and the Article 16 mechanism.  I am sure Vice-President &Scaron;efovi told the committee that the EU regards the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement ,TCA, as inextricably linked to each other.  Therefore, the EU would not even agree to start negotiating a TCA until there was a withdrawal agreement in place, backed by a treaty, that is, international law.  If the British Government decides to set aside elements of the withdrawal agreement, that is, elements of the protocol, then that has a carry-over into whether or not the EU can implement the TCA as agreed.  That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland, or in the UK, for that matter.</p><p> There is much at stake over the next few weeks, and the focus probably needs to be on what percentage of, and what elements of, checks can we effectively do without, and at the same time protect the integrity of the EU Single Market.  How do we put systems in place that can dramatically reduce the checks burden on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we know are staying in Northern Ireland and can show and prove that?  How can both sides work together to remove that burden and make it easier for businesses to source from Great Britain in terms of their supply chains?  If we can make a lot of progress in that area, that will deal with many of the unionist concerns and many of the business concerns in Northern Ireland linked to the protocol.  The EU is in that space, but it cannot remove 100% of the checks.  That is not credible and it is not consistent with what was agreed.  However, it can certainly show a lot of flexibility, and it is willing to do that.</p><p> I will get a briefing on where we are again on Friday.  There is still quite a big gap between the two sides, if we are honest.  At least the negotiations now are focused on and are serious about trying to find landing grounds, which is a welcome change.  We should give those negotiating teams time and space and also the confidentiality of what goes on in the negotiating rooms that, hopefully, can facilitate the building of some trust.  Trust is possibly the biggest problem.</p><p> If I am frank, the EU is concerned that if it makes a concession it will be banked and Lord Frost's team will then take that and look for more.  The UK side has got to give something here, too.  It is not all about the EU giving.  If you look at what has happened since the start of the year, all of the concessions and flexibility have been moving in one direction only, and that has been a very successful negotiating strategy for Lord Frost and his team.  However, there are limits to that as to how far the EU can go if it does not believe it is moving towards an end point through negotiation.  We are pretty close to that end point now. </p></speech>

Lord Frost is a good and tough negotiator and good luck to him.  The EU also has concerns that need to be protected.  As Vice-President &Scaron;efovi said at this committee, its priorities are the integrity of the Single Market, not compromising it, protecting an all-island economy, protecting a peace process and ensuring there is no need for any physical border infrastructure to re-emerge on the island of Ireland.  That is what the protocol is there for, and it does that job.</p> <p>  What we are now trying to do is to reduce the checks burden on east-west trade only, from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, which of course is the price of the protocol.  Those are goods coming into the EU Single Market.  I think Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has gone a long way to try to respond to the asks and frustrations of people in Northern Ireland on those issues.</p> <p>  The medicines issue has a solution that involves the EU changing its laws.  The sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks burden can be reduced dramatically as indeed can the customs issue.</p> <p>  The other big question that continues to be asked by leaders in Northern Ireland is on the democratic deficit issues linked to the protocol.  This impacts on Northern Ireland, but it does not have a say in the future application of the protocol apart from through joint committee structures and so on.  Therefore, the Commission is willing to look at formalising more structures in terms of communication.  That has to be supported by the British Government as well, if it wants to do it.  That is where we are.</p></speech>

Senator Gallagher has joined us in the committee room because the technology is not working and we will take a question from him.  Senator Wall sent me a question because again the technology is not working.</p> <p>  You mentioned the word "trust" at the end of your comments, which leads on to my next question.  We have just discussed the state of the current negotiations.  What is the state of the current relationship between the Irish Government and the UK Government?  While Lord Frost's negotiating tactics might be considered to have been quite effective, they have left a sour taste in the mouths of many people in Ireland and indeed in Europe.  The consistent threat to trigger Article 16 and to undermine years of negotiation and work, to the detriment of people on this island, North and South, has been a regrettable way for the UK team to be doing business.  There is a considerable body of work there for us now to try to rebuild those relationships, because they are quite strained.  What is the level of engagement now between Ministers and their UK counterparts?  What is that relationship is currently?</p> <p>  I will read Senator Wall's questions.  You mentioned seizing momentum in your opening remarks, so what are the next steps?  What supports are in place to deal with Irish exports and UK tariffs?</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher, I invite you to ask your questions.  We will then go back to the Minister, because we are tight on time.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time out of his busy schedule to update us on where things are in relation to Brexit.  For someone from the outside looking in on all of this, it must be hugely frustrating to be dealing with this particular issue.  Following the Chair's comments, where would the Minister rate the current relationship with the British Government, on a scale of one to ten?</p><p>Perhaps he has just answered that question.  In many ways, for somebody from the outside, who does not know all the facts, looking in, it is like dealing with a spoilt child in that they keep putting the hand out for more.  When is a deal a deal?  When is a deal finally sealed?  Everyone thought this was all done and dusted, tied up legally between the two parliaments.  We thought the deal was done.  Here we are now renegotiating again.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the tactic employed by the UK has been very rewarding as far as it is concerned.  It seems to be a case that the EU negotiating team keeps on giving.  If I were part of the UK negotiating team, I would want more of the same because it seems to be paying off.  For how long will this process go on?<br/><br/>Another question relates to the positives that Northern Ireland would enjoy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the protocol, which the Minister touched on.  It puts Northern Ireland in a unique trading position whereby it can trade unencumbered and have access to the EU market, while at the same time trade within the UK and be part of any future trade agreements the UK may negotiate.  There has been some evidence of that unique position already.  There have been two major job announcements recently, one announced by Coca-Cola in regard to a large number of jobs being created in Belfast, and one by Almac in Craigavon which is creating 1,000 jobs over the coming three to five year period.  In regard to that, Craigavon is approximately half an hour to 45 minutes from Monaghan town.  As someone who comes from a Border constituency, I wonder should we be making more of those job announcements in Northern Ireland.  It is a good story to tell, not just from a Northern Ireland perspective but for those of us who live in Border counties, including my colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly.  It is not that long a journey to travel from Monaghan town, north Monaghan or even Cavan to Craigavon.  There are benefits for the Border community, if not for the island as a whole.  Should we make more hay, if you like, out of those announcements?  Should we market ourselves across the EU and across the globe, based on Northern Ireland's position, from an all-Ireland perspective?  We could benefit from that unique trading relationship Northern Ireland currently has.<br/><br/>My final point is somewhat connected.  The Minister might use his good offices to talk to the relevant people north of the Border.  In early January the minimum unit price on alcohol will come into effect.  For those who live along the Border, many retailers fear that day coming.  We are all in favour of the minimum unit price on alcohol coming in.  It has proven beneficial in Scotland in that it has had the desired effect.  It was my understanding that this issue was going to be tackled on an all-island basis.</p></speech>

There will be plenty of opportunity to do that if we can get an agreement.  I am anxious to focus on the limited but nevertheless evident progress over the past ten days or so and to try to encourage that progress even further.  It is not helpful for me to talk about how people have behaved or what they have said over the past ten months or so.  Clearly, it has put a heavy strain on relationships between the EU and the UK, between Ireland and the UK, and at times also between the UK and Washington in regard to the concerns coming from the White House and others on Capitol Hill.  However, there will be a time to discuss all that.  For now, we have a little bit of momentum in these talks and we should focus on that.  I will encourage both sides to try to make progress.</p> <p>  When I said that the British negotiating tactic has been very successful, that is true in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU, but it is not true in terms of reputation and relationships which are very important for a country the size of the UK and a country as globalised as the UK.  That is all I will say on it.</p> <p>  As for the next steps in regard to momentum, there are two very experienced and smart negotiators with very good teams supporting them.  Let us hope that they get the political instruction to do a deal, because that is what is needed here.  Negotiating teams can only do what the key decision makers, politically, allow them to do.  What is needed between now and Christmas is for the British Prime Minister to give a signal to Lord Frost that we need to try to conclude these negotiations and get the best deal available, and we need a signal from President von der Leyen to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi that he needs to do the same.  I have spent a good deal of time speaking to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  We are very lucky to have Mr. &Scaron;efovi.  He is very interested in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  He is very interested in being helpful and in solutions.  He has pushed the Commission really hard, right to the edge of the boundaries of what is legally consistent with the protocol.  That is because he wants to get a deal done.  They are very much in that space.  I hope the British side is too.  They have achieved much in this negotiation in regard to changing how the protocol is both perceived and implemented but, as Mr. &Scaron;efovi said, if they ask for the impossible, then it cannot be delivered.  That is a political choice for the Prime Minister.  I am more hopeful now than I was a fortnight ago.  Is this hugely frustrating?  Yes, of course it is.  We thought this issue was put to bed.  Do not forget, the protocol was agreed two years ago but on 17 December 2020, the British Government agreed an implementation plan for the protocol.  Michael Gove was then the key negotiator and he agreed that with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  The approach changed then, as January and February passed.  The personalities on the British side changed from Michael Gove being the lead negotiator to Lord Frost being the lead negotiator and, as I said, they have achieved much since then.</p><p>The EU is getting close to its horizon of what it can do.  Hopefully, that is recognised in London. </p><p> Regarding the positives for Northern Ireland, finally some people are starting to talk about that.  Instead of politicians leading the debate, industry is starting to be part of that discussion in a major way.  Some people have asked me if there is a threat that businesses and investment in the Republic may potentially go north?  I do not see that as a threat.  I would welcome a significant increase in investment in Northern Ireland.  It is good for the all-island economy and, God knows, Northern Ireland deserves it, given the pulling and dragging that Northern Ireland has had to put up with throughout the Brexit debates and so on.  I would not begrudge Northern Ireland that economic success at all.  We have a very competitive proposition for foreign direct investment south of the Border but increasingly now, there is a strong and growing proposition for foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland.  Personally I would welcome that.  It is a great opportunity.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the mechanisms and compensation for tariffs.  First, the TCA guarantees there are no tariffs, unless the TCA is called into question because the protocol gets called into question, as the two are interlinked.  It would be incredibly frustrating if, after all the negotiations, decisions and compromises to get the TCA and withdrawal agreement in place, all of that started to unravel because of a unilateral decision in London.  I hope that does not happen but if it does happen, the EU is prepared for that, I would say.  I do not want to go into that too much because, again, I do not want to focus on failure when we need to be focusing on achieving an agreement and a compromise.</p><p> On minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which does not have anything to do with the protocol or Brexit, when I say we could not get the Executive in Northern Ireland to agree, I do not think that is fully fair.  We have certainly indicated that we would like to do this on an all-island basis because we do not want people going across the Border to shop for cheap alcohol because we have introduced minimum pricing here.  We believe it is a good public health measure to ensure that alcohol is not being used as a loss-leader or being sold for half nothing and being abused as a result.  We believe that has worked in other jurisdictions and it will work here.  We would of course like Northern Ireland to do this with us at the same time but we do not have any guarantees on that and we cannot wait forever.  The Government's view on this is we would like to do this on an all-island basis if we can but, if not, we need to move ahead anyway.  We need to try to manage the cross-Border trade consequences of that as best we can.</p></speech>

This is a political decision for the Executive.  I will not overreach as I sometimes get criticised for doing that by politicians in Northern Ireland.  This is a matter for the Executive.  It is its issue.  We have signalled for some time that we want to do this, we think it is a good public health measure and we would like to do it together but it is a matter for the Executive to respond as to why it either does or does not want to do it on the same timeline as us.  Efforts to do this on an all-island basis have effectively delayed this measure for longer than it would otherwise have been delayed.  The view of the Department of Health is that while it may potentially cause some trade disruption potentially and cross-Border shopping, which would be frustrating, we still think that, on the whole, this is a public health measure we need to move ahead with.  I think it will happen.  It is a fair question and a matter I will raise with some of the political leaders in Northern Ireland whom I will meet next week.</p></speech>
