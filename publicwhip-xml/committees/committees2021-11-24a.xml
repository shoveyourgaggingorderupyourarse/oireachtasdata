    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members for the opportunity to be here today to discuss this issue.  An important pillar of Government policy is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development in a very wide geographic distribution around the country.</p> <p>  The horse and greyhound racing industries make a valuable contribution to our economy.  It is estimated that the thoroughbred industry has an annual economic impact of &euro;1.84 billion with direct and indirect employment of 29,000 people, and the greyhound sector provides an estimated 10,000 people with economic benefit.  The thoroughbred industry, in particular, brings a high level of international investment into Ireland.  Government funding, in addition to supporting these key industries, presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy, thereby providing widespread benefits to our society.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at an international level.  We are the third biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the United States as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally.</p> <p>  Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding.</p> <p>  Thanks to the hard work and exceptional support of Irish people for the vaccination programme, the Government has been in a position to continue to gradually reopen society over the last period of time.  Since 22 October 2021, following the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and in line with the Reframing the Challenge - Continuing our recovery and reconnecting strategy, full attendance has once again been allowed at outdoor events in both greyhound and thoroughbred racing.  This situation is being kept under review as the winter months continue.</p> <p>  The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was created under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;.  In the period from 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.46 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has been reached.  Exchequer support provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of both industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2022, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.</p> <p>  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of Budget 2022, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% of the funding going to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% of it going to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  In order to allow my Department to provide for these fundings, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Act to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund by &euro;88 million to &euro;1.54 billion.  This is achieved by way of regulations, which I have submitted to the committee today.  The aggregate limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009 to 2021, inclusive.</p> <p>  On the horse racing industry, the 2017 Deloitte report, Economic Impact of Irish Breeding and Racing, commissioned by HRI, indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry was estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries. </p> <p>  Horse racing generates a very significant return to the rural economy in Ireland, in particular, and a positive international profile for the country.  Of course, behind all facts and figures are the thousands of men and women who, directly and indirectly, make the Irish racing and breeding industry what it is today.  While the Covid pandemic has had a major impact at all levels of the industry, particularly in the area of racecourses and attendance, the metrics of horses in training, owners, runners, fixtures and race numbers have all shown strong growth this year over the corresponding pre-pandemic figures for 2019.  Figures published by HRI for the first six months of 2021 show horse in training numbers, which is a key driver of rural employment in the industry, are up 24% on the last comparable figures from 2019, with ownership also up by almost 24% and new owners registered showing a 30% increase on the 2019 figure.  Those are very significant increases across the board and across those key metrics.  Turnover in 2021 is estimated to reach &euro;154.7 million by year end, which would be an increase on &euro;48 million in 2020, but down &euro;10.5 million on 2019 levels.  HRI continues to engage with all racecourses to crystallise losses incurred due to Covid-19.</p> <p>  As proven in 2021 to date, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses are setting standards globally, and their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore Ireland&rsquo;s international prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level, despite other major racing nations having much larger populations and economies.</p><p>The importance of a strong welfare and integrity foundation to this highly successful industry is crucial and this is well recognised throughout the industry.  My Department and I will continue to work with HRI, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the highest standards of integrity and welfare are maintained.  In that regard, I am in receipt of this committee&rsquo;s report on integrity in horse racing which the committee issued earlier this month.  This followed a series of meetings with this forum involving officials from my Department, HRI, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board and the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association in the summer.  My officials are examining the report and they, and I, will fully consider its findings.  </p><p> It is of note that Government funding, in addition to supporting this key industry, also presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment leading to a flow of income throughout the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy.  The EU-UK trade and co-operation agreement reached in December 2020 which included the Northern Ireland protocol was a welcome development for the sector.  It should be noted however, that challenges remain in regard to the movement of horses between Ireland and Britain, and between Ireland and mainland Europe, for those animals transiting via the UK land bridge.  The global nature of major breeding operations illustrates that while Ireland arguably now holds a leadership position within Europe our pre-eminence is never guaranteed. </p><p> According to the 2021 Power report the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly across the Irish economy.  It is estimated that in 2019 the industry supported more than 4,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition there are more than 6,000 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at more than 10,000.  The funding provided to the greyhound sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country, both rural and traditionally urban.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, highly rural areas.  The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare focused and founded on a strong regulatory system.</p><p> There is a strong commitment to improved animal welfare in the sector.  That commitment is clear in the programme for Government.  My Department is committed to the continued strengthening of welfare standards in the greyhound industry.  Future funding of the sector is contingent on welfare standards being upheld and this is reflected in annual parameters set out by my officials in their liaison with R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> Provisions in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 which came into effect in May 2019 are making a real difference in this regard.  This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability as well.  The new Act improves the governance of R&aacute;s&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity within the sector.  It provides the industry with real tools with which it can effect fundamental change and reform.</p><p> A key element of the new legislation is the provision for the first time for a full IT traceability system for racing greyhounds.  The R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann Traceability System, RC&Eacute;TS, came into operation on 11 January 2021.  The system provides a mechanism to ensure that racing greyhounds are properly registered and traceable throughout their lives.  The sections of the Act commenced on 1 October 2020 signal a new era for greyhound racing.  They facilitate the board in focusing on its priority objective of achieving the highest standards of care and welfare of greyhounds.  Further commencement orders to commence the majority of the outstanding sections are currently being drafted.  The Greyhound Racing Act 2019, when fully implemented, will enable R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to ensure the important heritage associated with greyhound racing in Ireland can continue under the appropriate rules and regulations.</p><p> The greyhound industry is predominantly a rural industry with a strong urban support base.  The Covid-19 crisis has, similar to other sectors of the economy, resulted in a collapse of commercial activity in greyhound racing and a significant reduction of activity generally also.  Recovery of the industry will require ongoing support to aid restoration of normal levels of activity over the time ahead. </p><p> Given the wide geographic distribution of these two industries, they are fundamental to the achievement of more balanced regional economic growth.  Nurturing rural economies is a key priority for Government and in this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution that they make to rural economic activity and employment.  The welfare of horses and greyhounds is a cornerstone of both industries and I am assured that HRI and RC&Eacute; are striving to ensure the highest standards for the sport and its participants, on and away from the racecourse.  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has played a significant role in providing for this investment and has been instrumental in shaping the destiny of both industries.</p><p> Brexit poses an array of threats to the Irish economy and coupled with the fact that we are a small and open economy naturally prone to volatility, it can be somewhat difficult to fully predict what the future holds for both industries.  It is therefore crucial that we support both of these important industries and their continued navigation through the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit as we enter 2022.</p><p> Accordingly, I am seeking the committee's support to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann receive the funding provided for in budget 2022 and that the very important role played by these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend the regulation to the committee, and look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>

I will put him on the clock the next time.  I call Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and the officials.  As always when we are dealing with racing, I put on the record, although it is probably well known at this stage, that I am chairman of Kilbeggan race committee.  I also have one brood mare and its progeny.  I suppose I could be called a breeder, although small one.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister and pledge my support and that of my party for the increase in the cumulative upper limit.  The Minister stated the figures - I will not rehash them - of the jobs created, maintained and supported through this fund in rural Ireland.  One of the big mistakes people make when looking at this fund is to categorise horse and greyhound racing as sport, which it is.  The three to five minutes that a horse is racing is sport.  However, the journey from breeding, to rearing, to training and to transportation to get that horse to the start line on the race track creates and supports so many jobs in rural Ireland where there are few other employers.  It is necessary to speculate to accumulate.  The return, based on the figures the Minister gave, to the State from the money it invests makes it a worthwhile investment.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister mentioned the committee's report and acknowledged receipt of it.  I will hold him to his commitment to follow through on it.  The report cannot afford to end up on the proverbial shelf.  It may not be the silver bullet or may not have all the answers.  The starting point of the report was probably based on accusations and reports in the national media and we then undertook to do the report.  While not all the answers may be included in it, I said at one of the meetings that when accusations are made in the media, traditional or social, many people take them as fact.  By virtue of some of the statements made, reputational damage has been done to the industry.  As I said at one committee meeting, one is innocent until proven guilty, and I still believe that.  Once accusations are made, in the eyes of the public, you are guilty until you prove your innocence.</p><p>It is vitally important the Minister and his officials, through that report and whatever complementary things they need to bring in, help to undo the reputational damage done and keep the good name of Irish racing to the fore.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to animal welfare.  It is important HRI, the Department and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, remain committed to animal welfare at every juncture of the horse's and greyhound's life.  Again, there was serious reputational damage done to the horse racing sector through a "Panorama" programme.  We cannot have a repeat of that.  It is incumbent on the administering bodies and the Department to continue the funding for animal welfare and ensure it is a central and integral part of all activities.</p><p> The Minister will have seen correspondence from Midlands Horse and Pony Racing which needs a small amount of money.  It is vitally important it gets it from some source to keep the show on the road.  We all sing the plaudits of our top jockeys, whether at Cheltenham, Ascot or wherever, but the majority if not all of those jockeys start out in the incubation that is pony racing and the pony clubs.  They would not make it to the lofty heights they reach if not for pony racing.  They have a shortfall, and Senator Murphy will probably mention it.  If it is at all possible through the fund, the HRI or whoever, it should receive some funding.  It is looking for a very small amount of money to cover its insurance.  This is money it normally raises through fundraising but in the pandemic, this has not been possible.</p><p> People in the racing world have asked me about a matter, and unfortunately it is on the back of the well-documented raid in Monasterevin a couple of weeks ago.  When IHRB came before us, it explained how it was going to get on top of the perceived or reported drug issues.  Its staff had been granted the status of authorised officers which meant that they could enter premises, both licensed and unlicensed, with horses in or out of training.  However, the report about the haul a couple of weeks ago was definitive in saying that the Department carried out that raid and that IHRB was called to the site only when the Department and the garda&iacute; had sealed off the premises.  Many people have asked me about the reason behind that.  As said on the record during a committee meeting, IHRB staff are now recognised by the Department as authorised officers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Daly.  I recognise, as I did in my opening comments, the work of the committee in putting together the report which it submitted to me in the past week or two.  It was important work to which the committee gave significant time and attention.  It is an example of how this committee has been effective and can operate effectively by engaging with stakeholders and doing reports on particular issues.  Certainly the committee was responsive in addressing this issue.  In regard to the 11 recommendations made and the arguments put forward on how to proceed and respond, my officials and I are considering them in detail.</p> <p>  On the question of horse and pony racing, this matter comes under the remit of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, which is funded, as is the greyhound racing board, R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, through the horse and greyhound fund.  The HRI and the IHRB met with representatives of Midlands Horse and Pony Racing earlier in the year.  Following on from those meetings, the HRI agreed to provide funding to assist with the costs associated with running pony racing meetings in 2021.  The funding will go directly towards assistance with essential insurance cover.  It was provided on a one-off basis.  The HRI invests each year in supporting young jockeys through the EQUUIP programme.  A number of fully funded courses are available to young jockeys at the race training centre in Kildare.  As Minister, I provide the funding to HRI and it engages with its representative members and various aspects of the industry to spend that funding as prudently and as effectively as possible.  The horse and pony racing sector, in particular, is important.  It has been engaging and I look forward to that continuing.  I take on board the points made by Senator Daly.  It is something Senator Murphy has raised with me on a number of occasions outside of this committee.</p> <p>  In regard to the final point the Senator made on the work of the special investigations unit, and the particular investigation led by the Department on 9 November, given the fact that it is an active investigation, I am constrained from commenting on it in any detail as it is ongoing.  Suffice to say, it is normal practice whenever there is a special investigations unit investigation, it would engage with other appropriate authorities, including the IHRB and the garda&iacute; to support it in that.  Of course there is a role, as the Senator pointed out, for the IHRB.  It has the capacity now to carry out monitoring and testing in yards directly.  That is open to it at any stage, to do as part of its normal business.  This particular one was a special investigations unit led operation, which then engaged the IHRB and the garda&iacute;, as would be appropriate and standard practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and appreciate he has looked at the report.  It would be remiss of me not to refer to the report this committee published.  The committee made a number of recommendations in regard to the issues that came to the fore.  Those recommendations include the need for transparency in its governance as well as independence and gender balance on the board.  Has anything been done in that regard?  The report also recommended that, as the IHRB receives public funding to provide for its regulatory role, consideration be given to reclassify the IHRB as a semi-State body under the aegis of the Department.  Can the Minister update us on that?  Given that public moneys are directed through the HRI for the functioning of the IHRB, what are the Minister's views on this recommendation?  Is the Minister amenable to this?  When would be start to see some change there?</p> <p>  The public contribution to the sector of &euro;70.4 million for next year is considerable.  While those moneys are important for the progression of the sector, the correct spending of public funds is crucial for public confidence in this sector.  Can the Minister outline what changes the public can expect to happen in the sector in return for funding that is discussed each year?</p> <p>  On welfare in both sectors, coming from the same constituency as the Cathaoirleach, which is steeped in horse and greyhound racing, I can say welfare is taken very seriously in the industries.  They want to maintain the high standards that they already maintain.  Looking at the figures, there are 15,200 indirect jobs created by the horse industry and another 4,000 by the greyhound industry.  It is a big employer in our area.  That does not take away from the organisations we are discussing to which the moneys will go.</p> <p>  Will the Minister outline what specific engagements his Department has had with both sectors ahead of deciding on the level of funding to be issued next year?  Has his Department audited all the welfare commitments given by all the organisations and the level to which they have lived up to those commitments?</p><p> On the greyhound issue, I wish to raise two small points.  Recently, it was reported that further funding will be needed to continue the roll out of the traceability system.  How much more money are we talking about?  Can the Minister tell us the extent to which the system has been rolled out to date?  Has his Department maintained contact with the traceability system on the matter, and what has been learned?  Is the roll-out on schedule?</p></speech>

Obviously, the committee put much work and effort into it.  I am considering the recommendations and each of the points the committee made before responding.  I will take the required time to give that a full assessment before reverting to the committee and giving clarity on how I intend to proceed.</p> <p>  The Deputy made points on the make up of the board the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.  That was one of the points the committee made in the report on which I will be reflecting.</p> <p>  On the greyhound spend on welfare, the Department ring-fenced 10% of the fund allocation to R&aacute;isa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, in 2021 for welfare initiatives, and similar criteria are being implemented for 2022.  A major expansion of the overall care and welfare programme in RC&Eacute; is ongoing and has been progressing.  The projected spend by R&aacute;isa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann for this year on welfare matters, including integrity, is &euro;1.97 million.  There is ongoing bilateral engagement between RC&Eacute; and my Department on the achievement of these objectives.  As I said, funding is contingent on ensuring that progress is made and that there is very significant prioritisation of it.  It is something in which RC&Eacute; has significantly invested from the point of view of finance, resources and time to ensure there is very significant oversight and that progress is being made.</p> <p>  On the traceability aspect, the resets came into operation in January of this year.  Under that, owners and trainers were brought into the system on a phased basis.  Data from the system at the end of October indicated the total number of greyhounds subject to traceability was 20,784.  As the Deputy knows, the key objective behind it is to ensure that important life events in the life of a greyhound racing dog, including birth, microchipping, registration, the dog's racing career, changes in ownership or trainers, the location of the dog at any time, the retirement and end of life are accurately recorded as part of that.  It is an important step forward and it is something in which RC&Eacute; will be significantly investing resources continuing on from where it started this year.  That is the update with regard to it.</p></speech>

It is spending more than that as things stand.  Looking at it across the board, the projected spend of RC&Eacute; for this year on traceability, in particular, was &euro;336,000.  For care and welfare programmes, it was &euro;750,000; for veterinary care at tracks, it was more than &euro;300,000; for the national greyhound laboratory, it was &euro;400,000; and for welfare inspections, it was &euro;175,000.  The total is over and above the 10% RC&Eacute; required under the funding arrangement I, as Minister, and the Department have set as a requirement of funding.</p></speech>

The welfare issue has been known for months and promises were made months ago.  Has the Minister had any specific engagements with sectors to see what they have done ahead of getting any funding?  Has the Department been in contact with them?  If they have not improved welfare, I would stall the funding.  As Senator Daly said, the whole thing that blew up earlier in the year has affected both sectors.  If there is not going to be accountability or if there have not been improvements in welfare in that length of time, it is not fair that they are starting to get money.</p></speech>

There is ongoing engagement between our teams.  Dr. Kevin Smyth is the assistant secretary responsible for that, and Ms Caroline Ball also works on an ongoing basis on the oversight of that.  Will Dr. Smyth give us a flavour of how that engagement works over the course of the year?</p></speech>

Whether they are meetings with Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, or RC&Eacute;, welfare is always discussed.  Another thing is the shareholders letter of expectation sets out the requirements on welfare.  The Minister writes exactly what is required.  We set out the requirements in terms of the minimum 10% for greyhounds and all the commitments being met.  We have the metrics on the rehoming of greyhounds and so on.  We are seeing both the financial spend and the statistics in terms of what is being done in regard to animals.</p></speech>

Have there been improvements in both sectors since those television programmes aired?  Is funding contingent on improvements being made in those sectors so that confidence can be brought back into both greyhound racing and horse racing?  As I said, the Chair and I are from a big area where there is horse racing and greyhound racing.  The general public is looking at money being spent in these two sectors and it wants accountability; it wants to make sure things have improved.  I have no doubt the Department is still talking to them.  However, the general public wants to know that if its money is being spent, there is accountability and things have improved from six or seven months ago.</p></speech>

A number of things have been brought in and the key here is the traceability.  It is the ability to be able to recognise what happens through the lifecycle of a dog or horse to ensure they are looked after.  We now have metrics.  On the greyhounds, &euro;0.5 million has been put into the cost of the IT system and there are ongoing costs in terms of monitoring what is going on.  We are about to see the first year's results.  That means that the dogs are in the system and we are capable of following them.  That is a big change since the television programme on welfare was aired on RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#D01000"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the committee.  They are always welcome.  It is great to see the Minister here.  He is fiercely committed to the committee and to engaging with it.  That is something the committee really appreciates.</p> <p>  I will go through a few items in the order the Minister set out in the statement he submitted.  I will focus first on the HRI allocation of &euro;70.4 million rather than the 20% going to the dogs.  That is a very substantial amount of money.  The Minister and all of us on this committee know that horse racing and horse breeding are an integral part of agriculture, rural life, rural employment, rural communities and rural economy and are massively connected both directly and indirectly to rural employment.  Therefore, I am with the Minister all the way.  I see the significance and the importance of this industry.</p> <p>  I spoke last year on this and I pulled up some notes today on my contribution then.</p><p>I said we should not have any more reports about this industry or the dog industry but that we should dust down the Indecon report.  I had a look at that report again today.  We had the Indecon International Economic Consultants report and the Deloitte report, so we have reports falling off the shelves in regard to both sectors.  There is still a sizeable number of key recommendations that I am not fully convinced have been fully implemented.  We should look at that again.  It is a healthy exercise to go back and look at reports that are sitting on our shelves and those in the Department.  There are matters we should follow up on.  It is my intention to bring this up at a future meeting of the committee.  I am going to dust down some of the these reports and focus on some of those key recommendations because they are important.</p><p> The other thing I liked about the Minister's report was the heavy emphasis he placed on integrity and confidence within the sector.  That is a big issue and a recurring theme.  As yet only two members have spoken and both mentioned it.  The Minister mentioned it in his report.  I welcome that focus and emphasis on its importance in his statement.  However, that integrity, governance, accountability and animal welfare must be conditional.  There must be a measured conditionality in regard to this very substantial funding of &euro;70.4 million for the horse racing industry and &euro;17.6 million for the greyhound racing industry.  That it a great deal of money.  It is interesting to observe that a significant number of Members of this particular Oireachtas are very focused on animal welfare.  It is a recurring theme in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, and I welcome it.  There is a renewed interest in animal welfare.  We need to reassure the public.  There was the famous "Panorama" programme as well as other investigations into animal welfare, and this is of concern to the Irish people.  It is something they expect the establishment and the authorities to pursue.</p><p> The Minister referred earlier to our report into the racing industry, and I am delighted he is going to take a look at it.  I would like to think he will do more, such as run it by his chief veterinary officer and key personnel in his Department and add to it.  It is the beginning.  I acknowledge the Chair and his work in guiding us through that.  We spent a great deal of time on that.  One of the good things about this committee is that we work in partnership with one another and really focus.  We believe this is a particularly important industry that we want to see it protected, grow and do well.</p><p> I ask the Minister to come back with a timeline.  I respect that he has a busy schedule and many priorities but he talked  about considering it.  I ask him to consider it in the next quarter, if he can do so given all the demands on him.  Can he look at how much of this can we implement and proceed with?</p><p> In the same week we launched our report, there was much negative comment in the media and subsequently we had the Monasterevin case about which I do not propose to talk.  The Minister is right that it is an issue for Revenue, the investigating personnel and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but again it raised very serious concerns.  The paper does not always refuse ink.  We do not know how much of the story reported in public is true or false but the investigation will run its course.  When the investigation has run its course, it is important it is put into the public domain so that we know what happened and what sanctions were imposed.  Clearly it has raised more questions than answers and is of concern so it is something we need to look at. </p><p> In regard to the EU and Brexit, and we discussed this last year, we had the tripartite agreement between Ireland, the UK and France.  At that stage we were talking about the challenges around Brexit and the movement of bloodstock across those jurisdictions and, of course, mainland Europe.  Some concerns were flagged and we are not yet out of the woods in regard to that.  Could the Minister touch on that, and on where it is going?</p><p> I welcome the proposals and the comprehensive report but my asks of the Minister are simple.  Will he expedite his consideration of our report, seek advice from officials in his Department and others, as appropriate, and come back with strong recommendations on how we will implement the key recommendations of both the Minister's report and of this committee's report, if he finds them acceptable?  Will the Minister dust down the Indecon and Deloitte reports to see if there are outstanding issues that need to be followed up?  Will he place greater emphasis on the conditionality of animal welfare in regard to both sectors and that this be a condition of funding?  How will we measure that?  I note the Minister published an extensive animal welfare policy document.  We need a mechanism or metrics to measure that and reassure the public as well as this committee, the remit of which is animal welfare and agriculture.  We want to see both of these industries prosper within a tight regulatory framework that is fair, appropriate, open, transparent and professional.</p><p> In regard to the national stud, we may not have time now but I am interested in the State's financial commitments to it and the funding mechanisms around that.  It is a wonderful organisation.  That is not specifically on our agenda today but at some time the Minister might follow that up with the committee.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their time this evening.</p></speech>

He outlined the importance of the funding through the horse and greyhound fund to the horse racing sector.  I agree with him on the importance of that.  He also outlined the importance of ensuring that welfare is at the core of all racing.  That is absolutely the case, and it is crucial that it be the case.  The public expects it.  It has to be uniform and consistent across the board.  In the current environment, an exceptional case can be perceived to be closer to the norm.  It is not tolerable that any situation can exist where welfare standards are not upheld.  The Department as well as horse and dog owners take this very seriously.  It is what we all owe to the animals in our care who bring such enjoyment to their owners and to the public.</p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, there have been challenges over the year but we have worked closely with horse owners to navigate those and ensure that trade and travel have been able to continue.  This is essential for racing, which is an international industry as is breeding.  It has been more challenging between Ireland and the UK and also Ireland and mainland Europe where the land bridge is concerned.  It brought challenges in particular at the start of the year but we worked closely with the industry to manage the new requirements now in place.</p> <p>  In regard to the key recommendations of the Oireachtas committee report, that is something I am considering in strong detail and I will engage with the committee further on that.  I am also assessing the Indecon and Deloitte reports and ensuring the advice and learnings are followed through on.  We are open to further advice and guidance on those matters, where appropriate.</p></speech>

I strongly support the horse and greyhound fund and the finances that go towards it.  On the IGB and the greyhound industry, as the Minister is aware a number of years ago we had the Indecon report and the proposed closure of a number of greyhound tracks.  Some closed while other were able to negotiate and work their way out of it, including my local track in Enniscorthy, which is now doing very well.</p><p>Is the Minister aware of any proposals to close any more greyhound tracks in the future?  Is he aware as to whether IGB is going to carry out any more reports on proposed track closures?  What departmental oversight does his Department have on the closure of tracks?  Enniscorthy track, for example, was proposed for closure but after working with IGB and the then CEO, and huge credit to all involved, the track is running extremely well.  Can the Minister answer that question for me?</p></speech>

I know how important tracks are to each area.  They are fondly regarded and a key part of the character of the areas in which they are located.  Overall, it is a matter for R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to consider and manage.  The Department asked NewERA to produce a report on R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann's financial situation and the health and future of the industry.  There has been ongoing engagement between the Department and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann on the outcome of that and to help inform the future business development and potential of the racing industry.  In terms of management of, and investment in, tracks, that is a matter for R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann to assess, advise and take forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#F00300"><p>I ask the Minister to ensure his Department has more of an oversight on the proposals for any future track closures.  It is not in the best interests of the greyhound industry to have some tracks closed, sometimes for the wrong reasons.  I know there are private tracks and public tracks.  Millions of euro are being invested in some tracks where there are not big attendances, and tracks with small attendances being financially supplemented by IGB.  This is a mistake as some tracks are making money but do not get the same financial supports as others that are in financial ruin.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on the report that this committee carried out.  I compliment the Chair on his work and leadership on the report on the horse racing industry.  I plead with the Minister to look at the 11 key recommendations in that.  The committee was careful in compiling recommendations that were workable and achievable.  If the horse racing industry is compared with the IGB, we have all seen that the IGB has done much recovery work.  I do not want to see the horse racing industry going down the same route.  It is a proud industry in Ireland.  Some of the members spoke about the public commentary, whether it is true or untrue.  The committee did not find evidence of any wrongdoing.  As we delved into the workings of HRI and the IHRB, it became clear that transparency is required.  It is up to the Minister to look at the key recommendations and, along with his officials, to implement the recommendations.  I hope this report does not gather dust on a shelf like many other reports and that it receives the respect it deserves because of the work that went into it.  Can the Minister comment on some of the key recommendations, one of which is closed circuit television, CCTV?  If there are financial shortcomings in terms of putting CCTV in place - this should have been done years ago and I understand IHRB has given a commitment it will be finished soon - will the Minister look at that?  I am not going to ask him to give a commitment, because they are already receiving millions of euro already, but for the good of the industry, CCTV on and around tracks is urgently required.</p> <p>  I want to touch on insurance for some of the activities on greyhound tracks.  The tracks are finding it extremely difficult because attendances have been down right across all tracks in recent times.  The other issue coming down the tracks, pardon the pun, relates to horse racing, point-to-point, pony clubs, hunting and so on.  Insurance is crippling them and they are often unable to get insurance from insurance companies.  Has the Department done any work on this issue?  Has the Minister heard that this is an issue?  What actions, if any, will the Department take?</p></speech>

Before the Minister replies, I wish to reinforce Deputy Kehoe's point on insurance.  A number of point-to-point meetings have been cancelled in the past couple of weeks because of insurance.  The point-to-point sector is the cornerstone of our national hunt industry and the nursery for producing those champions we all like to see in venues such as Cheltenham, Aintree, Leopardstown or Punchestown.  There is a serious issue there.  One insurance company, Liberty Insurance, was providing insurance cover, but it has now pulled out of the market.  This is a huge issue.  Hunting is also facing problems.  It is not only an equestrian issue; all outdoor activities are affected.  We see headlines that ice-rinks cannot get insurance.  Water activities are likewise affected.  Water parks closed during the summer due to insurance problems.  I brought this up as a Topical Issues matter the week before last and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Fleming, answered my questions in the D&aacute;il but we need a resolution to this.  I support Deputy Kehoe in this regard.  Where can these activity sports go to ensure they can get insurance cover?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#F00500"><p>I thank Deputy Kehoe and the Chair.  The first point Deputy Kehoe made was on the importance of integrity and the highest standards in oversight in the racing industry.  We all agree that is critical.  Maintenance of the highest standards is essential to the future of the industry and the sector.  I know from the committee's report that it found that the testing regime and the systems in place domestically were strong and comparable with any international systems and other major racing countries.  Much of that oversight work is carried out by the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, which received &euro;10.3 million funding through HRI this year to carry out those regulatory functions.  In regard to the work it carries out, it has an extensive testing programme.  Some 5,000 samples were tested in 2021, including every race winner being tested and additional race day samples and out of competition samples being tested.  There is also testing at point-to-points.</p> <p>  As colleagues will know and as I mentioned previously, I granted authorisation to 12 authorised officers in the IHRB in May this year, which strengthened the work on anti-doping in Ireland.  That officer status allows those IHRB officers access to sample any thoroughbred at any time.  It also gives the veterinary team in IHRB increased powers, which include access to unlicensed premises and the testing of these operates in the same manner as it does for licensed premises.  Tests can take place without any prior notice.  Tests involve blood, urine and hair samples.  It is critical that we properly fund and invest to ensure that the highest standards are maintained.</p><p>It is also essential that everyone in the industry maintains the very highest standards.  We are very fortunate to have a strong industry in this country and one that has been built up over many years through great work on behalf of all stakeholders.  Maintaining good and top class standards and integrity is essential to maintaining the success it has had over the years into the future.  This is why we put so much effort and emphasis on it and why we will fund it so strongly.  It is also why those in the industry are aware of the uniform, consistent highest standards right across the board. </p><p> On CCTV, &euro;500,000 was provided by HRI, to the IHRB as part of its integrity services funding this year for the installation of CCTV in all racecourse stable yards.  The tender process for the project has been completed and the contract is to issue shortly, subject to board approval.  Most racecourses will have a CCTV system installed before their first meeting in 2022 and all 25 racecourses will be completed by the end of quarter 1 in 2022.  </p><p> Deputy Kehoe and the Cathaoirleach both mentioned insurance as a real issue and it has been a real difficulty for a number of point to point meetings this year.  The HRI is working with relevant stakeholders to assess potential solutions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming, has done significant work in his Department to address competitiveness in the insurance sector in general as well.  The HRI is engaging with stakeholders on the challenges in its industry and to examining potential solutions as well.</p></speech>

The most successful system probably ever brought in in this country was the animal identification and movement, AIM, system, by the Department of Agriculture.  There is low-hanging fruit in the report that we did, which could be moved on pretty rapidly, that would give confidence in the whole sector in terms of traceability.  I understand he will examine the entire report and I do not expect him to say that he will do X, Y or Z today, but I ask him to look favourably on that.</p> <p>  I concur with the previous two speakers who mentioned pony racing and point to points that there is major problem with insurance.  We are facing a situation where, because of companies leaving the market - and I acknowledge it is a private market - but we are leaving ourselves under ferocious pressure and I ask the Minister's officials to liaise with the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming, or the Department of Finance, to try to find a solution to that.  </p> <p>  I would like to mention the equine farming cap in the context of horse breeders and so on under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  Does the Minister envisage that he will be able to broaden some of the supports under TAMS?  I believe they were included in the scheme but were never kicked into gear, and that is the big problem.  </p> <p>  Every Deputy supports as much animal welfare as possible because it is -----</p></speech>

I acknowledge this is in one of the submissions that he has made as part of his report on traceability, and it is certainly something I will reflect on further.  HRI is working with Weatherbys Ireland and the IHRB to develop a comprehensive thoroughbred database to improve traceability via improved Weatherbys' e-passport functionality, and that work is ongoing.  I will certainly reflect on the submissions made by the committee and the suggestions that the Deputy has made.</p> <p>  I have dealt with the insurance issue and it is something I have engaged with the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on as well.  I have spoken to a number of people in the sector about it and they say HRI is engaging with stakeholders on the issue as well to explore potential solutions. </p> <p>  On TAMS, it is an issue that has been raised with me over a period of time and I have asked our TAMS section to reflect on it.  I will engage with them further to assess the merits of extending the scheme.  TAMS is not available currently for most facilities and types of investment in the equine sector.  However, as I said, it is something that has been raised with me and that I will assess further. </p></speech>

How is the allocation to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund arrived at?  We are all on the record in this committee in agreeing that both sectors are incredibly important.  The figure brought before us this year is a reduction on last year, but it in itself was a substantial increase on 2020 and the reason cited was the Covid emergency.  The figure is still a &euro;4 million increase on 2020.  How was that figure decided upon?</p></speech>

It is considered to be part of the Estimates process.  Basically, they put in bids and it is dealt with as part of the budgetary process.  They ask for the money - normally they would look for increases and things they would like to do - and then it is finalised with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is put into the Department's Vote as part of the budgetary process.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct that there was an increase for this year in the amount for the fund.  An additional &euro;12 million was put in to help protect both sectors against the effects of Covid because they were both very badly economically affected by the closures caused by the Covid pandemic.  Some of the additional &euro;4 million this year is actually residual Covid money that is being given to the two sectors for 2022 because the economic effects are still being felt.  In general, the way in which the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is determined is part of the budgetary process.  It is done as part of the Department's Vote and it is agreed with the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p></speech>

What they put in is two detailed budgetary submissions, one for each.  They detail what they require and that is usually sent to both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is followed up by meetings with both Ministers, where they outline their budget bids and then the actual amount of money for the horse and greyhound fund is determined as part of the Department's Vote in budget 2022.</p></speech>

There are lots of similarities between them and the last year to 18 months speaks to that in relation to the impact of Covid.  Both industries are very much subject to race attendances and have very similar models in that regard.  By and large, in terms of the engagement I have had with both organisations in the course of the two budgets I have done, the dynamic has been quite similar from both in relation to the challenges they have had to deal with.  I have not seen any reason to alter the ratio but the opportunity is there to do so at some stage in the future if a Minister sees fit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#H01200"><p>It seems strange to me that the system is such that if, for example, the horse racing sector managed to bring forward a really good proposal, another organisation would get the benefit of that on a <i>pro rata</i>basis as standard.  I would argue that we need to move away from the set percentages and actually allocate funding on the basis of merit.  That is not to say that either organisation's allocation would increase or decrease.</p><p>In his opening statement the Minister said that Government funding presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for investment, leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  We all agree on that but my question is whether we can be sure that is actually what is happening, that is, that Government funding is delivering the highest possible return.  Has the Minister had discussions with HRI on the level of Government funding that is allocated through prize money?  Has the Department looked at other avenues to ascertain whether there are better ways to ensure that money is distributed across the sector to the benefit of the widest number of players in the sector and the widest number of geographical areas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#H01300"><p>This is something that Deputy Carthy raised at the committee last year as well, when he made the same point.  Indeed, he has also brought it up in debates in the D&aacute;il.  A key driver behind the health and pre-eminence of the sector nationally is that we are able to compete in terms of horse racing.  The competitions that take place attract international horses and ensure that right throughout the racing ecosystem there are very strong and attractive races for all types of horses.  That is an important driver for the industry and that is the rationale behind providing competitive funding pots for different races.  The Government funds a competitive prize money structure and that helps the viability of the various businesses, including the extension of the prize money down to fifth place in races which are supported.  It is a key driver of investment in the sector.</p> <p>  According to the HRI fact book, for example, in 2020 there were over 300 fixtures around the country, with 7,500 individual runners and 25% of those horses would have won at least one race over the course of the year.  There were 5,000 individual runners which would have won prize money at some stage, equating to around 70% of individual runners.  Of the 2,500 individual races, over 2,000 would have had prize money of under &euro;25,000, with over 50 having prize money of greater than &euro;100,000.  Obviously, there are also further opportunities for Irish-trained horses to win prize money abroad as part of the equation.  A key part of our industry is having strong and attractive races at elite level and at other levels within the industry.  That is a key driver in terms of those who become horse owners and put those horses into training.  It is also a key driver of the significant employment in training yards across the country.  It is very much driven by horses racing and the prize money that comes from those races justifies individual business cases and personal decisions that owners make, either on their own or coming together with friends to get involved in the sport.  The prize money is a real driver of that and it permeates down throughout the industry.  It very much drives and populates the financial system within the industry.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#H01400"><p>I am not disputing the fact that prize money makes an impact.  What I am asking is whether this level of funding could make a greater impact or a more positive impact.  No matter what way we set out the figures and the numbers, the facts speak for themselves.  A huge proportion of the prize money goes to a very small number of players.  I was stunned in recent weeks, when this was raised by other Deputies, to learn that even though we have invested as a State almost &euro;1.5 billion in the horse racing sector since 2000, the horse and pony racing sector actually gets none of that even though that sector is such a core component of this industry.  The Minister has referred to discussions with HRI but as the person who is going to be signing the HRI cheque for approximately &euro;60 million, will he ensure that a proportion of that money goes to the horse and pony racing section which is so important to the overall industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#H01500"><p>It is really important that we support all sectors.  HRI is aware of that and has ongoing and continuous engagement with all stakeholders and all of those involved at all levels within horse racing.  It is important that all levels are supported because the next level depends very much on the health of the level underneath it and on the foundation levels, going right back to the small breeders, trainers and owners.  As I said previously, we have just over 50 races nationally that have a pot of over &euro;100,000 from a total of 2,500 individual races that are supported for prize money.  It is really important to have those significant races that are really competitive and sought after from the point of view of our national sector but that also attract international players.</p><p>If it were not the case that racing was significantly supported like that and if there were not internationally competitive pots, then the sector would suffer.</p><p> I know they are not a direct example, but I will refer to draws.  Deputy Durkan is not here but if he was he might compare pots with the national lottery.  The latter is very much driven by the opportunity to win and everybody contributes in a small way by buying a ticket for an extremely successful lottery draw that involves a very large pot.  That is because there is potential to win a big prize.  Maybe we will see, through Deputy Durkan's efforts, that one or two balls will be dropped from the national lottery and that there will be more winners as a result.  Having competitive racing pots available allows all of those in the industry to have hope that they can have winners.  In other words, that during their lifetimes they might have one or, if they are lucky, two horses that might win significant prizes.  The latter will encourage people to invest their money.  In most cases, people invest because this is a hobby and a sport.  People do not make money; they bring their money to it because they have a great passion for the sport and they hope that they will get lucky one day by having a really good horse or greyhound.  In both industries, competitive races and funding pots are important, which drives the health of the industry overall.  It is important that we keep an eye on this matter.  Deputy Carthy is right that all sectors throughout the system and the wider ecosystem are supported.  That is something of which HRI and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann are very aware.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#J00200"><p>If it is a lottery, then it is the taxpayer who pays for all of the tickets.  As a result, we need to ensure that taxpayers get the best value for money.  Every time I have raised this issue with the Minister, I have been struck by what has been said people in the industry who contacted me.  They have stated that there has to be a better way to ensure that all parts of the industry receive supports.</p> <p>  The Minister did not answer directly as to whether he would ensure that the horse and pony racing groups will be catered for.  I ask him to inform HRI that it must pony up or that he will find alternative ways of examining that matter into the future.</p> <p>  I want to touch on some of the committee's deliberations.  I will not go through the facets of the report.  I heard what the Minister has said.  It strikes me that the argument for distinguishing and separating the IHRB, which is the regulatory body away, from HRI, which is the governing body, makes eminent sense in order to ensure that we have maximum public confidence in animal welfare, anti-doping and other regulations for which the board has responsibility.  In the modern era, I do not think it is feasible to have a situation where a regulatory body is dependent on the governing body for its annual budget.  Will the Minister pursue the agenda to break them up in order to ensure maximum public confidence?  Will he ensure that there is maximum transparency in how these organisations, which, in essence, are publicly funded, operate, including ensuring that the salaries of senior executives are published and publicly available?</p></speech>

The Deloitte report was published in 2017.  It showed that the industry is worth &euro;1.84 billion to the economy and is responsible for 28,500 jobs.  The Government has a national funding commitment of &euro;70.4 million this year, which is a really important driver and generator for the industry.  However, the industry can be worth up to &euro;1.8 billion to the wider economy.  It is a small part of the overall industry, but it is an important part and driver.</p> <p>  I spoke earlier about the recommendations made by the committee.  I have received them.  The committee members have given great thought and consideration to the report.  I very much respect the work done by the committee and the hours they invested in their deliberations.  The members have played an important role.  I am considering all of the recommendations put forward and will revert to the committee with my views.  Likewise, in terms of transparency about salaries, where the State has a role and provides funding, I am assessing that in terms of the general practice and will review it in the context of what the standard practice is across the public service.</p></speech>

Will the IT traceability system come from the 10% of funding that has been ring-fenced for welfare expenditure or will an additional amount be needed?</p> <p>  I will focus on the data that is collected in respect of greyhound welfare.  Many committee members are passionate about greyhound racing and horse racing.  Although I am not one of them, I know that if we want this industry to survive then it is in the interests of the industry to have the absolute best welfare standards that are available.  I submitted questions to Greyhound Racing Ireland and it has confirmed that no vets are present at official and unofficial trials, even though they are present at races.  Would the Minister consider making it mandatory that vest attend trials?  I ask as such a provision would shorten the amount of time that it takes to seek treatment for an injured animal.  I also ask that data on injuries be collected.  I understand from the responses I received from Greyhound Racing Ireland that the injuries fund is for race-ending injuries and is only accessible at official trials.  I do not think we get the full picture on the number of injuries that are sustained.  The organisation has admitted to not collect the data at unofficial trials.  Will the traceability system come from the 10% of funding or is additional funding needed?  What is the Minister's view on the fact that vets are not present at trials?</p></speech>

When an injury occurs at an official trial, the name of a local vet is given for contact reasons and people can access the injury fund when there is a race ending injury.  At unofficial trials, which involve younger dogs, there is no vet present and people cannot access the injury fund if there is a race ending injury.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a system in place whether it is sports in which humans participate, such as local matches, county matches or whatever.

There is a similar system for races.</p></speech>

Horses and greyhounds are bred to run as well.  They do not like hanging around doing nothing.  The greyhound industry support scheme was introduced in 2020 to provide financial assistance to injured greyhounds to enable them to continue to have a healthy life after their injury.  The applications for the scheme were assessed on the basis the greyhound would be immediately retired from competitive action, whether competing in trials or racing, following treatment.  Initially, the scheme provided for up to &euro;500 per application.  However, it was further increased to &euro;1,000 per application in October last.  By 31 October, 18 applications had been received, of which 12 had been processed.  The scheme was extended at the start of quarter 3 to include injuries to greyhounds that were incurred during official qualification trials and plans are under way to expand the scheme further in 2020.</p></speech>

Significant progress has been made on this matter.  Plans are afoot to expand the scheme.  Under the care fund, a range of care and welfare initiatives were introduced, including incentivising the rehoming of greyhounds through additional supports provided by the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust.  Financial supports are also provided by rehoming agencies.  The total spend in that respect was &euro;23,000 last year.  In 2020, the greyhound injury support scheme provided financial assistance to eight injured greyhounds.  As I mentioned, the organisation has plans to continue to expand the scheme.  I do not know the full detail of how it plans to do that.  It has made significant progress on which it seeks to build.</p></speech>

All thoroughbreds are microchipped.  About 19% of horses are not microchipped but these are non-thoroughbreds.  That is an issue I raised at this committee a good few times.  I do not think the Department is working hard enough on ensuring compliance with the microchipping of horses.  Those that are not microchippped are non-thoroughbred horses.</p></speech>

It is the person who is named on the microchip.  There is the same issue with the microchipping of dogs.  If the microchip information is not updated, a dog can be found that is still registered to the breeder.  If a microchipped racehorse is found abandoned, can we ensure it is established who is responsible for it?  If it is the person named on the microchip, people might be very keen to ensure that information is updated.</p></speech>

I am proud of our horse and greyhound racing industries but that does not mean we cannot challenge them, particularly with respect to accountability and animal welfare.  I remember when I was young growing up in rural Ireland there was a horse dealer who said most horse dealers can say they have good horses but it takes a very good horse dealer to admit he has a bad horse.  There are many bad horses in horse racing and by "bad" I mean horses that do not cut the mustard or meet the grade.  For example, a broken down three or four-year-old gelding is pretty much worthless.  Accountability and traceability come into play in what happens to such horses.  The Department and its officials did tremendous work in this area, particularly after the horsemeat scandal.  I raised this issue with the Minister last November and with Department officials at this committee.  I am still concerned about the efficacy of registration and traceability in the equine sector.  It is light years behind bovine registration and traceability.</p> <p>  I raised the case of a sports horse breeder from County Longford last November.  It is a different genre but the similarities are probably relevant to the discussion.  The breeder flagged with Horse Sport Ireland last November that when he checked the ownership breeder records, 18 horses on the Sport Horse Ireland register were still registered to him.  Of the 18 horses, two were dead, two had been exported and subsequently died, three others had been exported, nine had been sold but the registrations had not been updated, one he had never owned and the final one had been sold, subsequently exported and the records had not been updated.</p> <p>  There is much work to be done but it would provide great reassurance to the public if we could significantly improve traceability in the sector.  I cite the example of that broken down three or four-year-old gelding.  In particular, if a horse is a thoroughbred, there would not be much meat on it and there is a concern about where these animals end up.  We are conscious of that.  There is a lot of movement of horses.  Anecdotally, we are told a large percentage of those that do not make the grade are culled by the big yards and big owners.  This is probably more a question for the officials.  In light of the information I shared on the case that was flagged with Horse Sport Ireland, are they satisfied with the current position or do they consider some work needs to be done on the registration and traceability of equine records?</p></speech>

The system for horses is not as good as the system for cattle.  We all know that and it must be addressed.  We are doing more work on equine identification, ID, and horse passports.  It is one of the areas we will be addressing in the response to the committee report with regard to equine ID.  It has been highlighted by the members also.  We will come back to the committee on the matter.  A good development I should make the committee aware of is an equine census which will take place this year.  It was announced recently.  We will get a more comprehensive overview with regard to it but we agree we need to sharpen the system on equine ID.</p></speech>

The Minister has addressed the insurance issue.  I urge him to use his influence to ensure insurance cover is sorted out for all recreational activities of an adventurous nature.  This point has been made by numerous Senators and Deputy in respect of pony racing and I would also include harness racing.  The funding sought by both those sports does not amount to a great deal of money.  They have an important role to play in the equine sector.  The horse and greyhound fund is needed for those two industries.  Will the Minister consider a fund for pony and harness racing?  The sectors are not seeking a large amount of Exchequer funding.</p><p> While we are talking about the equine sector, Horse Sport Ireland and the sport horse industry in general were disappointed that they did not get more of an allocation in the budget.  Theirs is a 26-county industry.  I ask the Minister to engage with Horse Sport Ireland to see what funding can be found for the industry for the forthcoming year.  Horse Sport Ireland has ambitious capital projects for which it is seeking help.  While it does not fall under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, I ask the Minister to consider the sport horse industry, which encompasses the 26 counties.</p><p> I will put on my constituency hat and discuss the capital plan for the country's second all-weather track.  A site in Tipperary is the one HRI has picked as being most suitable for the track.  Will the Minister use his influence to push that project onwards?  A significant amount of capital is being sought.  HRI is also talking about putting a training academy there as well as many infrastructural improvements for the industry as a whole.  It would be a great project and Tipperary is a central location with excellent rail infrastructure for young students going there to learn their trade.  I ask that the Minister take my points on board.</p><p> On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister and the departmental officials for assisting us in our consideration of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2021.</p></speech>

In addition to Mr. Nolan, I am joined by Dr. Kevin Smyth, assistant secretary.</p> <p>  It is important to highlight in the first instance that the regulations governing the nitrates action programme are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, with my Department administering the nitrates derogation that is provided for under the regulation.  My Department is fully engaged in developing and supporting a new revised and strengthened programme and derogation for 2022.  This is a key commitment in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  The agriculture sector is committed to stabilising and improving water quality.  The review of the nitrates action programme provides a timely opportunity to review the impact of agriculture on our water environment and support agriculture's ambitions to stabilise and improve water quality while seeking as many co-benefits for climate, air and biodiversity as possible.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to develop a cohesive policy response in delivering and implementing policy on water quality to coincide with the delivery of the next river basin management plan.  Both Departments are also working closely with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on reviewing water quality monitoring and water quality trends, and investigating and understanding the pressures from nutrient, pesticides and sediment losses from agriculture.</p> <p>  My Department has been at the forefront of assessing the regulatory baseline for agriculture and proactive in reviewing and balancing measures to minimise the impact of agriculture on the environment.  Ireland has been a leader in the EU in protecting the environment through a strong approach that includes nitrogen and phosphorus in our regulations unlike most other EU member states where nitrogen is the sole nutrient regulated.  However, we must recognise that recent trends in water quality have not been in the right direction and my Department is fully supportive of working with farmers to reverse this.</p> <p>  We initiated a voluntary review of the nitrates derogation in 2019, covering 7,000 farmers who availed of the facility.  That review introduced additional measures on such farms to improve on-farm efficiencies and reduce agriculture&rsquo;s impact on the environment, for example, the use of trailing shoe technology and preventing access to watercourses.  Additional measures have also been introduced for a further 5,000 farmers in 2021 who do not avail of the derogation but are farming at a similarly high level of intensity.</p> <p>  In order to develop future agricultural measures for the protection of the environment as part of the current nitrates action programme review process, Teagasc was asked to review and model the impact of future potential measures.  This work concluded that a number of additional measures would minimise nutrient losses to the environment further.  The nitrates derogation, which provides for 250 kg of nitrogen from livestock manure per hectare, was considered environmentally safe based on Ireland's grass-based system of production.</p> <p>  My Department and I have been aligning agricultural policies and strategies to ensure a coherent approach to meeting agriculture's commitments to the environmental challenges of climate, air, water and biodiversity.  Agriculture has a significant role to play in meeting environmental targets across all of these issues.  The strong support and work being delivered by farmers to address these environmental issues must be acknowledged.</p> <p>  A nitrates expert review group has been put in place to review the nitrates action programme and make recommendations on foot of the two periods of consultation earlier this year.  That review will shortly conclude.  I look forward to considering its recommendations, which I anticipate receiving shortly.</p> <p>  Ireland has applied for a nitrates derogation as provided for in the nitrates directive and that to date has been made available on the basis of strict scientific criteria.  In line with the current nitrates action programme, Ireland's current derogation expires on the last day of this year.  Ireland is currently negotiating the next nitrates action programme and working through a process to achieve a new programme and derogation.  In order to allow these negotiations come to a fruitful conclusion and secure a favourable opinion on Ireland's application, a vote on Ireland's derogation has been postponed until early March, by which time Ireland's new nitrates regulations should be in place.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention and time and will be happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

I was told that, regarding compliances and inspections, we did not have the data on the types of issue that were arising.  Is this not a potential problem, given the lack of data on the types of operator that are non-compliant with these regulations?  A lack of specific data can lead to misrepresentation of farms' compliance in general and limits the progress being made on tackling breaches of the regulations.  Clearly, a distinction must be made between the few operators that may be flouting the regulations deliberately and the majority of operators who are doing their level best to comply and to contribute to the protection of our environment.</p><p>I ask the Minister to outline the progress that is being made between the EPA and the local authorities through the new information system, NIS, network in improving the collection of this type of data. </p></speech>

We are trying to ensure that local authorities are fully cross-reporting any problems they identify on the ground.  There is a facility there that will make the job easier for local authority inspectors that is not being availed of at the moment.  We know there is a high level of non-compliance with the slurry storage requirement on dairy farms.  This is a particular issue that has been highlighted by the Department and by farmers themselves over the past year.  There is no individual non-compliance that we can point to that will be a silver bullet and improve water quality.  We need to improve in every area and that will contribute to improving water quality.</p> <p>  We have found that farms that have expanded greatly over the past number of years may not have invested enough in farmyard facilities.  There is an increasing spotlight on that.  That situation will improve over the coming period and that will contribute to improving water quality.</p></speech>

He mentioned that a strengthened nitrates action programme and nitrates derogation in 2022 are key commitments in the programme for Government.  I would like to put on the record that this is not true.  I have searched the programme for Government and it does not state that.  I mention that in the context of the challenge we have and my concern that with the nitrates derogation we are not going to achieve our targets on water quality and that we are going to fail with regard to our objectives under the EU water framework directive to have our water bodies in good status by 2027.  As things stand, that simply is not achievable.  That is what we were told by the experts from the EPA when they appeared before the committee in recent months.</p> <p>  I note from the Minister's statement that he is aware of the importance of the derogation for many farmers and that he is entirely committed to protecting it while at the same time improving water quality.  I am not sure those two objectives are consistent with each other.  The EPA has noted that a one-size-fits-all approach will not be adequate to achieve the outcomes that we need and, therefore, measures must be targeted to achieve water quality objectives.  They need to be targeted and specific to the soil activities and risks on the farms.  The nitrates derogation is a blunt instrument.  We know that there is a correlation between the derogation farms and the collapse in water quality in the catchments around those farms.  We need to look very seriously at this issue.  I acknowledge that the Minister is serious about his role and the objective of improving water quality in those catchments, but this situation whereby we continue to go to Europe to apply for the derogation and we concurrently have to bring in ever-more severe and challenging nitrates action programmes that apply to all farmers is not going to lead to an improvement in our water quality.  Farmers throughout the country who are not derogation farmers are effectively being penalised because of that.</p> <p>  I would like to hear more from the Minister.  Does he believe that we should get more targeted in our approach to dealing with water quality issues, in particular in the south and east of the country, which are particularly badly affected?  There has been a significant increase in nitrates and phosphate levels in our watercourses.  If we are not listening to the EPA, we can bring in a fifth nitrates action plan or a sixth nitrates action plan but we simply will not get to where we need to go.  The fourth nitrates action plan was an abject failure.  How can we have confidence that the fifth plan, with its more stringent criteria, will achieve the improvements in water quality that we need to see in our watercourses throughout the country, but particularly in the south and east of the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#M00800"><p>I believe it is possible and compatible to have the nitrates derogation and improvements in water quality.  The objective behind putting in place stringent criteria and conditions in the awarding of the derogation to any one farmer is to ensure farmers apply the additional nitrogen and achieve a higher stocking rate in a way that effectively manages that nutrient and that resource so that it grows grass but does not impact on water quality.  We cannot have a situation whereby water quality in the country is deteriorating.  It has been going in the wrong direction in recent times and we must address that.  It can be done and we are working to achieve it as part of the nitrates derogation.  The Deputy is correct that it is not straightforward in that it is very much particular to different soil types.  It is about trying to ensure that we are applying the right measures and the right conditions in the right places.</p> <p>   Many of our nitrates farmers adopt exceptionally good practices in the controls they have in place to manage and protect water quality.  It is crucial that this should happen across the board.  The Deputy is correct that a small number of farmers not carrying out the right practices can have a detrimental impact, one which impacts on everyone else.  We have to take a very hard line and ensure that people take responsibility for the activities they are carrying out.  Chemical fertiliser and organic fertiliser can be very powerful if used appropriately.  This is something that we have valued tremendously throughout history and throughout agricultural production be that in regard to seaweed or the very careful and efficient use of manures long before chemical fertiliser was available.  We know the benefits of chemical fertiliser, where used appropriately.  Likewise, something that can be a nutrient, a driver or a tonic, if used wrongly, can be detrimental.  It is really important that fertiliser, whether organic or chemical, is used appropriately by everyone.  As a farming nation and as an agricultural sector we take a very hard line in regard to anyone who is not doing that.   </p> <p>  In putting this nitrates derogation in place, it is important that we have appropriate safeguards that are followed by everyone in terms of how it is applied.  I will ask Mr. Nolan to comment further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#M00900"><p>The Deputy is correct that it is a challenge and that a one size does not fit all.  That has been recognised.  We have more restrictions on intensive farms than we do on other farms.  I do not agree that ever-more severe restrictions are being introduced on every farm in the country.  The Minister mentioned that we had a voluntary derogation review in 2019.  That was done at the behest of the Government.  It was not initiated on behalf of anybody else.  That review resulted in the introduction of measures such as compulsory use of low emission equipment on derogation farms, which reduced the level of crude protein that can be fed to dairy cows on intensive farms, compulsory use of grassland measurement and compulsory training for derogation farmers.</p><p>We are differentiating all the time.  Earlier this year, we asked Teagasc to model some of the proposed measures that will be introduced, possibly next year, and they show that we can meet the targets that the EPA has set.  We work very closely with the EPA.  Those who were here from the EPA the same night we attended are part of a working group with us on the nitrates expert group.  As recently as last week, we were on a farm in Kildare with the EPA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Teagasc looking at how measures will be implemented on farms.  Therefore, there is a coherent and collaborative approach to water quality in Ireland.</p><p> I disagree that we will not achieve our targets; I think we will.  We need more - the Minister has stressed it.  It has been publicly said by farmers for the first time.  We need stricter enforcement, particularly by local authorities.  We need industry to become involved and help farmers in moving along, and changing, the dial.  In New Zealand, they have done studies on where water quality would be if they had not the changes that we have introduced already.  We have moved.  The Minister is right in saying - he said it in the opening statement - farmers have invested significantly.  They will be asked to invest more but it is unfair to brand all farmers or say agriculture is completely responsible.  There are a small minority who are causing a lot of harm and over the next number of years they will be targeted more and more.  We are using the water quality data from the EPA to target inspections and water quality will improve.  We firmly believe, along with the EPA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Teagasc, that the new CAP and the new regulations, along with support from industry, will contribute to improving water quality in Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the comments from both.</p> <p>  To put it on the record, I certainly was not blaming all farmers.  Mr. Nolan was right to say that not all farmers are to blame but it is certainly not my position that they are.</p> <p>  If we get that derogation from Europe but we also accept that there needs to be a targeted approach, will the Minister consider that derogations would not be granted for lands that drain into water courses that are considered at risk by the EPA?  Maybe this is something that has already been discussed in that working group.  I do not want to necessarily put the Minister on the spot or get an answer from him here and now, but I favour the targeted catchment approach to fixing the quality of water and using the derogation or, as the case may be, not giving a derogation to farms that are draining into those rivers, where a correlation can be shown where the derogation is leading to the degradation of water quality.  I would appreciate if the Minister could consider that level of approach to the problem because it is a very serious problem that we have.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Nolan to come in in a second again.  I reiterate what I said.  In terms of all farming types and all farming practices right across the sector, we have to be determined to ensure that water quality is central to what we do, to ensure that it improves over the time ahead and to ensure that from an agricultural point of view our practice does not detrimentally impact it.  Therefore, the controls and the advice we have in place is important, and particularly the advice we have in place around the derogation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jack Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021112400002#N00400"><p>Deputy Leddin is right, and the Minister is right, that there must be a targeted approach.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine supports the agricultural sustainability support and advisory, ASSA, programme.  That delivers targeted advice on farm.  It is easy for me to sit here and say to farmers in Cork, Donegal or Wexford what they should do but until one is actually on the farm walking the land, it is impossible to say the measure that is most appropriate.  In the next CAP, there is a commitment that we are looking at this kind of approach.  For example, there will be learnings taken in from the European innovation partnerships, EIPs, where farmers are part of the solution and they are not being talked at - they are being talked with and allowed to come up with the solutions to the problems.</p> <p>  There is a recognition among farmers that things have to change, and change more rapidly.  We are not disagreeing about anything here about the change that is need.  It is just the pace, and the pace can only be accelerated with more support, I believe, from the consumer and from industry, to help farmers with the investments that are needed and also around education.  We have to give farmers credit for the amount of knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange that they underwent in the previous CAP and through the previous derogation programme, and keep providing that.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that the ASSA programme will be continued.  That is supported by all farmers and by industry.  It is a collaborative approach between the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We will achieve a lot of success through such an approach - going onto farms and giving direct advice about what needs to be done.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Nolan and thank him for being here.</p> <p>  On the previous occasion the Minister was in here, I raised two points.  I will not quote the Minister on anyone else's points which were raised on the day.  No doubt the members will bring it up.</p> <p>  On slurry spreading and wastewater storage, nitrates action plans aside, like never before farmers will want to get the maximum value from their slurry in the coming year with the projected prices and, indeed, availability of chemical fertilisers.  To maximise that and to meet the targets and the calendar windows of spreading, many will probably need to extend their storage capacity.  With current building prices and building material prices escalating, would it be possible, in conjunction with this plan, to have another look at the targeted agriculture modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the ceilings and the percentages of costs that can be covered?  For example, let it be 60:40.  The 40% of an exorbitant price is a much bigger spend on the farmer's part than it would have been in the past.  The farmers will more than meet the Minister halfway on this one now because they all will be glad to be able to provide facilities to store their slurry until the growth comes in, depending on what part of the country one is in, whatever month that is.  The Chairman could probably be putting it out in February but up my end of the woods, one would be nearer to May before one would be getting any value for it.</p> <p>  The other issue I raised on the last occasion, to reiterate it, is the 30 km rule.  I can see why that would be considered when we are talking about derogation farmers renting land to keep their stocking rate down or whatever.  However, if that rule were to be followed through on, for instance, where I am from, around Westmeath and Meath, in particular, we have a lot of people from Deputy Fitzmaurice's area in the west of Ireland who would come up and rent bits of land to do a bit of finishing.  They would still have very low stocking rates - they would not be anything near derogation - but if that 30 km is across the board, it would seriously affect them going forward.  Those were the two points I raised on the previous occasion that I want to repeat.</p></speech>

Slurry, at the minute, is worth &euro;50 per 1,000 gallons.  It is very valuable.  Fertiliser prices have nearly trebled.  They are up 250%.  The Department fully supports the idea of getting slurry out at the right time of year - whether that is in May or February - depending on soil type, etc.  There will be a huge change in that.  We are fully supportive of it through the advice that is given by farm advisory system, FAS, advisers, whether they are private advisers or through Teagasc.</p> <p>  To reiterate, as we said on the previous occasion, the 30 km rule was a proposal but, based on the feedback we have received, that will not be introduced.  The 30 km rule will not be introduced.  There will be a limit on the stocking rate on commonage because it is artificially being used by intensive farmers to dilute their stocking rate but the 30 km rule is not being introduced.</p></speech>

In relation to the low emissions slurry spreading which is planned to come in more over the next few years, it is contractors that put out 90% to 95% of slurry.  To be quite frank about it, and farmers themselves would tell the Minister this, some of them have got the tankers and the gear for putting behind it.  With them being busy or with, maybe, a tractor not big enough for agitating or whatever, they struggle at times.  Is there any work with the Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI, to see could it come up with something to help them on the TAMS side of it?</p></speech>

I think it has to be farmers but I will check that.  There has been a massive and welcome uptake in the past three or four years of low emission slurry spreading under TAMS.  About &euro;100 million has been spent on it through the Department through the TAMS grant.  There are about 3,000 low emission slurry spreading machines in the country now.  There is great capacity there and it makes great sense.  It is a win-win in terms of the efficiency of the slurry being spread.  It costs farmers less.  When they use this approach they get far more benefit out of the fertiliser and it significantly reduces emissions.  It means about 15% of all slurry is spread using less equipment and that has resulted in a reduction in ammonia emissions of 7%.  It is something that we need to drive on because it can really make a big difference.</p></speech>

Senator Paul Daly mentioned this.  There is a problem and there is no point in my hiding behind it.  There can be people 100 miles away taking land to cover them for nitrates.  We have to talk openly about it.  How will that be resolved?  There will not be people spreading slurry on the side of a mountain, to be blunt, and not all mountains are commonage.</p></speech>

We are talking to our own colleagues in cross-compliance too.  If you have land on your basic payments that is, say, 100 miles away, you will be at a higher risk for inspection because of nitrates.  Not to blame the dairy farmers, but if you are a dairy farmer in Cork and you have land taken up in Mayo or somewhere, that is very unusual and that will put up a red flag in the future and those farmers will be more likely to receive an inspection.  That is how that will be dealt with.</p></speech>

Before, there used to be rules around distance and so on but now it around your farming type and whether you can prove that you are farming it.  For example, if someone has mountain land and they only have dairy animals, it is obvious that is not what they are actually doing.  That is how it will be targeted.</p></speech>

It is national law.  Every farmer in the country has to comply with it.  The local authorities do carry out inspections.  We are talking to them about making them more meaningful and that they do it better because that is part of the whole nitrates action programme.  You would be outside the loop for Department inspections for nitrates because the Department does it for cross-compliance if you receive basic payment, but the local authority should still be there inspecting you.</p></speech>

It is up to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the local authorities.  I am not passing the buck but it is national legislation.  We fulfil all our requirements as regards the number and type of inspections we need to do.  This is national legislation.  We are talking to the EPA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the local authorities on how to better implement it.</p></speech>

The level of public acceptance has changed.  People no longer accept pollution and so on.  I think that local authorities will step up their enforcement and then it is open to them to act.  There are fines of up to &euro;500,000 if local authorities bring someone to court.</p></speech>

Will there be a facility to grant-aid those farmers?  There was a proposal that every shed would have to be covered or something.  Would it not be better to give a grant for the ground to put in the tanks everywhere?  Some farmers might be over their stock or area where they have enough storage.  How does the Department plan to tackle that?</p></speech>

However, after submissions everyone including the expert group agreed that should not be done now.  There will be a review of that.  That is not going to happen.</p> <p>  On grant-aiding slurry storage, the Department under EU regulation - and it is EU taxpayers' money as well as the Irish Exchequer - can only grant-aid farmers that are already compliant.  You cannot give grant aid to someone who is non-compliant.  This is where industry could step in with low-cost finance or to use things like the MilkFlex loan.   As I said here last day, if I have a more energy efficient house, I will get a lower mortgage than someone who has not.  Therefore why can the banks here not offer something similar?  The Department cannot give grant aid to someone who is not compliant.    </p></speech>

The 250 kg/ha on certain land is perfect, but on other land maybe it should be 50 kg/ha.  Unless you get into the individual soil type, it is very hard to have a figure.  Who says 170 kg/ha is right?  It was a figure arrived at back in 1991.  Teagasc research shows that if farmers comply with all the measures in the derogation, spread the slurry at the right time and similarly the chemical fertiliser and use the economic breeding index, EBI, and low crude protein, the derogation is sustainable and it should be something that Ireland avails of.</p></speech>

I will wait until then out of respect to the role carried out by the consultative committee, which is very important in terms of informing, assessing and feeding back the ideas of stakeholders on what is on the table and the overall shape of the CAP strategic plan.   The key objective is to ensure that there are options available for all farmers to participate.</p> <p>  On the three trees per hectare, we have done some assessments and investigations.

That was followed up this year by another &euro;15 million.  There will be several hundred thousand detailed soil samples available, which will also tell farmers what the level of carbon in their soil is.  A baseline has been established.</p> <p>  In the most recent budget, the Minister also announced a &euro;1 million scheme to encourage farmers to grow multispecies grass, which has plants that root at different depths.  In other countries it is claimed that these will sequester more carbon.  These kinds of opportunities are being looked at and supported outside of CAP.</p></speech>

This is for the simple reason that multispecies grasses are nearly twice the price.  The cost is approximately &euro;95 per acre as against &euro;60 per acre.  While &euro;1 million is welcome, if we are trying to bring farmers throughout the country on board, is there any way of upping it a bit?</p> <p>   I will say to the Minister, and this might be case of "Take a fool's advice", that if grass seeds are sown that a farmer will not be able to spray, generally, the back end of the year is always the best time for less weeds and stuff.  Are officials looking at sowing early this spring or during the back end of the year?</p></speech>

It is something we want to encourage in the context of the next CAP because there is real potential in it from a financial point of view.  I will ask Mr. Nolan to comment more on how it can be accounted for in schemes and how additional costs involved in one particular type of sward over another can be paid for.  From an economic point of view, there are financial merits for a farmer sowing either clover or multispecies sward because it reduces cost and increases profit.  It makes a lot of sense from that perspective.  We are also trying to support it through CAP measures.  Mr. Nolan will elaborate on the costings.</p></speech>

It is about &euro;96 an acre for six-species grass seed, which is meant to be the best.  It includes two clovers, two herbs and two grasses.  We hope to roll it out, with the Minister's approval, as early as possible to give farmers a chance to plan ahead for it.  It is planned that the scheme will subsidise farmers at a rate of &euro;50 per acre to meet the difference between the cost of the grass seed and multispecies seed and that it will cover 20,000 acres.  If we could get farmers to take this up that would be substantial, because there are only approximately 200,0000 or 300,000 acres every year.  The cost of fertiliser was mentioned.  According to research, clover will save three bags of calcium ammonium nitrate an acre, which costs &euro;180 at current prices.  There are significant savings if we go down this road.</p></speech>

I am hearing a negative view from people in the sector who, in the past day or two, met officials in the Department who are drawing up the schemes.  If a farmer went on the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, was on it for two years and then applied for a forestry licence, which could take a year or two, that farmer could not get the licence and was basically in a straitjacket.  If some farmer wants to sow three, four or five acres of trees under the new rural environment protection scheme, REP, or whatever the new environmental scheme is called - which will help with nitrates and sequestration - and part of the land is stuck in the section that was in REP, will the Department look at that to ensure that farmer is not paying back over five years or is not screwed like that?  Is the Department willing to look at that and to give a commitment that the scheme will be workable?  Everyone is talking about trees but nobody seems able to give the go-ahead to sow them.</p></speech>

We have to work within the confines of the overall EU regulations, etc., but I have asked the team to look in great detail at what we can do to ensure that it all marries up with the core objective, which is that we facilitate trees and forestry and, in every way we can, provide for, allow for and encourage them.</p></speech>

I just cannot fathom it, if the EU is talking about trees, which is one of its big agendas at present, and a farmer who wants to sow a few acres of trees cannot do so.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</p></speech>

One point of clarity that has raised concern is that the Minister mentioned that the vote on Ireland's derogation has been postponed until March when it expires on 31 December.

It will not be extended.  We do not have the authority to do so.  For the first three months of next year, or until there is a vote, we will not have a derogation but no farmer will have exceeded the limit by that time.  This situation also came up in 2014.  We worked through it and got the vote at the next meeting.  We anticipate that the same thing will happen this time so it should not be a concern for farmers.</p></speech>

We have very good water quality by comparison with other member states.  We fully accept that we have more to do.   The Minister said in his opening statement that we fully accept there is a declining trend that we need to reverse.  We are making good progress in our negotiations and our action programme.  I will go back to what Deputy Browne said, which is that a key element will be enforcement and implementation of what we have already.  We anticipate that we will have a positive vote in March.</p></speech>

I will reiterate what others have said.  The one area that we cannot blame on anyone else, and I have mentioned this at previous meetings, is our water quality.  We are an island and, once we operate and co-ordinate on an all-Ireland basis, which we should do, then we have no one else to blame for failings.  The truth is that there have been failings.  It is not good enough that the quality of many of our watercourses has declined over a number of years.  That is not all the fault of farmers.  It is scandalous that some 30 towns and villages are pumping raw sewage into our waterways, but it is an area about which the Irish public will be particularly unforgiving, if we do not get this right.  I will make the point that all of this is crucially important.</p> <p>  There has been quite a bit of emphasis on low emission slurry spreading.  I discussed this with Mr. Nolan the last time.  Has the Minister seen the potential issue that might arise if the use of low emission slurry spreading, LESS, equipment is mandatory?  It means it cannot, therefore, be funded under TAMS or any other scheme for that matter, as I understand it.  It is hard to see how removing grant aid will expedite uptake among people who have not taken the scheme up at this point.  Has the Minister given any consideration to how we can overcome that particular anomaly?</p></speech>

That is why it is important that we give lead-in times and notice of what is coming down the tracks and an adjustment period.  That was done in the context of the low-emission slurry spreading, LESS, grants for slurry spreaders.  Notice was given of what was coming down the tracks in order to allow those who would need to do it in future to become compliant and have the opportunity to avail of that grant aid to be able to get the equipment.  Likewise, I foresee that the approach to be taken will give due notice to allow people to avail of grants and support to get the equipment to enable them to do it.  However, as is the case now, those who are not in compliance cannot be grant-aided.  That will continue to be the case.</p></speech>

If people are not in compliance by the end of this period, incentives will be needed to get them there.</p><p>To return to the point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice in respect of farm contractors, I find it bizarre that there is no problem grant-aiding people in Dublin, who probably have a bus stop outside their door, to move from a diesel vehicle to an electric one, but the Department cannot grant-aid farm contractors to move to a particular type of technology that would be of substantially more benefit to the environment.  In the context of interactions with the EU, we need to ensure we have imaginative proposals that actually allow money to be targeted at areas that are proven in terms of delivering.</p><p>Reference was made to mixed swards.  Mr. Nolan spoke about their value in terms of sequestration.  That is almost becoming accepted.  I ask him to provide an outline of the impact those types of swards have in terms of nitrates and whether there are measures that could be used that would encourage derogation farmers to make that shift.  Is there evidence they have been making that shift already?  If so, how can we accelerate that?</p></speech>

The Minister is 100% right in his statement that there will be a glide path, but we need to change and accept that.  It is the same as what the Deputy said about water quality.  It is just not acceptable anymore.  Many farmers are probably contractors, or <i>vice versa</i>, and may be availing of grant aid that way.  It might be awkward for them, but they are able to get grant aid.  The Deputy is correct that it would help a lot if contractors got grant aid for low-emission equipment.<br/><br/>On the issue of mixed swards, I refer to what Teagasc has shown  There was a smart sward project in UCD, run by Helen Sheridan and Tommy Boland and funded by the Department.  It showed that nitrogen can be reduced by 100 kg per hectare and there are health benefits from that.  Teagasc research has shown for the past 20 years the effects of using clover.  It is the clover in the mixed swards that really helps to reduce nitrogen.  When we did a derogation review in 2019, we made it compulsory for derogation farmers to include clover when reseeding.  That will help them to reduce nitrogen.  We have already made it compulsory.  Teagasc appeared before the committee last week or the week before that to discuss carbon sequestration and climate change.  It has towers on these different types of swards, such as Italian rye grass mixed species swards.  There is one at Johnstown Castle in County Wexford.  In the next three years, it will show what the actual reductions are from mixed-species swards and what the benefits are with regard to sequestration, but we know that currently nitrogen can be reduced by up to 100 kg per hectare by using clover which is part of a mixed sward.</p></speech>

We had a bit of a debate on the previous occasion Mr .Nolan appeared before the committee in respect of the section of the consultation document that referred to the need for all farmers, including non-derogation farmers, to fence off water courses.  I refer to the particular anomaly in respect of those undesignated lands and the provision in that regard.  At that stage, Mr. Nolan told me it would be dealt with.  I ask him to provide us with an update on the solution on that issue.</p></speech>

I think we are 20th in terms of the development of that sector.  How important will the development of anaerobic digestion be in terms of addressing the issues of storage and energy generation?  Is there a route by which farmers can collaborate and use anaerobic digestion to secure a new income stream?</p></speech>

It is something we need to progress.  I have secured funding for it under the national development plan in terms of capital investment to support pilot initiatives in this area.  It is a far more expensive way of producing energy than other renewable alternatives, but it has the benefit of feeding into the circular economy and making use of nutrients and taking energy from it as well as retaining the fertiliser capacity of the nutrients for that purpose.  I am very focussed on it.  The Department and officials are working with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of moving this forward.  There is real potential.  It is undoubtedly expensive as a straightforward energy production method.</p></speech>

I got caught up with other meetings.  My apologies.  My questions will be brief as time has moved on.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Nolan or the Minister to comment on the Teagasc agricultural catchments programme in respect of nitrates.  The programme involves six different locations, one of which is in Timoleague.  It has been running for the past decade.  Where does that fit into the data that are being collected in respect of the science on the nitrates issue itself?  I received a very interesting presentation today on the issue.  I refer to the six catchment areas, the different soil types and the issues in the context of nitrates and how they are being affected.  From an agricultural point of view, it was really good information to get out there on how a soil type could be the more defining factor when it comes to nitrates.</p> <p>  It also brought into focus the issues in respect of a very dry summer.  If there is a very dry summer, as was the case in 2018 - maybe Mr. Nolan will comment on that - the nitrate levels in all rivers automatically go up because of the environmental factors relating to a dry summer.  There is a significant amount of information there of which I think the farming community is not aware.  It is a body of work that the committee may take on board at some stage.  We need to start considering the organic nitrogen - not the bad nitrogen - that is being produced, how that can be affected by weather conditions and how it can affect river quality.  Even if farmers were to grow vast quantities of clover tomorrow morning, that does not mean the organic nitrogen will not leach out of their soil, depending on the soil type, and go into rivers.</p> <p>  There is a significant amount of information we could consider in respect of the Teagasc-run institution for the past decade.  Does the Minister have plans to invest more in this programme?  It is being run on only six sites at the moment.  What is the view of Mr. Nolan on the programme?  Where does he believe this information ties in?  I believe Teagasc has slightly different figures, in terms of quantification of nitrates, from the EPA.</p><p>Am I right in saying it measures water quality every ten minutes regarding machines and the EPA, which measures four or five times a year?  The Minister and Mr. Nolan might comment on where this will feed into the process?</p></speech>

I recently visited Castledockrell catchment area.  Eddie Burgess is the official running that.  I certainly learned a lot from that visit.  There is so much all of us can learn from the experience and research.  Overall, the message is that it really speaks to the fact that it is very different for different soil types.  It is not straightforward; rather it is quite a complex area in terms of how nutrients react and how different soil types can absorb and respond to different levels of nutrients.  As Mr. Nolan said, a nitrates farmer on 250 kg of chemical nitrogen can operate in a way that is very manageable and sustainable yet on a different type of soil, a much lower level of input can have much more potential for impacting water.  It is really complex and there is a lot we can learn.  I am committed to see how we can develop, expand and learn.  The key point is to take the learnings we have from those catchment programmes and expand them to farm level across the country.  I will hand over to Mr. Nolan for further comment.</p></speech>

It was being funded at &euro;1.5 million per year, which the Minister increased to &euro;2.5 million per year two years ago.  It now includes climate as well as water, which is key, so members can see the co-benefits.  All the information Teagasc provides from the catchments feeds into the nitrates review.  Commission officials from Brussels have visited the catchments on three separate occasions to look at the soils and hear about the research.  The Senator spoke about the dry soils and dry weather in 2018.  Research from catchments shows that climate will overwhelm all the measures we put in place.  That is not an excuse for us not to put measures in place.  We just have to accept that this is something that is there.  It also shows that if farmers do what they are meant to be doing, we can improve water quality.  We have not got there yet.  The farmers in the catchments are getting individual advice and free soil samples.  That is where the agricultural sustainability support and advisory programme came from.  It came from seeing how successful this catchments programme can be.</p> <p>  As regards expansion, the programme is the envy of our colleagues across Europe.  They get water samples every ten minutes but the country as a whole could not afford that.  The Senator said the EPA does four or five samples per year.  This meets European standards and that will continue but the EPA visits the catchments as well.  The catchment visited by the Minister was recently visited by the EPA.  There is considerable sharing of data.  People may not recognise that the Department, the EPA, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Teagasc are working together, sharing these data and looking for solutions.  These data play a very important role.</p></speech>

What are the witnesses' views on the bands and the promotion of the cross-bred cow?  Is there any flexibility to increase the bands, particularly the middle band?  Could the middle band be increased upwards?  If a farmer is getting near that threshold, there is significant temptation to move to a cross-bred cow to bring down yield?  This would be counterproductive to what we want to achieve as regards sustainability.  Could there be some flexibility regarding the bands?  The genetic merit of cows has improved dramatically, particularly during a year like this when there has been tremendous grass growth, and cows have milked exceptionally well.  I would hate to see the introduction of these bands having a detrimental effect on the improvements in breeding we have seen.  Could the Department look at that again and see if anything can be done with the bands so that people on the limit of a band will not think of doing things that would be detrimental to sustainability.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister and officials from the Department for engaging with us on this important issue.  I propose that we hold our next private meeting at 3.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 November.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and they will notice that every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing.  I urge people not to move any chair from its current position.  They should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for members' full co-operation in this.  Any member participating remotely in the meeting can only participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Paul Murphy, Louise O'Reilly and Matt Shanahan.</p> <p>  Today's business is to resume our discussion of the general scheme of the sick leave Bill 2021.  At present, there is no statutory obligation for an employer to pay for a medically certified absence of an employee due to illness.  While many employers provide such sick pay, employees who do not receive it are disadvantaged.  We also know that it may encourage such employees to attend work even though they are ill.  In the context of the current public health situation, this is particularly undesirable.  The proposed Bill will provide for the creation of an entirely new right to sick pay, which will be legally enforceable through the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the courts.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  From IBEC, we have Ms Maeve McElwee, director of employer relations, and Ms Pauline O'Hare, senior employment law solicitor.  From the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, we have Dr. Laura Bambrick, social policy officer, and Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to references the witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Today, however, witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised that they make take legal advice on this matter if they think it is appropriate.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions that are given.</p> <p>  The opening statements from IBEC and ICTU have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Ms Maeve McElwee to make opening remarks on behalf of IBEC.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#A00300"><p>IBEC welcomes the opportunity provided by the joint committee to comment on the sick leave Bill 2021.  In addition to the statement we will make today, we intend to provide the Department with a more detailed submission setting out the views of our members on the Bill as it progresses.</p> <p>  IBEC contends that the introduction of statutory sick pay poses a significant cost to employers, particularly small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and those sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  We understand that it is the Government's intention to develop a scheme that is fair and affordable with minimum complexity and administrative burden for both employers and the State.  However, IBEC submits that the introduction of statutory sick pay, in the manner proposed, will give rise to a disproportionate cost burden to employers.  This is at a time when businesses continue to contend with the challenges posed by both Covid-19 and Brexit.  There are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.</p> <p>  While the Bill provides an exemption for employers that already operate a company sick pay scheme, the criteria for determining whether an existing scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay are so stringent that they will likely result in many employers being faced with the cost of administering a company scheme in addition to the payment of statutory sick pay.  For this reason, IBEC submits that the Bill as currently drafted will place excessive costs on employers, regardless of whether businesses have existing company sick pay schemes in place.</p> <p>  The Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations for the purpose of prescribing the daily rate of statutory sick leave payment.  As the regulations will not be published until the Bill has been enacted, we do not have full sight of what the prescribed rate will be.  However, we understand from the regulatory impact assessment, RIA, and the general scheme of the Bill that statutory sick leave payment will be at a rate of 70% of the employee's normal rate, subject to a daily earnings threshold of &euro;110.  The daily threshold is based on 2019 mean weekly earnings of &euro;786.33 and equates to an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16.  The Department has stated in the RIA that setting the rate at 70% is to ensure excessive costs are not placed on employers, which in certain sectors may also have to deal with the cost of replacing staff who are out sick at short notice.  However, the proposed payment is undoubtedly favourable when compared with sick pay schemes in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland where statutory sick pay is paid at a rate of &pound;95.85 per week.  Further, while the Government's stated intention in setting the sick pay entitlement at this level is to provide a minimum level of protection to low-paid workers who may have no entitlement to company sick pay schemes, basing a statutory sick pay entitlement on an annual salary of &euro;40,889.16 goes beyond protecting those who are low paid.</p> <p>  The Bill provides for an entitlement to three statutory sick leave days, which may be increased by ministerial order.  IBEC understands from the RIA that the Government's intention is to increase the number of statutory sick leave days to ten by 2025.  While the phased introduction of this cost is to be welcomed, IBEC submits that a potential increase in costs of &euro;1,100 per employee per annum is excessive.  This amount does not recognise the costs to the business of replacing staff who are absent on sick leave, often at short notice.</p> <p>  The entitlement to statutory sick leave in the Bill is granted on a per annum basis.  IBEC submits that this entitlement should be specified to be within a rolling 12-month period rather than in one calendar year.  This is a common feature of company sick pay schemes.  Should an employee take three statutory sick leave days at the end of December and then become entitled to another three days of statutory sick leave a week later, in the new calendar year, this would be financially difficult for employers.  The extension to ten days, as indicated, will exacerbate this issue for employers, with greater challenges again for those with peak trading over December and January.  This is particularly the case for SMEs which do not already operate a company sick pay scheme and therefore may be disproportionately impacted.</p> <p>  The Bill provides that the entitlement to statutory sick leave arises once an employee has completed 13 weeks of continuous service, which is a significant reduction from the six-month service requirement proposed in the general scheme.  This is a matter of concern for IBEC and its members as many company sick pay schemes do not take effect until an employee has six months of service and-or has passed a probationary period.  A recent survey of IBEC members found that 60% of the 307 respondents who operate a company sick pay scheme had a six-month service requirement in place.  Of particular concern is that the exemption in respect of company sick pay schemes only applies where the company scheme is more favourable than statutory sick pay.  As a result, employers with a service requirement in excess of 13 weeks will be required to pay statutory sick pay of up to ten days per annum in addition to any entitlements arising under the company sick pay scheme.</p> <p>  IBEC welcomes the principle of the non-application of the obligations under the Bill to employers which operate company sick pay schemes.  However, section 9 as currently drafted undermines its effectiveness.  IBEC submits that an exemption from paying statutory sick pay should apply where an employer operates a company sick pay scheme that is no less favourable than statutory sick pay.</p><p>Where the employer&rsquo;s scheme is at least equivalent to the statutory entitlement, it should not be required to pay twice.</p><p> Second, the matters which are stated to be taken into consideration when determining whether a company sick pay scheme is more favourable are overly stringent and will exclude many employers that may operate very generous sick pay schemes.  Specifically, as noted, company sick pay schemes often include a service requirement of six months or more.  Company sick pay schemes often do not apply until the fourth day of absence, in line with the payment of illness benefit, and they often operate on a rolling basis, whereas the statutory entitlement set out under in the general scheme is based on a calendar year.  While the general scheme states that the benefits must, as a whole, be more favourable to the employee, it appears likely that very generous company sick pay schemes may fall outside the scope of this section 9 exemption where certain terms of the scheme differ from the statutory sick pay requirements.  This could result in employees who already have generous sick pay entitlements under their contracts of employment receiving an overlapping increased sick pay benefit at a disproportionate cost to their employer.  The unintended consequence of this wording is that employers will likely seek to mitigate costs by reducing benefits over the statutory requirement or offering lesser terms to new employees.  This in turn would threaten industrial relations stability in the longer term.</p><p> IBEC and its members are concerned that although the Government intends the statutory sick pay scheme to be fair and affordable, for many companies, above all SMEs, the introduction of statutory sick pay will present a disproportionate cost burden, particularly in the current environment.  That cost will only be heightened where companies have the additional cost of replacing skills, with little or no notice, lost during a period of sick leave.  While IBEC supports the exemption of companies that already operate company sick pay schemes from the obligations of the proposed Bill, it appears from the current drafting that many employers who already operate sick pay schemes will not be in a position to avail of this exemption, which is of great concern to our members.  IBEC submits that any statutory sick pay scheme that is introduced must be sustainable and not represent a disproportionate cost.  In this regard, as much of the detail that will affect IBEC members will be set out in the subsequent regulations, IBEC will be seeking to engage with the Department on their drafting.  It is vital that IBEC is consulted in order to ensure that any proposed statutory sick pay scheme is fair and affordable, as well as manageable and operable, for employers across the board.  The scheme should include the introduction of tools for managers to be able to operate the scheme, manage and address issues that may arise around sick pay, none of which is currently included in the legislation.</p></speech>

My colleague Mr. Liam Berney will join us later following his meeting with the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands, if time allows.</p> <p>  First, the congress wishes to acknowledge the work of Department officials and the collaborative approach taken throughout on the design of the new scheme, including by this committee.  In the brief time available for my opening remarks, I will focus on key outstanding issues for ICTU and highlight differences between what is provided for in the draft Bill and what was indicated as intended in the general scheme of the Bill, which was published in June of this year.</p> <p>  Section 2 of the general scheme provides for the meaning to be ascribed to terms used in the body of the proposed Bill.  Like all employment legislation, the scope of what is provided for extends only to those employed on a &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;.  The definition of that term, for the purposes of this legislation, is taken from the Terms of Employment Information Act 1994.  This is a narrow definition and confines the scope of the proposed Bill to those employed on conventional contracts of service.  ICTU recommends a better and broader definition of a contract of employment, namely, those provided by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  Both definitions are much wider than the one now proposed.  Paragraph (b) of both definitions extends to atypical forms of working arrangements and is more akin to the notion of a worker in European law and the definition of a worker in UK law.</p> <p>  Section 5(2) of the general scheme provides employees with an entitlement to up to three days of paid sick leave per year.  While ICTU acknowledges that it is the clear intention of the scheme design that after 12 months, the three days will automatically move to five, then seven, and ten days in 2025, we are concerned that three days, not ten, will always be written into the legislation.</p> <p>  Section 5(5) provides that the service qualification for entitlement to statutory sick leave is 13 weeks&rsquo; continuous services.  Head 6(2)(a) of the draft scheme provides that the entitlements created by the proposed Bill will commence when an employee has completed six months of continuous employment.  Both cannot be right.  The congress recommends that the qualification period be kept to a minimum so as not to stall labour market mobility or create a perverse incentive for employers to dismiss workers before they come into qualification.</p> <p>  We are further concerned that the proposed Bill provides that the service qualification be based on continuous service.  Certain groups of workers routinely have their service broken by their employer.  One example is the thousands of early years professionals working in early childhood care and education, ECCE, or preschool services on 38-week contracts, who are forced to sign onto social welfare during the summer.  ICTU recommends that the wording be deleted or amended to ensure such workers do not have to build up their entitlement year after year and are repeatedly left without coverage for months on end.</p> <p>  Section 5(8) provides that all sick leave must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.  While the requirement to have the sickness certified is common practice in statutory sick leave schemes throughout the EU, Ireland is unusual in that workers have to pay for primary healthcare.  Very few people in employment are covered by a medical card or a GP visit card.  The Healthy Ireland survey wave 5, commissioned by the Department of Health, shows that an estimated 14.6% of people, or one in seven, aged between 18 and 64 working for payment or profit - that is, employees and self-employed people - hold a medical card, while a mere 3.6% hold a GP visit card.  In recognition that the out-of-pocket expense for a GP visit will create a barrier for workers exercising their new right to paid sick leave, the congress recommends that the final version of the Bill include provision for limited periods of self-certified sick leave.  Self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick leave.</p> <p>  Section 7(2) merely provides that the daily rate of statutory sick leave, and the maximum daily amount payable, are to be prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister.  However, head 7(1) of the general scheme provides that the daily rate is to be 70% of the employee&rsquo;s daily rate, subject to a maximum of &euro;110 per day.  This can be varied by the Minister by regulations made under the proposed Bill.  We recommend that the legislation further require the Minister to consult with the social partners annually on the adequacy of the daily rate, income cap and income floor to ensure adequacy and its interaction with occupational sick pay schemes, and to report to the Oireachtas on the outcome of this consultation.</p> <p>  Section 9 of the draft Bill provides, in effect, that the obligations imposed on an employer are not applicable where the employer provides employees with a sick pay scheme which is more favourable than that prescribed by the Bill.  Many contractual sick pay schemes provide for waiting days, typically meaning that no payment is made for the first three days of illness.  ICTU recommends that, rather than excluding the application of the legislation completely where more favourable contractual schemes apply, obligations under the Bill would not apply in respect of any day on which the employee is entitled to be paid by his or her employer under the terms of a more favourable sick leave scheme.</p><p>Section 10 of the Bill provides for the granting by the Labour Court, of an exemption from the requirements of the Act.  This is now a standard provision.  Congress recommends that in such circumstance the employee is fully compensated from the Social Insurance Fund and a debt is raised against the employer in the same ways as when a payment is made under the redundancy and insolvency payment scheme with employers that are still trading. </p><p> Having convinced the Government of the necessity to introduce statutory sick pay, the priority for congress is now to ensure that the new scheme will protect workers' health and income and bring a basic employment right in line with European norms.  It is this that informs our recommendations to the committee today.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

This is a very welcome discussion.  Sinn F&eacute;in very much welcomes the introduction of a sick pay scheme.  It is long overdue and it is good to see employers and unions working collaboratively to achieve this goal.</p> <p>  Could both witnesses comment on why Ireland has been an outlier for so long when it comes to the provision of sick pay?  We quite rightly often hear from IBEC in terms of making sure we are not an outlier in respect of investment in research and development compared to our European colleagues but we have been an outlier for decades on the subject of sick pay.  Why has this been the case for so long?  </p> <p>  One of my key concerns about this Bill is the practicalities of it, particularly regarding workers requiring certification from a GP.  Let us be practical here.  Right now, if a worker is sick, he or she is not going to get an appointment with a GP today.  In fact, he or she will be lucky to get an appointment this week.  That is the reality we must recognise.  We must also recognise that unlike our colleagues across most of Europe, where there is no charge to access a GP, here we are looking at anything between &euro;60 and &euro;80.  This means that the first day's sick leave pay is effectively gone because the person has had to pay it out for a doctor's certificate.  This is clearly a barrier to workers accessing the scheme.  Would it not be better to go for a limited self-certification period for the first couple of days not just because it would be the right thing to do in terms of not punishing workers by having them pay &euro;60 but also because it is simply not practical to expect a worker to be able to access a GP on the same day he or she is sick?  </p></speech>

This is not the first time it has come up for broader consideration.  I presume that as with any of these issues around employment rights and terms and conditions that apply, all of these things get looked at.  They look at the principle around our social protection system, the fact that illness benefit was always paid by the State and the fact that there are other provisions to support employees that may not necessarily be in place in other states.  There are probably a very significant number of factors that give rise to that.</p> <p>  The Senator&rsquo;s point about certification on day one is of considerable concern to us as well.  Like the Senator, we recognise the challenge for people getting access on day one to certification in a non-emergency situation.  Nevertheless what is really important to recognise here, particularly when we are overlaying a statutory sick pay scheme on existing company pay schemes is that most company sick pay schemes do require certification after the waiting days, which are typically three.  They always require that certification to be produced on day three and do not accept backdated certificates because technically, it is very difficult for a GP to know how sick someone was three days ago so that certification always comes on day one.  </p> <p>  It was recognised in a number of the initial consultation papers we received that management of sick pay also helps to manage absence and it was introduced as a positive consideration about the introduction of statutory sick pay, in that it would assist employers in managing absence.  However, there are no provisions in this Bill to assist employers in managing absence and address concerns employers may have around the veracity of sick leave taken, how it is taken or whether there is an abuse of sick leave that is ongoing.  Other pieces of protective legislation recognise that these situations do arise &ndash; not all of the time but they do arise and they do need to be managed and addressed.  This is probably the only piece of management support within this legislation as it currently stands and I know employers would be very concerned to see it removed, albeit we do recognise the challenge around a medical practice being able to issue a certificate on the same day.  </p></speech>

When it went through our books to look for potential cost savings - to put it diplomatically - it looked at how we provide workers with sick pay.  The troika identified that we are really unusual throughout Europe in that our Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost of workers&rsquo; sick pay from day one &ndash; day one minus the waiting days.  In other countries, the employer is entitled for a short period.  If the illness lasts longer than that, the Social Insurance Fund then kicks in to cover it.  The push-back was very similar to what we are hearing today, which is that now is not the time to introduce it and the country is going through so much that it is important to keep labour costs low.  One of the recommendations of the troika was that statutory sick pay be introduced because the existing situation was placing a risk on the State because the Social Insurance Fund is not a fund.  It is a cost that is taken out of the day-to-day outgoings of the State.  That is the last time this was looked at.  This time, we did not need the troika arriving in town.  It was a global pandemic that brought us to this space.</p> <p>  Regarding the GP certificate, we must go back to the origins of this Bill.  It concerned Covid clusters in meat factories.  Employers in this sector are very wealthy with a mostly migrant workforce.  How would that migrant workforce function under this Bill?  The majority of them are on a minimum wage.  The Bill will provide them with 70% of their daily rate.  That is lower than the average cost of seeing a GP, which is &euro;60.  Seventy percent of an eight-hour day on the minimum wage is in or around &euro;57 so already they are out of pocket by &euro;3.  They are also based in really rural communities.  The chances of seeing a GP in a built-up environment such as Dublin are already difficult, so seeing a GP in a very isolated area would add further expense involving in travelling to see that GP as well as the practicalities of having GP certification on the first day.  They would be the concerns of congress, which is why we recommend that a period be introduced where someone can be self-certified in order that people can have those one or two days and then on day three, have the time and knowledge to know if this is a sickness that will require a further period of recuperation.  </p></speech>

The meat factory workers are an excellent example of how, unless we move to a limited period of self-certification, this sick pay scheme will not work.  It will leave them out of pocket, as Dr. Bambrick has said.  Clearly, that is not what any of us wants to achieve through this Bill.</p> <p>  I have another concern that I want to raise with both parties, which is how we write the legislation.  As Dr. Bambrick has said, it is going to be written in with just three days leave and the idea is that regulations will increase that.  As we all know, there is no guarantee that those regulations will come into force as planned.  We all know that there is likely to be a pushback whenever the next cycle of session comes around.  Would we not be far better to write the schedule of days and increases into the legislation to ensure that we end up with a worthwhile scheme?  While that would not put us on a par with our colleagues in Europe it would at least bring us some way towards that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#DD00200"><p>We had expected that we would see something different and more than just regulations.  On the other hand, it is reasonable that there is flexibility to adjust the days without having to fully amend the legislation on every occasion.  I mean that the regulations give a little bit more flexibility rather than primary legislation.</p> <p>  I wish to take up a couple of points.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that we are saying keep wages low and do not bring in sick pay now.  I wish to correct the record and I acknowledge that it might just have been the way I heard Dr. Bambrick.  We are not saying not to bring in sick pay.  We are saying that there are some really challenging issues and very significant costs for lots of employers at this particular time.  Certainly, we are not talking about keeping wages low.</p> <p>  When we come to that issue of writing the days into the legislation, I think what we would all recognise is that once those days are in the legislation and are operated by contract with the employee they rarely, if ever, move back.  It is not IBEC's normal operation to see those days move back on an across the board basis.  For example, at the time of the national minimum wage changes many years ago, in response to the financial crisis, IBEC did not support that move at all.  We do not expect to see that type of change would come about.  We do recognise that it is important.  It is covered in the Bill as it is currently stands.  There are exemptions and exceptions albeit that they tend not to be particularly useful to employers individually but they are at least there for individual different circumstances.  I am not sure that having it as a regulation or definitively in the primary legislation might necessarily be any different.  We would not expect to see that being clawed back but it would be normal that regulations could amend legislation.  Also, any increases could be looked at and maybe amended or introduced more slowly in the event of a negative economic situation at any particular point in time.</p></speech>

We absolutely understand the need for it to be gradually introduced but we assumed that it was taken as a given that it would never go below ten days.</p> <p>  Similarly, but for different reasons from Ms McElwee, we do see the benefits of regulations.  I mean that if changes are to be made, it would not require the Minister having to go through the hoopla of getting primary legislation changed.  I guarantee that every budget submission from now on will include a request around statutory sick pay.  We will be looking at how well the economy recovers.  In the same way as Ms McElwee&rsquo;s members will be seeking a slow-down of the scheme&rsquo;s introduction, we will be seeking for it to be brought forward.</p> <p>  To echo Ms McElwee, there are benefits to using regulation but our concern is that the ten-day period is not mentioned in the primary legislation.  That period is an absolute floor to this right.</p></speech>

I noted comments from the Chartered Accountants Ireland this week to the effect that, given that it is just a few weeks away, it would be impossible for employers to implement this scheme from 1 January 2022, particularly businesses using payroll service providers, as there would not be enough time to develop or adapt software.  Providers of payroll services have stated that they would need a six-month lead-in time.  Will Ms McElwee advise us on whether she has similar concerns?  What are her thoughts on this matter?</p></speech>

While I am not a payroll specialist, I know that there are considerable concerns among members about the timescale for the legislation&rsquo;s introduction.  There are undoubtedly any number of challenges that would arise for organisations in its implementation, how it could be managed and how employers would integrate the statutory sick pay scheme, given the complexities they already deal with in running their existing sick pay schemes.  Many employers, particularly those that have grown over many years, perhaps by acquisition, do not have a single sick pay scheme.  We could identify multiple schemes in a number of our larger members that have not had the opportunity to amalgamate them.  There could be ten or 15 schemes still running.  That poses a major challenge to trying to integrate a statutory sick pay scheme, particularly where so many questions remain.  In section 9, for example, no clear understanding can be taken from the current wording as to whether an employer&rsquo;s scheme can be considered better in the round or who can consider it to be better.  Would one or two days&rsquo; difference in a current private scheme make it better than a scheme that the WRC adjudicated on two days earlier?  The Bill provides no clarity or guidance whatsoever.  For employers trying to integrate a scheme like that into their overall payroll programmes would be problematic.  I can see where the body is coming from in that regard.</p></speech>

As has been outlined and as far as I am aware, the most common protocol in the private sector is that sick leave must be certified if it extends beyond two days.  Would ICTU like to see limited periods of self-certified sick leave being included in the Bill?  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

We can see that it costs about one tenth of the cost of the sick leave scheme to have those limited period of uncertified days and it would be the difference between falling ill on day one and day two and giving a worker the opportunity to see if it is something that will require a GP and an extended period of sick leave.  A worker would not get those one or two days every time he or she goes on potential sick leave.  It would be limited to a number of days every 12 months, as Ms McElwee suggested.  A limited number of the ten days would be uncertified to allow people to see whether this was an ailment that would develop into a sickness.</p></speech>

This is a big change for Ireland and we are pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this with all the actors involved because we want to get it right.  Ms McElwee spoke about the sectors that have been most impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  She might expand on that and explain what those sectors are.  She also mentioned in her presentation that there are additional costs involved in the replacement of skills, with little or no notice, which are lost during a period of sick leave.  Is it not the case that regardless of sick leave some employers would have to replace skills if somebody was out sick?</p> <p>  We need to explore the question of existing schemes being more favourable than statutory sick pay.  I agree with Ms McElwee that we need to drill down into that because I do not see how people could be paid on the double.  The witnesses from IBEC said they would give us more information and I would like them to give us an indication as to what sick pay schemes are out there already, how they are operated by various companies and how they work.  That would help us to examine this.  Ms McElwee mentioned in her presentation that 307, or 60%, of respondents came back and said that they operated sick pay schemes.  Ms McElwee mentioned more than once that the bigger companies seem to be operating a sick pay scheme or maybe more than one scheme in some instances and the smaller companies will be under pressure.  We are all agreed that we do not want to put pressure on SMEs to the extent that they cannot operate this.  We need to find a way around that but big companies can well afford it.  I have also been looking at some research, which I am not sure if IBEC has been looking at.  The research maintains that paid sick leave is good for business.  Rather than impacting on business, if it is done properly it can increase worker productivity, reduce the spread of contagious illnesses, keep businesses open during Covid-19, as was the case in some states in America and reduce worker turnover.  There are huge positives to paid sick leave and some of the larger companies that operate such schemes probably recognise this and understand that happy workers lead to better productivity and so on.  We might need to talk about that.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Bambrick as well.  I would like to further explore the issue of bogus self-employment.  I was speaking with some employers recently and they maintained that were they to operate various statutory schemes like this one, they would be competitively disadvantaged by other companies that operate bogus self-employment.  I would like to hear Dr. Bambrick expand on bogus self-employment because some employers I spoke with were concerned about that.  The 38-week contracts are another issue we need to explore further.  Dr. Bambrick mentioned that self-certified sick leave typically costs about one tenth of the total cost of public service sick pay.  Where does that statistic come from?  I have looked at what the HSE and others do and the HSE provides seven days of self-certified paid sick leave in a continuous two-year period.  If it is self-certified then how is there a cost?  Maybe I am missing something here and excuse me if I am.  Dr. Bambrick also mentioned that the Social Insurance Fund should be used in some instances, which is interesting and curious, even though others have said that should not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#E00400"><p>I will take the Deputy's questions from the beginning.  He asked which sectors might be most affected.  We will see it in many sectors, including in our experience economy, which has been hugely impacted by Covid.  The introduction of sick pay schemes there will undoubtedly create an additional burden of cost.  Any businesses that do not have sick pay schemes will feel the cost but our experience economy will be hardest hit.  It is also coming into its most difficult trading period early next year and there are huge challenges around the sector at that time of the year anyway and putting this on top of that provides a significant cost.  There are other sectors across the board where we know that wages tend to be set at a particular rate, whether that is the national minimum wage or whether there are sectoral employment orders or joint labour committee rates in place.  There will also be a requirement for us to look at how we will realign all of that so there is a significant impact across those sectors as well.</p> <p>  There are a couple of things to look at in the issue the Deputy raised around replacement costs and employers having to replace costs.  We also have a significant challenge in respect of the availability of labour in all sectors.  Not alone is it difficult to replace individuals but it is expensive to replace them.  We also have considerable challenges in the negative context and climate around short-term work contracts and agency working, whereas in fact they are an important part of our workplace flexibility.  The ability of employers to offer and appropriately provide statutory entitlements like sick pay, carer&rsquo;s leave and parental leave relies on that flexibility.  It is important that we do not perpetuate the negative narrative that these are poor employment options.  They often provide a first step in the door for many individuals but it is difficult and costly to replace skills that are particularly unique.  Where you might have somebody in a stand-alone role, there is an additional cost.  That person will have to be replaced; otherwise the company bears the cost of either lost production or significantly reduced production over time.  Employers that are not paying sick leave already bear that replacement cost or productivity loss but now they will also in many cases bear the productivity loss or cost, which is excessive in many cases, and the statutory sick pay cost as well.  The more days that are introduced as we move through the system, the more costly that can become in the long term.</p> <p>  Looking at how sick pay schemes operate, the vast majority of members who we have surveyed tell us they have waiting days in place.</p><p>There is initially going to be a service element.  Most employers do not start incorporating people into sick pay schemes until they have passed their probation, which is typically six months.  After that, there will be service days and, therefore, there are waiting days where people can take a couple of days' sick leave without the requirement to be paid but also without the requirement to produce any certification for those particular days.  They are still considered to be authorised leave, however.  They are out sick and that is recognised.</p><p> When we look at organisations and how sick pay works, however, the Deputy is quite right.  Employers see sick leave as being a benefit.   They see it as an opportunity to attract people to their organisations where they can afford to put something in place.  It is not just larger companies.  Many smaller companies offer sick pay benefits to their employees where, again, they can afford it.</p><p> The challenge, particularly with this proposed Bill, is that in terms of offering a benefit, it often has to be managed so that it is not actually just a right, it is a benefit of one's employment and it operates to be beneficial and fairly and effectively.  There is nothing that employees hate more than that sense that people are getting away with stuff where others are operating very effectively.  We know that the unions support and have always supported employers on this piece.  As a result, it will be critical to look at sick pay schemes and say that almost every existing sick pay scheme has a disqualification cause; a reason to say that an employer is not actually operating the scheme fairly and we are disqualifying them from it.  There will be clauses within it which state that the company will review a person's sick leave if it feels that there is a pattern to it or that there is an ongoing problem with the potential to be able to restrict a person's usage of it.</p><p> There are abuse clauses, as there are in other items of statutory legislation, relating to people who it is felt are not operating it in line with the principle that it is there to support.  All those things are very important clauses in the context of sick pay.  Then there are other situations where organisations will run sick pay.  There will be issues around whether a person will be eligible to earn a bonus, what schemes are in place and other company benefits that will be dependent on sick pay, particularly where the sick pay is going to be put on a statutory leave footing and how that will interact with other company benefits and schemes, such as, for example, those relating to attendance bonuses.  Were we to suggest that a person is not deemed to be absent on a day that he or she is on statutory sick leave, how will that have an impact?  There is much complexity regarding how sick leave schemes operate within the environment at present.</p><p> On the Deputy's final point to the effect that big companies can well afford it, big companies that have put in place sick pay schemes can afford the schemes they have budgeted for and are operating.  If we are now layering on additional costs, that will be challenging for many organisations if we are now referring to day one and, again, the lack of clarity around section 9 as to whether it is better in the round or on the whole and how that will operate may actually increase costs.  The last thing we want to do is to be seen through statutory legislation to drive a race to the bottom where employers step back and say they have actually put in place some significant benefits for employees, including sick pay but often many other benefits.  If this is layered on top and represents an additional cost, employers may say they are able to afford it but are being penalised for putting more favourable policies in place because everything that comes a statute is now layered on top of it instead of being taken in the round, which I think the proposed Bill is trying to do.  That really needs to be made clear because, otherwise, employers will retrench and say that if the cost is going to be added on, they have to be sure and have some certainty regarding what the cost will be.  If, therefore, there are no management clauses in the legislation and no overarching ability to be able to say that an employer has something that is better overall, then employers, quite reasonably, will rely on the legislation and say that that is what they will implement.</p></speech>

We do not want to have a situation where we have ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to schemes.  That needs to be very clear.  I am not sure if Dr. Bambrick wishes to come in on the question I asked with respect to the 10%.  I am just curious about that.</p></speech>

Our two big concerns for trade unions in winning the right for statutory sick pay, forgetting about the details of the proposed Bill, are what Ms McElwee talked about whereby it could lead to a displacement of existing occupational sick pay at company level, which, at ten days, actually has ended up being more generous than what is in the proposed legislation.  All of a sudden, instead of the proposed legislation becoming a floor it becomes a ceiling.</p> <p>  The second issue we had, to which the Deputy drew attention, is whether this will incentivise more bogus self-employment because there will be an incentive for some employers to avoid the costs that will be imposed on them.  That is why we made our first recommendation in respect of changing the definition in section 2 as to who is covered.  That would take in many of those workers who are providing services rather than under a contract of employment.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to people who are working in ECCE, also known as the free year or playgroup year.  If early years professionals are working for the service providers that just provide those playgroup years, they have to sign on for the summer.  They do not have continuous contracts of employment because the facility is not getting the funding through the Government scheme.  Under this proposed Bill, they would have to build up their entitlement again.  A person who starts back in September would not be eligible until December under this Bill.</p> <p>  The reason self-certified sick leave is still creating a cost in respect of the scheme is that the worker would still get paid for those pays but he or she would not be obliged to provide the employer with a GP certificate.  Self-certified and uncertified days still operate the same costs to the scheme.  The difference is having to provide a GP certificate for those days or not.  That is where the 10% comes.</p> <p>  On the Social Insurance Fund, as I mentioned earlier, it is recommended - and we support this - that where an employer has shown an inability to meet the costs of the scheme, they can go to the Labour Court.  To ensure that the employee is not left out of pocket, however, in the same way that we do with redundancies in the context of companies that are letting workers go but are still trading, the Social Insurance Fund picks up the cost and then the charge is imposed on the employer.  Over time, the Department works with that employer to ensure that the money is paid back.  This means that neither the employee, in the first instance, nor the Social Insurance Fund, in the medium to long term, are out of pocket.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#F00500"><p>I thank ICTU and IBEC for attending.  As I said at the previous meeting, I am relieved and frustrated in equal measure that we are eventually having the pre-legislative scrutiny of this important proposed legislation.  Enormous credit goes to ICTU and to my union, SIPTU, in terms of putting this issue very much on the map some 12 months ago.  My big regret, perhaps, is that it has taken until now for us to talk about introducing this proposed legislation.  Nonetheless, we are here today.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  It is important for me to mention the importance of hardwiring some of the detail into the legislation, which I believe Senator Gavan, the ICTU and others also spoke about.  I am very supportive of that.  I will turn to IBEC first regarding the question of replacement costs and productivity losses or, as Deputy Stanton alluded to, long-term productivity gains.</p><p>I note that IBEC undertook a survey of its members with regard to sick pay arrangements within their workplaces.  Was a question about the replacement cost of a person being out of work because of illness asked in that survey?  It is important that we understand there is a replacement cost but we must also understand the extent of that replacement cost in any one workplace.  </p><p> As a follow-up to that, has IBEC looked at research on the productivity loss from staff members being out ill?  Is the loss linear?  To me, the loss from a staff member being out one day is not the equivalent of his or her being out six days.  It seems to me the loss would be much greater if somebody was out of work for a protracted period of time as opposed to one or two days.  I know that the productivity loss is a concern to IBEC.  What research has it looked at to quantify the scale of the loss within workplaces?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#G00200"><p>I think that question was for me.  We did not specifically ask member companies in that particular survey to try to quantify the productivity loss because we understood that a different number would have come back from every respondent.  The scale of productivity loss would depend on the role each company was trying to replace and the specific skill set involved.  It also might depend on the area of the country the company is in.  What we know is that depending on that skill set and depending on the availability of labour, it can be a very different cost and a difficult challenge for many employers.  That is the case now.  It was also the case before the pandemic and it remains the case since the loosening of some restrictions.  The availability of talent continues to be the number one concern for employers.  The absence of people within that talent pipeline in the organisation does matter.</p> <p>  The Senator asked whether a longer, more protracted absence is more difficult and costly to manage.  In actual fact, many employers find that short-term absences are much more disruptive because staff members are much harder to replace.  If we know somebody is going to be unwell and out of work for a longer period of time, it is easier to make sure a replacement is in place.  It is easier to plan and manage if somebody is likely to be out for six days, ten days or whatever it might be than it is if somebody is out for multiple, very short periods, which tend not to come with a great deal of notice.  There is a cost associated with bringing in somebody from an agency, moving somebody within the business or just doing without and addressing the productivity loss.  It is different depending on the role but short-term absences are much more disruptive for organisations.</p></speech>

I would like to understand a little more about the timing of that.  I am conscious that there was a quick turnaround between the invitation to appear before the committee and our guests' appearance.  I appreciate there are many calls on their time.  However, this has been the subject of many discussions at the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, over many months.  When does IBEC propose to make that submission to the Department?  Some of us believe there is an urgency with regard to progressing the Bill.  Is IBEC going to produce the submission quickly or is this going to delay the overall passing or progressing of this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

Looking at the Bill as it is currently drafted and given the lack of clarity we have, we feel a lot of information is missing.  As I have already outlined, there are a number of clauses, including anti-abuse clauses and companies' ability to be able to manage this system appropriately, as one would expect any organisation to manage an absence policy, in which there is a lack of clarity.  The definitions within sections 8 and 9 are very unclear.  We are expecting that as the Bill moves forward, we will see more clarity around its drafting.  We hope that as a result of our interventions at the committee today, some of the concerns we have around the lack of clarity in the legislation will be reflected as the Bill progresses and it will be amended and updated to address some of those concerns.</p> <p>  I have listened to the points Dr. Bambrick has raised this morning about, for example, the definitions within the initial sections.  We have a different sense and a different feeling around the whole issue of who is going to be captured by it.  We have had some discussion around bogus self-employment and who would be captured.  The real concern for employers is that we do not have a definition of "worker" in Irish legislation.  One is either an employee or is not an employee.  We have plenty of case law and legislation that allows us to determine who is an employee and who is not.  We have adequate and ample mechanisms, in our view, for how that gets done.  The challenge with legislation like this is that if we have people who are not in a traditional employment contract, that opens up a whole question as to how an employer would understand to whom they have responsibilities.  How would the employer apply existing sick pay schemes to somebody who is not on an existing contract of employment, as we understand it?  How are we going to deal with people who have multiple part-time roles, that is, people who are not just in the employment of one employer?  What happens when a worker's illness might arise from an injury or occupational illness suffered while working for one employer?  How are we going to manage such a situation, even for payroll or reporting purposes, and determine who is paying that sick leave and how it will be structured?  We have no clarity at all around how part-time sick pay is going to be managed, accrued or calculated.  To answer the Senator's question, there is still a major absence of information that will require remedy before we think this Bill is ready to be enacted.  However, we do not intent to delay it.  We will continue to bring forward all of the concerns, as we have been doing, to try to make sure we have the best and most appropriate legislation when it passes.</p></speech>

I want to finish with IBEC.  I will turn to the issue of financial sustainability, which is, of course, something we must look at.  Ms McElwee said in her opening statement that it would be financially unsustainable for a worker to take three days' sick leave at the end of December and three days' sick leave in the new calendar year.  How is that different from a person taking three days' sick leave because he or she falls ill in September, that person having taken another three days' leave in July?  I ask that mindful of Ms McElwee's previous comments about six days' absence being easier to plan for compared with a day here and a day there.  I want to understand more about what makes the last week of December and the first week of January less financially sustainable, relative to taking sick pay at other times of the year.  I apologise if the answer is obvious but I think it would be useful to clarify the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#G00600"><p>I will be brief in my reply.  From our perspective, I am probably looking at particular sectors that were impacted here.  There are two issues.  One is the fact that most sick leave schemes, as they currently operate, are on a rolling basis.  This entitlement arises every year from January to December but it rolls, depending on when sick leave might have been first activated within the rolling period.  The calendar period presents a unique challenge for many sectors, particularly those in our experience economy and those in retail because many of them have extraordinarily busy times.  During those times, those employers would not offer annual leave on a regular basis.  Taking retail as an example, that would be true as we come into the Christmas trading period and the new year's sales period.  It is often a challenge for other employees when people are absent or not around.  Three or four days' absence is disruptive during that period.  If sick pay is available for ten days, somebody could potentially disappear for ten days before Christmas and another ten days during the January sales period.</p><p>We were looking at it in the context of the experience economy element across entertainment, hospitality, retail, restaurants and bars, with all those sectors hitting that critically important trading period in December and January.  All these things wrap back up.  That covers the issues of the rolling 12 months and the absence of any management clauses within this proposed legislation that all lead to it being problematic.</p></speech>

Senator Sherlock&rsquo;s time is up.  That concludes the first round of questions.  Does anyone want to indicate and start the second round of questions?  Senator Ahearn has indicated.  The Senator will have seven minutes.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McElwee and Dr. Bambrick for their contributions and for their work on this matter.  The draft legislation is important and welcome.  As previous speakers said, it is about time we discussed it and tried to get it put in place.</p> <p>  To pick up on Ms McElwee's response to Senator Sherlock, I do not think anyone is trying to delay legislation coming through the Houses.  This is about working together to make sure it is right.  The intentions on both sides is to make sure this is done correctly.  Ms McElwee expressed concerns about the draft legislation and ensuring it is right.  She gave the example of a person who has two jobs who gets injured in one job and how would that would affect his or her other job.  All the examples she gave would have happened in other countries when sick pay was introduced.  How did they manage?  Has IBEC researched how it has been managed in other countries in the context of the various concerns Ms McElwee raised?  Are there good examples of how other countries managed in that regard?</p> <p>  This is a question for Dr. Bambrick and Ms McElwee regarding medical certificates.  One of the main concerns about getting a doctor&rsquo;s certificate is the cost for the employee.  Almost 50% of people either have a medical card or a GP visit card.  It would not be 50% because many retired people would have medical cards.  Has any research been done on the percentage of employees who hold a medical card or a GP card?  I know from my constituency office that many people who are entitled to a GP card are not aware of that.  Perhaps we need to get that message out.  It certainly protects the lowest paid.  When we talk about the cost of paying a GP for a medical certificate in respect of sick pay being a significant barrier, I would be interested to know the percentage of employees who hold a GP card or a medical card.  If it is 50%, which is the highest it would have ever been in the history of the State, common sense dictates that we have probably the highest percentage of employees who have ever held a medical card or a GP card.  That goes some way to supporting employees.  I would interested to hear our guests&rsquo; comments on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#H00500"><p>I can respond on those figures.  As the Senator said, we have good coverage of the population as a whole with respect to medical cards and GP cards.  The officials mentioned the working-age population in this context last week.  Many people in that cohort are outside the workforce.  I refer to those with disabilities and many lone parents.  If one&rsquo;s youngest child is under the age of eight, one is not required to be looking for work and one is therefore not counted as part of the labour force.  The Department of Health conducts a Healthy Ireland survey every two or three years of a sample of 7,500 people.  It is representative, which means it is similar to the Red C poll one would read about on a Sunday.  It is a snapshot of the population.  We can note from it that one in seven people who are actively working, being either self-employed or employees, has a medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  When we narrow it down and examine the people not only of working age but who are in employment or self-employed, it is very narrow and the reason for that is the income is based on the household, not on what the individual earns.  We know from research on minimum wage workers that many of them do not live in low-income households because they are either living with their parents, who have their own income, or they are living with a spouse, and the minimum wage earner is a second earner who might have a part-time entry job.  We have very few people who are in work who have the cost of going to a GP covered.  One in seven of them has a full medical card and one in 27 has a GP card.  Many people of working age have a medical card but very few of them who are actively working today will have the &euro;60 cost of a GP visit to get medical certificate covered.</p></speech>

I will check that.  There may have been a time lag in doing one.  The figures I quoted are from 2019, when those data were collected.  There may have been a delay because of Covid-19 because of the way those data are collected.  Unlike the financial crash, during Covid-19 we have not seen a big increase in the number of applicants for medical and GP cards.  That is to do with how comparatively generous our Covid income supports were.  Even if one was in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment, one was still not eligible because that &euro;250 level would have pushed one over the income allowance even if one was not in a low income household or was living with other people.</p></speech>

She said one in seven people has a medical card and one in 27 has a GP card, which seems very low for GP cards when it should be easier to get that card.  What were the figures going back two, four or ten years?  I do not have the figures but it seems obvious that if we are issuing more medical and GP cards to the nation, more employees will have them.  I understand that someone's GP card or medical card takes account of the household income.  There is an obvious reason for that.  Dr. Bambrick gave the example of a person who might be living with a parent.  People who live with their parents often might not pay rent and their expenditure would be less.  Has the number of employees with a GP card or medical card increased during the past ten or 20 years?</p></speech>

The extension of coverage with respect to medical cards has tended to be include the very youngest and the eldest, the over-70s.  GPs cards were introduced for people with both a State pension and an occupational pension.  GP cards were also introduced for under eights and moving on to the under-12s.  A single person living on his or her own with an income over &euro;184, is not eligible for a medical card.  If one is on the minimum wage and one works more than 17 hours, one is not entitled to a medical card.  If one earns more than &euro;304, one is not eligible for a GP card.  If one works 28 hours, long part-time hours, one is not eligible for a GP card.  Hands off, we have been very good at expanding coverage but the coverage is not hitting the working population.</p><p>A big working age population is included in it but those people are outside the labour market.  We hear conversations about work disincentives, such as the fear of losing a medical card because that is a gateway into many other services such as the back to school allowance, transport and so on.  People are reluctant to take on work because of that expense.  To drive home that point, it is not necessary to earn a great deal of money not to have primary healthcare covered in this country.</p></speech>

She said in her submission that additional costs are involved in the replacement of skills with little or no notice which are lost during a period of sick leave.  If a person is sick, he or she will not be able to go to work regardless of whether we have schemes in place or not and that will have to be replaced anyway.  Can Ms McElwee tease out what she means by that particular statement?  If a person is sick surely we should not encourage him or her to go to work?</p></speech>

When we talk about the costs for employers of replacing somebody, particularly for short periods of time, we are not talking about serious illness here, there are challenges.  It depends on whether somebody can be moved from another area, or there may be a skills training issue.  Generally there is some loss of productivity and cost to the business as a result.  There is a management cost of moving people around, potentially a replacement cost or an agency cost if someone is brought in externally.  There is also an administration cost of addressing and person-managing the salary, engaging with the agency, paying it and so on.</p></speech>

Whether or not we introduce a sick scheme of any sort, if a person is sick he or she cannot go to work and should not be there.  Am I right in saying that introducing this particular scheme should not have an impact in additional costs involved in replacing skills?  If people are sick, they should not be at work.  If they have to go to work their productivity will probably drop, they will probably be quite upset and also may infect other workers.  I just do not get that.  If someone is sick, he or she is sick and needs to be out and that is that.</p></speech>

What we are trying to reflect and recognise here, particularly where it is important that we see this brought in on a phased basis, is a recognition for employers that it will be a significant additional cost because they would not ordinarily be paying the second salary if they do not already have a sick pay scheme in place.</p></speech>

Okay.  The other question is, with respect to the current sick pay schemes in operation by the companies Ms McElwee cited earlier, are there any reports of abuse of those schemes?  Would that be a concern?  Would Ms McElwee give us an indication of what that is?  I have looked at some of the international research here which indicates that when good relationships prevail between workers and employers that abuse does not happen.  In some instances in America these schemes have been expanded because it was found that productivity went up.</p> <p>  Regarding the other point Ms McElwee mentioned in regard to competition for workers, would some employers use the presence of a sick pay scheme as an extra way of attracting workers to their companies?</p></speech>

I would also say that there can be increased productivity where there is good management of those schemes and where there are good relationships, but I would also tell the Deputy that the bread and butter of the IBEC executive's role is often dealing with the day-to-day issues that arise around absence and absence management.  Without a doubt we regularly have issues and concerns that arise around ongoing sporadic absences.  They may be around managing issues where perhaps somebody has an underlying concern but often they can be linked to other issues.  It is an ongoing matter for employers to deal with.  It is important that they deal with it fairly and have a process for dealing with it but there is no doubt these are the daily questions that come through around managing that sporadic absence.  Questions arise on how to implement the company's sick pay scheme if people are not providing medical certificates, if employees are always missing on a Monday or if somebody is routinely gone after a bank holiday weekend?  HR departments are occupied with such issues on an ongoing basis and that is one reason we say it is so important that there is governance, because the management of those schemes appropriately and fairly within a process is what makes them work.  It is what makes them attractive and makes other employees feel that everybody is being treated the same way.  Everybody knows when somebody is abusing a sick pay scheme.  When employers do not deal with it it becomes a really significant industrial relations problem.  That is why schemes can be seen as a benefit.  Where they are well managed they address those issues.  Where people are not operating in good faith they can be managed within the provision of the scheme.</p></speech>

She might come back to us later and let us know if they have carried out any research with respect to abuse.  I ask Ms Bambrick, in light of what Ms McElwee said, to outline the position of the trade union movement with regard to abuse of schemes.  If a person in a company is abusing a scheme and we do not know to what extent that might be, that other workers actually have to pick up the slack and might feel discommoded which may lead to people being disgruntled which is understandable.  Would Ms Bambrick comment on that please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Bambrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021112400002#J00900"><p>I will qualify my answer by saying I am not involved in industrial relations and unfortunately my colleague who would be better able to answer this, is dealing with the State pension at the moment.  As Ms McElwee mentioned earlier, trade unions are very supportive when there is genuine abuse happening because these have to date been voluntary arrangements by the employer and so we wanted to see these schemes work both for good worker-employer relations but also to protect the sustainability of the scheme.  I will also point to other international research.  The findings are somewhat paradoxical.  They show that the more generous a sick pay scheme is, the fewer waiting days, the higher the replacement rate cost, the easier it is to access it with those uncertified days, and the less absenteeism we see.  It sounds contradictory, that if one gives people easier access to paid days off, the expectation might be that they might abuse it and take the time.  What the research finds when it digs down is that it allows people to take days off when they have a minor ailment and it stops the condition festering into something more serious that a longer spell of absenteeism is needed to recuperate.  This is what we have seen during the outbreaks of Covid-19.  People had minor coughs and colds, were not sure if it was Covid-19 and took the gamble to go to work because they did not have the safeguard of a sick pay scheme, and within that time whole companies had to be shut down.  Real research exists which says that a generous scheme can be more beneficial and less costly than being very tight about who can access it and the terms under which they can access it.</p></speech>

I was glad the interaction between Senator Ahearn and Dr. Bambrick on clarifying who is entitled to a medical card and GP card took place.  It was really useful.  Officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a number of comments two weeks ago that were not reflective of the reality on the ground with regard to the working age population and their entitlement to medical cards.  I thank Dr. Bambrick for providing the detail on who does and does not qualify and on the number who have an entitlement or have qualified for the GP card.</p><p> In her submission, Dr. Bambrick mades a number of very important points on who the legislation would apply to in terms of the definition or the relevant benchmark legislation.  The definition of "employee" and the comments on self-certification were very important points.  I ask about the minimum service period because she raised that concern as well.  There are certainly those who have a break in their employment in a particular year.  When the Labour Party put forward its Bill on sick pay last September, there was a provision for a four-week minimum service period.  Dr. Bambrick made the point that effectively a period of 13 weeks is too long.  What does congress propose the minimum service period should be?   What is it recommending?</p></speech>

However, I hope it helped the him in his deliberations.</p> <p>  When we talk about the minimum service, we absolutely acknowledge the need to establish a relationship between the employer and the worker.  We accept that is a principle that is already established in other legislation.  Our concern around this is the wording of continuous service.  That is where it causes difficulties.  Our colleagues in SIPTU, who represent the early years, drew our attention to the thousands - we are not talking about a niche group here - of workers in the early years whose employment does not exist for 52 weeks of the year.  Under this existing draft legislation, they would start off again as a new entrant employee even though they have established that relationship with that employer.  They would have to build it up from 1 September, not coming into qualification until December, if the 13 weeks are accepted.</p> <p>  Where we lie on what the appropriate minimum of service is, we wanted to emphasise that we identified the difference between what was said in the draft that was published in June that suggested six months and what is proposed now.  We came out strongly against that initially, saying it was too long and it would lead to some employers letting people go before they built up their entitlement.  We are glad to see it has been reduced down to 13 weeks.  We want to put it on the record of this committee that it was not an oversight.  We think less time is better and we are not at this stage looking for it to be narrowed down again.  Our emphasis, though, is on that wording on the continuous period of employment.</p></speech>

A discussion took place earlier on the 70% replacement rate.  Of course, for a minimum wage worker working a full day at &euro;56 per day of gross income, one day's wages is not even sufficient to pay for a GP visit.  Of course, there is a need to have a floor or certainly a minimum guaranteed entitlement.  Dr. Bambrick talked about the importance of consulting with the social partners and certainly from a Labour Party perspective we would very much echo and support that.  She talked about the need to consult with the social partners and to report back to the Oireachtas.  Should those details be delegated by way of that consultation and then regulation by the Minister or be hard wired into the legislation?</p></speech>

Ms McElwee highlighted much of the potential around how this Bill will interact over at least the next four years as it is gradually introduced.  It will be important to look ahead.  Hopefully, we are pre-empting much of this now.  Once this gets out into the field, many things will arise and it will be important there is an opportunity in this regard, rather than us of each separately having to lobby the Minister to say that something is an issue.  For example, we might find that some workers will be worse off than they would have been if they had got the illness benefit after day four.  We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences.  It is not the intention of congress to see employers who moved early and established good company policies being in any way penalised by this legislation.  That would be a big concern.  Equally, bogus self-employment, which was mentioned earlier, would be a concern.</p> <p>  For some people the 70% replacement rate will be a disappointment.  However, we are comparing it to the replacement rates in European countries that have had those schemes in place for decades, and some for centuries.  The schemes we are looking at today did not exist from day one.  The really important part of this legislation is it is putting in place the principle that employers are responsible for their workers for a fixed period of time if a worker is too sick to work.  We can look at tinkering around the edges and hopefully improving the scheme in terms of replacement rates, the timing and the certified and non-certified days as it progresses.  We think it is important, especially in the four years as the scheme is rolled out, that there is a commitment that the social partners will be listened to and our opinions taken into account, even if it is done through this committee.</p></speech>

They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.  I ask for their full co-operation in this regard.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  A witness giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precinct may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precinct will be asked to leave the meeting.  </p> <p>  We now move to our engagement with the Central Bank of Ireland.  On behalf of the meeting, I welcome Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, and Dr. Mark Cassidy, director of economics and statistics, and thank them for attending the meeting.  The committee is examining the issue of inflation and this is the third of three engagements on this topic.  The intention of today's engagement is to discuss drivers of inflation, policy responses, budget 2022 and the impact of inflation.  I invite Mr. Makhlouf to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#A00300"><p>Dr. Cassidy and I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the important topic of inflation.  Last year, inflation was very subdued across the euro area - even turning negative for several months as economies closed down to slow the spread of the virus.  Coinciding with the easing of health restrictions and increased economic activity, inflation turned positive again in 2021.  We know that many people are feeling these very real price increases, in particular across their energy and fuel bills.</p> <p>  Overall, increasing inflation is being driven by three factors, namely, higher energy prices, a rebound in prices for some goods and services that fell sharply during the pandemic and a rebound in demand, which is meeting global supply bottlenecks in both inputs and transportation.  At first, inflation developments in Ireland lagged behind those of the euro area due in part to a slower phased re-opening of the economy but in general, they have followed global trends over the past couple of years.  Increases in global energy prices have been a major driver of inflation in recent months with inflation reaching 5.1% in Ireland in October and 4.1% in the euro area on a year-on-year basis.  Energy prices have both a direct and indirect effect on prices people have to pay for goods and services.  The direct effects on home heating or electricity and personal transport fuels - driven in particular by changes in energy prices in international energy markets - tend to pass through quickly to consumers.  Indirect effects occur via the impact on business costs and tend to be passed on more slowly and only partly to consumers.  </p> <p>  The rise in energy price inflation during the first half of 2021 follows on from the fall in prices in 2020 at the onset of the pandemic, that is, the so-called "base effects".  Given that the prices of some goods and services fell during 2020 as governments imposed lockdowns, comparing prices from now - when economies have reopened - to last year can produce a sharp increase in measured inflation even if prices are recovering to pre-pandemic levels.  These base effects were larger for Ireland compared with some other euro area countries simply because prices fell by more in 2020 in Ireland.  However, these base effects are playing a smaller role more recently with energy price levels now exceeding those before the pandemic.  While highly volatile and often influenced by geopolitical factors, market expectations are for wholesale energy prices to plateau in 2022 before declining gradually.  </p> <p>  As well as energy prices, there are three other components of the Irish inflation index that are important to consider, namely, food, non-energy industrial goods and services.  Increases in food and goods inflation reflect the global factors I have already mentioned, namely, global supply and transport bottlenecks.  Pass-through from higher energy and input costs is also a factor and will likely continue to be so for several months yet.  </p> <p>  However, the price of services in Ireland has been increasing through the second half of 2021.  Within the services category, price increases in rents, restaurants and hotels stand out.  This is not only for the scale of the increases but also because both categories together account for almost half of all services spending.  Base effects are also relevant in these categories.  Relative to pre-pandemic levels, rents and restaurant and hotel prices are both 4.2% higher according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO.</p> <p>  While measures of inflation are designed to represent an average consumption basket in an economy, people feel the impact of inflation differently and not everyone in the community will experience price increases in the same way.  Some people will be more or less impacted by the recent bout of inflation simply because they are more or less exposed to certain price changes.  Lower-income households, older people and rural households are more affected by energy-driven inflation.  This is because it represents a larger proportion of their spending compared to other groups.  Conversely, higher-income households, younger people and more urban households tend to spend more on services.  </p> <p>  In deciding how to respond to inflation developments, monetary policymakers such as me need to consider two things.  First, what is the source of the inflation and how long is it expected to last?  Second, what is the potential for more broad-based and persistent inflation above the 2% target in the medium term?  Forecasting future economic developments is always challenging but there is a remarkable level of additional uncertainty and complexity to consider right now.  We are not in an ordinary economic environment.  </p> <p>  Our judgment today is that we expect the global drivers of current inflation to recede gradually during 2022.  On the potential for relative price changes to lead to more broad-based inflation, monetary policymakers across the world have spoken about so-called "second-round effects" from inflation into wage setting.  Recent data for the euro area does not suggest, at least thus far, that higher inflation in 2021 is feeding into broad-based higher wage demands, although the upheaval in the labour market makes it more challenging than ever to extract timely and accurate insights from the data.  </p> <p>  Monetary policy's primary effect is through the demand side of the economy.  We, therefore, need to be conscious of the effects of tightening policy when the recovery from the pandemic in the euro area remains highly uncertain and incomplete.  The wrong monetary policy action today could prove more costly than the risks stemming from the current spike in inflation.  Over the medium term, it could slow economic growth unnecessarily, which could prevent inflation reaching our target in a sustainable manner.</p><p>While lower-income households suffer more from energy-driven inflation, they are also more vulnerable to a contraction in demand that would reduce employment.  Constraining demand now to bring it back into line with what might be a transitory supply interruption would then depress incentives for supply to return.  Having said that, we cannot afford to be complacent.  We need to recognise that there are risks to the inflation outlook.  If current trends in inflation persist, the case for monetary policy action will become stronger.</p><p> Turning to other policy levers, Government decisions on expenditure and tax revenue can have an important impact on economic growth, inflation and the broader economy and labour market.  While action is needed to address infrastructure deficits in housing and to meet the challenges of climate change, any investment, given the current economic backdrop, needs to be managed carefully and accompanied, where necessary, by structural reforms to ensure that the demand it generates does not lead to excessive inflationary pressures.  Put simply, the economy as a whole does not need, nor would it benefit from, expansionary fiscal policy in the coming years.  This does not mean that targeted measures which do not add to overall demand in the economy and which offset the negative impact of current inflation on the most vulnerable are misplaced.  More generally, since Ireland is a small, open economy in the euro area, fiscal policy has an enhanced role here as the main instrument of macroeconomic stabilisation.  Dr. Cassidy and I are ready to take the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the Governor to the committee.</p> <p>  I am sure Mr. Makhlouf agrees with the statements in the economic letters from the Central Bank that the drivers of inflation are likely to dissipate over the medium term.  Will he outline to the committee the negative impacts of low or no inflation for households, businesses and the broader economy, an issue that is maybe sometimes little understood?</p></speech>

I said this in my opening statement but it is worth repeating.  The ECB's target is that we achieve 2% inflation over the medium term.  Intuitively, people ask why not less than that.  A rate of 2% reflects an assessment, based partly on historical evidence, that it is the right rate to encourage investment which promotes growth in a stable and sustainable way.  If inflation were zero or even negative, people's incentives to spend would be distorted.  They would tend not to spend, meaning that businesses would tend not to invest.  That would then result in a deflationary spiral, which, ultimately, would result in lower growth and job losses in the economy.  A rate of 2% is therefore the judgment we at the ECB have come to but it is also the level that other central banks around the world have come to as being the right amount of inflation to encourage economic growth in a stable way.</p></speech>

My position is that, on the evidence we see today, increases in interest rates are absolutely not warranted because the factors driving inflation, as I said earlier, are temporary.  In fact, increases in interest rates today would have a very negative effect on economies.  If, however, we saw the evidence change, my view is that we should respond without delay.  The fundamental response to the Deputy's question is that if the evidence changes, my view is likely to change.  Right now, however, the position we have taken is the reasonable one.  I said yesterday that I think that in these circumstances patience is a virtue.  Our position is the correct one, but we need to be vigilant because these are exceptional circumstances not just for the Irish economy and the euro area economy but also for the global economy.  We need to be vigilant, make sure we understand exactly what is happening and maintain as much optionality in our toolkit in order that we may respond in reasonable time if the facts start to change.</p></speech>

The other point was that this is more medium-term to long-term.  Is that the evidence and the facts that would need to change for Mr. Makhlouf to reconsider his position?  In what timeframe does he believe we should start to see those inflation numbers start to decrease?</p></speech>

One is if I saw what I described earlier as second round effects.  In other words, if current inflation started to feed into wages.  History has taught us that that is the beginning of a price-wage spiral.  The other set of evidence is if we started to see structural change in the way economies operated and if we started to see changes in the supply chains and the way they were working - in other words, if they were not reverting to normal but were changing in some way.  We expect that in 2022 we will start to see the current levels of inflation I mentioned earlier recede gradually.  For one thing, a number of base effects will come out of the calculation and, it is to be hoped, as 2022 proceeds we will see a number of these bottlenecks start to get repaired.  I think that next year we should see things receding.  In December, the ECB's governing council will receive the latest forecasts from ECB staff on their projections, so in about a month's time we will have much more up-to-date information on which we will make our judgments.</p></speech>

One of the factors leading into the overall inflation numbers is the issue of energy prices.  For households and families, as Mr. Makhlouf has rightly pointed out, this is probably the one they are most concerned about because they are feeling it right now and, as we go into a colder snap, people are having to heat their homes more, the bills are coming in and they are quite significant compared with what they were this time last year.  Depending on the type of fuel used or the method used to heat one's home, this is felt differently in different areas.</p><p>For example, in the Border region and the west there is an over-reliance or a reliance on home heating oil, which means two thirds of people use heating oil to heat their homes.  That is a sharper increase than what we would see with gas or electricity, although those increases are significant in themselves.  Is there any reassurance in what the Governor has seen in terms of when those numbers will start to level out or decrease? </p></speech>

First, and I do not just mean myself and Dr. Cassidy, but we at the Central Bank of Ireland and we at the European Central Bank are taking the impact of current high inflation on the purchasing power of people very seriously.  I absolutely recognise, in particular, that current high energy inflation has a negative and concerning impact on some households.</p> <p>  Let me put this in economist language.  The energy shock that we face right now is an international and a global one.  How it is going to affect particular types of energy consumption in particular parts of the country?  I am not sure whether we have enough information on that.  Certainly the whole of the industrialised world right now is facing the sort of energy shocks that we are talking about.  Does Dr. Cassidy wish to add something?</p></speech>

We are seeing price inflation in the housing market in both rental and residential properties, which is due partly to the pandemic savings being unleashed into the sector that was closed during that period.  Such inflation is also due to the undersupply of housing that spans the best part of the past decade.  There are also demand-side measures from the Government into the housing market.  For example, last year just over 12,000 homes were purchased and over 6,000 of them were through the help-to-buy scheme.  Does the Government expect this level of intervention on the demand side comprising the proportion, as it does, of new homes purchased to impact on prices?  Does he expect the same effect through the proposed share equity loan scheme that is being considered by the Central Bank?  I would appreciate any comments on that.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has talked about this over the years.  Demand-side policies can have a negative effect on inflation.  I do not have a specific number to tell the Deputy what the precise proportional balance is.  I have said in the past that the supply of housing is a challenge that we need to address in Ireland.</p> <p>  I want to make one clarification point and it is important that everybody bears this in mind.  When we talk about inflation and quote numbers about inflation, we do not include the cost of purchasing a house but we do include the impact of rents.  That is partly historical.  The ECB decided at the end of our strategy review back in July that the cost of owner-occupied housing should be included in the calculation of housing.  That is going to require the European statistical authorities to develop a process which can separate out the proportion of a house purchase that is investing in an asset and which should not be included in the measure of inflation from the consumption cost.  I mean it is a technical issue but I think it is important that everybody understands the measure of inflation at the moment.</p></speech>

In terms of energy prices, what is somewhat unusual about the current crisis is that energy prices are increasing by equally significant amounts right across the board.  It is not just fuel prices and petrol.  It is also electricity and gas.  This reflects developments in all parts of the international energy markets.  Oil prices, natural gas prices and costs of shipping transportation have increased very significantly.</p> <p>  In terms of future developments, what we can say is that futures markets indicate that there is an expectation that prices of gas and oil will begin to decline somewhere around the first quarter of next year and gradually reducing back towards pre-pandemic levels but there is enormous uncertainty.  Futures prices are the best way we have of estimating what the future paths might be but they are certainly not always right.  There is a lot of uncertainty and I think that is the most we can say.  The economic factors suggest that these temporary factors, that we can point to as causing these prices, one would expect that they would begin to gradually ease.</p></speech>

I do not wish to pile pressure on the present Governor but his predecessor made himself very available, which was always very appreciated by the committee.</p><p>I am not an economist and I focused on the Governor's paper entitled Inflation dynamics in a pandemic: maintaining vigilance and optionality, in which he fleshed out some of these issues.  I will work backwards.  Just watching some of the information anecdotally coming out of the USA, the Governor said:</p> <blockquote> 	We know the reasons underlying today&rsquo;s inflation.  We believe that those reasons mean today&rsquo;s inflation is not going to be permanent but I accept that we do not know that to the same degree... </blockquote> <p>Looking at some of the countries that have their own independent central banks that might have entered into the inflationary phase a little more quickly than we have, what can the Governor discern from that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#C01000"><p>I am delighted to appear for the first time at this committee and I will make every effort to be more available than my predecessor.</p> <p>  What can we learn from other central banks?  They are all having the same conversations as we are.  The inflationary pressures are global because the world was essentially impacted by the pandemic.  The world responded to the pandemic in similar ways.  The world is now coming out of the pandemic and is seeing the same sorts of issues around supply bottlenecks, base effects and energy prices.  On the other hand, there are important differences that we do need to bear in mind because sometimes it is too easy to say this central bank is doing this and to ask why are others not doing the same.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the United States.  One of the, in my view, important differences between the euro area and the United States is the US's fiscal response to the pandemic.  There has been a very significant fiscal impulse that is playing a role in their current inflation numbers.  Although it is fair to say that in Europe there has also been a very significant fiscal policy response, it has not on the same scale as we have seen in the United States.</p> <p>  Another important difference, which is perhaps a bit more technical but is worth bearing in mind, is that the Federal Reserve has got a slightly different mandate to that of the ECB.  So the ECB's primary objective is price stability and it has the secondary objective to support the policies of the EU without prejudice to price stability.</p><p>The Federal Reserve's mandate is both price stability and maximum sustainable employment.  The Federal Reserve has adopted a policy of average inflation targeting, which is different from the ECB's.  It means that they are more tolerant of overshooting their 2% target in order to help them achieve their maximum sustainable employment objective.  I mention that simply to just bring out the way the Federal Reserve responds, or will respond, to the current inflation pressures may be slightly different from the way the ECB would respond.  This reflects the differences in the mandate and also the more substantive differences in the underlying dynamics. </p></speech>

It came to a real head during the financial crisis, but that is perhaps for another day.</p> <p>  In this paper Mr. Makhlouf suggests that if inflation was to persist then the case for monetary policy action becomes stronger.  What kinds of tools are at the ECB's disposal?  We do not have any at own individual disposal, or do we?  Would there be budgetary options there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#D00300"><p>Monetary policy is done at the ECB.  We are part of a single currency union.  Our preferred tool is interest rates.  We can raise our interest rates if inflation is persisting, and we can lower our interest rates if the opposite is happening.  As Deputy Doherty said earlier, inflation in the euro area has been below target since the financial crisis, and unusually for a central bank we have been trying to increase inflation for the past decade.  Somewhat paradoxically, the current state of inflation is moving things in the direction we want to go, even though the rates are actually higher than we would like them to be.  Using interest rates has been a problem for us over the past decade because, for a variety of reasons, inflation was so low that interest rates have been operating at what we would call the effective lower bound.  At the ECB they are in negative territory.  When interest rates are at those low levels they are not very powerful so we had to develop a different set of tools to use.  </p> <p>  I will outline some of the tools we use.  We purchase assets such as bonds, which is known in some parts of the world as quantitative easing, QE.  We have asset purchase programmes, and we also have interest rates as part of our toolkit.  At the start of the pandemic we increased our asset purchase programme by putting in place an emergency programme, PEP, to cope with the crisis.  They are our first two tools.  The third tool is forward guidance.  We guide the market and help to manage inflation expectations through giving forward guidance to markets, which then feeds through to the economy.  Finally, we have dedicated loan arrangements where we make available to banks, at preferential rates, money that they can then lend on in the economy to promote growth.  That suite of tools is available to us.  Our preferred tool is interest rates, but currently and in recent years it has been more difficult to use.  If inflation persists and is no longer temporary, we would be looking at the whole of that toolkit.  The likelihood is that we would probably reduce our asset purchases before we increase interest rates.</p></speech>

I like the introductory comment he made in this paper when he said "all financial crises are alike but an economic crisis is unique in its own fashion".  How far behind do wage inflation pressures come?  Is there a rough point in the economic cycle, that Mr. Makhlouf has seen before, whereby inflation manifests itself into wage inflation demands and materialises into wage demands?  Is there a formula for how far behind it lags?</p></speech>

The reality is that the institutional framework we have in place today, at central banks and in the way wages are set, is quite different from what it was 40 years ago when central banks had less independence and where wages were set in different ways.  I am aware that increasingly a lot of people cannot remember the 1970s, but some of us can.  In the 1970s there was a much quicker response between inflation being seen and wages being increased to compensate for them.  As a result, we had that sort of close connection, such as I described earlier with a price-wage spiral.  Central banks did not respond fast enough, or I should say that monetary policy did not respond fast enough, to deal with that.  With the world we are now in, however, central banks have independence to deal with that.  Partly because we have had such low inflation for such a long time there is less of that sort of connection between inflation appearing and wages responding immediately to it.</p> <p>  Monetary policy itself, the raising and lowering of interest rates, has quite a lag before it has an effect.  If for some reason we woke up tomorrow and came to the view that actually inflation was going to persist, some of the actions we take now would take some time to feed through.  Perhaps Dr. Cassidy will talk about what sort of evidence there is, to respond to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mark Cassidy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#D00600"><p>Since the financial crisis we have seen very modest developments in terms of wage increases.  The wage increases we have seen in recent years are very welcome because when an economy is growing it is important that the benefits of that growth are spread across the economy.  Wage increases are good thing.  We would be concerned if wage increases across the economy as a whole are increasing faster than productivity is increasing.  This means that firms are increasingly getting into a loss-making position.  We are not seeing that at the moment.  We are seeing that wage increases are quite strong in those sectors that are performing best and in those sectors that are most productive, and in those sectors therefore that are able to afford it.  Those sectors include business and financial services, construction, and IT services.</p><p>We still have one single labour market in the economy.  If wage pressures in those sectors that are best performing become generalised and we start seeing wages picking up across the economy as a whole, then those parts of the economy that are not doing as well become unaffordable and the only way they can react is to push prices further up.  That is what leads to this wage-price spiral and that is where we would become concerned.  We are not seeing evidence of that at present.  There is no fixed timeframe when wages increase.  Indeed, it is not automatically the case that higher prices lead to higher wages.  What we would be looking out for, more than anything else, is when we start seeing wage pressures across an intensive labour services sector, such as hospitality.  That is when the risk for the economy as a whole is that those wage increases are too much.  We are not seeing that at the moment.  It is something we and other countries and policymakers will certainly be keeping an eye on in the coming years.</p></speech>

It is important to have this type of engagement and I appreciate their time, as do all the other members.  As a small businessperson, as well as a politician, I like to think that I and my other colleagues are acutely attuned to the world of finance and the different pressures and complexities that it brings.  As a person who has been borrowing money since I was 18 or 19 years of age, I am becoming acutely aware of how difficult it is, even for an established person, to borrow money and have access to funds.</p> <p>  I judge everything by how I see it and what I see going on close to me.  If a person such as me and my close friends locally are having difficulty in accessing borrowed funds, not massive but ordinary amounts of money, where does that leave the young couple of today?  That is the young boy or girl who is making friends or starting out on his or her own or as part of a couple and looking to borrow to try to get on the property ladder or to get a loan for a small or medium sized business to get a bit of a leg up.  If what I would call established people find it difficult, how in the name of God will young people find it?  How are they supposed to manage?  How are they supposed to get on in life?</p> <p>  As a politician, I feel so bad every day that young people are being held back and not being given the opportunity.  Everybody talks about how bad the 1980s and 1990s were, but at that time people could walk into a bank, look at a bank manager and sell themselves the bank manager, if the witnesses know what I mean.  Bank managers had autonomy to lend if they liked the look of someone and thought that person was a worker who would knuckle down in life and do what needed to be done to get on.  When I say "get on", I do not mean anything big or fancy but getting on in paying a mortgage.  Is that not a great achievement for a young couple?  That is getting on.</p> <p>  However, so many obstacles are being put in the way of young people today.  When I meet people in banking circles and in that way of life, the first thing I always ask is what in the name of God they are doing with all the money.  Why are bankers not being more understanding?  Why are Governments not doing more?  It could be said that that is our job, but I like to think people from all parties, be it Sinn F&eacute;in, or all the other people doing a lot of work in housing and the banking sector - I heard Deputy Doherty speaking earlier on and asking questions - are really putting their shoulder to the wheel.  Many politicians are pulling their weight, but I would love to think the banks are pulling their weight and I would like to think the banks' hearts are in the right place in supporting our young people.</p> <p>  If we give young people a chance and give them a loan or mortgage when they are looking for one, of course things might not work out for some people and they will fail, but businesses fail.  Individuals do not have the luxury of not failing either.  Things can go wrong in anybody's life, but I would like to think of people being given the chance.  All I want for the young boys and girls of today is for them to be given an opportunity and that we have a banking sector that is kind and understanding.  I also want a Government that would be kind and understanding to young people.  We only get one chance at life.  We only get to live once and I want people to have the same opportunities.</p> <p>  I do not want it to be the case that people have to be awful lucky to get on.  It should not be that way.  If people are determined and knuckle down to the job of living, they should be given the same opportunities as everybody else.  It is up to them then to make their way.  Banks play a significant role in people's lives.  Can we imagine the young 18 or 19-year old of today getting scrubbed up and walking into the bank, asking for the manager and saying he or she wanted a loan?  For God's sake, the manager would not talk to him or her.  The manager will hardly talk to us, never mind a young person starting out.</p> <p>  The Chairperson knows I do not ever want to rabbit on.  I just want to make my little point.  That is all.  I hope I am making it as clear as I can.  I ask that young people be given a chance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#E00400"><p>I am not sure there is a precise question.  I completely sympathise with the Deputy's sentiments.  Certainly, the banking system in Ireland is in a much better plan than where it was a decade ago, although, to a certain extent, it is still repairing itself.  We still have, for example, long-term mortgage arrears that are a problem for the system.</p> <p>  If the Deputy is talking about housing and the mortgage measures in particular, it is very familiar territory.  Tomorrow, I will be announcing the conclusions of our latest annual review of the mortgage measures.  We are in the middle of a pretty significant review of the entire framework, which will conclude next year, on the mortgage measures.  As I have said in the past, as far as housing is concerned, the fundamental issue there is the supply of housing, as opposed to the availability of finance.</p> <p>  In terms of lending to small businesses, we have not seen any evidence to say that banks are short of money to lend.  I would expect that if someone has a good business proposition, and I have no doubt the Deputy has lots of them, he or she will get a positive reaction from his or her bank manager.  However, I completely understand the housing challenge, if that was the Deputy's particular focus.  That is a significant issue, but its solution is not in the availability of credit but the supply of housing.</p></speech>

It is interesting to listen to the way the conversations have been going.  The first area I want to touch on is inflation and inflationary effects.  We have an unprecedented set of circumstances, worldwide, as well as an unprecedented domestic situation.  We have been saying that the common view on this is that it is a blip in that the current inflation is abnormal and will settle down again, it is hoped, in time.</p><p>After what amount of time would Mr. Makhlouf get worried that this is more of a sustained increase in the inflation rate?  Would it be six months or a year?  I refer in particular to the cost of living and how people's spending power is being eroded by inflation. </p><p> I am also concerned that inflation is eroding the results we will get from the capital projects we hope to deliver over the next ten years under the national development plan.  Shorter lengths of road or rail line will be built for the amount of money we will have.  If things keep going the way they are going for another six months, a year or two years, at what point would the Central Bank decide it needed to have another look at the matter?  At the moment, the Central Bank is observing.  Patience is one thing but this will have to be reviewed.</p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae was talking about mortgages and young people.  As a result of inflation and the cost of building homes, they are out of the reach of most people.  I refer to young people and first-time buyers.  Homes are partly out of their reach because of the limit on what they can borrow, which is based on their salaries or wages.  I believe the limit is three and a half times their salary.  In many cases, they will fall short of being able to buy a normal house.  I will ask for the witness's opinion on a matter.  The credit union movement holds a massive amount of people's savings but cannot spend it.  The banks are charging credit unions because they need to keep a certain amount in reserve in the banks.  The banks are holding their money and charging them for that.  Would we be better off trying to make the credit union movement a third force in banking for mortgages for first-time buyers?  Should we try to get something going there?  I know the overall principle is that you can borrow as much as you can afford to pay back but we have created some anomalies and some people are trapped.  They are saving money and doing everything right but when they think they have a mortgage sorted out, the price jumps again because of the lack of supply and moves out of reach again.</p><p> I would like the Central Bank's comments on all of that.  I hope I have been coherent.  This is all in my head and I am trying to get it out.</p></speech>

I will take his questions in turn.  To put it in my own terms, the first question was about how long it would be before I would get worried and feel that we needed to act, that is, how long would inflation have to continue at these levels for me to get worried?  I am worried today.  I am not complacent about this.  I am very conscious that inflation is impacting on households across the country today.  On the other hand, it is not so much a question of a certain amount of time before we feel we need to take action.  However, it is fair to say that the longer inflation persists at these levels, the more likely it is that this will start feeding into wages and having other second-round effects.  For me, it would matter more to see evidence that supply blockages were being repaired and falls in energy prices.</p> <p>  With regard to the supply blockages, there is a sort of consensus that these are blockages as opposed to structural changes.  If I may expand a little bit on the supply blockage issue, they are essentially a reflection of a very big increase in demand around the world as a result of restrictions being lifted.  Growth in Ireland, in the euro area and around the world has increased significantly over recent months because restrictions were lifted.  That has led to a big demand.  People had been saving during the pandemic and have now decided to spend their savings.  They have started to spend them either on consumer goods or on services, that is, going out to restaurants and the like.  That very significant increase in demand has put pressure on supply.  This would have happened in an ordinary situation if demand had increased by as much as it has but, in the meantime, a lot of the supply chains closed down because of the pandemic.  They have had to reopen, which has taken time.  Famously, many of the ships that transport goods from Asia to the United States or Europe are in the wrong place.  It takes time for them to get rearranged and ready to transport goods.  </p> <p>  If, as we hope, we begin to see evidence that those sorts of supply blockages are being repaired, in some respects, it will not matter whether it takes four months or a year.  If they are being repaired, we know that they will subside.  For example, we know that there is a big shortage of semiconductors.  This is affecting car manufacture but also the production of white goods like fridges and so on.  This shortage is likely to persist for much of 2022.  However, we also know that the supply of semiconductors will come on stream.  That is a question of timing.  It is not simple to say how long this would have to go on for before I would start to worry.  It is more the case that, if I see evidence that these blockages are not being fixed or that different things are happening, I would start to worry.  However, I am worried today.  I hope that I will be a lot better informed in a few months' time because we will have seen more evidence.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point on housing, I hope he will forgive me because I have forgotten the overall question.  I recall him asking whether credit unions could be a third force.  There is no reason why credit unions could not play a role in the system.  On the other hand, the biggest players in terms of lending money and providing mortgages are the big banks because they have the asset base to do that.  The focus of the Central Bank is always going to be on making sure that the system works in a stable way and that reckless lending and reckless borrowing are avoided, as I have said in the past.  That is a particular focus of ours.  We do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past.  I do not know if there is anything Dr. Cassidy wants to add on that particular point.</p></speech>

The Deputy made a very important point about the effect of inflationary pressures on the delivery of the national development plan and ensuring that we get our money's worth in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, what is planned in terms of capital investment in the coming decade is extremely significant.</p><p>Capital spending will be increased to very high levels, which we think is very welcome, in order to address the infrastructure and housing deficits that currently exist, to meet our climate change targets and to enhance productivity.  The challenge that Deputy Canney is alluding to is that we are already seeing inflationary pressures in this sector and rising construction costs, tender prices, labour shortages and levels of demand.  The challenge over the next decade will be to get the most out of the money that we are spending in this area.  That is something we also need to monitor.</p><p> I will mention a number of things in this regard.  First, the construction sector and the housing sector in particular will undoubtedly need significant additional labour over the period.  An important element is how the economy can attract that labour.  Estimates are for perhaps an additional 30,000 to 40,000 workers.  It will not be as easy to attract labour from abroad, for example, in construction as it was in the 2000s when wages here were much higher than in some other countries.  Second, the level of productivity in the sector is particularly low and lags behind that some other countries.  In order to deliver successfully on those plans, that productivity deficit will need to be addressed.  Third, we will need to manage delivery and ensure that cost overruns are limited.  If we are to get the most bang for our buck in capital delivery, those are the three things I would point to.  If they can be achieved, then what has been proposed is very welcome and necessary for this economy.</p></speech>

Across most industries, we expect that to increase over time as technology improves, for example, where one gets more per unit of worker.  In the construction sector, that rate of increase has been typically very low and has lagged behind increases in other countries.  What we mean here is how much we can produce for a given labour supply because the labour supply is necessarily somewhat limited.</p></speech>

I think there are others who speak better to this.  This is not something that we have looked at in detail.  There are suggestions out there where some of the other institutions have looked at our construction sector in more detail.

From our perspective, the framework review of the mortgage measures that we have under way is going to be comprehensive and will look to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question as best we can.

We will not help young people if we increase the amount of debt we give them.</p></speech>

I hope they are enjoying their first time before us.  I am sure that they will be rushing to come back again.</p><p>I have a number of questions.  I am quite interested in the comments made by the Governor in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  They struck a somewhat different note from what we have heard from Philip Lane when it comes to the need for interest rate increases.  I would like to tease that out with our witnesses if I may.  It is something more of a hawkish position whereby Mr. Makhlouf said today that we should not hesitate to increase interest rates if inflation persists.  I am interested because, from my understanding of this, we can see that current inflation is arising as a result of two main factors, one of which is energy prices.  Much of that is due to the geopolitical factors in respect of Saudi Arabia and Russia reducing oil and gas supplies in their own interests.  There is also the reopening of the supply chains that is currently under way.  It will take time but it is happening nonetheless.</p><p>I am very interested in hearing the bank&rsquo;s views as to how it feels that an interest rate rise could have an effect on those things.  Would it not be worried in any sense that it could create risks and could stymie the recovery and potentially even create stagflation?  I thank the Chair.  That is my first question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#G01300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her question. I do not think that there are any differences between Mr. Philip Lane and me on the question of raising interest rates now.  I spoke to him, I believe, last week.  I still think that that is the right position.  If the Deputy reads the remarks I made yesterday, I hope that they are a little bit clearer than the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i>perhaps was.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, increasing interest rates today would be a mistake.  On the evidence that we have today, and I emphasise and underline the word &ldquo;today&rdquo;, the factors that are driving inflation and the answer to them is not to raise interest rates because that would impact the recovery, slow down economic growth, have consequences for employment and, ultimately, have the completely opposite effect to the one that we would want.  Mr. Lane and I would completely agree on that.<br/><br/>What I have been saying is that we need to be vigilant.  If we take a step back, we are in a pretty unique situation today, not just in Ireland or the euro area but in much of the developed world.  We went into an exceptional economic shock in March 2020 when governments decided to close down both demand and supply across the world, and did so voluntarily.  I remember saying at the time that I could not find an example in history of that having happened before.  I do not believe that that particular situation has happened before.  That unique situation is reflected in the world that we are in today, which is that we are coming out of this pandemic, which was a unique experience, and the way we are doing that is putting unusual pressures around economic activity, whether it is the supply bottlenecks that we have discussed or the sudden increase in demand that is being experienced.  As I said earlier, we see those factors as temporary.  The right response, therefore, is patience.  If we are right, we will see those pressures recede.  The wrong response today would be to increase rates.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if the evidence we see starts to suggest that there are structural changes happening to economies that are going to see inflation persisting, or if we see the current temporary inflation start feeding into wage pressures which are not supported by productivity increases, we will then be exposed to a wage price spiral and to inflation persisting and becoming more permanent.</p><p>What I have been saying, and what I said yesterday, which <i>The Irish Times</i>reported today, is that we need to be vigilant about the circumstances we are in, pay very close attention to the evidence and respond without delay if we see that evidence changing.  That is the sort of point I have been making.  People will make similar arguments in different ways and there will be different points of emphasis.  Reference was made to Mr. Philip Lane.  He and I may have different points of emphasis but we are pretty aligned on the fundamentals, as is the governing council of the European Central Bank, ultimately.</p></speech>

I just saw what <i>The Irish Times</i>has reported.  I know I am sometimes quoted in a way that differs from my remarks.  I will have a good read of the article.</p><p>My next question is on the high prevalence of so-called zombie companies across the EU and on how a significant interest rate increase could impact them and, by extension, the wider EU economy.  Obviously, increasing interest rates makes it increasingly difficult for them and jeopardises their solvency.  I am aware that the French bank Natixis estimates that the proportion of zombie companies has risen from 3.5% at the beginning of the 1990s to close to 21% in 2019.  The research carried out, including research by the <i>Financial Times,</i>indicates one fifth of Europe's corporate landscape may now be zombified, but that research was all carried out before the pandemic.  If more than one fifth of those in Europe's corporate sector were zombified before the pandemic, it seems likely, and it would not be a massive leap of faith to believe, that this proportion has increased.  In this regard, I am wondering about two points.  How many of the so-called zombie companies do the witnesses believe are in Ireland's corporate sector?  From the point of view of financial stability and employment, what would be the implications of a sharp interest rate increase for those companies and the wider economy?  My questions are slightly hypothetical, but it would be quite interesting to hear the delegates' views on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#H00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will ask Dr. Cassidy to respond in case he knows some of the specific answers.  I am not on top of the number of so-called zombie firms in Ireland.</p> <p>  There is a related, but slightly separate, relevant point that is worth making.  Many firms and households have benefited from Government supports over the past 20 months or so.  We have been asking what the impact would be if those supports were withdrawn because, in theory, a withdrawal would give the first sign as to whether so-called zombie firms have been surviving only on Government supports.  Their failure will be the first indication we will have.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that if we increased interest rates, it would have a direct effect on the cost of funding businesses.  Those that are not profitable would be impacted.  To repeat what I said earlier, we are not in the business of raising interest rates right now.  The need to withdraw Government supports is a more realistic proposition.  I can comment on the financial stability implications.  We will be talking about this more tomorrow when we publish our latest financial stability review.  Essentially, the Irish financial system went into one of the biggest economic shocks that it has had for a very long time when it was in a fairly robust position and fairly robust health.  The evidence over the past 20 months has been that the Irish financial system has benefited from the repair work it has had to undergo over the past decade and survived the most extreme effects of the shock.  The economy is now coming out of the depths it was in.  The big financial institutions are in a robust enough position to manage the withdrawal of supports that is ahead.  The position on interest rates is a bit more complicated because we are speculating as to what may happen a bit further down the line.</p></speech>

The Governor makes an important distinction between firms that are non-viable but kept alive because of the low interest rate environment prior to the pandemic, which the Deputy described as &ldquo;zombies&rdquo;, and firms that became reliant on Government supports during the pandemic.  With regard to the former, there are other countries in Europe that are more exposed.  I do not have a number to give the Deputy but our analysis shows there would not be many non-viable firms coming into this crisis.  The Deputy referred to a sharp increase in interest rates.  Even when interest rates begin to normalise, nobody will be expecting a sharp, significant effect so much as a gradual return to normal.  Therefore, I do not think the effect would be too significant.  It can be economically damaging.  In Japan we saw the concept of evergreening.  Interest rates have been so low for so long that many non-viable firms have been kept alive when they would not otherwise have been able to do so.  That prevents new firms from developing.  It is quite a negative economic development.</p> <p>  With regard to the pandemic, the view right across Europe is that when government supports are reduced, some firms may not survive.  The numbers are expected to be much lower than we might have expected a year ago.  The evidence right across Europe, including in affected countries such as Italy and France, shows that while some may be affected, the number will be much lower than expected.  The economies are coming out of this in a stronger position than was previously expected.  There is uncertainty but the outlook is not as bad as we might have expected a while ago.</p></speech>

I thank them for their briefing and the overview.  Many of the points I was hoping to make have come up already in various shapes.  If the witnesses bear with me, however, I might refer to a couple of different angles.  They are saying they feel that there will not be longer-term inflation so much as more short-term inflation, that patience will be the big ingredient and that if the data change and inflation looks like it will be more long term, we should be able to move on it at that stage.  What tools do they envisage being used?  What kinds of triggers do they foresee and what data do they expect to see changing?  I realise the witnesses have mentioned wages, but we have already seen wage increases in the tech sector as a direct result of being able to work from home.  In construction, there have already been wage increases.</p><p>I am trying to figure what the Governor sees as the triggers, if any, down the road and what kind of tools he would act with at that stage.</p><p> I have three or four questions.  The capital plan will be a big driver of spending in housing, transport and various different infrastructure.  The Governor is concerned about the size of the spend and how it might impact on inflation.  How would the Governor handle it and at the same time ensure that there is an adequate spend on housing, transport and all those different key projects?</p><p> The Governor is talking about the wrong measures having a significant impact now.  What would the Governor consider to be the wrong measures?</p><p> Finally, the cost of housing has considerably increased, whether you are buying or renting, and it is a sizeable component of inflation.  It is a reasonable aspiration of people to be able to buy their own home.  Raising the deposit and at the same time paying rent is a significant blockage for people - a real struggle.  Would the Governor see a situation where the ability to pay rent would be seen as proof of ability to repay a mortgage and be considered as part of the assessment?  The Governor has referred to the supply as playing a big part in addressing housing but irrespective of how much supply is there, that issue will be there for younger couples, single people or whoever wants to borrow money.  I would be interested to hear the Governor's views on seeing if there is a way to consider the ability to save while they are paying rent.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Cassidy to pick up the capital plan questions.  All I will say on that is I am not only worried about the size of spend.  I am also worried about how it is spent.  However, I will leave that to Dr. Cassidy to talk about.</p> <p>  On the wrong measures, to answer that question first, the wrong measure to tackle inflation today would be to raise interest rates today.  That would be top of the list of wrong measures.  Raising interest rates today would have a negative effect on the recovery and it would lead to job losses and business failures.  It would put the whole of the recovery at risk.  That would be the wrong thing to do today in response to what we are seeing.</p> <p>  On raising interest rates, to turn to the Deputy's question about the tools if we saw inflation persisting, raising interest rates is the biggest part of our toolkit.  However, if we were faced with that sort of decision what we would probably do - certainly, what I would want us to do, and this is for discussion with all my colleagues at the ECB - is reduce our asset purchase programme first before we raised interest rates.  Fundamentally, it would have a similar effect of tightening policy and having a direct impact on demand.  </p> <p>  Someone used the word "stagflation" earlier in one of the questions and I did not respond to that directly.  We are not in the stagflation situation that we were in the 1970s.  There is genuine growth happening, both in Ireland and in Europe and around the world.  It may be slightly dampened in the near term because of the re-emergence of restrictions, etc., but there is real growth.  In the 1970s, the "stag" bit reflected stagnation and we are not in a stagnation sort of world right now.  We have the tools to deal with inflation.</p> <p>  I completely understand Deputy Aindrias Moynihan's point on housing and rents and deposits.  It is one of the questions we are considering in our review of the mortgage measures framework which will not be concluded until next year but I am aware of it.  Fundamentally, we are not trying to stop people from being in a position to put a deposit down.  What we are trying to prevent, as I stated earlier, is reckless lending and borrowing, but how the rules interact with supply being constrained and rental prices as they are is something I absolutely recognise.  It is an issue.  One of the answers I can give to the Deputy's direct question is that banks or lenders have the flexibility today to consider the reliability of the borrower.  If they have a track record that they have been paying X amount in rent, banks have the flexibility to take that into account in their decision-making and to use the flexibility they have to lend above the restrictions as part of that.  Leaving that aside, I completely understand the Deputy's point.  That is an issue that we are thinking about very carefully.</p></speech>

It is a welcome opportunity to address the infrastructure deficit in this country to increase housing supply and to meet our climate change targets.</p> <p>  The concern the Deputy is alluding to is a very real one and involves a significant sharp increase in the rate of capital spending.  The concern there is that the additional demand feeds through to higher prices as opposed to what you are trying to achieve.  That is something that needs to be monitored.  The timing or phasing in of the plan currently seems appropriate.  If you were to see excess inflationary pressures, if you were to see private sector construction, for example, being squeezed out by the extension of public sector, then you may need to look at the phasing or timing of some of that delivery but that is not something that we are projecting or forecasting at present.  However, it will be necessary to attract more labour into the sector.  It is necessary to look at the productivity of the construction sector, particularly to ensure that we are getting value for money and the economy can control the costs of these massive infrastructure projects.  If that can be achieved, this will have a very welcome effect on the productive capacity of the economy and some of the societal needs in terms of housing and infrastructure.</p> <p>  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan also mentioned wages and referred to some sectors.  I would say the Deputy is absolutely right.  The Deputy identified some of the sectors where wages are increasing quite rapidly at present.  We can identify those sectors as the ones which are experiencing the tightest labour market conditions and finding it most difficult to attract workers.  What we are not seeing yet is that becoming generalised across the economy.  At present, high wage increases are in a few fast-growing sectors - the Deputy mentioned information technology, IT, and construction, and there is also financial business services - rather than across all parts of the economy.</p></speech>

During the previous two sessions on inflation, we heard that the expectation that this inflation will last for a short period.  Hopefully, it will ease over the next year.  However, we are all mindful that the pandemic is unprecedented and we are really not sure how it will play out.  I am interested in the Central Bank's longer paper on the aspects that could impact inflation in the longer term.  I particularly wanted to ask about reshoring or the shortening of the length of supply chain, partly because often in my area of politics, we talk about local supply chains and community wealth.  Could the witnesses expand on the downsides, possible threats to reshoring or disruption and changes to supply chains and the impact of this in the longer term?  Is it a consideration or worry that is being raised regularly in the Central Bank's conversations with the ECB?  I know there have been a number of policy papers or research on whether there should be a move towards reshoring that have covered particular sectors such as medical products.  Could the witnesses unpack that for me?  Do they see reshoring and that longer supply chain issue as major concerns?  Do they believe the EU will move towards any particular policy position on that?  I know we have talked about the US and economic protectionism but my question relates more to security of supply chains.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.303" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#K00200"><p>It is a fascinating issue and a very big question.  The Chairman asked me if I was worried.  I am not worried about changes in supply chains as a concept.  I would be interested in understanding what those changes were before I could comment on whether they are positive.  What I put in my paper yesterday is that there is a change in sentiment, certainly in recent years, compared to the previous 20 years, when the question of where manufacturing or production took place was driven quite a bit by cost considerations.  In recent years, partly because of economic nationalism, as the Chairman described, but also because some countries have started to think through their security needs, countries have started to reconsider their supply chains.  The pandemic has changed that dynamic in another way.  The Chairman mentioned medical supplies.  The world is probably in a bit of a state of flux, which complicates the work of a monetary policymaker as we try to understand how our economy is adjusting not just to these questions of strategy, and within the EU, we talk about open strategic autonomy, but also about the developments in technology, digitalisation, 3-D printing and changes in consumer preferences and wants.  All these things will play out over the coming years and will have an effect on economies and the way they work and interact.  What the Central Bank and the ECB need to do is make sure we keep up to speed with those sorts of developments so that we are ready to respond to what are fundamental changes but I would not say today that we are concerned about reshoring.  It is more a reflection that if that sort of structural change starts to happen, it will have effects on the way economies work and we want to make sure we understand that in case it has particular effects we need to take account of in our monetary policymaking.</p> <p> The Chairman did not mention the question of climate change.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#K00500"><p>Well the pandemic has been a pre-play of what we expect to see from climate change.  It has disrupted supply chains and made us look at our systems.  I wonder if the issue of reshoring is directly related to this considering that in the past number of weeks, we have seen a province in Canada almost cut off from the rest of the country due to climate events.  Are those two issues linked?  Considering we look at medium- to long-term budgetary issues in this committee, what does the ECB consider to be the timeline for those issues to have a significant impact?  Is it five or ten years?  We were talking about economic modelling.  It is such a dynamic situation and so difficult to assess how it will play out.  Is it possible to do sufficient economic modelling on those impacts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021112400002#K00600"><p>The key is in the word "sufficient".  I suspect that we will never be able to do sufficient economic modelling but I am pretty sure we can do a lot more and better economic modelling as we gather more and better evidence and develop better understanding.  The ECB's position on climate change, which I endorse 100%, is that it is probably the single most significant change to the way economies work in the future.  We reviewed our entire strategy and concluded the review last July.  We decided as part of that review to have a specific climate change action plan, which is pretty comprehensive.  Fundamentally, it is about understanding what changes will happen to economies and the implications of those changes for the way economies work and, therefore, the job we have at the ECB, which is to maintain price stability.  It obviously has implications for financial stability among other things.  I told colleagues at the Central Bank yesterday that if we are going to achieve zero emissions by 2050, and 2050 is less time away than when Jack Charlton took the team to Italia 90, and fundamentally change our economy to achieve net zero, it will involve significant change.  I do not know what that change will be.  I can see it happening around me.  It is not that long ago that the notion of buying an electric car was slightly ridiculous because it could only travel 100 metres.  This is changing and changing very fast.</p><p>However, that sort of change will have to be comprehensive across economies if the net-zero emissions target is to be met.  It will have implications for the way the ECB works, understands the economy and sets interest rates and monetary policy.</p><p> It is a significant area of work for us.  Just a couple of weeks ago, I wrote to the chairman and chief executive of every regulated financial service provider saying that the Central Bank had certain expectations of how they would manage climate change risk and that it was something on which we would focus.  I also told them that we were going to set up a climate change forum because many of these challenges are new and we need to work on them together with as many players in the economy as possible.  I am glad that this committee is thinking about the medium to long term because these are significant issues for everyone.</p></speech>

Now that the Greens have entered government in Germany, I hope that the pace of change will increase even further.</p> <p>  A banking review was announced this week.  Obviously, the Central Bank will play an important part in that.  The three issues I wish to ask about are inflation and whether that will be on the agenda; access to credit; and whether Mr. Makhlouf envisages green products forming part of the review and how to achieve change in that regard.</p></speech>

I would be surprised if the review looked at inflation.  I do not believe that is within the review's terms of reference, although the Chair would have to ask the Department.  I expect that the issue of access to credit will feature in the review in some way.  In all fairness, though, I cannot speak for the banking review led by the Department.</p></speech>

What is the Governor's perspective on the issue of post offices and credit unions and what role does he see them fulfilling?  Both have good networks.  Post offices are under pressure.  An Post has already gone into banking to some extent, but the credit unions not as much.  We have had an incomplete discussion about the role of credit unions and post offices in an integrated system.  I am not referring to the Sparkasse model or whatever.  Can Mr. Makhlouf envisage an enhanced role for credit unions and post offices in delivering banking and financial services the length and breadth of Ireland?</p></speech>

In some respects, they already play a role.  The interesting question for us all is what consumers want.  Their preferences have clearly been changing in recent years and I suspect that the banking review will examine that.  To a large extent, the question of what the people of Ireland want from their financial service providers will determine the shape of banking with a small "b" in future.  Right now, I believe that diversity in service provision, be it through An Post, credit unions or the large retail banks, is a positive.  I expect that this will be a discussion point over the coming months as the review takes off.</p></speech>

We are getting many queries on the ground about the lack of availability of insurance cover.  This has to do with licences because, to operate in this jurisdiction, a provider must go through the Central Bank.  Has the Central Bank received many applications from people to set up as insurance companies?  How will that market develop?</p> <p>  Two components arise.  First, many service providers for the non-mainstream areas of leisure and so forth have pulled out of the market and have not been replaced, for example, Zavarovalnica Sava.  Second, many companies are approaching their annual renewal dates at the end of December, since insurance is normally organised on a calendar year basis.  It will probably only be for a certain time but many insurance brokers have told me that they are sometimes finding it difficult to get cover, even for mainstream businesses.  This is down to managing risk, Brexit and whether that is a real or illusionary factor, and particular underwriters pulling out of the market.  Is the Central Bank engaging with underwriters in the UK?  Many underwriters in the Irish market are from the UK.</p> <p>  Mr. Makhlouf might give me his perspective on this issue, which is being raised frequently.</p></speech>

I was not announcing any new departure at all.  I said two things.  What I said was lenders have the flexibility to lend above the restrictions because of the allowance system that we have.  Lenders need to make decisions based partly on their own assessment of risk or their own credit risk policies.  There is nothing preventing them from considering the potential borrowers track record in making that decision.</p></speech>

The other thing that I said was that I was very conscious of the issue that I was asked about earlier, which is the challenge that potential borrowers have to save for a deposit when they are renting.  That interaction is something we are giving careful consideration to in our review of the overall mortgage measures framework that we are doing but I will not announce anything on that tomorrow.  We will conclude that next year.</p> <p>  As far as the shared equity scheme, I invite the committee to read the material we publish tomorrow.</p></speech>

Has that flexibility being used?  Have figures been collated on where that flexibility is being used?   I ask because many people have told me that they do not feel that there is any flexibility being exercised when they deal with lenders.  Maybe some data has come back to the Central Bank that he might be able to share with us.</p></speech>

It is expected that inflation will level off somewhat as we come towards the end of the year and the beginning of next year.  What issues are most likely to contribute to inflation?  What issues are most likely to contribute to the reverse?</p></speech>

Inflation right now, today, is being driven by three things.  It is being driven by what we call base effect, which is just the statistical phenomenon of the way inflation is measured looking back 12 months.  The reality is that 12 months ago prices fell everywhere as we were in the middle of the pandemic.  We are now coming out of the pandemic and out of restrictions.  That measurement process is feeding into the calculation of a number that we are seeing.</p> <p>  Second, inflation right now is the result of supply chain blockages.  With the restrictions having been lifted, we have had a significant increase in demand and supply has struggled to meet that increased demand.  This is partly because of very practical things as I mentioned earlier.  Container ships are in the wrong places to transport goods from Asia here, for example.  This is also partly because of the sheer scale of demand on the part of consumers.</p> <p>  Finally, inflation right now is being driven by an increase in energy prices.  All of these are affecting the whole world to some extent or another.  Over the next 12 months we see those pressures dissipating.  So the base effects or measurement point will probably be the first to start to be seen because it will fall out of the calculation.  Hopefully, we expect supply chains to get back to some sort of normality and to certainly work in a way that meets demand.  We see a consequent impact as well on energy prices.</p> <p>  Essentially, we see current inflation beginning to dissipate from the start of next year and slowly be seen throughout 2022.  If supply chains do not get repaired, for example, then obviously that prevents normality and that may have an impact on how long inflation persists.  Certainly, it is not going to disappear overnight.</p></speech>

I dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire t&aacute; c&uacute;pla l&iacute;ne le r&aacute; agam ar cheist na pribhl&eacute;ide agus ruda&iacute; eile.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to deal with the issue of privilege and with some housekeeping matters.  I welcome Mr. Olli Ruutu, deputy chief executive of the European Defence Agency.  As Gaeilge, I gave Mr. Ruutu a promotion and called him the pr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannach agus ba ch&oacute;ir go dtabharfar leas-phr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannach air, which is deputy chief executive.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely by MS Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  If members are attending within the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and have at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  I believe that everybody knows the drill in this regard at this stage.  Without further ado, I call Mr.  Ruutu to make his opening statement.</p><p>Good morning to the Chairman and the distinguished members of the joint committee.  It is a real pleasure to speak to them today about the EU's cybersecurity strategy, which was released last December as a joint communication of the Commission and the high representative.  I am joined by Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig, who is our head of unit for information security at the European Defence Agency, EDA, and who will be very glad to take questions from members after my introduction.</p><p> Given my position as deputy chief executive of the EDA, and in line with the agency&rsquo;s mandate, I will address today&rsquo;s topic from a defence capability development perspective.  It is from that perspective that EDA was involved in preparing the strategy, given the responsibility of Mr. Josep Borrell as head of the agency.  We worked closely with the European External Action Service on the defence-related parts of the strategy.</p><p> My message today is clear: achieving greater EU digital sovereignty will require a joint endeavour across the EU, bringing together civilian and defence efforts and leveraging synergies where relevant.  I will address three dimensions where this will be necessary: policy; capabilities and technologies; and resilience.  </p><p> On the policy perspective, building on the EU global strategy and the Council&rsquo;s strategic agenda on the one hand, and on the security union cybersecurity strategies on the other, there would be clear benefits to defining a common approach to digital sovereignty at EU level.  I have no doubt the strategic compass, which is currently being prepared, will contribute to this wider objective.  At the same time, it will be a long-term endeavour, given, notably, the specificities of the defence community.</p><p> After the introduction of the strategic compass, the revision of the 2018 cyber defence policy framework, CDPF, is an opportunity for the defence community to contribute to shaping the ambition on digital sovereignty so an EU approach encompasses the perspective of the military and responds to specific defence needs.  </p><p> Turning to the second dimension - capabilities and technologies - there is a clear need for more investment in cyber capabilities in the EU in view of the fast-evolving nature of the cyber-threat landscape.  With the multi-annual financial framework and Next Generation Europe, the EU will be investing heavily in the digital field.  This is very much welcome.  In view of the increasing investments by the military on digitalisation of forces, we should leverage all possible synergies in this area.  Let me welcome the Commission action plan on synergies between the civil, defence and space industries as an important step in this direction.  To foster civil and military synergies, the EDA is working closely with the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, CERT-EU, and the European Cybercrime Centre, EC3. </p><p> When it comes to cyber defence capability development, we are surely not starting from scratch because, in the EDA framework, we have established EU-level priorities to guide the development of cyber defence capabilities and to focus our effort on cyber defence technological priorities.  </p><p> Given the sensitivities associated with cyber defence, as well as the different levels of expertise and approaches among member states, a co-ordinated approach will, of course, take time.  The EU defence initiatives offer a comprehensive framework to foster more collaborative capability development between member states.  </p><p> The co-ordinated annual review on defence, CARD, for instance, offered a comprehensive defence review.  The 2020 report, which was issued last autumn, identified more than 100 collaborative opportunities to develop next-generation systems.  Ensuring the cyber resilience of the systems to be developed is a key requirement.  </p><p> Permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, provides a dedicated framework to develop these collaborative opportunities.  Already we can see that a great number of projects in the cyber and C4ISR area, with highly visible projects such as European Secure Software-defined Radio, ESSOR, the cyber rapid-response teams or the Cyber and Information Domain Coordination Centre, are paving the way.  Member states have proposed, in the fourth wave of projects of PESCO, a cyber-ranges project that should build on the existing EDA Cyber Ranges Federation operation.  The European Defence Fund, EDF, building on the European Defence Industrial Development Programme, EDIDP, will provide a powerful financial incentive to develop these capabilities, bringing together large industries, SMEs and mid-caps.</p><p> To avoid losing our technological edge, it is critical to invest in the right technologies.  There is a clear convergence of civilian and military needs to master disruptive technologies, from artificial intelligence to quantum technologies.  As cyber technologies are by and large dual-use in nature, we see clear added value in the defence community continuing to contribute to the research effort financed by Horizon Europe. </p><p> The last dimension I would like to address is resilience.  The EDA has taken an important initiative, the EU MilCERT Interoperability Conference, MIC, to foster operational co-operation among EU military computer emergency response teams, CERTs.  In fact, today co-operation among military CERTs still remains very limited, unlike in the civilian domain.  This is also due to different national approaches - for example, on deterrence or attribution.  This is why we have developed the MIC, combining an innovative type of live-fire exercise and strategic discussions.  The first edition was successful, with participation from 17 EU member states in addition to Switzerland.  We are now preparing the second edition, which is to take place in 2022.</p><p> To finish, let me mention two additional areas where, in parallel with the Commission&rsquo;s agenda on the civilian side, the agency is actively supporting EU defence ministries in increasing our collective resilience, namely supply chain security and the further development of secure networks, which is required from an agency perspective as member states are sharing more sensitive data, including in relation to capability development projects.  This is a natural outcome or requirement of deepening European co-operation on defence capabilities.  </p><p> To keep to the timeline, I will conclude my presentation here, but, together with Mr. Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig, I am ready to go into more detail during the question and answers.</p></speech>

It was very European in its language but I realise it is a very technical area.</p> <p>  Is the MIC a specific conference on a specific date or will it be over a period?  Does Mr. Ruutu have a date?</p></speech>

We had our first edition of the conference last autumn.  The idea is to continue on a yearly basis.  It is an example of collaboration and co-operation between responsible cyber defence authorities in member states and of increasing co-operation in the area of cyber defence and bringing people together in that regard.  I wanted to highlight it because, by comparison with civilian cyber operations, there is progress to be made on active cyber defence co-operation.  This is an example of a concrete step forward in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#B00400"><p>I thank our guests.  The Chairman has said that Mr. Ruutu has quite properly made a very high-level presentation to us.  We want to drill down more into the nitty-gritty and specifics.  Our opening view is that, as a committee, we very strongly agree with President von der Leyen's statement that cybersecurity is one of the pressing issues because external actors have the capacity to paralyse industrial plants, city administrations and, as we know very clearly in Ireland, health systems.  The cyberattack on our health system in the middle of a pandemic was an extraordinarily impactive and damaging assault on our public administration that actually caused deaths.</p><p>In particular terms, I would be interested to hear, from the European Union perspective and in a collegiate way, what we can do in responding to attacks like that.  Is there a focus on the nations which we know host such cyberattackers or is it entirely a diplomatic effort that is left to the external action focus of the European Union?  How do we better prepare ourselves for the future?  Preparing resilience within our systems is one thing but how do we actively ensure that those who attack us are discouraged from doing so?</p><p> Will the witnesses explain the differences between cybersecurity and cyberdefence?  What are the features of each of them?</p><p> As active parliamentarians, most of us are particularly concerned about cyber interference in our democracy.  We see this in other jurisdictions.  We have certainly seen it in the United States in recent elections and I have no doubt there are active participants across Europe also.  Does this form part of the European Defence Agency's focus?  What does Mr. Ruutu have to say on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#C00200"><p>With regard to preparedness, our focus is on building a collaborative approach and collaborative opportunities for cyberdefence capabilities.  I gave the committee a few examples of different projects.  We try to structure and find common interests for cyberdefence capabilities.  As we move to the next generation of defence capabilities and our co-operation on them, we need to pay systematic attention to make sure that cyberdefence-related aspects are considered.</p> <p>  From our perspective, we are in intergovernmental agency within the European Union.  We help the member states to build their capabilities and come together, for example, through the Cyber Ranges Federation project where we are able to test together how our readiness, detection and responses to cyber threats are developing in the defence domain.  We also have the co-operation of the military CERTs to test this and simulate what types of options and means of responding we would have at a national level and in consultation.</p> <p>  The committee will also be aware of the joint cyber unit, the establishment of which was a Commission recommendation.  It is also referred to in the European Union cybersecurity strategy.  Here, the aim is to increase the usability to cope with large cyber incidents by promoting co-operation across the different cyber communities.  The recommendation includes the defence community as one of the four communities.  There are also the civilian, law enforcement and diplomacy areas, although I note also the specificity.  We are now working on how to engage the defence community to receive feedback on how it wants to be engaged in this wider effort.</p> <p>  While the European Defence Agency is not directly involved in cyber incident management, we are ready to be associated with the efforts designed at increasing overall preparedness, including the development of specific tools and capabilities which will benefit the cyberdefence community.  That is a process on the joint cyber unit that has led to the discussion by the Commission, together with the member states and other actors in the area.  Our way to support preparedness is to have collaborative approaches for the development of national capabilities, and then to network those.</p> <p>  On cybersecurity and cyberdefence, I have outlined what we do mainly on cyberdefence.  We have a prioritisation framework, which means that we want to look at what European defence requires over the long term, what capabilities are key for our ability to act and prepare European Union member states' interests over the longer term, and how to invest in cyberdefence capabilities in order that our still limited resources - even collectively - would be used in the best and most effective possible way.  We offer a platform for collaboration on cyberdefence capabilities, which is where we are active.  Technologically, the line between pure cybersecurity and cyberdefence is often not that clear, but we want to make sure that the co-operation within the agencies framework by defence sectors is raising our industrial technological level and that there is an active engagement and networking with cybersecurity actors who would do that more from the civilian perspective.  In any event, our approach is based on cyberdefence capability development in that sense.</p> <p>  On the issue of interference, we are not working actively on that or on incident management as such.  We are preparing the capabilities for member states to be able to do so first and foremost in the defence field.  The Deputy asked whether it was one of our areas of focus and he cited election interference as one example, among others.  We are part of the European Union effort to be more capable technologically, now and in the long term, to withstand pressure that is being seen in this area.  Our mandate is to work on defence capabilities and cyber capabilities to that extent.  Perhaps Mr. Roehrig will add to that.</p></speech>

For example, since May 2018 we have in place a formalised memorandum of understanding between the European Network and Information Security Agency, the European Cybercrime Centre in Europol, as well as the CERT for the EU institutions, CERT EU, with the European Defence Agency, to especially explore these elements of the dual-use nature of cyberspace as such and the interlinks between cybersecurity on the civil side and cyberdefence on the military side.</p> <p>  In addition to the preparedness part of the question, since 2014 we have been running a series of exercises, the so-called cyber strategic decision-making exercises.  We have run these exercises so far with seven member states in order to train a government, with some artificiality within the set-up, on how to deal with an escalating cyber crisis.  This is one of the areas where we see a lot of potential to have these kinds of exercises institutionalised for achieving a better preparedness towards the decision-making within a government in such an escalating crisis.</p></speech>

Reference was made to increased spending in the multi-annual financial framework.  While I appreciate the witnesses may not be able to differentiate the various areas, by how much specifically will spending on cybersecurity and cyberdefence increase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#D00100"><p>I would not be able to give the Deputy a figure from the multi-annual financial framework that is altogether dedicated to this.  The importance in the long-term multi-annual perspective is that, in different work programmes, for example in the European defence fund, we will see emphasis on cyber defence-related capabilities.  It is very important, and what the agency wants to convey is, that we need to invest in cyber defence capabilities over the long term, throughout the entire multi-annual financial framework and then beyond.  In a way, at the European level, we need to support co-operation and have an objective so that in the 2030s and 2040s, over the long term, we are able to field capabilities in cyber defence that are sustainable and that are also interoperable in the digital environment we are moving towards.  It is a long-term exercise and, in this review we have done, we will be able to see the exact financial figures, although, unfortunately, I am not able to give them to the committee that today.  The importance in all of that is, with regard to European resources overall, there are limits to how much we can spend on cyber defence given the other interests.  Our approach is very much to try to structure the discussion to make sure that we have priorities where co-operative spending on that would be most effective.  It is about the collaborative approach and the investment that will be necessary.</p></speech>

We all accept the difficulties we are facing and if we did not, the ransomware attack on the HSE proved the danger of the new world in which we live.  I am always somewhat wary of defence issues, particularly in regard to army and military co-operation being melded into the conversation around cybersecurity meets cyber defence.  I will just put that out there and I do not expect the witnesses to answer specifically in that regard.</p> <p>  The witnesses went into detail in regard to what the EDA deals with.  Will the witnesses give some detail on its overall remit?  We have a general notion of that but how exactly does the EDA define cyber defence capacity?  How are things operating in regard to the relationships at this point in time in dealing with individual states, whether that is dealing with individual militaries, individual police services or the likes of the National Cyber Security Centre here?  How do the witnesses perceive that will change?  Obviously, there will be updated protocols on how we operate into the future.  Regarding the exercises, reference was made to the seven member states that have engaged in these.  Can we have some detail on what exactly we are talking about, which states they are and what these exercises were?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#D00300"><p>I will go direct to the question.  I will outline a bit more on the way of working and Mr. Roerig will add more detail on the co-operative approach from his perspective.  Our approach is very much to support concrete collaborative projects.  We are working as a secretariat to the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, which I referred to earlier.  Among the 46 projects that are now running within the Permanent Structured Cooperation, we have added 14 to these in November and there are four that are directly focused on improving cyber defence.  We are working on cyber rapid response teams, CRRTs, and mutual assistance in cybersecurity.  There is a cyber threats incident response information sharing platform.  We have the Cyber and Information Domain Coordination Centre, CIDCC, and the EU Cyber Academia and Innovation Hub, EU CAIH.  Some other concrete examples that I have referred to are the Cyber Ranges Federation, which has been going on since 2020 with eight participating member states, and we have a project on advanced persistent threats detection.  We then have research and technology projects on cyber forensics, dynamic malware and cyber situational awareness.</p> <p>  As we move along in the Permanent Structured Cooperation, what we are doing is providing member states with supports for projects in the PESCO framework.  One of them, which also received European Union funding, is on cyber situational awareness and is called CySAP.  We have a demonstrator developed within the EDA and we are, as an agency, designated as a project manager.  It is a clear example of how, from national requirements, we go to collaborative approaches and then we use the tools at our disposal to manage these projects.</p> <p>  In education and training, we have a cyber co-operation planning exercise called Cyber Phalanx, which has been conducted since 2018.  As Mr. Roerig said, there was also a strategic decision-making exercise.  We are also piloting our policies, for example, on cyber awareness "train the trainer" and the implications for Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, operations and missions planning,  and also a cyber hybrid pilot course.  In addition to providing the priorities, we offer collaborative opportunities and then link that with the EU funding opportunities and, very importantly, encourage the member states responsible to co-operate more together.</p> <p>  These are examples of the concrete activities we have ongoing.  I ask Mr. Roerig to come in on some of the other aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.352" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#D00400"><p>On the strategic decision-making exercises which we are running since 2014, the member states with which we have executed this type of exercise so far are Portugal, the Czech Republic, Austria, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia and Slovenia.  We were designing this type of exercise from the beginning on the principle that in the cyber world, what is technically possible will most probably happen.  Therefore, we were designing the scenarios from the beginning in 2014 along the aspect of &ldquo;think the unthinkable&rdquo; and make it into a scenario.  The Deputy mentioned the very recent ransomware attacks on the Irish national health system.  This scenario was already part of our initial way of doing the exercises or scenarios from 2014.  This scenario also has the opportunity and option to be expanded into a hybrid environment, so it was also the baseline which was part of the hybrid exercise which was run with the Defence Ministers in 2017 under the Estonian Council Presidency.</p> <p>  The other aspect concerns the point on connecting capacities.  This is exactly what we are aiming for with the MilCERT Interoperability Conference, MIC.  Here, we are clearly striving for a network of operational capacity within member states to increase their information exchange and their co-operation because we clearly see a gap in the defence community.  What is already standard on the civil side with, for example, the Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-EU, network, which is fostered by ENISA, is not happening yet in the military community and we are now trying to foster this in line with the cyber security strategy from 2020, where it is explicitly addressed.  We will also be an interlocutor for the civil network of CERTs.</p></speech>

Does the EDA see itself as the lead in respect of cyberdefence?  I am not sure where cybersecurity and cyberdefence stop and start.  Long term, we have to deal with defence capacity, international law issues, digital hygiene, and a capacity to disrupt attacks and even a counterstrike capacity.  Obviously, our big fear is cyber-to-physical attacks.  What is the roadmap into the future and who will be the lead at EU level?</p></speech>

I do not know whether that is clear but it is the clearest way to interpret the link.  The EDA is not an operational actor and, therefore, on any aspect of operational activities relating to cyberdefence, it is not the EDA in the driving seat, although it has a supporting role.  As Mr. Ruutu mentioned, this work on the joint cyber unit in the defence and diplomacy community is led at this stage by the external action service, EAS, with the EDA in support.  The link with the military community, following the establishment of the joint cyber unit, is one of the key items we have at the moment in the defence community.  As Mr. Ruutu mentioned, a roadmap on how to engage with the defence community is being developed.  Together with the diplomacy community, these communities in the EU context are still taking an intergovernmental approach compared with the other dimensions of baseline cybersecurity under the network and information security, NIS, directive, or combating cybercrime with the support of the European Cybercrime Centre.</p></speech>

I welcome greater co-operation throughout the European Union on issues such as defence and cybersecurity.  It makes sense, particularly for a small country and member state such as Ireland, to pool resources and to work with like-minded member states to deal with these threats that have, as the President of the Commission said, advanced in such a way that one person with a laptop can now cause significant damage to a country, as we have seen in Ireland.</p> <p>  Many of the questions about the strategy and how this might work have been asked, so I will ask some more specific questions.  What is the future of the European Defence Agency?  What are its plans for the next five or ten years?  What are its budgets for 2021 and 2022 and do our guests foresee an increased budget for the EDA in the next five or ten years?  Is it recruiting additional staff and personnel with certain expertise to expand its operations to support member states?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.357" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#E00400"><p>There is a growing realisation in the security environment we are in that more collaborate approaches are needed at European level to support member states' capabilities and to harness the tools we have available at European Union level.  The agency was established in 2004 and we have supported member states since then.  Our budget for this year was &euro;37.5 million.  Last week, we adopted the budget for 2022, at &euro;38 million, which is accounted for by an indexation correction to keep us at that level.  Of course, this is in the physical environment in which we have operated and, in light of Covid and the financial constraints our member states have faced, this is a conservative budget.  Especially in the areas of innovation and supporting projects and programmes in defence capability co-operation, we see a need for a moderate increase in the years to come.  The investment we are making in the collaborative part of defence capability development remains very modest.<br/><br/>In 2017, the agency was given three specific tasks and its role was defined further in the context of these three tasks.  The first was prioritisation, which relates to examining, as I mentioned earlier, what Europe will need in the years to come, based, importantly, on member states' requirements in regard to the full spectrum of defence tasks that member states will need to complete, and also to meet the EU level of ambition.  The question is what kind of capabilities we need to be a credible security provider in the years to come.  It is important that we agree, based on member states' priorities and in co-operation with member states, what we need to focus our efforts on in order that they will have the broadest benefit.<br/><br/>These priorities are based on a capability development plan, an overarching strategic research agenda and industrial capacities and skills that are required.  We need to have a long-term approach of co-operation and to build on these priorities.  These priorities, which member states agreed to in the EDA framework, are also referred to in, for example, the regulation of the European Defence Fund.  They will cover all EU defence-related activities as a guiding priority for the future.  We are still on the prioritisation path.  We are still developing and reinforcing our work on foresight in respect of both capability requirements and technology in order that Europe will be well prepared to analyse what is needed for the years and even decades to come.<br/><br/>The second task that was given in 2017 by defence ministers was to be the central forum for supporting defence projects, that is, projects undertaken together that can support member states' capability and development.  We have run more than &euro;1 billion worth of research and technology programmes in the agency's time.  Currently, we are running between 100 and 120 <i>ad hoc</i>capabilities and activities.  In many cases, these activities we are running, such as in research and technology, are activities where a number of member states, perhaps four, five or ten, make a moderate initial sum of investment but the most important thing is to examine what requirements we have and where we can find commonality.  In that way, by harmonising our requirements, we can also create the basis for future operability, feasibility studies and many things that will go down stream and become capability development activities.  We support projects also in the fiscal framework and try to rationalise and reinforce the effective use of funds.<br/><br/>The third area of co-operation and mandate we received relates to interfacing with wider EU policies.  We are discussing cyber today, which is a good example of that, but it means that when we develop our defence capabilities and EU policies, we take into account what the defence and security policy requirements are in regard to making that policy.  It is quite important now that we are able to have some EU funding through this multi-annual financial framework for defence-related research and capability development, but there are a number of issues relating to space or the environment where, in defence, we share responsibilities relating to sustainability and where we need collaborative approaches to ensure we are capable and credible and, at the same time, we fully carry the responsibility on environmental issues.</p><p>These are the three elements on which we are working.  For example, in maritime security and many other areas of EU activity, how can defence support the joint efforts and how can policy development take into account defence requirements?<br/><br/>As to where the EDA has been focusing in recent years, we hope to see moderate growth in the collaborative approach, the more effective use of EU funds and the sum of EU member states' activities changing from individual <i>ad hoc</i>ones into something that in ten, 15 or 20 years' time and beyond support a credible and constructive approach to capability development.<br/><br/>On the question of where we see the EDA going, we have in recent years created an architecture of EU defence initiatives.  Through the co-ordinated annual review on defence, we have commitments for more co-operation with the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO.  We have a European defence fund that, in co-operation with the Commission, awards through competitions concrete funding to SMEs and large and small industries and incentivises co-operative approaches.  In that sense, we are on a good path.  The important element is to ensure that we focus on priorities that are sustainable in the long term and we actively review and pursue the most cost-effective use of funds.</p></speech>

I wish him well in that work.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Ruutu had engagements with other EU parliaments similar to today's?  What has been the reaction of other member states to Dr. von der Leyen's speech and the announcement of the EU defence union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#F00300"><p>I should have thanked the committee for inviting us and giving us the opportunity to share how we, as an agency of the member states, see this developing.  We have had some hearings in member states' parliaments.  We welcome such opportunities because we have seen an increasing interest in co-ordinating and planning activities more jointly than previously.  The political direction and guidance will be given by the member states and their parliaments but the earlier we are able to create an understanding of planning in national defence reviews and other documents, the more it will help us to find more opportunities for co-operation.  As such, we welcome the opportunity of this meeting and would like to have more invitations like this one.  We are grateful for the Irish Parliament's active and engaging approach.  We are seeing signs of others doing the same and have been listened to in more and more instances.</p> <p>  I will again refer to the co-ordinated annual review on defence.  It is an example that I hope can be used by various parliaments and decision makers throughout the member states.  In November 2020, we presented findings on how we viewed the European defence landscape in terms of co-operation.  The EU has state-of-the-art and world-leading capabilities in many respects but, in terms of planning jointly and investing together, we are still fragmented.  We are not far enough along in making informed decisions on how Europe can do more together.</p> <p>  Through the review, we are starting a process with our colleagues in Ireland's Department of Defence of hearing member states' views on what is important in terms of national as well as regional requirements, including capability requirements, and what member states' technological perspectives are.  With this review of and outlook on how European defence is developing, we hope to engage in discussions on and solutions for how to take the situation forward.  This landscaping function and the co-ordinated review on defence will be key to making informed decisions.  We hope to keep delivering in this regard so as to inform parliaments better.</p></speech>

Since no one else is indicating, does anyone wish to ask a supplementary question?  We have time.  I call Deputy Howlin, followed by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</p></speech>

I was interested in Mr. Ruutu's comments about supply chain security, which is a focus right now.  Perhaps he will elaborate on what work has been done to ensure that we have supply chain security within the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#F00600"><p>I referred to our privatisation framework.  We have a strand of work, called "key strategic activities", which identifies the industrial skills and know-how required in the European defence technological and industrial base to sustain capability development and research areas in accordance with our priorities.  We monitor the supply chain and industrial landscape in areas such as materials and components in terms of how Europe can have a viable supply chain and we identify risks and opportunities in that regard.  We are developing a risk management framework that is specifically dedicated to managing cybersecurity issues and military capability supply chains.  A strong supply chain is a prerequisite for digital sovereignty.  We are trying to develop this kind of assessment for military commanders.  We are in the early stages of the risk management framework but we and other EU actors are looking at identifying what the requirements are for defence-trusted supply chains.  In terms of the application of emerging disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence, we want to see what the requirements would be for certification of defence-trusted technologies.</p> <p>  We are conducting this work with member states and are at the beginning of discussions on what exact elements would help to manage risk in the supply chain.  We are only one of the actors and I am sure that this is a matter of concern for others.  Besides the risks and disruptions caused by Covid to the supply chain, there are also issues of security of supply owing to access to certain components and raw materials.  This work forms part of our prioritisation of industrial competency, skills and efforts to ensure that we are prepared in terms of supply chain security.</p></speech>

Do the joint exercises involve a straightforward opt-in?</p><p>Is that a straightforward opt-in?  What are the criteria?  Did a number of states decide to collaborate on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Wolfgang Roehrig" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#G00200"><p>Member states requested the EDA to begin such an exercise.  It is all voluntary, so we cannot and will not force any member state or government to run with this.  We see a positive effect from all of this in that, in most of the member states that I mentioned, the exercise was a trigger to establish a national series of similar exercises to continuously train public and civil servants up to the highest level in how to react on this.  As we said, we asked member states to apply natural rules, regulations and procedures.  It would allow consideration of those procedures where there is a sequence involved as well.  For sure, at any time, Ireland, for example, could ask the EDA to run such an exercise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#G00300"><p>I have a general question about the European Defence Agency.  Mr. Roehrig might have gathered from my earlier comments that even the name frightens the life out of me and other people in the context of where it will end up.  There is a fear of a wider European army and so on.  How do the protocols go with regard to the EDA determining what member states want and need, what the requirements are, the research that is done and where the EDA foresees it going in the future?  I guess that Mr. Roehrig will not be able to give me a definitive answer.  I will misquote whoever spoke earlier about the European Union as a security player, for want of a better term.  What does the EDA foresee that being?  I have a fear about where that will go, while also accepting that we have to deal with the situation, whether we are dealing with the consequences of the failed military operation in Afghanistan, which fell apart brutally, or with issues on the Polish border with Belarus, where Lukashenko is engaging in war by another means.  I would be delighted if the witnesses could give detail on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#G00400"><p>I would reaffirm what I was saying earlier.  The EDA's role is really to support capability development co-operation.  We are about collaborative opportunities.  It is based on the logic that all member states can join those areas of co-operation that they wish to, whether it is cyberdefence or any other requirement, such as strategic lift, based on work that we initiated ten years ago relating strategic lift or air-to-air refuelling.  These capabilities were also used in the evacuations from Afghanistan.  We are trying to support development of new capabilities and to support operational issues, including crisis management or any other requirements that individual member states have.  Our approach is based on member states voluntarily engaging in any activities they have sought co-operation for.  This is our mandate.  It is a mandate in the treaties and it was further reinforced recently in light of the changes in the security environment.  We are there for collaborative approaches based on each member state's requirements.  That answers the question about our role.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to priorities.  They are based on a methodology where all member states bring matters that are important for them to the table.  In this collaborative discussion, we came up with 11 priorities, which were established in 2018, relating to capability development.  They cover all domains.  Cybersecurity is one.  We have to make sure that the European Union's capabilities in the long term are prepared and resilient.  This is the approach and the work that the agency advocates.</p></speech>

What roadmap does the EDA see?  I accept what the witnesses have said about it being collaborative action that people opt into.  How do they see the European Union operating when the matter of security meets foreign policy, especially when we are talking about those bigger issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.370" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Olli Ruutu" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021112400002#G00600"><p>I think the Deputy is aware that the strategic compass at EU level is being discussed at present.  We are one of the actors that has contributed to that discussion.  Defence and foreign ministers discuss what to do.  The work is ongoing so I will not prejudge any outcome.  The aim from our perspective is to be capable but also more cost-effective through co-operation.  As I said in the co-ordinated annual review, we have seen that we have a lot of capability to support our requirements in the future, but we need to be more effective together.  This is the spirit in which we are working.  Regarding the projection of that capability and supporting member states' requirements, I think this strategic compass will give a lot of direction to EU work.  In our work, the European defence initiatives already prioritise capabilities through providing funding and the work programme, which is more on a technological basis.  The Commission is working on the different synergies between civilian and military aspects.  We would be able to have more cost-effective and sustainable investment in the requirements that member states have over time.</p></speech>

We will now commence the examination of the Supplementary Estimates.  I invite the Minister to give his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for taking these Supplementary Estimates today.</p> <p>  I will present to the committee a proposal for: a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 resulting in a gross Estimate of &euro;34 million in respect of Vote 12 &ndash; superannuation and retired allowances; and a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;3.665 million in respect of Vote 17 &ndash; PAS.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2021 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;700.3 million gross and &euro;339.9 million net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises mainly due to higher costs than forecast for the year under the pension scheme for established civil servants as a result of a higher than expected number of retirements for 2021.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of the PAS Vote will bring the total gross allocation for the Vote to &euro;20.455 million in 2021.</p> <p>  The additional allocation of &euro;3.665 million sought for Vote 17 includes &euro;800,000 of additional current expenditure to enable PAS to provide additional recruitment services to the HSE; and an increased capital allocation of &euro;2.865 million in 2021 to allow for facilities upgrades, which have been carried out over a quicker timeframe than was originally envisaged.  This increased capital expenditure in 2021 will not increase the overall cost of the project, but it will enable works to be concluded over a shorter timeframe.  I understand that further detail on this request for Vote 17 has been provided to the committee.</p> <p>  On Vote 12, pensions and lump sums paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants make up 91% of total gross expenditure and, therefore, the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  However, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for a number of reasons, including the following: the majority of established civil servants will have a compulsory retirement age of 70; a number of people under age 60 retire each year under cost neutral early retirement or on grounds of ill-health; each year a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement; and the average pension benefits of lump sum and pension that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.</p> <p>  The 2021 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;666.3 million, which was based on a forecast of 1,650 retirements from the established scheme.  As a general rule, for each person who retires, the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Subhead A4 is, therefore, a key driver of expenditure variance on the Vote in any given year.</p> <p>  At end October 2021, &euro;118.6 million has been expended from subhead A4 compared to the original 2021 full-year estimate of &euro;109.8 million.  Further expenditure of up to &euro;23.2 million by the end of the year is expected, resulting in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;32 million on the subhead.  It is now estimated that total gross expenditure on the Vote for 2021 may be in the region of &euro;700.3 million, some &euro;34 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;666.3 million as voted previously by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  Appropriations-in-aid for 2021 were estimated at &euro;326.4 million.  Receipts with respect to the single public service pension scheme are ahead of profile year to date.  Total appropriations-in-aid are now projected at &euro;360.4 million by year end, which is &euro;34 million more than originally expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants expected to retire up to the end of 2021.  Approval for the Supplementary Estimate - Vote 17 will also enable the PAS to deliver additional demand-led recruitment services to the HSE and conclude an upgrade of their offices in a shorter timeframe than previously envisaged.  I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the committee and I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

It is always good to have the Minister in front of the committee, and I thank him.</p> <p>  On Vote 12, will he indicate how much was paid out in total last year for what is called "golden handshake" payments, and what was the highest single payment?  What was the average payment in this regard?  Will he confirm which Departments paid out most in this regard?</p> <p>  On Vote 17, what fees have been paid to external interviewers in the past three years?  I have a number of other questions but I put those two questions first.</p></speech>

I do not have the outturn for 2020 with me because we are dealing with the 2021 Supplementary Estimates.  I can, however, answer a number of the questions she has put.  For example, the average annual Civil Service pension last year came in at just under &euro;24,500.  That is up from a figure of &euro;23,000 in 2019.  The average Civil Service lump sum payment, in the year to date in 2021 to the end of September, was &euro;73,100.  For 2020 it was just under &euro;69,600.</p><p>That is just to give the committee an indication of the average.  As members knows, the lump sum is typically three times the level of the pension in respect of an individual person.  I will obtain for the Deputy the figures for 2020 by way of the outturn.  I believe the gross provisional outturn for 2020 is approximately &euro;628.4 million in respect of the superannuation and retired allowances for Vote 12.  Did the Deputy have another question?</p></speech>

It is also, in effect, the regulator.  Does the Minister believe the regulator should be able to comment on matters relating to the regulation of public service appointments?  I ask because of the remuneration of a particular Secretary General, as was recently reported in the media and debated at different committees.  I wrote to the commission to ask its views and it told me it was not appropriate for it to comment.  To be honest, I thought it was unusual, in some senses, that the regulator could not comment on matters pertaining to the regulation of public service appointments.  I would like to hear the Minister's views and comments on that matter.  Does he see a stronger role for the committee, in light of the recommendations made in the report that was recently published?</p></speech>

In terms of day-to-day operations, the Public Appointments Service operates independently and the level of interaction I have with it on a day-to-day basis is limited.  The Supplementary Estimate, in particular, arose as a result of the additional recruitment of medical and clerical staff, especially in the health area.  The majority of the Supplementary Estimate relates to the ongoing works to upgrade and modernise the offices in Chapter House.  That includes, for example, the modernisation of interview suites to include increased options for digital services and to allow for social distancing in face-to-face interviews and so on.  For any individual recruitment campaign for a particular post, it is a matter for the Public Appointments Service as to whether it wishes to comment.  I imagine the service is constrained in its ability to comment on any individual recruitment campaign but that is a matter for itself.  I am happy to take any questions arising from the committee's report.</p></speech>

I am going to have to listen back to it.  I apologise.  It is unfortunate that I missed what the Minister said at the start of his reply but I gather from what he said at the end that he is happy to take questions with regard to the report.  As he knows, 14 recommendations were included in the report, including the establishment of a formal process of interim and permanent appointments to senior posts and for that process to be followed in all instances.  It also recommends the establishment of a body to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service, and to develop a process for how those appointments are made.  The report also stated that the ministerial power to set individuals' salaries should be reviewed, with a view to ensuring transparency and oversight.  Can the Minister inform us what action he is going to take with regard to the three recommendations I have mentioned?  I hope there will be action relating to those recommendations because it is important they are implemented.</p></speech>

I hope she is hearing me okay.  I welcome the report.  I am still working my way through it because it is a lengthy report which gives a lot of food for thought.  I have looked at the 14 recommendations that were provided by the committee.  Those recommendations will be given serious consideration.  I have had an initial discussion about the recommendations with my officials.  There are some stand-out recommendations, in particular the recommendation to establish a body similar to the review body for positions with a higher remuneration in the public sector.  The report suggests that body is established immediately to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service and develop processes and procedures governing appointments to senior posts on interim and permanent bases.  I will give consideration to that.</p> <p>  I will make the point that until July of next year, the pay level for senior posts will be generally governed by the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The final unwinding of the long tail of FEMPI will occur on 1 July 2022, in accordance with the legislation.  Once we get beyond that point, the question arises as to what is the appropriate way in which pay issues can be examined at senior levels.  At the moment, as the Deputy knows, and in line with the legislation in place, it is a power that falls to the Minister.  We must consider that if we reconstitute a body similar to the one that was stood down in 2009, we may not always like its recommendations.  It may come forward with recommendations in respect of pay levels that far exceed what the committee or I, as Minister, might be willing to entertain.  We must consider that point.</p> <p>  As Minister, I am accountable.  I have attended before the committee in respect of the matter that was the subject of the report.  I am before the committee again today.  It is important that we have that level of accountability.  We would need to consider carefully exactly what the terms of reference and the role for such a body would be.  Would that role be to make recommendations and it would then fall to the Minister to make a decision on individual pay levels?  That requires careful consideration.  I am giving a commitment to the committee that I will consider the report and I am happy to engage with the committee on that particular recommendation and the others, which I am happy to answer questions about.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to three recommendations.  To which three, in particular, was she referring?</p></speech>

The second was the establishment of a body to review the remuneration of senior posts in the Civil Service and public service and to develop the process of appointments.  The third was the review of the ministerial power to set individual salaries.  It was those three in particular on which I focused.</p></speech>

I know this committee commented on the role of TLAC in its report.  I have informed the Government that I intend to review the role and composition of TLAC.  If the committee has any detailed proposals or suggestions for the role of TLAC, I would be more than happy to engage.  Until recently, TLAC had 13 members.  A lot of work is going through the committee at the moment and there are many vacancies across senior levels in the Civil Service for which recruitment processes are under way.  We must bear in mind that membership of TLAC is a part-time role.  Following consultation with the Chairman, we have increased the membership from 13 to 16.  I acknowledge the need for a wider review.  It has, generally, served us well.  I believe TLAC has been operating for almost 40 years at this stage and it has played a crucial role in supporting the appointment of senior posts, from assistant Secretary General level up over that period of time.  In general, the role has been performed well but it is now timely to conduct a review.  I am studying the report this committee published last week.  I am also consulting my officials and will consider any proposals the committee wishes to make in that regard.</p></speech>

Is the Minister concerned about that?</p></speech>

Management of the payroll bill is an issue for the Accounting Officer in charge of the HSE Vote.</p><p>It is not something that I have day-to-day involvement in.  The Estimates we are discussing today relate to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and do not involve direct payments to employees outside of its own body.  Of course, the issue of pensions relates to the Vote on superannuation and retired allowances.  I am happy to come back to the committee or to help it obtain any information it needs, but I do not have a detailed briefing on the breakdown of overtime payments to employees across the HSE.</p></speech>

I wish to begin by asking the Minister about the Estimates in terms of the pensions and lump sums.  He may be aware that it is now no longer permitted for his Department to publish details of the pensions that former Ministers are receiving.  Does he believe that this is something that needs to be rectified in the legislation?  I am conscious that he also oversees the freedom of information legislation.  Surely, when money is paid out of the public purse to people in positions such as those which the Minister now occupies himself, the public has a right to know about the pension provision?  Perhaps the Minister can explain to us what has changed, because this information was previously always readily available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#C00300"><p>I am aware of the issue.  My understanding is that the change arises from a ruling by the Information Commissioner following a freedom of information process that ultimately made its way to his desk for a decision.  It is a decision that was made by him and one that we have to comply with and be consistent with.  I should make the point that we are doing a review of the freedom of information Acts.  We have commenced an initial scoping exercise, on which there has been very strong engagement.  We have received around 300 submissions already.  It will be a comprehensive review that will run well into next year and will ultimately shape proposals that I will bring to Government and hopefully, to the committee.  I know that members of the committee and other Opposition parties are interested in bringing forward proposals in this area.  That particular issue will be examined as part of the review.  However, my understanding is that currently, we have a ruling from the Information Commissioner and we are essentially bound by it.  If we are to revert to publishing information at the level of the individual, it raises the question of where to draw the line.  Do we publish the pension information of retired senior civil servants and retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the health service, or is it just politicians that we are interested in?  That is a question that we need to answer if we are seeking to address the issue in legislation.</p></speech>

The approach was always that information in relation to the Garda, nurses or teachers was not published.  However, I think there is an additional responsibility on those of us who are in public life and are in the privileged position of being elected to office.  I am not sure if the Minister shares that view.  I would be eager to hear the Minister's personal opinions on that.  Does he believe that that information that was made public in the past should be made public in the future, through this review?</p></speech>

It is not something that I have given a great deal of thought to because we have that ruling from the Information Commissioner.  It is not a decision point for me at this moment in time.  It is an issue that we should consider in the context of the legislation.  In his comments, the Deputy drew a distinction between elected officials and unelected officials.  We have to consider whether that is an appropriate line to draw in terms of a distinction between people who were formerly elected.  For example, we have to consider if we would include former judges in that.  I take it that the Deputy would say "No" to that, but "Yes" to including politicians in that.  We have to consider whether or not it is appropriate to have a system that is solely applicable to politicians rather than to other persons who served at senior levels across the Civil Service and public service.  That does require some thought.  We want a situation where we continue to attract people into politics and to apply for senior roles in the civil and public service.  It requires some thought, but I am happy to give it thought and to engage on it as part of the review of the freedom of information legislation.</p></speech>

In relation to the appointment of medical professionals, there is a serious issue in respect of the recruitment of medical professionals, including for consultant and other posts.  Has the Minister engaged with the PAS on the process, the length of time it takes and the delays?  I have engaged with local hospital managers and senior management staff within the hospitals and my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has visited most of the hospitals across the State in the past two weeks.  From my engagement and the information relayed to me by Deputy Cullinane, I have learned that the current recruitment process is not fit for purpose, particularly for regional and rural hospitals.  For example, when recruiting a consultant for a post in Letterkenny, the PAS could offer the position to a person who is located in Dublin and has no intention of relocating to Letterkenny.  The PAS has to go through the process of sending the offer, it being considered and rejected, then must look at the list of candidates again and offer the post to another candidate, and so on.  The PAS might get to the fourth candidate on the list, who is somebody from the region who has an interest in the region.  It is not just about that person moving to the region and taking up a position; it is also possibly about a partner, a husband or wife, who would need to relocate his or her job, and so on.</p> <p>  There are no regional panels here.  If there were regional panels in relation to the suitability for appointments, it could fast-track the process, instead of the PAS going through a process that is not fit for purpose and offering positions to professionals who have no intention of taking them up in the first place.  I ask the Minister to comment on that and on the need for a localised campaign.  The centralisation of recruitment in the health service is important in terms of costs and quality.  Indeed, in the review that has been done on the PAS, concerns have been raised and recommendations made in terms of ensuring that it recruits the proper staff.  However, we can see the benefits where hospitals have been able to engage in their own localised recruitment process.  I think we can all accept that there is an emergency in terms of staffing of our hospitals, not least now with Covid-19.  Surely, this needs to be looked at in a way that is about more than just giving resources to PAS, but actually looking at how we are recruiting, why there are no localised panels and allowing our hospitals, within certain parameters, to organise localised recruitment initiatives.  My understanding from the regions is that the ones that are bearing most fruits are those introduced to recruit nurses, in particular, as well as other professionals at higher levels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#C00700"><p>Undoubtedly, it has been a challenge to recruit the number of staff that we have provided the budget for.  Having said that, a lot of progress has been made.  Last year, over 6,300 additional staff were recruited, which included over 1,700 nurses and midwives.  This year, so far, just under 4,500 additional staff have been recruited.  Therefore, between last year and this year, approximately 11,000 have been recruited.  In such a relatively short period of time, it is the most significant level of recruitment that the HSE has ever embarked upon.  The figures look challenging but from the information that the HSE is conveying to us, I understand that it expects that the figure of 4,500, which is quite possibly the position to the end of September, will rise to close to 7,400 by the end of the year.  There will be a budget to continue with that recruitment next year.  The key point the Deputy made is about the system and the pace at which recruitment is taking place.</p><p>All I can say to the Deputy is that this is an issue we have discussed at the Cabinet committee on health.  We have provided the funding and we want to see the staff recruited to improve the quality of the healthcare we are providing to our people.  It is a combination of the work of the PAS and the HSE&rsquo;s internal HR system and the operation of that.  We have asked that information would be brought back to the Cabinet committee on health and I would be happy to share whatever information I get once we receive it.  The Deputy has made a particular suggestion about localised panels to increase the prospect of somebody being offered a job actually taking it up, which is a fair point, and to allow as much discretion at the local hospital level as possible.  We will take those two points and convey them to the HSE.  I want to repeat the point that the HSE has recruited about 11,000 people between last year and this year so far, which is a significant increase in the overall staff resources it has.  It will be doing more before the end of the year and into next year but there is a need to see if we can make the system more efficient.  Localised panels and more local recruitment at hospital level offer some potential and we will take that on board.</p></speech>

We are recruiting people and that is great and we are competing internationally as others are also trying to recruit but the timeframe is all wrong.  The Minister needs to get under the bonnet of this, look at the steps that are being taken and strip away or shorten some of the time within this.  We have had scenarios where hospitals have told us they have applied for maternity cover for a particular speciality at an early stage, they have since been granted the cover and they are delighted about that but the baby is born and is one-year old and the person who gave birth is back in the position.  That is what is happening in our hospitals.  When we ask our hospital management and staff to indicate at an early and advanced stage that they may be taking maternity leave, which they have no obligation to do, we must streamline that process.  If it is taking that long then there is a serious problem.</p> <p>  We may be talking about the length of time it takes to recruit but if that is a speech and language therapist, that means there are dozens of children, whether they have autism or other speech impediments, who are not getting a service in cases.  It means that their educational ability and attainment are curtailed because they have dropped out of a service that they needed during that period or because there is a delay in the service.  It is life lasting and it has a serious impact on the development of a child.  It could be a case of life or death in other specialties which cannot be carried out or in which there is a delay because the position is not filled.</p> <p>  The issue is the time it takes to fill a consultant post.  The average time it takes to fill a consultant&rsquo;s post is 513 days.  I recognise that some posts are filled in a shorter period of time but some also take longer.  We have evidence to suggest that positions are being offered to people who have no interest in coming to more regional hospitals.  A localised pull would help to curtail some of that but there are also a number of other suggestions.  Giving more money to the PAS is one thing if it needs it but the process needs to be looked at.  If it is still going to take the guts of two years to employ somebody then that is a problem.  It should never take that long.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will hear this if he is engaging with hospitals and they say that where they are able to do a localised recruitment campaign, they are able to attract the nurses in.  Letterkenny University Hospital is a case in point.  Dozens of additional nurses will be going into the hospital through a localised recruitment campaign and they will be in place in January.  There is a new ward lying empty in Letterkenny University Hospital because there are no staff to work in it.  That is the problem with the PAS system and the centralisation of recruitment.  We have capital investment in a hospital that is not staffed, that is lying empty and that can accommodate dozens of patients yet the staff to maintain that ward are not there and will not be there until the new year.  That ward is only open to hold the beds when there are 30 or 40 people in the accident and emergency department.  I am sure that is not unique to Letterkenny University Hospital but is replicated elsewhere.</p></speech>

We should also acknowledge that in many instances the PAS is finding it difficult to get the candidates.  The average figure that the Deputy quotes of over 500 days is not solely down to the system.  I acknowledge that there is a need to streamline and improve the system and that is an area of work that the HSE is focused on because I know it has been discussed at the highest level at the Cabinet committee.  There is also an international challenge in attracting candidates into different disciplines within healthcare.  It is not always the case that there are willing candidates but the system is not quick enough or able to assimilate them.  To put the figures in context, at the end of September we had about 130,600 whole-time equivalents in the health service and sanction is in place to increase that to over 141,000.  This is a dramatic scale-up in recruitment across the HSE because we recognise that we have to improve the permanent capacity of the healthcare system.  We have hired about 11,000 new staff across last year and this year and there is more to go.  We will continue to put the resources into this and we will focus on the system to see if there is a way in which we can improve it, while also acknowledging that there is a general problem in attracting candidates to certain posts across the system.</p></speech>

In that context, where is the bonus for front-line workers?  It has been five months since the Taoiseach made an address in New York to say that the Government would bring forward a bonus for front-line workers.  It is two months since he said that it would be finalised shortly.  The Minister has said to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that this needs to be dealt with well before the end of the year and next week we will be into December.  These nurses are in the middle of a fight against Covid in their hospitals again and they are understaffed and looking at Christmas and wondering what leave, if any, they will get.  They are going through another year with no bonus and the Government has not announced a bonus.  How long does it take for the Minister and his colleagues to figure out that our front-line workers should be recognised with a bonus?  The Government has had five months since the Taoiseach publicly made that commitment.  How long more will it take?  This rests on the Minister&rsquo;s desk and it is him who is ultimately responsible for this.  Can the Minister inform the committee when a decision will be arrived at on a bonus?  Has a decision been arrived at or has the Government just dropped the issue?  What will the bonus be?  What will it cost?  Front-line workers in our hospitals are fighting the pandemic every day and we ask them to turn up and put themselves in the bearna baol for the rest of the community.  Surely to God the Government should have made this decision well in advance of coming into this Christmas period.</p></speech>

We are continuing to work on this issue because we need to get it right.  If we do not get it right it could result in unnecessary divisions being opened up and we should seek to avoid that.  There are a number of elements to it, as the Deputy knows, and many of them have been publicly discussed on a number of occasions.  We need to find an appropriate way to remember and commemorate the fact that well over 5,000 people have lost their lives to Covid-19 so far.  As the Deputy knows, the issue of a public holiday has been under consideration and there is the question of the timing of that.  It would have an impact on employers and we need to make sure that adequate notice is given as well.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about who should get a recognition payment, how much it should be and when it should be paid.</p><p>We are considering these issues and it is being actively worked on, not just by me but by a number of colleagues across Government.  We are really conscious that at this very point in time, those front-line workers are once again working in incredibly difficult positions.  Our focus is to help them, and to provide as many resources as we possibly can and do all we can as a Government to stem the tide of this pandemic and get on top of the situation again.  There will be an appropriate moment soon when we can confirm how we are going to address all the issues I touched on.</p><p> I assure the Deputy and all the front-line workers in our healthcare system that this has not been forgotten about.  It is very much a live issue.  Government has been focused on the immediate response that is needed with regard to booster campaigns and adding capacity as best we can across the system.  This issue will be dealt with shortly, however.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach used the same words two months ago.  The Minister said this will be decided well before the end of the year.  There are three weeks of sittings left in the D&aacute;il.  When is this going to be decided on?  Can the Minister outline the work that he is doing?  He has asked all the questions that others are asking but he is the Minister.  What does he need to do to get to a point when he can announce the bonus for front-line workers?  Will this be announced in the next week, or two or three weeks, or is "soon" still a number of months away?</p></speech>

What I will not do is give half an answer.  We will give the full answer when we are ready and when we have all this fully worked through.  It is being actively worked on right across Government and a number of Departments are directly contributing to this work.  It does not sit within any single Department.  As the Deputy indicated, I have said publicly that it should be dealt with well before the year end.  Today is 24 November.  We have a number of weeks to go.  This is actively being worked on.  It will be done shortly and it is a priority for Government.  I am not going to give bits of an answer to different elements of it.  When we confirm the position, it will be the complete and final position.  It remains a work in progress, therefore, and we are almost there.</p></speech>

Before we go into the formal acceptance of the Estimates and so on, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to report No. 42 from 2007 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service and non-payment to health service senior managers, serving and retired.  That report was provided to Government but there has been little or no action on it.  The individuals concerned, many of whom are retired now, have written numerous times to senior officials and, indeed, some Ministers, to get some sort of action with regard to the implementation of the recommendation.  That was in 2007.  It has continued since then.  There was a Labour Court ruling on it in 2011.  All these individuals are still campaigning on the solution that was found through the Labour Court process, which was recommended by the review body on higher remuneration.  When are these individual likely to get paid, given that the Minister is bringing forward Estimates now that will bring us to the end of 2021?  They do not seem to be included in this either.</p></speech>

He will have to forgive me for not being familiar with report No. 42 of 2007 from the review body.  I believe it relates to orthodontics.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#E00600"><p>No, it relates to managers within the HSE or health service or whatever it was at that time in 2007.  It affects payment to health service senior managers, serving and retired.  The recommendation was made and, as I said, it went through the Labour Court hearing.  It was upheld and both sides seem to have accepted it.</p> <p>  Since then, what I find very disturbing about the whole thing is that senior officials do not even bother to respond and Ministers over that period did not bother to respond.  Surely, former employees of the State should be at least extended the courtesy of a reply to explain why an accepted report is not being acted on and why they are not being paid.  I met them again recently and it stuck in their craw, as they say down the country, that one Secretary General's pay was increased by &euro;80,000 on a nod yet those who served in the service were denied it; not to that extent of an increase but they were denied what was recommended.</p> <p>  I understand why the Minister would not have this information with him and I did not advise him either that this matter was going to be raised.  Therefore, I accept what he is saying.  I ask in the context of fair play and good manners, however, that the Department should at least reach out to them.  I ask if the Minister to please undertake that.</p></speech>

If there was a Labour Court hearing, it is the practice of the State, where the State is a party to a Labour Court hearing and a recommendation is made, to honour and implement that recommendation.  I will, therefore, take that away.  We have noted report No. 42 of 2007.  I will investigate that and come back to the Chairman directly.</p></speech>

With regard to the overall performance on the Estimates and given the challenges of Covid-19 and many other issues, has the Minister identified any challenges to the public spending targets so far this year insofar as he can see into the future?  The European Commission and others have commented on inflation and the possible impact on budgets, for instance.  Does the Minister see that as a particular problem?  Is it manageable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021112400002#E01000"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan very much for his question regarding the public finance position within the current year.  As the Deputy knows, on budget day we published our updated budgetary forecasts and also our updated macroeconomic forecasts for the next number of years.  It is fair to say that we have witnessed a strong rebound in the Irish economy in recent months.  That has resulted in very strong revenues across a number of different tax heads, in particular VAT and income tax and, of course, corporation tax receipts continue to be particularly strong.  In addition, we have had some underspends in the system but it remains to be seen precisely what the year-end position will be in that regard.</p> <p>  In overall terms, the expenditure that we forecast on budget day for 2021 was of the order if &euro;89.25 billion.  We anticipate that we will come in below that figure; not by an enormous amount but by perhaps &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million.  It depends how Departments complete their programmes between now and the end of the year, particularly on the capital side.  The forecast deficit for this year is significantly reduced from budget day, however.  I believe we estimated it would be of the order of &euro;13 billion versus the figure of approximately &euro;20 billion that was estimated earlier in the year.  Similarly, for next year, there is a significant improvement in the forecast position.  We are, therefore, working on the basis that the recovery of the economy will continue.  If one looks at the forecasts in terms of growth, both modified domestic demand and GNI*, we are forecasting steady and sustained growth over the next number of years, which will result next year, for example, that we will only be borrowing for the public capital investment programme and not even for all of it.  Some of it will be resourced by Revenue for collecting.</p><p>We estimate that we will be back to having a balanced budget position by 2024.  Certainly, we are in a better position than we thought we would be several months ago, but we also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  We are all witnessing that, including with the continuing challenge being posed by Covid-19 and the impact that inevitably has on the Irish economy.  We remain optimistic regarding inflation.  It is posing many challenges, not least for the people we represent and for businesses.  Costs and household bills are increasing for the public, and that is a real challenge.  The overall forecast is that inflation will peak this quarter and then begin to moderate.  As the committee will be aware, we forecast on budget day that the average inflation rate across next year will be just over 2%, at 2.2%.  The European Central Bank, ECB, believes that the underlying inflation position remains stable, and that it will moderate.  It is confident that the rate of inflation will stay within what the committee members will know is the bank's overall objective of containing inflation to no more than 2% in future.  </p><p> Overall, then, there are many challenges.  From representatives of businesses, I am hearing about staff shortages, increasing costs, global supply challenges and rising energy bills.  Those are the main issues that will present challenges for us in the short term.  We are, however, seeing a strong recovery.  Therefore, we are optimistic, but we must also acknowledge that there is a high degree of uncertainty.  In addition, we also have the issue of Brexit to deal with.  The threat we have heard in that regard from the UK Government concerning the triggering of Article 16 is another potential downside risk for the Irish economy, depending on how that plays out in the weeks and months ahead.</p></speech>

This topic is an important one that was suggested by Deputy Pringle.  All witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee this afternoon, from a location outside of the Leinster House precincts.  I welcome them to the meeting.  We are joined by Mr. John Farrelly and Ms Orla Keane from the Mental Health Commission; Mr. Bernard Joyce, director, and Ms Jacinta Brack, co-ordinator of advocacy and communications, from the Irish Traveller Movement; Dr. Salome Mbugua, CEO, and Ms Leina Ibnouf, development officer of AkiDwA; Ms Collette O'Regan, senior training and advocacy co-ordinator of LGBT Ireland; Mr. Deagl&aacute;n &Oacute; Briain and Ms Mary O'Regan, both principal officers from the Department of Justice.  I thank the witnesses for being here.</p><p>I invite the witnesses to unmute their devices to allow the sound to feed into the committee room.  I presume they can all hear me and there are no difficulties.  They might stay on mute while they are not speaking and then unmute themselves accordingly.  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves so they are not contributing to any background feedback.  I ask that they would use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p><p>Before I invite witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I must make them aware of the following note regarding parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask members who are participating remotely from Leinster House to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When they are speaking, I ask that where possible they have their camera switched on and to be mindful that we are in public session.  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they are physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to that constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who tries to participate in this meeting from outside the precincts will be refused.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  Any deviation on these matters will be addressed through the Chair.  The provisions of standing orders in relation to matters which are <i>sub judice</i>place an onus on members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might affect or prejudice the outcome of a court decision.  Therefore, we cannot admit any discussion or questioning which relates to any current litigation or court proceedings in the course of this meeting.</p><p>I will invite each organisation in turn to make an opening statement for a maximum of three minutes.  Once all the opening statements have been delivered, I will then call on members of the committee, in the order they indicate, to put their questions.  We are not trying to close the contributors down.  We just have a very short window for being able to hold physical meetings because of Covid.  Even though we are participating remotely, we are also physically in a room together.  That is the constraint.  Witnesses should please take it as read that we have the statements and members have read them in preparation for the meeting.  We invite the witnesses to make their opening comments as much for the benefit of the people watching as for members of the committee.</p><p>I invite Mr. Farrelly to make his opening statement.  He has three minutes.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Orla Keane, general counsel for the commission.</p> <p>  The commission is an independent statutory body established in April 2002 under the provisions of the Mental Health Act.  The principal functions of the commission are to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to take all reasonable steps to protect the interests of persons detained in approved centres.  We also register and monitor the provision of inpatient mental health services in the State.</p> <p>  The remit of the commission was extended by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides for the establishment of the decision support service next year.  Our vision is the highest quality mental health and decision support services underpinned by a person's human rights.</p> <p>  In our submission, we focused on the interaction of people with mental illness and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  People with mental illness represent a growing minority in Ireland and although there have been significant improvements in the attitude towards and treatment of people with mental illness in the justice system, significant barriers still remain.  In 2009, the commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued the Report of the Joint Working Group on Mental Health Services and the Police.  That report made a number of recommendations including the creation of a 24-7 statutory social work service, expanded training for members of the Garda and the implementation of adequate diversion programmes to deal with minor criminal matters involving individuals with mental health problems.  Twelve years later many of the recommendations have not yet come to fruition.  At most, we can say that there has been some limited expansion of training for garda&iacute;, but not to the level required.</p> <p>  Furthermore, since sending the committee the commission's submission, Dr. Susan Finnerty, the Inspector of Mental Health Services, has published her report on Access to Mental Health Services for People in the Criminal Justice System, which raises various concerns and makes recommendations.  One issue which we focused on in the submission was the increased volume of applications made under the 2001 Act by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, more specifically, the increased use of section 12 of the Mental Health Act, which gives a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the power to take a person into custody if he or she believes that a person is suffering from a mental disorder and that because of the mental disorder there is a serious likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons.  Although section 12 was enacted with the expectation that it would be used in exceptional circumstances, there has been a worrying increase in the volume of section 12 applications made.  The most recent figures show a 5% increase in the number of section 12 applications made in 2021 as compared to 2020.</p><p> The commission is glad to note that the general scheme to amend the 2001 Mental Health Act includes amendments to sections 9 and 12 which will mean that only authorised officers will make applications in the future.  However, this does not remove the impetus to make further improvements as it stands.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na still remains the only agency immediately available, day and night, to respond to crises in the community.  The limited training and support available to the force creates a situation where the most vulnerable in our society are being failed.</p><p> The commission met with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July and is awaiting further information on a number of matters raised at that meeting.  We have offered to assist with to the expansion of Garda training in mental health matters and it is our hope that through increased training and the implementation of an adequate diversion system by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE, we can improve the experience of people with mental illness who interact with the justice system and that such people will receive appropriate treatment.</p><p> As outlined in our submission, we have had a number of stakeholder initiatives.  We have met organisations like Cairde already and will be meeting Pavee Point in December.</p></speech>

There are many and very particular barriers for Travellers in accessing legal support and justice.  Shortcomings in the civil legal aid scheme limit its scope in terms of providing representation on accommodation, on discrimination under the Equal Status Acts, access to services, housing, education, for social welfare appeals and in employment cases.  There are also restrictions in the scheme under section 28 of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 where someone is served with an eviction notice.  Travellers also have significant difficulties in accessing private legal services such as those provided by solicitors because of the enormous costs involved.  Furthermore, solicitors are often biased or prejudiced towards the community and have been found wanting in this area.  There is a lack of cultural competency within the service and many are not familiar with specialised equality cases involving Travellers.</p> <p>  There is no specialised Traveller law centre in Ireland and no collective data set to work from.  Therefore, the extent of Traveller&rsquo;s legal needs are systemically undermined.  The role in representation before the courts and tribunals played by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and more recently by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, Traveller legal service and independent law centres, is critical but inadequate relative to the demand.  There is need for a State supported independent law centre for Travellers.  This is supported by the Council of Europe which, in 2017, made four overarching recommendations to member states under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights given Traveller and Roma's distinct and intersectional need for access to justice across the European Union.</p> <p>  The Irish Traveller Movement has long reported concerns regarding a review of hate crime legislation and we welcome the work in this area.  We also endorse the campaign for a review of the Equal Status Act, given the context outlined here.  We want to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to some very notable barriers for Travellers in legal instruments, namely the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 2003 to 2008, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  We have called for review of Section 19 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003.  Cases against licensed premises were diverted to the District Court from the Equality Tribunal which has had a significant impact on Travellers who had referred most of those complaints.  Since then, there as been a significant reduction in complaints taken.  Court records show that in 2016, 26 out of 28 applications to the District Court under Section 19 were lodged by Travellers, with 27 out of 28 of being struck out, withdrawn or adjourned while in 2017, of the 51 out of 52 cases taken by Travellers, 50 were struck off, withdrawn or adjourned.  In noting this alarming decrease, the Advisory Committee to the Framework Convention on National Minorities, in 2018, and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in 2019, called on the State to change the existing procedure before the District Court or to provide an alternative mechanism so that victims of discrimination have the same procedural guarantees as those of an anti-discrimination body.</p> <p>  For discrimination cases at the point of entry taken to the Work Place Relations Commission, WRC, the burden of proof is too gruelling for Travellers.  Given that discrimination is so widespread, it is almost impossible to give practical effect or remedy where immediate redress is required.  For example, venues cancelling for special occasions like weddings, christenings or communions at the last minute causes a financial burden and emotional upheaval but is so frequent that Travellers no longer report or take cases.  The system itself is such that it acts as a disincentive to taking equality cases.  Additionally-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Salome Mbugua" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021112400002#B00700"><p>Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  I am joined by colleague, Ms Leina Ibnouf, from AkiDwA, which was established in 2001.  Our work is informed by migrant women through service provision, outreach, networking, and research.  Migrant women's access to justice is rendered by many factors which are intersectional based on their race, gender and ethnic background.  Given their particular racial and gender-based needs and challenges, migrant women have reported to AkiDwA on their experience of racism and discrimination while trying to access legal services or enter into legal service provision, including verbal abuse, intimidation, disbelief, mistranslation and culturally insensitive behaviour.</p> <p>  Allow me to share with the committee some of the experiences of migrant women as a minority group engaging with the structures and institutional apparatus of the justice system in Ireland.  Based on our work with migrant women, we have noted an under-reporting of crimes.  Women do not come forward to report.  AkiDwA members have experienced a lack of cultural understanding among legal service providers and a lack of awareness of culturally sensitive issues which leads to misunderstandings, negative perceptions and stereotypes which hinder delivery of proper support and services.  Complaints have been made about poor service from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and racial profiling is still a problem.</p> <p>  Many migrant women struggle to access information about legal services in Ireland.  As a result, many do not know where or how to receive legal assistance or access justice in Ireland.  The legal and justice systems in Ireland are very different to what many migrant women are used to.  A lack of awareness of their rights including legal rights and protections in the context of domestic violence, hampers them.</p> <p>  I will now focus on issues facing migrant women as minorities engaging with the justice system.  An area of enormous concern to our members is that of immigration and asylum.  There are particular legal issues facing refugee women and those in direct provision centres, especially surrounding the asylum and interview processes.  This includes long delays in the application process, without definitive decision dates which causes demoralisation and damages women's mental health and well-being.</p> <p>  Another key area of concern for IkiDwA is sexual and gender-based violence.  So many women are affected by such violence, as is clear from reports from Women's Aid but their legal status is a particular issue for those women who depend on their husbands to be able to stay in this country.  We also have a problem with the habitual residency condition which means that many women find themselves destitute, together with their children.  While Ireland has a policy which allows to women in abusive relationships to apply for legal resident status independent of their abuser, this is at ministerial discretion and not on a statutory footing.  There should be an urgent review of all policies that hamper women in terms of safety and equality.</p> <p>  AkiDwA also empowers professionals and front-line staff working with migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women to understand cultural differences.  We also work with many women who have been affected by female genital mutilation, FGM.  While we appreciate that we have the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 in Ireland, we still do not have a national action plan to address FGM in Ireland.  Trafficking is also a huge problem, and many migrant women are treated as criminals when they are caught.  They are not supported to relate their experiences or to tell what has happened to them during the trafficking process.</p><p>Access to legal supports and services are limited for these women, sometimes due to language barriers, fear of alienation, lack of cultural competency or fear of stigma due to cultural and religious traditions.  There is a need to increase legal support and to provide access to appropriate interpretation and support facilities.  There are many others issues we would like to bring to attention of the committee.  These can be seen in our report.  We have not even mentioned the victims of racism.  We welcome any questions in that regard.  My colleague, Ms Ibnouf, can answer them because she is working on an organisation called Community Alliance Against Racism.  This will provide victim support for people who are experiencing racism.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I did not spot it immediately but her camera has slipped ever so slightly.  She might adjust it to make sure she is fully included in the room, even if attending remotely.

I will just skim through my opening statement.  LGBT Ireland is a national charitable organisation working to improve the visibility, inclusion and rights of LGBTI+ people living in Ireland and their families through our front-line support services.  These services include national helplines, online chat and face-to-face and online peer support groups.  We learn everything about our community and its members' struggles in accessing justice from these front-line services.</p> <p>  The LGBTI+ community is a target for hate crime and hate incidents.  Our helpline deals with up to 2,000 contacts a year and there is a large amount of engagement through our peer support services.  We have a lot of experience of hate crime and hate incidents.  Some 4% of those contacting the helpline report violence but, anecdotally, we know that this low percentage does not reflect the true scale of homophobic, biphobic, lesbophobic and transphobic violence occurring in Ireland.  This year's Pride season saw rainbow flags being burned in Waterford and Cork and vile homophobic graffiti on a very well-known gay bar in Dublin city.  This can be seen as evidence of the impact of the online far-right, anti-LGBTI+ agenda coming more offline, onto our streets and into our communities and homes.  </p> <p>  Research carried out on our community in 2016 showed high levels of fear of violence and of actual violence, with large percentages of people being threatened or physically assaulted.  Approximately 20% of respondents had been physically assaulted, nearly 15% sexually assaulted and 6% attacked with a weapon because of being LGBT+.  We can also see from that 2016 survey that a large percentage of our community felt very unsafe in publicly showing affection.  They did not feel safe holding hands or showing any affection, which is completely contrary to the experience of our heterosexual peers.  We see those levels of threats of violence and actual violence upheld in a 2019 survey carried out by the hate and hostility research group in the University of Limerick, with one in three respondents having been threatened with violence and one in five being physically attacked because of being LGBT+.  There is a feeling in our community that this is the price of being visible and that we have to expect to endure living with this fear or to actually endure hate crime or hate attacks ourselves.</p> <p>  The legacy of the criminalisation of our community remains very strong.  It presents a strong barrier to our engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We welcome the organisation's national diversity and integration strategy for the period from 2019 to 2021, which focuses on its mission, "Keeping People Safe".  This has led to renewed efforts towards engagement between ourselves and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, there is a lot more work to do in respect of training because levels of reporting remain very low because the legacy of mistrust remains very strong.  It has been there for far too long.  It must also be noted that our community engages in activities which can result in ambiguity as to whether we can approach An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Levels of addiction are high in our community.  Chemsex forms part of its social scene.  LGBTI+ young people are more likely to use drugs and alcohol and constitute a disproportionate share of the young homeless population.  They are vulnerable to substance abuse, to rape and sexual assault and to engaging in prostitution as a means of supporting addictions and other dependencies.  All of those issues make it quite difficult for members of our community to approach An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of the legal issues around some of those aspects of LGBT culture.</p></speech>

I will use this opportunity to again call for a radically different relationships and sexual education programme that is fully inclusive and that is taught from the very earliest stages.  That would be a real means of addressing some of these issues.  For the benefit of witnesses attending today, I will mention that last week we undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the hate crime legislation.  On the day, we had representatives of the migrant community and of Pavee Point, on behalf of the Traveller community, in attendance.  Although we had written submissions, we did not have representatives from disability organisations, LGBTQ organisations or religions.  If any of the witnesses wish to make any points on the general scheme of the hate crime Bill, we are open to that and we will take such points into account.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021112400002#C00500"><p>I welcome all of the witnesses and thank them for their contributions and written statements.  I will ask questions of the groups in the order they spoke.  The Mental Health Commission raised some issues, including in respect of engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It strikes me, and has long struck me, that many of the situations members of the Garda encounter involve individuals who have a mental health issue.  These individuals have been let down by many systems before finally ending up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In many cases, that reflects a failure of early intervention and the inability of the mental health services to cope with the level of demand and the pressure that has been put on them for a long time.  When garda&iacute; end up in that situation, they very often come across an individual who is psychotic or who has a dual diagnosis, that is, someone who has issues with drugs or alcohol in addition to another issue.  The point I am coming relates to the training garda&iacute; need to be able to deal with these multifaceted issues.  The commission mentioned the pilot programme in Limerick in its submission.  Does that programme answer those calls?  Does it work?  Are there lessons to be learned from it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021112400002#C00600"><p>The pilot programme in Limerick still has not started.  There are still questions regarding the budget for it.  That programme would bring in what are known as crisis intervention teams to assist people who are unwell.  A mental illness is an illness.  It is a health issue in the same way as a cancer or any other health issue.  When someone has a mental health problem, they need to be met by people who understand mental health, that is, trained personnel.  I would like to think that, if it happens in Limerick, and it still has not, at the very least, lessons would be learned from putting it in place.  However, I emphasise the recommendations in this regard.  This has been going on for ten or 15 years.  There is no reason these teams should not be in place all over the country at this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021112400002#C00800"><p>Yes, there are examples from all over the world.  There has been a fair bit of research into it.  There are different types of approach but there is no doubt that it works.  During the Covid pandemic, section 12 has been used 10,000 times.  On 10,000 occasions, a garda felt that a person had a mental illness severe enough for them to be a risk to themselves or others.  One would wonder about the capability of a garda to make that decision.  However, if members of the Garda were surrounded by a 24-7 social work service - and we have a lot of social workers, they just do not work around the clock in this area - they could very quickly access the expertise to support them.</p></speech>

Sometimes, there is no space for such individuals in those facilities and they end up being released.  The risk the Garda has highlighted can sometimes come to pass because there is nowhere for these people to go.</p></speech>

I will let my colleague reply to the Deputy's question.  There is a lack of transparency.  The State has the Mental Health Act in place whereby if a person is brought into a mental health unit, there is a rigorous examination, transparency and a vindication of his or her rights.  That transparency is not in place with respect to garda&iacute; using their powers when people go into a station.  I will hand over to our general counsel, who will give the Deputy the exact detail on what is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021112400002#D00200"><p>I am also in charge of the mental health tribunal&rsquo;s team in the Mental Health Commission.  We deal with these issues all the time.  The first point is that 32% of involuntary admissions used the emergency provision - we call it the section 12 provision - last year.  This shows that the statistics are going in the wrong direction.  They should have been decreasing.  We would have expected them to be the exception, not the rule.  The process begins where garda&iacute; have a reasonable belief that somebody is suffering from a mental disorder.  The criterion relating to identifying mental disorder under the Mental Health Act is very complex.  even though we have asked for it, we have no visibility of the exact training garda&iacute; get in that regard.  That is not a criticism of the Garda, which engaged with us very well in July.  We raised questions with the force.  Unfortunately, we have not heard back.  I am sure we will, but we have not heard back from them at this stage.  Then the person is taken into custody.  One of the problems is that there is no specific period set down in the Act regarding how long the person should be in custody.  That is the first problem.</p> <p>  Then the person is seen by a GP.  In 2020, 616 applications went through via section 12 to make people voluntarily detained.  The Garda very openly stated that it initiated 5,700 or so applications under section 12.  There is a gap in that regard.  What happened to the other 5,100 cases?  There is a lack of clarity regarding the pathway and what is happening.  We hope there will be some good news on that front.  The expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act stated that all applications under section 9 should be made by authorised officers and suggested that section 12 should be left there.  The commission recommended that garda&iacute; should not be allowed to make applications under sections 9 or 12.  The Department of Health has taken that on board.  What is now being proposed is that garda&iacute; could take a person into custody but an authorised officer would have to come and make an assessment.</p> <p>  We have also stated that there needs to be a fixed period for which a person can be kept in custody.  If anybody on the committee would like to pursue the issue, we would like the period for the person to be in custody to be reduced to the minimum.  A person detained for being drunk and disorderly or because he or she is suspected of drink-driving is only taken into custody for three hours.  For a person who is detained on foot of a mental health issue, there is no set period as regards how long he or she can be in custody.  The period currently being suggested is 12 or 24 hours.  We are saying that it needs to be an awful lot less.</p> <p>  There has been progress.  Garda&iacute; would welcome that they would have a role but that they would not make the involuntary applications because they would accept, from a human rights point of view, that the person who should be making those assessments should be someone with a health or healthcare qualification.  The matter should be dealt with in the same way as that relating to a person with any other healthcare issue.  I hope that assists the Deputy.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses, including Mr. Farrelly and Ms Keane, whom I remember from my time in University College Dublin, UCD.  I have a few questions for Mr. Farrelly and Ms Keane in particular.  I have two brief questions.  Is an authorised officer an inspector or superintendent or is it somebody with training?  Ms Keane asked us to ensure that a person with a mental health issue would be in custody for the minimum period.  Does she want it reduced to three hours?  What specific period does she envisage?</p> <p>  When I worked in the courts over the years, I came across prisoners who clearly had mental health difficulties, which would lead to them not having an address or bail money.  Initially, they would be remanded in custody for a week.  This also applied to section 4 detentions where someone is arrested for questioning.  One would have had concerns about his or her mental health but would not have been able to give a reasonable or qualified assessment as to whether the person had capacity to make decisions either when he or she was arrested and placed in detention or when he or she was being remanded in custody for a week.  That person would often come back from prison having spent a week in custody and even though one might have asked for an assessment to be taken of his or her mental health, nothing was done in prison.  The person would often be remanded for another week or two weeks, and nothing was done for a period.  Has there been any engagement with the prisons to ensure that such persons are seen by a psychiatrist, which would assist their legal representatives in making a decision as to whether they have capacity?  One is sometimes boxed into a corner when a client states that he or she wants to get out of jail by way of pleading guilty to a charge and one is not sure whether he or she has the capacity to do that.  My question is whether there has been engagement with the prisons to ensure that access to psychiatric services will be made available to those people.</p></speech>

We would like the period a person would be in custody to be reduced to the minimum time possible.  Three hours or a maximum of six hours, for example, but not 12 or 24 hours.  An authorised officer is defined in the current legislation as an officer of an grade determined by the HSE.  The proposal under the forthcoming amended legislation is that the Mental Health Commission would set a code of practice regarding authorised officers and would deem who would be appropriate.  Hopefully, that answers those two questions.  I will hand over to Mr. Farrelly.</p></speech>

We just published a report entitled Access to Mental Health Services for People in Criminal Justice System.  I would point to two principles from our end.  People who may have offended because of their mental illness should not enter the criminal justice system; they should be diverted earlier, either by the Garda or the courts, into forensic mental health services.  Those in prison should have the same access as those in the community.  The simple point is they do not have that.</p> <p>  I can imagine in the case of Deputy&rsquo;s client at that time that with respect to the concept of that person getting a capacity assessment in prison, it would have been difficult.  I have walked the remand prison in Cloverhill with the Inspector of Prisons.  I have worked in mental health systems for 35 years, including in the old institutions in Ireland and England, and those are not places persons with mental illness should be put, full stop.</p></speech>

What impact does that have on many people who would not have immigration status here?  Basically, they are here illegally and that is being used as a means of coercion or control.  Is there a fear in that community or among those groups of people who would be exploited in that way that if they came forward they will simply be sent back to the countries they came from?  Does Dr. Mbugua consider that the authorities give sufficient recognition to the difficult and precarious situation these people are in and that they could be supported through that?</p></speech>

I refer to a case in June involving several women.  Some of them have taken off.  Many of them were trapped into this.  In 2019, we had to take a corpse back to a country of origin.  The woman had been sick but felt that she could not come forward due to a fear of being taken back to her country of origin if she said anything.  Most of these women fear that.  There is still a lack of organisation.  Most of the time, women are just kept in there.  They should be supported to recover from what they have gone through so that they can explain what has happened and where.  Quite often, they are treated as criminals.  This needs to have organisations and groups that can respond rapidly working together with the Garda to be able to support such women so that they can come forward.  There are women who are trapped.  Instances of trafficking are well hidden and may just come to light when the women are in trouble or sick or the situation is really unbearable and they are unable to stick it.  It is still a huge problem.</p></speech>

I missed some of the points made but I have read the opening statements.</p> <p>  I refer to the just a minute, JAM, card mentioned in the submission from the Courts Service.  It can be used by people with certain intellectual or learning disabilities or autism or whatever it might be in circumstances where they just need a moment to formulate their thoughts or say what they need to say to a judge, a garda or whomever it may be.  I am a practising barrister who works regularly in the courts.  I had never heard of this card before.  What has the experience of our guests been?  Have they found that system is in place or being used by people who need to use it?  Is it effective?  Those questions are not directed to any of the witnesses in particular.  I do not know if any of them have seen the card or had cause to see it being used in the Courts Service.  No response is forthcoming.  That is what I was afraid the answer would be.</p> <p>  I refer to attitudes in the courtroom.  Some of our guests referred to an understanding of cultural differences, interpretive differences and understanding that certain people have when they are before a court.  On the whole, we have a good system.  In general, judges are very fair.  Notwithstanding that, there are attitudinal problems within some of the officialdom within the Courts Service toward particular groups.  For example, I have thought for a long time that there should be specific judicial training in this area.  I know that judges meet every year and have conferences and things like that.  The committee recently spoke about the need for training for barristers in terms of dealing with vulnerable witnesses in the context of sex offences, for example.  Is there a need for training for lawyers, but particularly for garda&iacute; and judges in the context of court cases to understand the perspectives of vulnerable people who come before the courts?  How would our guests give effect to that training?  I do not know if any of our guests wish to deal with that.</p></speech>

I mentioned some of these themes in my presentation.  This is a major issue, especially for the women who are vulnerable when they end up in court or are with a lawyer.  Sometimes they do not even disclose exactly what happened to them, especially in situations of gender-specific harm, such as rape.  It may relate to something that happened while they were here.  Some of them still fear speaking out or saying what happened to them.  There are also problems with the language barrier.  As I said, some of the women feel misunderstood even when they express themselves because of the way they speak, so most of them prefer to keep quiet.</p> <p>  I totally believe it is very important to have training.  At the moment, my organisation is delivering what we call culture competence training.  It is about people understanding working across different cultures and how people behave and react to different things, but also to address the unconscious bias that might exist and the assumptions people may have in respect of people from a different background.  It would be very important for the committee to help us in that aspect of ensuring lawyers and others working in the courts are trained to understand working across cultures.  Such training is very important so that they can provide the kind of effective support that is needed for the people who present themselves.  I thank the Senator.</p></speech>

We cannot overestimate the importance of training or the lack of training across many of our core systems and the legal system in particular.  We would love it if some of our community could take some of what is happening to them to court, but they do not get that far.  They do not even get to engage with the Garda.  I am thinking in particular about gay men of a certain age or even butch-presenting lesbians and trans people.  They will just avoid at all costs reporting what is happening to them for fear of being disrespected when they are feeling most vulnerable.  It is almost like a re-traumatising, which I know often happens to other vulnerable victims of crime.  Even thinking about reporting and going into a Garda station not knowing who you will meet or how they will treat you is a massive barrier.  People have a store of research evidence and a lot of anecdotal evidence of negative experiences in that regard.  There is a need for training.  We are doing training with the Garda and it is only reinforcing my belief that so much training needs to happen.  I refer to the remarks of Dr. Mbugua in respect of unconscious bias.  Most people who are not living the daily life of the minority identity really do not have a felt sense of what the issues are.  That is the reality.  It is not their fault.  How would they know?  They need to be trained to know because they have a duty of care and we are finding it very hard to experience that duty of care in a positive way at the moment.</p></speech>

The courts system is an intimidating and challenging place for people, in terms of barristers, lawyers, judges, etc.  It is very far removed from the ordinary person's experience.  Even the way people dress in the High Court system is very intimidating.  There is an elite system in place, which I think is ridiculous in some ways.  It is so far removed from the ordinary person's experience, and it does not need to be like that.  At the same time, on the question of whether training is needed, it absolutely is needed.  It needs to happen in the context of access, culture and Irish Travellers, who find themselves on the receiving end of the courts system and decisions that are made.  In fact, looking at representation in the criminal justice system or civil law, Travellers end up coming out on the wrong end.  It is a very uneven system.  It is like David and Goliath.  It is very much opposed to those who are on the fringes, marginalised or excluded.  On top of that, currently, there is institutional discriminatory practice in place.  Human rights bodies across Europe, such as the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, have made key recommendations.  We have also made key recommendations in our submission on the type of training required for solicitors, barristers and judges.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to speak more to the Irish Traveller movement and civil legal aid and, in particular, to outline where the roadblocks are and what changes we could make.

It would be helpful if the witnesses could outline concrete issues that we could talk about in that review that we would like to see changed at the end.</p> <p>  I also have a question for the representatives from AkiDwA around the trafficking issue.  It is basically the same issue.  Our approach to human trafficking in this country is appalling.  We keep tumbling down the ratings in the Trafficking in Persons, TIP, report.  We are a tier 2 watch-list country for the second year.  We are headed towards an automatic tier 3, which is quite worrying.  What roadblocks do people face when they try to engage with that system and seek help?  What concrete changes do we need to make?  I will start with those two questions and ask another if there is time.</p></speech>

Travellers encounter many blockages in the civil legal aid system.  One, in particular, is that under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, there are restrictions to taking cases around access to services such as housing and education and for social welfare appeals, as well as employment cases.  Given the frequency with which Travellers need recourse in the area of equality law, that becomes a big problem, not least because many Travellers have difficulty, for instance, looking for private services due to the cost, but also because often Travellers are discriminated against in those services.  Therefore, automatically, there are particular exclusions.  We welcome the fact that the equality Acts are currently being reviewed.  That is really important.<br/><br/>There are other significant barriers, such as the restrictions under section 28 of the Act, including cases where a person is served with an eviction notice.  This, as we know, disproportionately impacts on Travellers who cannot access that support.  We have made many recommendations in the submission to the committee.  There is a particular barrier to Travellers in matters relating to eviction.  If we could draw that to the attention of members later, we would welcome the opportunity to do so.  The accessing of private legal services is difficult for Travellers on the basis of cost and also on the basis of the lack of cultural competency that exists within the service.<br/><br/>We have been told by the community that when they go to access legal aid, very often they are met either with hostility, indifference or an unfamiliarity on the part of the people they encounter, even at the point of entry of those services, who are not familiar with the type of law that Travellers want to access, namely, equality law.  That is something we know needs to be reformed and reviewed, at least.  Often, what happens in the meantime is that Traveller organisations have to act as <i>amici</i>in various quasi-tribunals, for instance, the WRC.  Also, as Mr. Joyce mentioned, the services are fragmented and there is no specialised legal service for Travellers or a single body that collects data from which to work.  That has obviously undermined the extent to which Travellers access legal services.  One of the recommendations that we have made to the committee is to resource the establishment of a Traveller independent law centre in order to service the national demand.</p></speech>

First, victims will not be familiar with the law in Ireland, how to approach garda&iacute;, what to say and do, and how to protect themselves.  They are completely unaware.  There is no advocacy from the solicitors to address this problem.  For example, if a woman affected by trafficking comes to a Garda station, which is very rare, she will not find staff who specialise in human trafficking.  She will usually encounter junior sergeants who are not aware of the issue or how to deal with it.  As Dr. Mbugua said, there is a lack of cultural competency.  Therefore the victim I referred to will feel she is not listened to.  She has been humiliated, rejected and is in danger.  It is most likely that her case will not proceed to the next step, which is the decision to legally prosecute.  This sends a message to other people who are suffering and are victims of this crime that there is no hope and no point in trying.  The victim is risking her life by being up-front about her case.  It is a very sensitive and delicate issue to deal with.  The victims really lack support.  They are completely isolated.  They do not have financial independence and do not know the law or who to approach.  Even garda&iacute; are not equipped to deal with their needs and complaints.  Therefore, unfortunately, because gangs are involved, it is most likely that a victim who is successful in bringing her case to light will be killed, at some stage, in trafficking.  That is why we do not have whole A-to-Z procedure for human trafficking cases.  The process is always cut short, for one reason or another.  Perhaps Dr. Mbugua, who has expertise in this area, can add to that.</p></speech>

I have a few short questions before we begin a second round.  They concern Garda training and the specifics of it.  I visited Dolphin House yesterday, where much of the family law and childcare law is taken care of.  Women's Aid and Men's Aid Ireland also have offices there.</p><p>We were talking about the need for a liaison officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be able to receive complaints from people who were disclosing abuse or identifying risky situations.  We talked about a liaison officer from Tusla too, although I think there is a slightly stronger presence there.  We talked about the training that had been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of dealing with domestic violence and coercive control.  There are new offences relating to coercive control and coercive behaviours.  There has been a roll-out of protective services units throughout An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's various divisions.  Part of the training was interrupted by Covid, including the physical training being delivered.  It is very different when delivered online.  There is a solid training programme, although it could be expanded.  I am interested in the details of the training that need to be provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Templemore and on an ongoing basis.  The witnesses have all talked about training.  What is the detail and what do they need to hear?</p></speech>

I cannot stress enough that there is a perception across society that everything is now fine for LGBT+ people ever since marriage equality came into effect.  We are not denying how positive and fantastic that was.  It has created a roadblock in people's minds to hear that LGBT+ people are still struggling a lot.  It is interesting that the Vice Chair referred to online training.  Much of the training requires a strong experiential dimension.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to engage in experiential learning whereby they get to feel, from the inside out, what it is like to walk the walk of that identity.  That can happen in a 20- or 30-minute exercise.  Once they do that, the atmosphere in the training changes, because they get it.  It is a Eureka moment and they get it.  That is important.</p> <p>  The LGBT+ sector is working with the Garda strategy implementation oversight committee.  We are developing training resources.  We are developing a series of videos for garda&iacute; of experiences that members of our community have had.  They are short videos.  Garda&iacute; can see somebody who is gay, lesbian or trans, and hear their story or experience, some of which is positive, though usually it is not so positive.  We then have to engage with that.  I did it about three weeks ago with diversity liaison officers, who are meant to be the officers who we go to.  The level of defensiveness two years into the strategy left me really demoralised.  We have much work to do.  They have to have felt an experience, because otherwise it is too abstract.</p></speech>

I want to bring in the other groups.  I was on the radio today with a gentleman called Cathal O'Sullivan, who is a member of the LGBT community.  He was going into schools to talk about sex education from his perspective and what it was like for him going through school.  Ms O'Regan referred to experience.  We are naturally empathetic.  Telling stories about each other and each other's experiences is a good way of training, but it is practically impossible online, as we can see.</p></speech>

We have to start where garda&iacute; are.  At the moment, from the lived experience of Travellers and their dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there have been tensions in the past, but the attitudes of garda&iacute; towards the Traveller community can be poor.  There are issues from the point of entry to training and the type of training that garda&iacute; do.  At the moment, the training is probably completely inadequate and not fit for purpose.  I do not know if that resonates with other members here.  Doing three hours or six hours of training is by no means going to be sufficient to equip them to deal with the community they serve.  The other side of that is that garda&iacute; are not particularly diversified.  I do not see members of the Traveller community in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which does not give me much confidence, nor do I see members of other minority groups.  The training and policing are dominated by white males.  There needs to be a significant change.  The Garda needs to become a modern service that reflects the society it polices.  We are part of a diverse society.  Travellers make up less than 1% of the population but find themselves in some ways over-represented in dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We need to change that.</p> <p>  Some training is taking place in Templemore.  We are not part of that but we would like to be.  We would like to see more physical engagement post Covid-19, which is about the community going in to carry out particular modules along with other minority groups.  It has to be embedded in training and not seen as a once-off.</p></speech>

I am out of time and have to keep myself to the time allotted.  It is lovely to hear other people's children in the back of Zoom calls as much as my own.  It is all very normal.

One issue that came up frequently was that of interpreters and translation services.  What is AkiDwA's experience of translation and interpreter services?  Are there examples of where it worked well?  The experience from the other side seemed to be negative but if there is an example of where it worked well, we might understand how to improve it, as well as the general experience, even if it is incredibly poor.</p></speech>

It is provided, for example, by Women's Aid and others who provide services.  Sometimes it can go very wrong.  I will give the example of some cases that we have had.  For example, a woman might have experienced gender-specific harm and be brought a translator who is a young man.  It does not work and it is not culturally appropriate.  It is very difficult when that happens.  We have also had issues where children are translating for their parents and there are issues of domestic violence.  This is unacceptable.  There have been examples of where children have to translate in hospitals because a parent cannot speak the language.  There have been some good situations.  For example, there was training in 2018 in order that people could understand the consequences of female genital mutilation.  In fact, the family was able to identify someone who wanted to translate.</p> <p>  When people go for their international protection hearings, some people translate different things from what is being said.  It is important that it is made clear that these have to be people who are competent enough to translate properly, particularly in view of the risk to the life of another person.  We have had very good stories and very bad ones.  Sometimes they are mostly bad.  We need proper translators to be able to translate for various groups and different people with different needs.  There are organisations and groups that can support this process.  It is important that the right people do so.</p></speech>

I have had some positive experiences with translators.</p><p>In my professional work I also have had some negative experiences, including the classic whereby the person one is trying to speak to will talk for five minutes and the translator will offer a one word response.  Certainly, in the context of access to justice, we all need to be drilling into this more.</p></speech>

I believe there are a lot of flaws in it that may not apply to this committee meeting, but specifically I wish to raise the issue of trial by a jury of one's peers and the diversity of juries, in the context of the various groups that are meeting here.  When we look at juries they tend to be relatively homogenous.  There is generally a good gender divide but not so much ethnic diversity, for example, in relation to the Traveller community.  Other aspects such as sexual orientation are obviously very difficult to divine while sitting in a courtroom.  Do any of the witnesses believe there is a piece of work that could be done by the Courts Service in achieving greater diversity and thereby greater fairness in the jury make-up system?</p></speech>

For a diversified courts system, part of that is the importance of the culture of competency training for the judges, barristers and solicitors, as the Vice Chairman has talked about.  It is also for the courts to diversify that to ensure that under trial by jury one tries, as much as possible, to diversify the juries in terms or other minority groups, including Travellers and others.  We need to have a system in order to do that but it has to be something as society's diversity increases.  I am not aware that any Travellers have actually sat on a jury.  It is probably none.  To highlight that, whether it is a small court case or any case, nobody has ever indicated to me, in the course of my 30 years of work, that he or she ever sat on a jury.  That indicates a lot.</p></speech>

They feel more easily able to disclose who they are if they see diversity.  Basically, workplace inclusion leads to inclusive practices, inclusive conversations and inclusive language, which makes it easier for people coming into the services to pick up on that and then to engage with that.  I agree that it might be hard for a jury member to come out and say, as part of the preparation, "I have not been on a jury before and I do not know what kinds of conversation or preparation happen".  It might be hard but it could happen.  If it was me, for example, I might be strong and resilient enough to put it out there and say "This is part of who I am."  I am sure that Mr. Joyce would know if there had been a Traveller on a jury, but I hear that it is easier for Travellers to come out as gay than it is to come out as Travellers.  It is possible that Travellers have been on jury duty and simply remained in the closet as Travellers, as lesbian, gay, bi- and trans people would have done as well.  This really speaks to how we create inclusive cultures in our workplaces and services.  The people who come into those services pick that up and also say who they are.  We can also get more familiar and make it a little bit more inclusive to ask questions of everyone around sexual orientation and gender identity issues; it should not be the case that you are just asking some people, you should be asking everybody.  These are simple things we can do to normalise bringing these issues into everyday contexts.</p></speech>

I did not want to emphasise the need to ensure that they are included in the jury, because we do receive the letters.  I too received one some time back.  To get onto the jury itself however is next to impossible because one goes to the court, stays and then is not called in.  It would be important to ensure that there is good representation.  Maybe a proportional system could be introduced to at least have two people on the jury from different backgrounds.  Perhaps one cannot represent or cover all of the grounds where people experience discrimination, but it is definitely important that we have representation in those juries.</p></speech>

Are there any other questions?  No.</p> <p>  As the Vice Chairman has said, there are some questions from Senator Ruane, which I will ask now.  We may have covered some of these but it is good to ask them anyway. One question is for the Irish Traveller Movement and for AkiDwA.  What is the implication of the low level of trust between the Garda and minority communities on their engagement with the criminal justice system and how can we rebuild that trust?</p></speech>

Racial profiling and an inconsistent response to the community where policing is required, sometimes during times of trauma and bereavement, have impacted on some parts of Travellers' ability to have confidence in policing supports and police protection.  In addition, we are aware that the findings of a relevant study undertaken in 2014 were unpublished, but it was highlighted by a journalist in 2020.  The Garda ethnic liaison officer found high levels of negative attitudes towards Travellers at the time and established that all of the members of the Garda who were interviewed held those attitudes in advance of taking up positions and remained negative after taking up their positions as serving garda&iacute;.  I highlight here that there is factual information about the ingrained attitudes through which members of the Garda carried out their roles.  On top of this, there is unconscious and conscious bias that has been catalogued in national studies of Travellers' own attitudes, where 70% of Travellers felt discriminated against by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When we consider this, the racial profiling, the experience of the ground and the interaction, there is a lot to be done in order to give confidence.  The first part of giving confidence is that we need to see members of our own community and other minority groups represented within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That gives us confidence and it gives other people confidence.  We also need to see training and it must be transparent, open, and accountable.  It cannot be an <i>ad hoc</i>tokenistic measure covered in the training of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There must be oversight around complaints and the procedures that take place in policing in Ireland.  I am aware that Garda liaison officers are currently <i>in situ</i>, and on that basis it is a start.<br/><br/>The ethnic profiling is significant issue and we really need to get on that with regard to the policing force.  Legislation proscribing racial profiling is absent, along with an independent complaints mechanism.  I will restate this.  We are calling for an independent complaints mechanism to deal with racial profiling and the lack of statistics.</p></speech>

There is a significant lack of trust between the youth and the Garda.  It is important that the youth feel protected and safe but most of the time - Mr. Joyce spoke about racial profiling - it is a big problem among the youth, in particular, black youth, where we even hear them being labelled as black gangs.  They are even labelled to that extent.</p> <p>  There are also some areas in Dublin that have been blacklisted.  Even when they are seen walking around as young people in the area from three upwards, they are targeted, they are stopped sometimes and they are questioned.  Most of them would not even go to report.  I recommend that the Garda and the criminal justice system change the approach that they use because sometimes it comes out as racist towards a specific group, which is quite unfortunate.  Also, they have to be very sensitive in the way they deal, for example, with different ethnic groups and religious groups because we have people with diverse backgrounds and diverse ethnicities as well.</p> <p>  It would be important to work with youth projects, especially from the ethnic minorities, and from the black minority as well, to be able to ensure that they are engaging at the community level.  In particular, community leaders can help them to shape the work with the youth as well.</p> <p>  Previously, my organisation indicated the importance of having a task force for the migrant youth so that they can be able to be supported in a meaningful way by first understanding what are the key issues that are affecting the youth, and then reporting to the criminal justice system as well, because it does not know about so many issues.  We have so many youth ending up in the courts because they do not understand consent.  Consent is a big issue now in Ireland that they should know and understand.  They do not understand so many things because they are coming also from a different, poor background.  They feel they are segregated and targeted and there needs to be a proper way of dealing with it.  A task force for migrant youth would be important, not only for ourselves as migrants but also for the State to be able to ensure that they shape the rights of these youth in a better way rather than bringing problems into the future.  Garda engagement, in an approachable way and in a manner that is understanding to the youth rather than just reacting to them and making assumptions as well, is very important.</p></speech>

The question was not addressed to us but I guess I want to flag up LGBT+ people in direct provision centres because they are incredibly invisible and incredibly vulnerable to sexual violence, physical harassment and violence and bullying with dreadful mental health outcomes for them and they are terrified to call in the Garda.  Mostly, they are closeted inside the direct provision centres and they feel unable to talk to the management to bring in the Garda.  Their first line of defence is always to try to talk to the management.  The management state that it is not their job and they should bring in the Garda.  It does not often meet the threshold of physical violence that will bring the Garda in.  Of course, they are terrified that if the Garda comes in, it will eventually come out that they are LGBT and what has happened to them.  I wanted to flag up a very invisible group who have significant barriers to overcome to access the Garda and who want to call on the Garda but are scared of them at the same time.</p></speech>

When people are at their most vulnerable and they need protection, there have been cases that have been pointed out to us over many years about the response time, not responding, not getting out and not intervening, and as a result serious situations have unfolded on Traveller sites.  The Traveller community needs to feel protected and safe and feel that they are also part of the community.  The values that underpin An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to protect and service and they should protect and serve everybody.  I am not saying they are not doing that but that there have been incidents where the response time has been questionably slow.  That is an important point to add to the conversation here today.</p></speech>

In the absence of a hand going up, I will ask another question from Senator Ruane.  Among her questions, Senator Ruane asked what are the benefits to having an intermediary intervention service between minorities and State agencies.  Perhaps all of the witnesses can, I would emphasise, very briefly, share their experiences of the benefits and potential pitfalls of having an intermediary intervention service between the minorities they support and the State agencies.</p></speech>

Part of one of our calls, and I am sure those of other civil society groups, was having liaison officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of community policing which is significant.  I see that as the pathway.  If I am right, there is not enough investment, support and training.  In fact, this does not get the necessary emphasis or priority.</p> <p>  Community policing is about establishing and building on a relationship but also holding and sustaining the relationships with the community.  Specifically, when we talked about young people here as well, it is about engaging with those young people and giving them confidence.  Before incidents happen, it is about working with youth programmes, community groups, Traveller organisations, migrants and other minority groups, and the LGBT, and then establishing those relationships and looking at how you bring them into the work that is happening.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, if I am right, does not only do policing and has other roles and functions.  It is about building that awareness right across the spectrum.  The Garda diversity plan is also in place and there is an oversight group within that.  That is another opportunity.  Within the Traveller sector, there is a national Traveller Garda advisory committee which the Irish Traveller Movement and the other organisations are part of.  It is establishing those relationships and functions and working with those who are leading in that direction.</p> <p>  Those are the areas which we can build on, complement each other and work together on.  Where there is more engagement, there are more successes.  When we see that, there are absolutely more successes but there can be blind sides.  There are Travellers who are LGBT, there are those who are in direct provision who are LGBT and there are migrants.  It is cross-cutting and inter-sectional.  We need to ensure that is embedded and understood right across the board, including - we talked a little bit about this - in the area of mental health, which is obviously a big issue as well.  We need to ensure that there is a holistic and real approach that is warranted in terms of meeting the needs of today.</p></speech>

The intermediaries need to be from the NGO side as well as from the services side.  As NGOs, we have a lot of casework experience.  We are doing as much as we can on all the issues that come to us but having a dedicated access to justice position in some of our NGOs would resource us to push to get those intermediaries set up and to keep engaged.</p> <p>  Mr. Joyce spoke about community policing.</p><p>It is already happening with diversity liaison officers, where the new strategy is that people get moved on.  Therefore, we are constantly rebuilding relationships.  If people on the NGO side of the equation do not have that institutional knowledge, memory and know-how, then we will not be able to build up expertise and learning as we go.  The NGOs and the services investing in intermediaries is the only way we will be able to make the changes we all want to see.  One side cannot do it on its own.  We must do it together, but we will require additional resources to do it.</p></speech>

The community is key when it comes to engaging with the people experiencing issues on the ground.  We have experienced this in my organisation, for example, when we had problems with where people were residing in residential areas.  Naturally, getting the Garda to work with us as an organisation and then working with the people experiencing these problems, and with the community, was an approach that worked well to turn the problems around there.  Therefore, this approach can work magic.  It can also make our work much easier for all of us, instead of it being a case of having to assume that the Garda and whatever services will do their jobs without having to link up with the groups and organisations on the ground.  It is important to approach issues in this way and it can help to solve most of the problems, and address them with more constancy, rather than just going through the motions and round and round and on and on again in this regard.</p></speech>

Regarding what Ms O'Regan said, I am not sure I properly understood what she was suggesting.  Was she suggesting that people should be polled concerning aspects of their lives that may be diverse, such as sexual orientation or being a member of the Traveller community or an ethnic community?  Other groups of people may have intellectual disabilities or mental health difficulties that may affect jury service, and we encountered issues in the past concerning people who were blind or deaf serving on juries.  Those are major issues for people serving on juries.  My next point is for Dr. Mbugua, but I will let Ms O'Regan answer this question first, because I am not sure I understood her point.</p></speech>

Everyone has a sexual orientation, for example.  The biggest sexual orientation in Ireland is heterosexuality, but heterosexuals never have to speak about their perspective because it is just taken as so normal.  It is the minority people who must speak about their identity.  In the same way, everybody in Ireland has an ethnicity.  White, Irish and settled is the biggest ethnicity here, but we never have to talk about that identity because it is just so normal and such a given in that regard.  That is the powershift that must happen, and we can begin to make that happen.</p> <p>  It will create a great deal of awareness and privilege checking.  It will make invisible privilege very visible, and that will help to make minority people at the table feel a bit more relaxed, because there will be an awareness then that at least the other people there have an understanding that not everyone is the same and that all opinions will be taken into account.  The people in the minority may be able to trust that the attitudes of the other people present will not be hostile.  I say that because that is the fear.  We are always struggling with how we can try to achieve that aim.  One of the easiest and most universal ways of doing this is to ask everybody the same questions.  It may seem uncomfortable to do that, but it will get more comfortable and the majority group must feel a little bit uncomfortable, because they are privileged.  That is where I am going with what I was suggesting.</p></speech>

Would Ms O'Regan be happy if there was also an opportunity for prospective jurors to provide information about their ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other factor they felt was relevant, for inclusion on the jury list?  I do not know if there are GDPR issues in this regard, but would she consider such an approach to be a positive or welcome development?</p></speech>

This is, however, a conversation and an issue worth exploring further.  Perhaps we could talk to others who may be more expert in the legalities of this aspect, but the CSO, for example, includes such questions.  It is, of course, not a guarantee that people will answer the questions honestly.  I suppose people can only feel safe if there is a feeling that everyone has been asked and will answer the same questions.  I am not sure how else we can begin to do this.  Something like this is needed, and if it is not a matter of questions being asked, initially, then I am not sure that people will come.  People may well be there on juries already, but they might be closeted and afraid that if they were to say who they were, the revelations would colour everything else they might say after that and their contributions would be heard in a different way.</p></speech>

From the perspective of being in the courtroom when jurors are being sworn, we always think of the obvious differences.  For example, ethnicity is an obvious one that we can see concerning someone&rsquo;s difference.</p> <p>  Dr. Mbugua said earlier that people who are ethnically different often do not get to serve on juries, or it may be impossible for them to do so.  I do not agree with that because my practical experience is that increasingly, as Ireland is becoming more diverse and, more importantly, as non-Irish people, if I can use that term, those born and living here or those who came here, are becoming citizens, more and more of them are finding their way into jury pools and, consequently, are being selected for juries.  Would Dr. Mbugua also be happy with the idea of people giving advance notice of their ethnicity or something like that?  How does she think that would make people feel?</p></speech>

Returning to the Senator's question regarding ethnicity, it is important.  If we want to get to know who is presenting in this context, how can we know that if we do not collect this information?  From my perspective, therefore, it is important that these questions are asked of everybody, whether they are indigenous Irish, Travellers or LGBTQ people.  It should be a general question posed to everybody.  In that way, we will be able to capture the information required to allow us to be informed regarding how we are doing as a society and as a country.</p></speech>

It is not necessary for someone to be on a jury and to display a T, for example, to specify that they are a Traveller, LGBT, etc., and nor should such information be anybody else&rsquo;s business.  However, what the system should be able to accommodate is the ability to collect data and identify information regarding the diversity of juries.  It should be possible to collect such data over a year to provide insight into how diverse juries are.  It should also be determined what measures must be put in place to address whatever gaps might be found and to improve the court system in future.  There is a real and tangible way in which that can be done, and we have been asking for this for many years in respect of ethnic data being disaggregated across all public bodies, including the courts system and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>There is precedence in other areas and I cannot see why that would not cross over for juries.</p></speech>

I also suspect that if this could be done, people would have to be given the option of whether to disclose the data.  Owing to the range of stigmas we are discussing here, whether it is mental health, ethnic minority status or being from the Traveller or LGBT community, people may not want to disclose that data.  In the initial stages at least, anonymous surveys could be sent to the people who are selected for jury duty, as well as those who are not selected, and one could work on the basis of the data collected.  However, there are probably some basic GDPR issues.</p> <p>  The issue I wanted to raise was training because it is fundamental.  I fully endorse what Ms O'Regan said.  I expect garda&iacute; receive training on mental health but they probably receive a lot of book training, in other words, they will read what this or that section of a book says, but they are not hearing from people with mental health experience.  They could hear from an LGBT person or someone from an ethnic minority who has a mental health issue.  We know that fewer people from the Traveller community are involuntarily detained because we have looked at that issue.  All of the organisations need to hear from those people and meet representatives of these communities.  Unless that is done, they are not going to learn about the issues and if there are fixed attitudes, they are not going to change.  Expanded training and hearing from the people involved are key.</p></speech>

The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is progressing legislation on the position of people with disabilities serving on juries.</p> <p>  The committee might consider recommending that the Courts Service consider ways to make juries more diverse.  As the juries list is effectively derived from the list of D&aacute;il electors, there would be real difficulty in capturing the type of information the committee and witnesses have been discussing by obliging people to disclose their personal characteristics when they register to vote.  There is a real GDPR issue and a question of proportionality with that.  The Department would welcome a recommendation that the Courts Service and the Department look at how we could make juries more diverse.</p></speech>

The high-level task force on mental health is sponsored by the Departments of Justice and Health.  We will meet the Mental Health Commission on its recent report and findings.  The publication is timely because it dovetails well with the work we are pursuing as part of the task force.</p> <p>  On a related matter, we all acknowledge the very complex needs of individuals with severe mental health difficulties, or even difficulties in the milder range, and their interaction with the criminal justice system.  That is to the forefront of the task force.  As the task force progresses its work, one area that is being looked at is diversion.  Depending on the needs of the individual, diversion is important when dealing with people with mental health difficulties and keeping them out of the prison environment, where possible.</p></speech>

For example, most service users, whether they are Irish Travellers or migrants, do not know they have the right to change solicitors or translators.  It is important, therefore, that people are informed of their rights.</p> <p>  The time between court proceedings is too long and very often plays a powerful role in people's mental health.  The time is too long, especially if the case involves domestic abuse, human trafficking or securing asylum.  The length of time between hearings is a form of mental torture because victims feel re-traumatised by having to keep their memories alive and fresh for the case.</p></speech>

The committee could spend a lot of time discussing the impact that the lack of judges is having and the roadblock in the courts.  I have indulged myself by getting on the soapbox about that.  I invite Ms Collette O'Regan, Mr. Joyce, Mr. &Oacute; Briain and a representative of the Mental Health Commission to make final comments before we wrap up the meeting.</p></speech>

I am speaking in particular on behalf of LGBT+ applicants who are spending far too long in a very isolated, closeted and hostile environment in direct provision.  They dread what is going to happen at their interview and wonder how they will explain why they are here.  That is not fair access to justice in terms of their experience of international protection.</p><p>The Department of Justice needs to invest in additional human resources so that people get a fairer and just experience of international protection in a much timelier fashion.  I cannot stress how much better their mental health and well-being would be.  Going back to Mr. Joyce's point, all these things are interconnected and people are battling with multiple struggles at once.</p></speech>

Given that so many people are so far removed from the justice system and they cannot access the justice system, they feel the justice system is against them.  That can be seen in access to services and goods.  In the Traveller community when somebody dies, the community comes together.  Whole towns, pubs and hotels close.  It is horrendous that this can happen in 2021.  It causes trauma, pain and hurt.  People who are coming home to small towns and, in some cases, cities cannot take recourse of action.  I do not know if any other community has experienced that.  It really affects the community.</p> <p>  In addition, that gives a kind of a message of access going against the hope and aspiration of where we should be as a society.  People should have access to services under anti-discrimination legislation.  That is what I was highlighting earlier.  In addition, we have the criminal trespass legislation.  If an Irish Traveller is in movement it is a criminal offence.  They are being criminalised for being a nomadic ethnic group.  As members will know, Travellers were formally recognised as an ethnic group in 2017 by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  However, legislative changes did not come with that.  We still cannot travel on this island, nor do we have any recourse to action on this island when threatened with evictions from public lands across the country.</p> <p>  Many families are living in overcrowded, substandard poor living conditions.  In our submission, the Irish Traveller Movement asked for a special independent service to address that and give the support that is needed.  That needs to be supported with State resources to give confidence to the community that people are entitled to access the services in a culturally appropriate way.  Currently that is not there.</p> <p>  I encourage the committee members to read the submission we submitted.  It is really valuable in terms of what we recommended.  I would be very happy to go back to any members or to any departmental officials after today's committee hearing.  I again thank the committee members for giving us the opportunity to present and discuss the matter which was very helpful.</p></speech>

The particular focus there is on victims of human trafficking, but we would be interested in and open to exploring that model with other groups, either by putting them in contact with the IOM or by having a direct relationship with them.  There is considerable emphasis in the Department on increasing the supports that we provide for victims of crime and access to justice.  We are definitely open to having discussions on whether that cultural mediation model might be extended.  We might work further with the IOM and with other NGOs to do that.</p></speech>

These groups are very poorly resourced.  If a group just goes and gives training and they are not from a specific background that is experiencing issues, it will not make any significant impact.  It is very important that groups and organisations are resourced to be able to raise awareness among the people they reach on the ground and also to be able to support them and to support the service providers in front-line services.</p> <p>  I cannot overemphasise the importance of training that covers a broad range of areas.  My organisation, AkiDwA, has been able to develop training to go into the training package on female genital mutilation, for example.  It is good that it will be already included in the manual that they have.  However, there are so many other areas.  We are talking about cultural competency and so many other things we cannot have as part of that training.  It is very important that the jury, the court and everybody understand about cultural competence and the issues that we are talking about.  It is also important to support young people, in particular young migrants.  It really will save us considerably if we invest in them, in particular.  Our recommendation on the task force for youth would be very important to be able to explore the issues and how those issues can be handled.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting us and talking with us.  This is a good beginning in discussing these issues and how we can move forward.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of Mayo County Council and I am joined by Ms Catherine McConnell, director of services who has responsibility for planning; and Mr. Tom Gilligan, director of services who has responsibility for housing.  I thank to the committee for the opportunity to participate in this discussion on housing and physical planning in Gaeltacht areas.  Mayo is one of only seven counties in the State with a designated Gaeltacht and we are proud of our language and Gaeltacht traditions and of the people who have kept these alive.  Members will no doubt be aware that the Mayo Gaeltacht, like some other Gaeltacht areas, has experienced the impact of emigration and population decline over the centuries.<br/><br/>Our submission outlines the Gaeltacht in Mayo in terms of location, extent and population trends, as well as highlighting relevant policies of Mayo County Council that impact on the Gaeltacht as set out in the current and draft Mayo county development plans and the local economic and community plan, together with council housing policy and delivery in Gaeltacht areas.  We include maps which show the population density in the county as well as the population change from 1996 to 2016.  As is evident from these maps, the Gaeltacht is largely characterised by low population density, which is no doubt impacted by the nature of the terrain in the Gaeltacht areas, with uplands and mountainous and poor quality land and areas that are geographically distant and poorly connected to the key centres of population.<br/><br/>The county development plan is a land-use plan which sets out a vision and an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the county for a six-year period.  The policies and objectives directly relating to the Gaeltacht include the objective:</p> <blockquote> 	To strengthen the unique linguistic and cultural heritage of Gaeltacht Mhaigh &Eacute;o, by supporting and facilitating improved physical, social and economic infrastructure at appropriate locations throughout the Gaeltacht areas and [requiring] a Language Impact Statement in respect of significant developments within or close to Gaeltacht areas, or where deemed appropriate, to determine their impact on the usage of Irish as the community language. </blockquote> <p>The general policies and objectives that apply throughout the county also apply to Gaeltacht areas, such as those relating to new rural residential developments, environmentally sensitive designations, scenic routes and sensitive landscapes.  The county development plan contains planning policies in relation to rural areas under strong urban pressure in Mayo but our Gaeltacht areas are not affected by this designation or any of the restrictions therein.  In the current draft county development plan, no restrictions apply to the development of housing in the Mayo Gaeltacht, other than those that apply universally due to environmental, landscape protection, road safety or normal planning constraints.  However, as previously set out, the Gaeltacht areas tend to coincide with areas of high landscape amenity, poorer ground conditions and environmental constraints and it is these factors that have predominantly influenced the outcome of applications for development in Gaeltacht areas of the county.<br/><br/>The Mayo local economic and community plan includes objectives such as:</p> <blockquote> 	To maintain and support the communities of Gaeltacht Mhaigh &Eacute;o and Mayo&rsquo;s inhabited islands by facilitating sustainable social and economic development through the provision of infrastructure (social and physical), housing and services and the need to protect the cultural and natural heritage of the Gaeltacht and the Islands where it can be demonstrated that there will be no significant adverse effects on the environment, particularly on the Natura 2000 network. </blockquote> <p>Mayo County Council has 272 social housing units in the Gaeltacht, of which 13 are demountable dwellings and a further 266 people have expressed a preference for housing in Gaeltacht areas.  Mayo County Council has recently built 13 social housing units in its Gaeltacht areas and 24 units are being progressed in the social housing programme for 2022 to 2023.  I thank members again for the invitation to appear before the committee and we look forward to providing any further assistance that we can.</p></speech>

T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam do na finn&eacute;ithe &oacute; Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe amh&aacute;in agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Valerie, Brendan agus &Uacute;na.  I thank the witnesses from Galway County Council for their contributions on planning in Galway.  Enurements are something that crop up from time to time.  I have a question about the Irish-clause enurements within estates.  For rural housing, they last for seven years.  On estates there does not seem to be a time-bound enurement.  Is it a lifetime clause?  It is impacting on people being able to secure mortgages.  The banks will find an excuse not to lend to somebody where there is an Irish enurement that does not state how long it lasts.</p><p>Could any of the Galway representatives or anyone else answer that with regard to their own counties?  I am sure it is an issue across the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.562" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Valerie Loughnane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12021112400002#E00200"><p>We have Irish language enurements attached to two or more houses in our Gaeltacht areas.  Effectively, the reason for the enurement is to ensure that Irish speaking communities are protected and enhanced and that people would be in engaged in conducting their business and lives through the Irish language.  The enurement clause is an Irish language enurement clause.  The house or property would always have the clause that an Irish speaker or somebody with Irish would be occupying that house.</p> <p>  I understand what Senator Kyne is speaking about with respect to securing funding for mortgages for these houses, but we would have a position that if a person had purchased a house, had an Irish language enurement, qualified under our criteria in Galway County Council through an interview and so on, but found sometime into the future that they would have to dispose of that house for whatever reason, we would be and have been open to transferring that enurement to another Irish speaker in order to facilitate the sale of that house.</p> <p>  The idea behind the enurement is obviously to protect and enhance the Irish language.  In essence, what we want to do is continue the restriction on the house with respect to the Irish language to facilitate Irish speakers, but we also acknowledge the fact that people have different situations throughout their lives and they may have to dispose of the property.  We would allow the transfer of that enurement to another Irish speaker or somebody who qualifies under Irish language criteria in Galway County Council.  I hope that gives some clarity to the question.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute; as sin.  Le bheith soil&eacute;ir faoi, she is saying these are lifetime clauses, even though they are not written into the conditions of the planning.</p></speech>

However, there would be some discretion with respect to the occupation of those properties.  If it is the case that somebody had to dispose of their property for whatever reason, the enurement is attached to the property.  In other situations, we have the enurement attached to the applicant; for example, when we have seven-year enurement clauses on houses in restricted areas in our county and all over the country.  The idea behind it is that the language enurement attaches to the property; the reason being we are trying to ensure we maintain and enhance the Irish language in those areas.</p></speech>

If a garda or a nurse with Irish moves into an area and satisfies a test that &Uacute;na N&iacute; Eidhin, as the Irish language officer, puts to them, can they be deemed to qualify for housing need within a Gaeltacht region, even if they have no connection to it?</p></speech>

If somebody can prove they will add to, enhance and use Irish through their everyday life, even though they may not be native to that Gaeltacht but may be native to another Gaeltacht elsewhere in the country and can satisfy the criteria, we allow people to be granted individual one-off houses.  When we spoke about the other enurements, we were talking about them in estates.  There is a policy in our plan that allows native Irish speakers an opportunity to live in the Gaeltacht, perhaps not the Gaeltacht from which they originated, and this also applies to speakers who are proficient in Irish.</p> <p>  For clarity, there are Gaeltacht areas around Galway city that are within Galway County Council's jurisdiction, but are under severe urban pressure.  Although they may be in the Gaeltacht, there may be situations where there are other things that are at odds with that.  We would have to look at the idea in the sustainable rural housing guidelines and so on.  There may be other issues which mean a native Irish speaker would not be able to achieve planning for a one-off house in a location around the city even though it is in the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>  However, in other Gaeltacht and strong Gaeltacht areas, we have a policy in our plan that facilitates that.  Over the years, we have facilitated a number of Irish speakers for individual houses in the Gaeltacht area, where they have proved they will enhance and carry not just the Irish language, but the Irish culture as well.</p></speech>

There would not be preferential treatment for Irish speakers in those areas, which are some of the weaker Gaeltacht regions, despite strong community spirit in parts of them in terms of speaking and trying to enhance Irish.  However, Irish speakers are not prioritised in those areas.  Their Irish-speaking ability and their desire to pass that on and to raise a family tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge would not supersede other issues such as development pressures.</p></speech>

We look at every application on its merits.  Even some of the areas Senator Kyne mentions are under more urban pressure than others, albeit in very close proximity to the city.  However, we would still look at that policy and take the individual in each application on their merits, based on the case they make and the contribution they would make to the Irish language and culture in those areas.</p> <p>  We have to be cognisant of the fact that in the past we have had one or two cases where planning permission was granted and appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which ruled that there would be an issue because the local area was under such urban pressure.  When we are advising people on our policies in the development plan, we have to advise them of that as well, because it is a risk factor.  That is why we have to assess applications based on urban pressure, taking into account all of the objectives that were in place in the past in the national spatial strategy and are now in the national planning framework, the regional spatial economic strategies and our current county development plan.</p></speech>

Feicim go bhfuil Danny O'Toole ar an nguth&aacute;n freisin.  Part of our role involves ensuring services are delivered in Irish to both Gaeltacht communities and Irish-speaking communities.  In each of the local authorities, is there someone in the planning department who could manage an application as Gaeilge?  Would I, as a resident or potential resident in a Gaeltacht area, or as someone who uses Irish as my primary language of day-to-day work, be able to complete a planning application with any of the councils entirely tr&iacute; Ghaeilge?</p> <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; suimi&uacute;il nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag a l&aacute;n de na daoine ar an gcomhr&aacute; anseo, seachas oifigigh na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; sheasann s&eacute; sin go maith i gcomhth&eacute;acs na n-aidhmeanna at&aacute; ag na hudar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la an Ghaeilge a spreagadh.  It is interesting that it was the Irish language officers who were in some cases giving the presentations today.  All of the county development plans have aspirations about promoting Irish and there is certainly a fantastic programme in Mayo County Council on Irish and on using Irish education.  I did something back in 2018.</p><p>How useful is that in terms of delivering the services?  That is also part of our remit.</p><p> Mr. Kelly referred to how the Mayo Gaeltacht does not really come under areas under severe urban pressure.  Obviously, it is an issue in Galway and probably less so in Donegal.  What kind of consideration is given by the seven local authorities in which there are strong Gaeltacht areas?  Do these authorities ever meet collectively or cohesively to discuss what they can do as a unit to promote Irish language services and planning within an area?</p><p> In that context, what about an area in the Gaeltacht that is under severe pressure to maintain Gaeilge as a living language and a language of day-to-day use?  A planning application may tip the pressure in a negative direction, were it to proceed.  What kind of collective action is taken?  It is the flip side of being under severe urban pressure.  Is any consideration given to a Gaeltacht area under severe pressure, where a planning application might change that?</p></speech>

First, in Mayo, we can facilitate a planning application through the process, but it would be with the assistance of staff who could transact business as Gaeilge.  It is probably fair to say that in my experience in local authorities, there are not enough staff who can deal fluently and efficiently in Irish to do the business as Gaeilge.  The Deputy has pointed out that much work has been completed in Mayo County Council over a number of years.  It still leaves the scenario where staff are hesitant and lacking in confidence in those interactions, especially on technical matters relating to planning applications and so forth.</p> <p>  While we would be able to accommodate it, we are not at the level of proficiency in order to make that a good service for the members of the public.  As I understand it, a working group has been established and met previously on planning matters in Gaeltacht areas throughout the Gaeltacht counties, which included our department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  That might not have met recently, but the idea behind that was to ensure there would be some degree of consistency of approach on similar issues throughout local authority areas in which there are Gaeltacht areas.</p></speech>

It is treated exactly the same in our county development plan.

My view is there will always be a certain tension between the protection of the Irish language and the development of areas experiencing rural decline.  We know from the last inter-census period that practically the entire western seaboard has experienced population decline over that period, with the exception of County Galway, due to the influence of the city.</p> <p>  At any point in time, one is trying to, on the one hand, protect the Irish language and those communities and on the other hand, ensure that the county and area develops in terms of infrastructure and also that each individual settlement develops in accordance with its needs.  My experience is that the impact of some of those infrastructural developments including wind farms, during construction phase, is limited.  People come into the area for that construction phase, but it does not have that much of an ongoing effect thereafter, other than the physicality of what is left behind.</p> <p>  If there is development within a Gaeltacht area, the community funds provision from those developments would be the positive impact on the community.  I am not so sure how one could attach conditions to those types of developments in a legal way, in a way which would be positive for the Gaeltacht communities or in a way which would, in a real way, protect or advance the Irish language of the Gaeltacht communities in our counties.</p></speech>

An mbeadh duine as Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe c&aacute;ilithe faoin bpolasa&iacute; sin, d&aacute; mbeadh siad ag iarraidh bogadh go h&aacute;it eile taobh istigh de Ghaeltacht na Gaillimhe?  An bhfuil mapa&iacute; ar f&aacute;il den cheantar lena mbaineann an polasa&iacute; neart&uacute; Gaeltachta?  N&iacute; fhaca m&eacute; mapa riamh a thaispe&aacute;in na h&aacute;iteanna taobh istigh den cheantar ina nglactar le hiarratais faoin bpolasa&iacute; neart&uacute; Gaeltachta agus na cuid taobh amuigh de.  M&aacute; t&aacute; mapa ann, an bhfuil s&eacute; bunaithe ar l&aacute;idreacht na Gaeilge sna ceantair sin n&oacute; ar ti&uacute;s an daonra n&oacute; an br&uacute; daonra?  An dtugtar suntas do na ceantair phlean&aacute;la teanga stat&uacute;ideach at&aacute; ann anois ag Roinn na Gaeltachta?</p> <p>  T&aacute; rud amh&aacute;in nach f&eacute;idir liom meabhair a fh&aacute;il air riamh.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfaighidh m&eacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; air inniu.  Luadh go bhfuil riachtanas teanga sa pholasa&iacute; neart&uacute; Gaeltachta, s&eacute; sin, go mbeadh duine in ann Gaeilge a labhairt go l&iacute;ofa, agus luadh "the Irish culture".  &Eacute;ir&iacute;onn dh&aacute; cheist as sin.  An gcaithfidh daoine an d&aacute; rud a bheith acu?  An gcaithfidh siad teanga na Gaeilge agus "the Irish culture", mar a tugadh air, cult&uacute;r na h&Eacute;ireann n&oacute; cult&uacute;r Gaelach, a bheith acu, n&oacute; an nd&eacute;anfaidh ceann amh&aacute;in?  An bhf&eacute;adfadh daoine f&aacute;il isteach leis an Irish culture gan an teanga a bheith acu?  Cuirfidh m&eacute; ar bhealach eile ar fad &eacute;.  Abair go raibh duine ina chainteoir d&uacute;chasach Gaeilge agus go raibh s&eacute; ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il a chlann le Gaeilge, ach go raibh sp&eacute;is acu i rac-cheol agus rugba&iacute; agus na ruda&iacute; ar fad nach luaitear mar chult&uacute;r d&uacute;chasach &Eacute;ireannach.  Fi&uacute; gur Gaeilge a bheadh ag an gclann mar theanga, go hioml&aacute;n agus go huile, &oacute; mhaidin go ho&iacute;che, an mbeadh siad d&iacute;ch&aacute;ilithe mar nach mbeadh an Irish culture seo, cib&eacute; c&eacute;ard &eacute; f&eacute;in, acu?  T&aacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ag teast&aacute;il faoi c&eacute;ard a chialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin.  N&iacute;or thuig m&eacute; riamh c&eacute;n f&aacute;th go raibh an tagairt ann do Irish culture mar t&aacute; an Ghaeltacht bunaithe ar an teanga.  N&iacute;l s&iacute; bunaithe ar aon rud eile.</p><p>D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh duine a bheith ag imirt rugba&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus sp&eacute;is a bheith acu i gceol nach bhfuil aon bhaint aige le ceol d&uacute;chasach agus mar sin de agus ina chainteoir d&uacute;chasach Gaeilge, sa chaoi ch&eacute;anna go bhfuil cainteoir&iacute; Fraincise sa Fhrainc gan aon sp&eacute;is acu i gceol na Fraince n&oacute; aon rud eile sa Fhrainc.  Ba mhaith liom soil&eacute;iri&uacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</p></speech>

Nine housing estates were developed in Gaeltacht areas of limited size between 2009 and 2021, which is one a year.  None were developed in recent years.  There have been a limited number of one-off housing developments within that area, notwithstanding the population of almost 9,500.  There are probably 37 individual permissions granted yearly.  We do not have the same set-up in terms of enurement clauses and so forth as might be in place in Galway.  We do not have any monitoring of conditions or language usage within the estates in the Gaeltacht areas.</p></speech>

Our linguistic study, with respect to the county plan and so on, is matched up with language planning areas or districts that are already in place.  Our Gaeltacht plan and the Gaeltacht chapter in our draft development plan, as well as the variation of the current plan that has been in place since 2018, relate to and correlate with the language planning area.  There is therefore a basis for the types of policies that are there from that perspective.</p></speech>

The question I asked was very specific.  An ndearna an chomhairle aon staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta ar an tionchar a bh&iacute;onn ag an bp&aacute;tr&uacute;n lonna&iacute;ochta ar an teanga?  Did the council do any objective linguistic study, which would have to be done by a sociolinguist of some type, on the effect settlement patterns have on the Gaeltacht?  We know that, by and large, the areas that stayed strong with the language had very dispersed settlements, for whatever reason, while towns like Dingle, Belmullet and so on that had conventional European-type settlements all lost the language.  If we start changing that without studying the linguistic impact, we could destroy the thing we are trying to save.  Sin an cheist.  An bhfuil an staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta seo d&eacute;anta?</p></speech>

Those districts vary.  For example, Baile Chl&aacute;ir, which is on the edge of the city, is in the Gaeltacht area and the amount of spoken Irish there is much less than further out west like in Carna or beyond.  From that perspective, the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, in a way.  The language planning areas are so diverse that we would have intrinsically looked at different settlement patterns or dispersals of settlements, as they are so diverse within those districts.</p></speech>

It changed from a dispersed population when Baile Chl&aacute;ir grew dramatically population-wise and as a town.  There are native Irish speakers from areas like M&oacute;inteach and Cathair Ghabhann who are still alive.  When I got into politics 30 years ago there were quite a number of fluent speakers there, just as there were in Menlo in Galway.  It seems that this drive for development destroyed the language very quickly because, as Ms Loughnane rightly pointed out, they are a dying breed and there is no succession of the language there.  Sin an cheist at&aacute; agamsa.  M&aacute; thosa&iacute;onn muid ag d&eacute;anamh an rud c&eacute;anna sa Cheathr&uacute; Rua, an nd&eacute;anfaimid an scrios c&eacute;anna?</p></speech>

From the point of view of going forward with it now, we are trying to keep what we have but also enhance it.  That is what we are trying to do with our current draft county development plan.  In the plan that is in place at the moment, we have policies with respect to rural housing, which is dispersed, as well as more centralised housing in towns and villages.  We would have looked at all of that when dealing with the policy objectives in our new draft county development plan.</p> <p>  With respect to the enurements and so on, the Irish language enurements are signed in order to comply with the conditions attached to the permission.</p><p>We would therefore be notified if they were to be sold on.  There is monitoring from that perspective because there must be compliance with conditions.  That does not happen regularly but we have had a few cases over a long number of years.</p><p> With respect to enhancing and protecting the Irish language, it is a whole package.  It is not about what particular sport or music people play.  If they are Irish speakers they will immerse themselves in the Gaeltacht and promote and enhance the whole thing-----</p></speech>

My family are Irish-speaking.  It is our language.  We are living the dream, as they say.  In all other aspects of life I do not see myself immersed in something that everyone else is as well.  People in Kilkenny are immersed in hurling.  What is more native than that?  People in Clare are into music.  I still find this very nebulous.  The big difference between a Gaeltacht and somewhere that is very d&uacute;chasach in all sorts of other ways is the language.  I do not get the idea that I would immerse myself in something else that half the country is immersing themselves in anyway.  Look at Kilmacud Crokes.  They have two county championships in their culture.</p></speech>

They could be playing our Irish national games or another game that originated somewhere else, but what they are doing is engaging with people through the Irish language.  It is a complete package from that perspective.  It is not one size fits all.  That is why each application is taken on its merits under that neart&uacute; Gaeltachta policy in our development plan.  We do our very best to ensure that people who will promote the Irish language, speak it and keep it alive in the Gaeltacht are facilitated through the policies that are there currently.</p></speech>

The chief executive&rsquo;s report is with the members.  We will have council meetings both before and after Christmas and any material alterations that are made to the draft as a result of the members considering the report will be placed on public display.  That should be towards the middle of February, provided that none of the material alterations bring up environmental issues that would require more assessment.  The public will then have four weeks in which to make a submission on those material alterations.</p></speech>

On the linguistic impact statements, any housing estate of two or more houses would have a linguistic impact statement attached to it.  In recent years there have not been that many of those applications but other types of applications have them as well.

Therefore, the conditions have to be complied with and that is the monitoring as such.  I think we spoke about enurements at the start of the session today.</p> <p>  On the linguistic impact statements, we can certainly root out those numbers in terms of how many there have been in the past ten years and how it has developed.  With respect to the fact that, since 2008, we have a Gaeltacht plan up to 2021, we have learned a number of things and we have tried to address them as we are going along regarding the application.  There were a number of infrastructural deficits, in a way, in the context of employment and so on.  Thankfully the 110 kV project was constructed a number of years ago to Connemara which gives continuity of power and certainty of power.  At one time there was an issue with trying to keep employment there and building the numbers.  There are a number of different facets involved.</p> <p>  From that perspective, in the variation we did in 2018, we went to the three islands.  We developed a framework plan for the islands, which was a new intervention introduced in 2018, and have developed it further in our plan with a Gaeltacht chapter.  We learned that the islands&rsquo; needs are different.  Their situation is different.  They are a Gaeltacht, but they are also physically different not alone because they are islands but because of the nature of the terrain and the designations and so on.  We learned that the island community needs a slightly different framework from that of the mainland.  We looked at various different aspects of policy that worked in 2008 up to 2018 and amended some of them in order for them to work a bit better for the Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  On the areas under urban pressure, there are difficulties from that perspective.  We previously mentioned that in cases where we granted a planning application for a once-off house for somebody who qualified under the neart&uacute; Gaeltacht and so on, if he or she was closer to Galway city or that area of urban pressure, An Bord Plean&aacute;la would look at the fact it is under urban pressure and possibly consider that as an area where there was a difficulty in providing a one-off rural house.</p><p>Since 2008, we have learned quite a lot.  If we were to look at our Gaeltacht plan of 2008, which we have done, compared with what is proposed in our Gaeltacht chapter of our draft country development plan, we would see a noticeable number of differences that we have learned from and have amended policies.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether it was answered but I got an interrupting phone call so perhaps I missed it.  Have we a standardised standard across the seven county councils in which there are Gaeltacht areas?  Do we expect the same language conditions to apply to each of the seven Gaeltacht areas?  Are they objective or subjective standards and with what are we comparing them?  What external monitoring applies to that?  If I were to apply under a linguistic standard to An Sean Phobal i gContae Phort L&aacute;irge, do I apply under the same language standards that apply sa Daingean n&oacute; i dT&iacute;r Chonaill?  That is the heart of my question, if any witness would like to reply.</p></speech>

While I am not directly involved in it, I understand there are differences of approach across the Gaeltacht areas in that assessment.</p></speech>

We do not have assessments or conditions in relation to Irish language clauses currently.  There has been a very limited amount of development in Gaeltacht areas with no urban generated pressure.  There is certainly a lot of food for thought from today&rsquo;s discussion and the issues raised by members of the committee.</p></speech>

There is liaising ongoing between councils and the working group is trying to establish consistency across the board, as previous speakers said.  Our standard is assessed under three different criteria, namely, the ability in the language, a commitment to the language and how the applicant uses the language in his or her everyday life.  We have an interview process that assesses applicants under the three different criteria.  That applies across the board be it for developments in estates with two or more houses or individual applications for one-off houses.  We spoke about the monitoring previously.  We apply enurement clauses which are conditions that have to be complied with.</p></speech>

We have reconvened to continue our discussion on the recently published report of the Commission on Pensions.</p><p>This is our third session of public hearings.  As previously mentioned the State pension is valued by all of society and is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at preventing pensioners from falling into poverty and we want to make sure this remains the case into the future.  Last week, we heard from the Commission on Pensions chairperson, Ms Josephine Feehily.  The commission was an independent body made up of pension experts, academics and workers representative groups.  The commission has completed its work.  Its comprehensive report was published last month.  This report states that that current State pension is not sustainable in its current format and needs to be changed.  The population is set to increase from 5 million to more than 6 million by 2050.  That is something we need to plan for to ensure that older people have an adequate pension and a safety net to keep them out of poverty.  </p><p> There are clear challenges in ensuring the sustainability of state pensions for future generations.  This has been known for many years and is confirmed by the report of the Commission on Pensions.  The Government has asked this committee for our views on the recommendations set out in the report.  This follows on from the committee's remit and our recent submission to the commission.</p><p> The committee's submission and during contributions at the various pensions hearings has consistently highlighted the issues related to those who are in manual employment who may not be physically able to continue work beyond 65 years and a related group, namely family carers, who may not have the contributions to avail of a full contributory pension.  At our hearings last week we touched on this particular pension challenge facing family carers in the home, predominantly women, and the self-employed, particularly those in the construction industry.  In this regard, I welcome Mr. Michael Taft, senior economist and Ms Rachel Ryan, barrister and head of legal rights unit, SIPTU; Mr. Liam Berney, industrial officer, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU; and Ms Clare Duffy, policy and public affairs manager, Family Carers Ireland.  </p><p> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Witnesses are reminded that full parliamentary privilege only applies to those participating from within the precincts of Leinster House.

Myself and Ms Ryan will be in a position to take questions afterwards.</p> <p>  SIPTU launched the STOP67 campaign because of widespread concern among our members at the prospect at that time of the pension age being increased to 67 years at the beginning of this year.  For the purposes of this, our opening statement will address two areas.  The first is the fiscal arguments underpinning the commission&rsquo;s recommendation to increase the pension age.  Everyone accepts pension expenditure will increase in the future.  However, increasing the pension age will save little money and will be an ineffective tool in ensuring pension sustainability.  The commission relied on models developed by the Department of Finance and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, to estimate savings from increasing the pension age.  Both these models showed that by 2050 the savings would be fractional, that is, less than 1% of national income.  While in nominal terms this is not insignificant, both models showed increasing the pension age would only save between 10% to 15% of the estimated overall increase in pension expenditure.  However, the Department of Social Protection produced data that suggests that these models may considerably overestimate the savings from increasing the pension age.  The reason for the discrepancy appears to be that the Department of Finance and IFAC estimated the impact on pension expenditure but did not factor in offsetting costs such as other social insurance payments, including the new benefits payment for those aged over 65.  The Department of Social Protection figures did factor in these costs.  That may explain the considerable discrepancy between the two.  Although SIPTU referred to this in its submission to the commission, unfortunately the commission did not refer at all to the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s data.  This led the ICTU nominee to the commission, Ms Ethel Buckley, deputy general secretary of SIPTU, to oppose the recommended pension age increase.  She was the only commission member to do so. </p> <p>  I now turn to the second issue of mandatory retirement before State pension age.  A key component in moving to a flexible pension system involves the introduction of a statutory right to remain in work at least up to the State pension age and potentially for years afterwards.  The increase in the State pension age has deepened the hardship felt by workers forced to retire from their employment at an age before which the State pension becomes payable.  Many workers, although not all, will wish to remain in their employment until their pension becomes payable due to their continued ability to do their job and the fact that they will see a significant drop in their income if forced to retire.  Addressing this issue requires legislative change.  </p> <p>  The Employment Equality Acts, 1998 to 2015, state that an employer cannot discriminate against a worker on the grounds of age.  The Act allows, but does not require, employers to set a mandatory retirement age for workers, provided it can be justified on objective grounds.  It is the law that must be justified rather than the decisions of individual employers.  However, there have never been any national employment policies, labour market requirements or social policy objectives set out by the Government on the imposition of a workplace retirement age under the Employment Equality Act, as required by European law.  SIPTU welcomes the Commission on Pensions recommendations for legislative change that allows but does not compel an employee to stay in employment until State pension age and calls for this change to be addressed by means of an amendment to the Employment Equality Act.  This recommendation is in line with SIPTU&rsquo;s submission, which called for a flexible pension age regime that exists in many other EU countries. </p> <p>  The commission further recommended the Government consider allowing people with long contribution records to access their State pension entitlements at age 65 years.  We welcome this first step towards greater flexibility but would urge the committee to consider in its analysis decoupling this recommendation from the pension age increase and consider more flexible options such as accessing pension entitlements at an earlier age, especially for those in arduous and-or hazardous occupations. </p> <p>  The commission failed to construct a consensus among all stakeholders regarding a credible path to pension sustainability and flexibility, one that will take these issues out of the electoral cycle.   In fact, by postponing the increase in the pension age to 2028, it has parachuted the issue into the next general election.  The committee has time to address the many defects of the commission report while urging swift action to implement the positive recommendations such as reform of mandatory retirement contracts.  The committee could investigate the discrepancies between savings estimates.  It can take up the issue of flexibility, especially in arduous occupations.  Most of all, it could help initiate an authentic stakeholder forum that would seek a genuine consensus based on best-case evidence.</p></speech>

My colleague, Dr. Laura Bambrick, social policy officer, may join us later but she is currently appearing before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>   First, ICTU wishes to acknowledge the work of the commission.  It has produced a comprehensive and detailed report that puts forward a wide range of recommendations to share the increasing costs of the State pension between the State, employers, the self-employed, workers and the generations, both current and future.  In the brief time I have available for my opening remarks, I will focus on the key challenges in the report&rsquo;s recommendations and the key improvements on previous pension policy from the perspective of working people. </p> <p>   ICTU has never denied the challenge population ageing presents for the public finances if no action is taken.  However, the 2011 Pensions Act put Ireland on course to have the highest pension age in the OECD in 2028, despite the fact that we have a relatively young population.  It is now acknowledged that this policy went too far, too fast and forced workers at 65 to sign on, putting them at risk of poverty at the end of their working life.  ICTU is pleased the commission has heard and agreed with us on this.  </p> <p>  The commission is recommending moving to a European-style, flexible pension age including proposing that the Government gives a right to retire on a full State pension from age 65 to workers who have worked from a young age.  ICTU was first to identify the need for, and to urge previous Governments to introduce, provision for early access to the State pension.  As my colleague, Mr. Michael Taft, has pointed out, ICTU was the only member of the commission not to support the recommendation to increase the pension age to 67 and 68 for people without sufficient PRSI contributions.  However, we acknowledge that recommending that the increase in the qualifying age be delayed and introduced gradually over a longer period is an improvement on the 2011 Act and will bring the increase in the pension age in step with other EU member states. </p> <p>  ICTU is pleased the commission is recommending new legislation to allow, but not compel, workers to remain in their jobs up until at least the pension age.  We have long argued that existing soft measures have proved inadequate for many workers who want to stay in their job beyond the retirement age in their employment contract.  </p> <p>  On the recommended increases to social insurance contributions, ICTU agrees, along with a range of bodies including the State&rsquo;s own advisory body, the tax strategy group, that the self-employed contribution should be adjusted up to at least the employer rate.  ICTU is also on the record highlighting Ireland as an outlier on employer social insurance contributions.  Ireland has the second lowest rate of employer PRSI in the 27 member states.  We are disappointed by the commission&rsquo;s lack of ambition in the size of the increase it recommends for employers. </p> <p>  ICTU supports in principle the need for intergenerational equity to ensure that the costs of maintaining current payment rates are not placed solely on younger workers.  However, we are concerned that the recommendation to remove the exemption to pay PRSI on people aged 66 and over could unfairly and disproportionately impact certain groups of pensioners.  For example, today&rsquo;s retired and older pre-1995 civil and public servants have no entitlement to the State pension.  Many of these workers rely on a public sector pension that is less than the value of the State pension.  They would be liable for a 4% PRSI contribution on their pension income in excess of &euro;100 per week, increasing their risk of poverty.  As the Chairman said earlier, it should be everybody's intention to ensure that people do not slide into poverty in retirement.  We are calling for the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to be allowed the time and space to consider this recommendation before the Government takes a decision. </p> <p>  ICTU is pleased to see that many of our long-standing policy positions on benchmarking and index-linking pension payment rates, introducing auto-enrolment, ring fencing State pension contributions, issuing regular PRSI contributions statements and easier access for long-term carers are included in the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations. </p> <p>  ICTU will continue its engagement with union members, members of Government and the Opposition, and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to ensure the increasing financial costs of the State pension will, as intended by the commission, be shared fairly and equitably.  Along with my colleague Mr. Michael Taft, I am happy to answer any questions members may have. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#C00300"><p>On behalf of Family Carers Ireland my colleague Catherine Cox and I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee today about the report of the Commission on Pensions and specifically its recommendations on the development of a sustainable State pension system that recognises rather than penalises family carers and values the immense contribution they make through their years of care giving in the same way that we value social insurance contributions paid through PRSI.  Family Carers Ireland is heartened by the programme for Government commitment to address the long-standing pension anomaly affecting family carers which was transposed into the terms of reference of the pensions commission.  We were fortunate enough to make a written and oral submission to the commission and warmly welcome the recommendations contained in its report published last month.<br/><br/>Our position with regard to the State pension reflects the lived experience of family carers, the majority of whom are women, who have been denied a State pension or who receive a reduced pension as a direct consequence of their years spent care giving.  Government policy has long supported initiatives to maintain the care of people in their own homes.  These long-standing and laudable ambitions, while welcome, are entirely predicated on the availability and willingness of family and friends to take on a caring role.  Today, one in eight people in Ireland provides care.  We estimate that this number will need to increase to one in five by 2030 to meet the growing demand for care.  If we are to achieve this, then Government must replace any remaining archaic policies that penalise family caregiving, not least of which are elements of the existing pension regime that allow a long-term carer to reach retirement age with no entitlement to a State pension or only a reduced entitlement.  While the number of carers affected is low at approximately 100 carers per year, the impact on them and the message this sends to broader caring community is significant. <br/><br/>In our submission to the commission we placed particular emphasis on long-term carers, that is those who have cared for more than 20 years and are, therefore, unlikely to have paid the 520 contributions necessary to qualify for a contributory State pension nor are they protected by the safeguards that currently exist within the State pension regime.  These safeguards are in place to protect a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a State pension in later life.  However, anomalies exist within each safeguard that undermine their value and put carers at risk of falling through the net.  What are these anomalies and how do they affect family carers? <br/><br/>First, the general point must be made that the pension system is incredibly complicated and the general population, including carers are often confused or misinformed about their pension entitlements.  There is a general understanding among some that there is no significant difference between the contributory and non-contributory State pension, at only &euro;10 to &euro;20 per week but people do not understand that the non-contributory State pension is means tested.  There is a mistaken belief that it is a guaranteed payment.<br/><br/>Another major issue for carers is the requirement for applicants to have at least 520 paid contributions, which renders most of the safety net schemes ineffective for family carers who have not secured ten years of paid contributions.  This is a particular challenge for long-term carers who have been forced to leave employment, often at a relatively young age, following the birth of a child with special needs.  The 520 contributions rule also undermines the value of the current homemaker's scheme.  <br/><br/>The imposition of a means test on the increase for a qualified adult, IQA, for both the contributory and non-contributory State pension has led to some family carers not qualifying for an IQA based on their income or assets.  The two-year rule with regard to credited social insurance contributions<b><i></i></b>means some family carers are not receiving credits while in receipt of carer's allowance, a fact many carers are oblivious to.  The disregard of &euro;20,000 in respect of savings and capital for the non-contributory pension is disproportionately low, particularly for families who have put aside money to make provision for the future care of their loved one.  The assessment of land not productively used is unfair to some landowners who may be unable to sell, rent or use the land themselves.  There are also issues with the differential treatment of people who are employed versus those who are self-employed in respect of the &euro;200 weekly disregard in earnings for the non-contributory State pension.</p><p>One fact that is often overlooked but, thankfully, was reflected in the pension commission's report is that carers whose partner is or was employed by the Civil Service and who receives a pre-1995 Civil Service pension are not afforded the normal protections offered through the State pension system.</p><p> Family Carers Ireland acknowledges the positive changes brought about through the introduction of the interim total contributions approach, TCA, which has addressed a significant number of the legacy issues associated with the yearly contributions approach.  It does not, however, address all of them.  The most notable issue is that family carers are still required to have at least 520 paid contributions, and even for those who have 520 paid contributions, their pension entitlement, while it may increase, will still not increase to the maximum level.  For this reason, in our submission to the pensions commission we called for a dedicated pension for long-term family carers to ensure they all receive a full pension entitlement equivalent to the maximum contributory State pension.  In its report the Commission on Pensions made three recommendations on long-term carers.  The first is that long-term carers, that is, those who have been caring for more than 20 years, should be given access to a contributory State pension by having retrospective contributions paid for them by the Exchequer for any gaps in their contribution records due to caregiving.  The second recommendation was that those contributions be exclusively for contributory State pension purposes and recognised as paid contributions for the purposes of such caregivers qualifying for the contributory State pension and calculating their entitlement.  This would abolish the issue arising from the requirement to have 520 contributions.  Finally, but importantly, the commission recommended the establishment of a family carer register because it recognised the immense challenge in identifying who long-term family carers are.  While the pensions commission's approach is to subsume long-term carers into the interim TCA system rather than creating a dedicated carer's pension, as we had originally sought, this is not necessarily an issue for Family Carers Ireland as the three recommendations, if fully adopted, would address many of the legacy issues associated with carers' access to the State pension.</p><p> We understand that the commission's report will be referred to the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment for consideration, with a view to bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to the Government by the end of March 2022.  We believe that in order for the programme for Government commitment to address the pension anomaly affecting family carers to be achieved, it is necessary that all recommendations relating to family carers be approved and urgently implemented.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

What we have before us to consider is the report of the pensions commission.  Mr. Taft makes the argument that the proposed increase in the pension age would not make as significant a contribution, in the context of pensions provision long-term, as is made out in the report.  I am glancing across the modelling from which the committee has to work and looking across the four proposed packages.  There might not be an enormous part payable by 2030, but the modelling out to 2050 and 2070 shows that the pension age makes a significant contribution.  Am I to understand that Mr. Taft questions the modelling behind the four packages laid before us?  My follow-on question is that if there are deficiencies in the modelling from Mr. Taft's perspective, where does that leave us when it comes to interpreting the pensions commission's report?  If we accept Mr. Taft's analysis, do we find ourselves back at square one?  I suppose we do not in one sense because he and other contributors have acknowledged that there is a lot in this report that they welcome.  As for the financial analysis, however, where do we find ourselves, from Mr. Taft's point of view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.671" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#D00400"><p>I will take up a couple of the Deputy's points and then come back to his final question.</p> <p>  As for the two models, increasing the pension age and how much that would save set against future pension expenditure, both the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance project that pension expenditure will increase out to 2050 by anywhere between 5.5% and 6% of national income, or GNI*.  We do not dispute that.  The increase might be high or might be low but it will be in that neighbourhood.  The fiscal council says, however, that increasing the pension age will result in savings of only 0.7%.  That is about 10% to 15% of total savings.  That is taking on board only the fiscal council's own numbers.  It is therefore not us saying this; it is the fiscal council saying it.  We are only drawing attention to that fact.</p> <p>  It would be helpful were the committee to ask the Department of Social Protection for the data it presented in two papers in 2020.  First was the collated briefing submitted to the Department of the Taoiseach for the programme for Government talks.  That was presented at that time to what were to be the three coalition parties.  There is also the ministerial brief to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, part B, which was also published in 2020.  They present data that potentially undermine - we say "potentially" because we will not set this in hard and fast rules - the projections of the Department of Finance and the fiscal council because the Department of Social Protection factors in offsetting costs.  Just because the pension age is raised does not mean that somebody on invalidity pension will not still be paid by the Social Insurance Fund, so there are very little savings to be made there.  It is the same with the benefit payment.  If the committee were to seek those data from the Department, it would help the debate and help the committee come to an understanding of the issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where we find ourselves.  We will need to do a number of things, and this is a significant challenge.  We will have to find measures to promote economic growth.  Unlike what the Commission on Pensions says, economic growth will generate savings and will in fact have a better impact on the public finances than increasing the pension age.  We will have to look at PRSI contributions and the incentivisation of people to work while they draw down their pensions.  In one sense Ireland is advantaged because we have one of the highest employment rates among people over the age of 65.  People want to work beyond that age, so it is a matter of building on those incentives.  If people continue to work, they still pay PRSI and, of course, tax on a large part of any pension payment, which would be subject to income tax.  Such incentivisation would therefore be a fiscal good.  Those are the three areas where we should start.  Setting a context and getting the data right are key.  That is what we urge the committee to explore in the context of what the Department of Finance and the fiscal council say on the one hand and, on the other, what the Department of Social Protection says.</p></speech>

It sounds like a small figure, but 0.7% of GNI* is a very significant proportion of the national income.  If we could get towards that percentage for our overseas development aid, we would be very excited.  If we could get to that level of expenditure on our childcare services, we would be very excited.  It is a significant amount of money.  A lot of what Josephine Feehily spoke about when she was before the committee related to the solidarity principle.  What if the proportion of savings that would arise from the proposed increase in the pension age were removed?  Much of this discussion puts me in mind of the emissions targets and the emissions ceilings.  The fact is that if one sector takes on less of the burden, other sectors have to bear that burden.  I worry that the pension age is another case in point in that regard.  If we look at the projections set out on page 13 of the report - and this is why I asked whether in Mr. Taft's opinion we can trust the modelling that lies underneath the report - we can see that packages 2 and 4 in particular try to share the pain.  I think I have said previously at this committee that no easy choices are presented by the pensions commission; it presents a range of difficult choices.  By not making a choice on the pension age and removing that aspect, are we asking people paying PRSI - and I think of PRSI on the incomes of the self-employed in particular - to take a disproportionate burden?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#E00100"><p>As I acknowledged in my opening statement, 0.7% is fractional but it is not insignificant.  Of course, by 2050 it will be very large.  It is also the case that it only makes up a very small percentage of the increase in overall future pension expenditure.  For instance, if there is a pension sustainability problem, if it will be a particular size, and if increasing the pension age only gets us approximately 10%, 12% or 14% of the way, that would not get us very far.  The problem is this debate has focused almost solely on the pension age.  Listening to the public debate, you would think the pension age is the key to pension sustainability.  It is not.</p> <p>  Are there other things that can be done that would be more economically efficient and socially equitable?  We believe there are.  However, ultimately, every legislator, Minister and Government has to make the calculation in respect of whether the benefit arising from the increase forgone outweighs the deficit that would be created if the pension age was increased.  That is a judgment call.  SIPTU believes that the same things can be achieved without forcing people to work longer to get their pension.  In so many cases, the people in question, though they may not be in the most severe, arduous or hazardous occupations, will be in physically demanding occupations, and there will be a toll on their living standards because of that.  It is a question of whether there is a better way of achieving the fiscal end while retaining that social good.</p> <p>  I remind members that although we often hear that life expectancy has risen to 20 or 22 years after the pension age of 66, healthy life expectancy, which is a measure used by the European Commission and the World Health Organization and to which we refer in our submission, is approximately ten to 12 years after the age of 66.  It will increase in the future but the indications are that the increases in both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy are slowing down.  If you take two years off a person whose healthy life expectancy is ten to 12 years, that is a substantial inroad into their living standard.  We believe there is a better way of doing it and achieving the same goal of pension sustainability.</p></speech>

He made a valid point regarding the data from the Department of Social Protection and the committee will seek that information.  To bring him back to a very important sentence in his evidence, he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Many workers, although not all, will wish to remain in their employment until their State pension becomes payable due to their continued ability to do their job and the fact that they will see a significant drop in their income if forced to retire. </blockquote> <p>Following on from the remarks of the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the points Mr. Taft has made on the issue of pension sustainability, if the pension age is not increased, is there an incentive for people who are fit, well and capable of continuing to work to do so?  In terms of that cohort of people, is there evidence from other European countries where people have continued to work?  Mr. Taft made the point that Ireland is seeing far more people working beyond their 66th birthday.  Does the increase in the pension age need to be introduced as an incentive to keep people who are fit, well and capable of remaining in employment working?  What would be the impact of just getting rid of the ban on people remaining in work at 65 or 66?  Is there any evidence to support that at the moment?  I invite Mr. Taft or Ms Ryan to respond on those questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#E00300"><p>Increasing the pension age to 67 or 68 is the ultimate incentive to stay in work because if you do not do so and drop out, you lose your work income but cannot access your pension.  That is a pretty hard incentive.  It tells people to continue working because they will not get their pension.  There may be better incentives.  The report of the commission suggests two things.  First, people who continue working can continue to accumulate contributions towards their pension record.  That will be very important in the context of the total contributions approach, TCA.  Second, people may defer their pension until the age of 70 and continue to work up to that age.  The report does not make that as a hard proposal but refers to people's pension being compensated by 4% for each year they do not receive it.  That would be a substantial financial incentive.</p> <p>  However, there are other incentives that go beyond legally forcing or trying to force people to work to the age of 68 or 69.  An example of that comes from the OECD report on the challenges of meeting future pension costs.  It points out there is a high level throughout Europe, including in Ireland, of people aged 50 to 60 who have a relatively low employment rate but, more important, suffer low pay and poor working conditions.  The OECD makes the point that if people are in low-paid employment with poor working conditions and intermittent income or are underemployed at the age of 55, they are less likely to continue working to the pension age, never mind beyond it.  There are arguments that there are incentives that can be put in place that would give people opportunity, such as our recommendation on mandatory contracts, and a financial and workplace incentive.</p> <p>  Incentives are important.  The commission has suggested some such incentives.  Consideration could be given to the suggestion from the OECD, which is being explored by SIPTU, that once people reach the age of 55 or 60, they can apply for reduced working hours in the workplace.  If a person works 40 hours until the age of 66 and then stops working altogether, it is a bit of a cliff.  Why not ease it in?  That would mean people may be able to continue working.  There many more soft measures for incentives, but also more socially equitable incentives.</p></speech>

I do not have the answer to this.  Mr. Taft may not have it either.  Is there evidence from elsewhere that these soft options may not meet the 0.7% but would come close to it?  It is not a black or white situation.  Is there evidence that increasing the age threshold for the pension would bring in 0.7% of GNI*, but if all the soft options are coupled together, that could bring in a proportion of that 0.7% of GNI*?  Does that evidence exist?</p></speech>

It might be worth investigating why we have such a high employment rate for those over the age of 65.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, may be of assistance on this.  I suspect part of it might be down to older farmers continuing to work.</p><p>We will seek the assistance of the Central Statistics Office to identify where that high rate is coming from.  The Chair referred to the 0.7%.  The commission and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council refer to it.  We do not know that there will be savings of 0.7% as the Department of Social Protection suggests.  It is potentially a figure that is up to two thirds lower.  People say that we need to bring in the pension age increase to complement the soft initiatives.  You do not need the soft initiatives when you force people to work to the age of 67 or 68 to get their pension.  They will have to continue working and will continue to make pension contributions.  The hard option means that we do not need many of the soft options.</p></speech>

I preface my remarks by saying that, unlike Mr. Taft, I am not an economist.  There is a social aspect to this that we need to consider too.  The Chair referred to it in his opening comments to the committee.  It relates to those people who literally cannot work beyond 65 because of the nature of their occupations.  They might have to retire before 65.  That includes people who work in construction, possibly from the early age of 16 or 17, until they are 61 or 62, where because of the arduous nature of their employment, they simply cannot work beyond that age.  It does not only apply to construction.  There are occupations in the health service where the same thing would apply.  It is important to consider the economics of all of this but there are crucially important social aspects too.  Asking a bricklayer, a nurse or somebody who works in an arduous occupation to work beyond 65 years of age, or even past a younger age than that, needs to be considered by the committee with regard to the impact it would have on those people.  Getting the financial and economic side of this correct is important.  It is important that whatever decisions the Government and legislators make are based on sound economics.  There are also social considerations at play that need to be factored in.</p></speech>

The concern that we would all have as Members of the Oireachtas is what would happen to people who are in a caring capacity who are not in receipt of the carer's allowance.  As public representatives, we have all come across people who are not getting the care support payment.  They end up falling through the cracks.</p></speech>

How do we identify long-term carers?  How do we define long-term carers?  We need to start with that definition.  It went into great detail about identifying these long-term carers.  There is no single repository in Ireland that will tell us how many carers there are.  There are different sorts of information, which the Chair has alluded to.  People get the means-tested carer's support grant, which is not the perfect database.  The most perfect database is probably the people who receive the annual carer's support grant because it is not means tested.  We have just under 120,000 full-time family carers in that.  The pensions report also looked at people who claim care-related tax reliefs or tax credits.  That is imperfect too because there is no requirement for those recipients to actually provide full-term care.</p> <p>  The model which we have suggested, which has been reflected in the recommendations, is a model that is used in the UK, where there are statutory carer registers.  How the UK supports carers is different from how we do it.  The UK does it through local authorities and general practitioners hold carer registers.  We have to think about that.  The recommendation from the Pensions Commission was that the Government would work with stakeholders, which I assumed to be organisations such as ours, and that together, we would develop the carers register.  It is an immense challenge, not least when people come off the register, if the person they are caring for passes away.  We expect them to declare that and come off the register.  There is much consideration.  We are almost at the point where we have no choice but to grasp the nettle and to try to establish this.  As I said, we do not have a single repository that identifies any type of carer, least of which are long-term carers who have been caring for more than 20 years.  The recommendation is that it would be done alongside us, as stakeholders in the sector.</p></speech>

I have asked general questions about the future world of work for the last couple of weeks but I will be more specific in asking these questions.  Ms Duffy referred to the fact that it looks as if we will have more people working in the caring economy as we get closer to 2050.  I want to give her the opportunity to elaborate on that.  It will not be disrupted by artificial intelligence and such as much as other things are.  Caring roles will still have to be taken on by humans.  Mr. Berney referred to physically demanding professions, such as blocklayers.  Is the number of people participating in that type of work staying constant or are there fewer people engaged in those physically demanding roles?  Is it becoming easier to participate in such roles because of technological innovation or do we still find the same amount of people in those physically demanding roles?  Nobody on this committee would expect a 67 or 68 year old to engage in those roles.  Those are two questions about the world of work and the specific aspects that the witnesses represent.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question refers to two different cohorts of carers.  The first is the cohort that I represent, which is unpaid family carers.  The CSO tells us that about 70% of unpaid family carers also juggle their caring responsibilities with paid employment.  It is important that we recognise that.  I should have said in my opening statement that the best way to secure a pension in retirement is to keep people engaged in the labour market and to support them to remain in employment.  That is a significant challenge for family carers who often provide full-time care as well as trying to work.  We need things like tax incentives and tax reliefs in the same way that we need childcare for parents like me who want to go out to work.  We need to have respite to enable carers to engage in the workforce.  It is an important point to make.  We need to incentivise carers to remain in employment so that they get their pension in the same way that anyone else will.</p> <p>  I am glad that the Deputy referred to the second cohort of workers.  They are home care workers and staff who are paid by the HSE or employed by people like us, who provide home care services.  We have a substantial staff shortage and a crisis in home care.  In recent years, funding for home care has no longer been the issue.  The issue is securing home care staff.  There are many reasons.  One reason for this shortage is the poor terms and conditions associated with home care work and the lack of a pension entitlement for those workers is a significant issue.  There are things that we need to think about and address for unpaid family carers and also for the paid home care workers who support the industry.  There is a shortage at the moment.</p></speech>

I referred to blocklayers as one example of arduous employment but there are many others in the economy.</p><p>It is impossible to know what technological developments might come along in the future to eliminate the more arduous aspects.  In construction, for example, there is still a very large number of people who are engaged in the type of arduous work that I have described.  It is the same type of arduous work that the Deputy has said it would be unreasonable to expect them people to work beyond a particular age or well into their 60s but there are many occupations like that.  I did reference nursing and, as the Deputy has said, nursing is a caring profession that is unlikely to see the technological innovation that will make it less arduous.</p><p> It is important to note what has happened in other jurisdictions.  We can supply information to the committee on this matter.  Committees like this one in other jurisdictions have developed ranks of occupations or set out occupations that should have access to the state pension or receive the state pension at an earlier age.  I know that this is not something the Deputy would support, given that he is a member of the Green Party.  In some countries, for instance, mining has been an occupation that the legislature has recognised as one that cannot continue into extended age.  There is not a big tradition of mining in Ireland in the same way as there is in other countries, but mining is an example.  There are attempts in other countries to classify occupations and give particular consideration to some by giving them early access to the state pension.  We can provide information on that to the Deputy after this meeting.</p></speech>

I will hone in on a few matters.  One is that a vast number of people coming to contributory pension age would not be able to work after 66.  In fact, many people retire before they reach 66 and do not get the State pension.  That is because their jobs involved physical input.  All of our physical abilities diminish with age, and this pension issue relates to a huge spectrum of professions and people.  Care workers have been mentioned, which could be care assistants and nurses.  All of the people who work in the building trades are definitely affected.  There is a wide range of professions beyond that.</p> <p>  One thing that seems to get lost in the debate is contributions.  We are talking about 2028.  In order to have 40 years' worth of contributions in 2028, a person must have started work in 1988.  In such circumstances, one must ask what was work like in 1988, in 1998 and during the Celtic tiger era in all of these industries and not what kind of facilities will somebody who starts work in 2028 have by 2068.  I presume and hope they will have much better health and safety and a hell of a lot better assistance, with lifting devices and automatons doing a lot of the more arduous tasks.  The reality is that those who will be retiring in 2028 all started work in 1988.  I am interested in getting feedback from SIPTU regarding how much, to their knowledge, this informed the debate.  There was somebody from the union movement there, but did SIPTU feed this information to the people concerned?  Having read the report from the commission, it seems that some of its members are removed from the reality of people's lives.  As I pointed out on the day the chair of the commission was before us, the State recognises physical capacity inasmuch as garda&iacute; and people in the Army are not expected to work to 66 because of the very physical nature of the job.  It depends on one's rank.  If you become desk-bound, you have a chance of staying longer.  There is a recognition that if you are out on the beat, your ability when you are in your 60s is not quite the same as it was in your were in your 20s, 30s and so on.  How much input did SIPTU have and what sort of response did it receive?  Do the witnesses think that point was taken on board?  Has SIPTU conducted research on the total number of people who will reach pension age in the late 2020s and early 2030s and who are involved in occupations that require ongoing physical input?  That could mean people who work in shops.  It is so vast an a area, particularly when one thinks of all the different ranges involved.</p> <p>  I am not in favour of designating industries.  I am of the view that when one reaches a certain age, one should get the pension.  The reason I say that is because as sure as you make a list, you will find somebody who is not on that list.  I am interested in the witnesses' views on that matter.  Should we just stick with 66 and raise the money in some other way?  I will be open and straight here: it is the solution I favour.  This is the big issue, but there many other things in the report.  The employment issues has to be dealt with, but I do not think that anybody argues about that.  Everyone accepts it.  A person is right to continue working if he or she wants to do so.  We need to get on with the job here in the D&aacute;il, but there is no big debate about that because everyone is on the same side of that argument.  It comes down to whether we can afford to continue to pay pensions at 66.  If we do not, will we hit a vast number of people who engaged in particular types of work during their lives and who could not be reasonably expected to continue working after 66.</p> <p>  There is another matter.  I read the submission from Family Carers Ireland last night.  The witnesses might be interested to know that I recently made submissions to the Minister for Social Protection and to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, which followed on from a pre-budget submission that was made by this committee.  I distilled out some issues that I thought were in urgent need of address, including the IQA means test.  I compared two couples where one knew the rules and the other did not, where one put all the money into a joint account and the other did not and where the primary earner was very careful not to put it into a joint account.  Of course, it is always recommended to put the money into a joint account.  Presumably, the couple would say that it is both of their incomes, which is a concept I agree with.  I was in that situation myself.  If there is a lump sum, savings from the primary earner's income, money from an inheritance or whatever, however, the means test means that IQA will be taken away.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of debate about the disability issue, which is an issue that I have raised in the D&aacute;il.  It becomes an increasing issue where parents die and the family home is broken up so the proceeds are divided between the children.  Once the amount goes over &euro;50,000, one hits an absolute wall.  Let us consider the example of three children, one of whom has been severely disabled from birth, and a house that is valued at &euro;450,000, which is not a massive price for a house in urban areas nowadays.  So the two children would inherit their share of &euro;450,000, namely, &euro;150,000 each.  They would get that without incurring any inheritance tax.  The third child would get the same amount without incurring any inheritance tax but the Department of Social Welfare would take away the whole disability allowance.  It is interesting that Family Carers Ireland focused on that and on the disregard for savings.  It would be fair to say that this committee has been very supportive of that.  I have gone one step further.  I went to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and stated that this will not cost anything significant but that there is a total injustice here.</p><p> Ms Duffy mentioned the issue of the self-employed versus the employed in terms of pensions.  People can earn &euro;200 a week under the IQA if they are employed and they cannot if they are self-employed.  I have that on my shopping list.  If Ms Duffy is interested in getting my shopping list, she can send me an email.  She can find my email on the web very easily and I will send my shopping list so she will see what I submitted.  I think she will say that one of us must have seen the other's paper because they are uncanny in their similarities.  It is an issue that is hitting carers and people on disability allowance, in other words, the caree and the carer, and it is one that needs to be addressed.</p><p>  I want to address the issue of the long-time carer.  In the main, when people are caring for a parent, it is not that long-term but where parents have a highly disabled child, it can often be a lifetime from the time the child is born.  As Ms Duffy pointed out, that means a person might have five, seven, eight or ten years work in the commercial workforce and then, suddenly, they hit a wall.  In those cases, we have to do something, both on the 20-year rule and also on the contributions rule.  I would not necessarily be in favour of going much beyond that but we have to look after that particular group, who really dedicate their lives not only to their child, but to do a job that the State could never do as well, in my view, and they should get every support for doing that.  If that is what they choose to do and if that is their free choice, that is fair enough, but it is still a hugely onerous task to take on and it needs every support.  We need to get rid of the disadvantage of going that route.</p><p> I could say a lot more.  The Family Carers Ireland paper on this issue, which is not all on pensions, is very relevant.  I would be particularly interested in the contribution from the unions in regard to whether we can get some fix on the figures for how many people there are.  It is totally ridiculous to expect them to work into their late 60s in the occupation for which they are trained.  I do not buy into this malarkey that people can suddenly train themselves to become a computer scientist or something else at that age.  I will never stop anybody doing anything, but we cannot expect them to do that and that is the difference.</p></speech>

The problem is that we cannot say X number would find it physically difficult beyond the age of 66 because it is a combination of the different types of work, even within the same in factory or the same firm, so it is difficult to nail down.  However, the Deputy has raised a couple of points.  We could say that manual workers might be the ones who are most at risk and it may well be that those are the occupations.  However, let us take a hospitality worker, a cleaner aged 64, who is flipping eight mattresses a day.  I struggle to flip our mattress once every six months whereas they do six to eight a day, yet we do not think of that cleaner as being someone in an arduous task.  There is this idea that in the work of the future, we are all just going to be sitting, punching numbers into a computer or doing the same thing on our smartphones.  We ignore the vast range of occupations which, in many cases, might be fit for a younger person but when people hit the age of 60, it becomes extremely difficult and they are at risk of injury.  Then, when we put that in combination with the issue of healthy life expectancy, we have a much different perspective.  I will let Mr. Berney develop that.  We will attempt to nail those numbers down for the Deputy.</p></speech>

That is my view.  I think that going to 68 is not dealing with the realities for people in my constituency.  We need a lot of examples of why and how this is not real-world stuff.  As I said, we have to take into account that we are talking about the work period from the late 1980s onwards, perhaps 1988 if we take 40 years as being the number of contributions people have, so there is no point talking about work practices of the future or even of the 2020s.  It is from 1988 onwards and we know what the work was like out there.  It is just to give us more of a flavour because it baffles me, personally, how anybody could suggest this if they had day-to-day experience of dealing with people who are working in these types of professions.  It is something that worries me about this report in that it just seems to miss so many of the people I meet every day and the condition they are in, and I am just talking about people who come in to me off the street with all sorts of problems, not all of them pension-related, and the physical shape they are in.</p></speech>

To be clear, both SIPTU and Congress do not agree with an increase in the pension age.  We are on the record and our submissions to the commission reflect that.  Both in our submissions to the commission and also in the meeting that was held with the commission and with stakeholders, we made very substantial points around the issues that the Deputy is highlighting about arduous work.  To some extent, the commission has acknowledged that but whether it has done enough to recognise the problem that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is identifying is an open question.  Like SIPTU, we will try to see within our own organisation whether we can help the Deputy in what he is trying to do and supply it to him.  He is right.  There is a range of occupations across the country where it is unthinkable that people would be asked to work well into their 60s.  While in a previous contribution I referenced the use in other jurisdictions of classifications of occupations, I am not saying that is an approach that Congress supports and I was just using it by way of an example of what is used in other jurisdictions.  As Mr. Taft has pointed out, in a factory it could be that different types of classifications have different experiences, so it would be a very difficult approach to take.  I was merely pointing to it as an approach that has been taken in other jurisdictions.  We will try to identify if we have within our own organisation any information that would support or help the Deputy in the analysis he is trying to undertake.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge all of his points.  As he said, everything that he has in his paper, I have in mine, so that is good.</p> <p>  The big frustration with regard to the IQA is that there is an anomaly.  Even though people are getting a contributory State pension, which is not means tested, the IQA is.  The other thing that is incredibly frustrating is that it is based on the assets.  In my experience, it is having assets that causes someone not to satisfy the means test for the IQA.</p><p>Very often it is farming families.  It is the fact that people have the land that often pushes the wife out of eligibility.  It is the assets as opposed to the income that concerns me.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to inheritance and how getting a lump sum affects pension entitlements and the children in the family, in particular where there are significant care needs.  There was a very welcome announcement in last month's budget.  I thank the committee for its work in highlighting the issue through its submission.  The budget increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 the capital disregard for carer's allowance.  I have done the calculations for families and this will make a major difference to some families who have a few bob in the bank.  If the disregard could equally apply to the non-contributory State pension, it would make an enormous difference.</p><p> In terms of the distinction between long-term carers and carers who care for a shorter period, I am satisfied that the current safety nets &ndash; the homemaker's scheme and the home caring periods &ndash; are sufficient to protect shorter term carers, for example, people who are caring for their mum or dad for two or three years.  The cohort we must support is what the commission calls long-term carers &ndash; I call them lifetime carers &ndash; because they have dedicated their life to caring.</p><p> One point I have not mentioned, which is important, is awareness about pension entitlement.  It was one of the recommendations that we made to the commission and it has been reflected in the report.  At the moment, people only get a PRSI statement if they take the time to log on and request one.  Once they get it, they would need to have a PhD to interpret it and understand what it means.  We have called for a more regular PRSI statement that would be automatically sent to people, perhaps when they reach the age of 50 and again at 55, so that if there are gaps, they can plug them and do something about them.  The PRSI statement should not be sent in its current format but should be interpreted a little more.  I appreciate that would require resources.</p><p> The Chairman mentioned the manual aspect of caregiving.  We have done countless reports in Family Carers Ireland which show the enormous physical, mental and psychological impact of caregiving.  I do not know the statistics off the top of my head, but we have figures that show the physical impact of caregiving, which is enormous.  I do not mean it in a disrespectful way, but carers do not have the luxury of retiring.  As long as their caring responsibilities continue, it does not matter if they are 66, 68 or 69, they still will provide that care, very often until their body simply gives up.  It is a highly manual, physical task.  Retirement ages do not count in the sector I work in.</p></speech>

I apologise for my late arrival.  I had another meeting which clashed with this one.  Everything comes on one day.  I apologise in advance if I ask a question that has already been addressed.  If I do, I ask the witnesses to let me know and I can watch the discussion later.</p> <p>  SIPTU especially, but also ICTU, raised the cost and the savings.  This is an issue we must address once and for all because it seems there is no real clarity and different people are saying different things about savings.  Do we know what has been saved due to the gap from 65 to 66 since the State pension transition payment was abolished?  What has been paid out in either jobseeker's payment or benefit for 65-year-olds versus what would have been paid out if they had received the State pension transition payment?  This is an important issue.  We must all be clear on precisely what the savings are, and potentially how much, if anything, we are looking to save by increasing the State pension age.  That is something we must examine very closely.</p> <p>  I was somewhat surprised by the recommendation made by the Commission on Pensions, which has at least recognised the need for a State pension at 65 in some cases.  Unfortunately, it has coupled that with the caveat of where the pension age is increased.  It is important that the commission at least recognised that, at 65, some people will need to access the State pension.  ICTU and SIPTU referred to that specifically.  Will the witnesses speak a little about that?  Perhaps Mr. Taft could speak specifically to employer PRSI and where we are at in that regard compared with the rest of the European Union.  The commission has put forward various potential increases in regard to PRSI across the board.</p> <p>  Both ICTU and SIPTU mentioned the abolition of mandatory retirement and the fact that we do and should allow people who are willing and able to continue to work to do so and accrue PRSI contributions.  In some cases, they may not have the necessary PRSI contributions to get a full State pension.  That is important.</p> <p>  The next issue I raise is directed specifically to SIPTU and Ms Ryan.  There seem to be a lot of blockages when it comes to banning mandatory retirement ages in contracts.  Twice, the D&aacute;il has unanimously passed legislation to make provision for this but it has not gone any further.  As regards ensuring we get this done, are there issues with these contracts being private and with the retrospective nature of the legislation?  I presume Ms Ryan plays a role, if not the main role, in bringing cases to the Workplace Relations Commission involving people who are forced to retire at 65.  How much of an issue is that for workers?</p> <p>  We all welcome that the commission has been clear on the need for a State pension for long-term or lifetime carers, as Ms Duffy calls them.  The Minister seems to be fairly adamant that she wants to get this introduced.  The last time she spoke in the D&aacute;il on this, which was around budget time, she said it would be done within the next two years.  I will look at that again.  It is clear that this matter needs to be addressed.  Does Ms Duffy know if the total contributions approach is having a positive impact on carers?  That measure was introduced to get rid of averaging and especially for people who have gaps in their contributions.  What we need to look at before it is fully rolled out is whether the total contributions approach is working for carers.  If not, we need a State pension for lifetime carers as quickly as possible.  How quickly could it be introduced?  Has there been engagement between Family Carers Ireland and the Department or the Minister specifically on the need for this State pension?  That would be important.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachael Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#J00400"><p>The banning of retirement ages in contracts is not something SIPTU sought, mindful of the fact that we have a diversity of workers within our membership which reflects workers within society.  There is a strong view among some of our membership that they want a retention of a retirement age because they are not going to have the ability to work on.  The difficulty that has occurred is that there has been what I would describe as a blunt instrument in this area, in that the ability to impose a retirement age has been given over to private sector employers.  European law in the first instance says we cannot discriminate against somebody on the grounds of age.  That would include imposing a retirement age on them.  If I could, I will quote from the equality framework directive.</p> <blockquote> 	Notwithstanding Article 2(2), Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, [importantly] within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. </blockquote><p>What we have encountered in the private sector, in some employments, is that there is a blunt instrument given over to employers to impose a retirement age.  As my colleague, Mr. Taft, referenced, within some employments, there can be a variety of jobs but, in our experience, there will not be a variety of retirement ages.</p><p> To be clear, we did not look for the abolition of retirement ages to try to balance that.  The title of our submission to the commission reflects the need for flexibility within our pensions system.  There are workers who will not be able to continue working past the State pension age, whether because they have no desire to do so or because they do not have the ability.  We have talked about physically arduous work and its physical effect on workers.  That needs to be balanced against the situation of workers who have given 30 or 40 years of service to an employer and have the ability to continue working but are told they have to leave because they have reached a particular age.  The psychological effect can be strong for a worker in those circumstances.  That is why we asked the commission and are asking this committee, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referenced, to examine the provisions in legislation regarding mandatory retirement ages.  It is our strong argument that such a review must include the employment and social policy considerations and should not be passed entirely over to private sector employment.</p><p> Regarding cases before the WRC, there are several workers, as I said, who have had their retirement age imposed on them.  Coupled with the abolition of the transitionary State pension at the age of 65, this has meant that some people felt they were, in effect, caught between two stools or thrown on the scrapheap, whichever language is best to describe it.  Within our union, we saw a sharp increase in the number of cases being put into the WRC because of that particular issue.  I refer to the figures set out in our submission.  In 2013, 52 cases were referred to the WRC on the ground that a person had been discriminated against because of his or her age.  In 2014, that figure went up to 64.  There are no data available for 2015 but the number increased in the following three years to 127, 161 and, in 2018,  to 714.  This sharp increase was because people were being caught in a situation where their retirement age was imposed on them and, in turn, the transitionary State pension was not available to them.  That is why, as part of the suite of measures we set out in our submission to the pensions commission, we have asked for that area to be reviewed.</p></speech>

Like our colleagues in SIPTU, we did not argue for a ban on retirement age in employment contracts for the reasons set out by Ms Ryan.  We argued in our submission to the pensions commission that there should be a recognition of long contribution records.  If a worker has an extensive contribution record over his or her period in work, that should be recognised by way of early access to the State pension.  To some extent, the commission has travelled that road with us.  It has recommended that people should have access to the State pension at 65 providing they have a particular level of contributions.  We would argue that the commission has pitched the level of contributions a bit too high, which is something the committee might look at in its review of the commission's report.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Ms Ryan on the point around why there was an increased referral of cases to the WRC over the period to which she referred.  It was because, at that particular point in time, people were beginning to be caught in the clash between their retirement age and the availability of the State pension.  It is important that the Oireachtas takes action to implement the recommendation of the commission that the retirement age contained in a retirement contract should at least be the same as the age at which people have access to the State pension.  Recognition of long contribution records is an issue to which we also should give attention.  It is an important consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#K00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  She asked whether the total contributions approach is working well and whether we had engagement with the Department on that issue.  Family Carers Ireland published a paper a number of years ago on the State pension and carers, called Mind the Gap.  The best way I can describe the TCA is that it plugs some but not all of the gaps that are there.  We have already talked about the increase for a qualified adult and the issues around that, as well as self-employment versus employment.  The TCA plugs some of those issues but not all of them.  The major issue it does not plug is the requirement to have 520 paid contributions.  It does nothing for carers who do not achieve that.  Addressing that issue is what is so attractive about the recommendations the pensions commission has made about moving forward.  Those recommendations do two really important things.  First, they allow for gaps in people' employment record extending beyond a limit of 20 years to be filled.  The interim TCA has a limit which makes it as though caring does not happen after a person has done it for 20 years.  It just ignores a situation where there have been 20-plus years of caregiving.  The new scheme would recognise those additional years.  It would also allow Exchequer-funded contributions in respect of caregiving periods to be counted as part of the 520 contributions.  It abolishes the 520 benchmark, which is at the heart of all of this.  In short, yes, there are improvements to the TCA but it certainly does not plug all of the gaps.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we have had engagement with the Department.  We had a really good engagement with the pensions commission.  We were perhaps one of the few organisations that was invited to make an oral submission, which we did in February.  In terms of engaging directly with the Department on pensions and a carers' register, that has not happened yet.  One of the commission's recommendations refers specifically to the establishment of a register of carers and notes that this could be attached to the national carers' strategy.  The revised strategy was due to be published by the Department of Health this year but has been delayed.  As far as I am aware, scoping work has not yet begun on a new strategy.  If the establishment of a carers' register is going to be an action contained within that, I am worried about the timelines.  This issue must be treated with urgency and it does not have to sit under the national carers' strategy.</p></speech>

This is the best committee meeting I have attended all year and I am a member of a couple of committees.  The quality of the contributions and the data we are getting are absolutely key.  I want to address a couple of points that were raised.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v spoke about people in the real world, the arduous labour they do and whether their situation has been addressed by the commission.  I do not know whether it has but I know Ms Ethel Buckley, who is a member of the commission, has spent years campaigning on the issue of the State pension age.  She was instrumental in the STOP67 campaign, which had a huge impact at the most recent election.  I have no doubt she would have raised this issue.</p><p>The real question I would ask is whether the other commission members were listening or how in touch they were in terms of real world people.  Let us think about this for a second.  There are 180,000 people working in the hospitality sector, including hotel housekeepers, cleaners and caterers.  There are also healthcare assistants and home helps.  Most of the people I have listed are women.  Sometimes we think of arduous labour and assume it involves men in meat factories or construction, but a multitude of women workers have arduous jobs.  To quote Michael Taft, are we really going to say to them after a lifetime of work that they have to continue working because they are not going to get their pension?  I do not know about the Chair, but I was most struck by the data around healthy life expectancy, which is ten to 12 years.  That brings it home.  According to the Pensions Commission, we are perhaps likely to tell people that we are going to take two of the last ten or 12 years of healthy life because we will have to make them work longer.</p><p> At a committee meeting a couple of weeks ago, it was stated by the Department that we have to be realistic.  My questions are for my colleagues in SIPTU.  Workers have worked incredibly hard in physical jobs across all of the areas I have mentioned.  I have not even mentioned the front-line heroes and people who have kept the economy going over the past two years, including those working in food production, warehouses and meat factories.  Are we really going to say to them that they are going to lose two years?  How realistic is it to expect people to do that work for another two years?  Is it more realistic to consider a different combination of changes to ensure our pension system meets the people who need it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#L00200"><p>I would like to come back on a couple of questions Deputy Kerrane asked.  On whether it is realistic, the argument is that the fiscal urgency is so profound and potentially so dangerous to our public finances that we have to sweep aside some of the concerns over social equity.  Insofar as it would not be realistic to ask somebody to work for longer in particular occupations, unfortunately, the hard realism is coming from a fiscal perspective which we believe has not been adequately justified.  As long as the fiscal argument is telling us we must do this or otherwise our public finances will be in terrible shape in ten, 20 or 30 years' time, this is what will be imposed on working people.  We are particularly sensitive to that in SIPTU because most of our membership comprises low and average income earners, primarily in the manual sectors, construction, mining and cleaning.  We are especially sensitive to their work and the fact that when some people say we have to get realistic, it is usually sort of people I have mentioned who end up paying for that realism.</p> <p>  I will respond to Deputy Kerrane.  She mentioned there was little or no clarity.  In our earlier discussion, we talked about the distinction between the different models and why it might be helpful to the committee to investigate that.  I will make a further point.  The commission did not give an estimate of how much its proposal would save.  Its proposal is quite distinct from the modelling of the Department of Finance and Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Its work was based on the previous legislation.  The commission's work started with 2028 and worked on the basis of phasing things out over four years etc.  That is quite a bit different from what the Department and council said.  It did not cost that.  If you are going to argue that we need to achieve fiscal sustainability when the main proposal in that regard is not costed, that is a deficit the committee may wish to look into.  </p> <p>  A second issue is something we recommended in our submission that the commission should investigate.  We do not know what net pension expenditure is.  There is gross pension expenditure and net pension expenditure, and that comes after tax.  Most EU countries report gross and net expenditure.  The EU ageing tables include that.  Ireland is one of the few countries that does not report that.  Again, this is not a game changer in terms of pensions sustainability, but in countries that report it, there is a gap of up to one to two percentage points of GDP.  The implicit tax rate in the legislative estimate by the EU Commission ageing report 2021 was about 15%.</p> <p>  We have to speak in terms of net expenditure.  If the only figures used are gross figures and revenue is ignored, which will automatically come from having made that expenditure, then the analysis may be skewed.  The Revenue Commissioners could do a sample analysis of the database for the committee.</p> <p>  On employers' PRSI, employers' social insurance is 50% of the EU average.  This is not surprising because for years we have had a beneficial age demographic.  We did not have as many older people as other countries and did not have to pay out as much in pensions.  Therefore, we did not have to raise as much social insurance to pay for those pensions.  That is going to change in the coming years.  We will have to push that up incrementally.  It is too early to say how high it will go &ndash; perhaps it will double &ndash;  but there will be a significant and substantial increase in employers' social insurance if our demands for resources for pensions are consistent with our move towards an EU norm in terms of the number of older people.</p> <p>  People get confused about employers' social insurance.  This can be collectively bargained and negotiated, not in terms of the rate set but the impact of the rate on employers.  When workers bargain with their employers over, for example, a 3% pot of money during a wage round, they can decide to make a demand for a 3% pay increase or they can demand a pay increase of 2.5%, but also ask for sick pay, a maternity top up, a new pension or some other social benefit.  In other words, social benefits, which employers' social insurance represents, are things trade unions negotiate.  If we had a proper collective bargaining coverage, we could integrate the increases in employers' social insurance with the collective bargaining framework, something that employers and employees agree, and that would minimise the impact of increasing employers' social insurance on the economy.</p></speech>

They have been covered by Mr. Taft.  I will not repeat what he said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2021112400002#L00400"><p>I thank the witnesses.  What Senator Gavan said was very informative.  One other aspect which has not been mentioned is the fact a lot of pensioners work beyond the age of 65 because they want to work.  Others do so because of poverty due to the fact they cannot afford to live on a pension and need to keep working to have an income to pay a mortgage or rent.  Many pensioners have experienced an increase in rent in recent times.  Many older people do not own their homes and may be paying high rents.</p><p>They need to stay on in work.  They are looking at their income.  That is an important point to make and it should be factored in.</p><p> We have been restricted in our debate on pensions.  The Commission on Pensions had a narrow focus, which was on the basis of age, which it was asked to look at, as well as the fiscal part of it - the financing of it.  That has pushed out the whole social contract.  Even though it has taken on board some of those social contracts, it could not take others, as it said itself.</p><p> Mr. Taft mentioned PRSI and the collective bargaining aspect of it.  Will he explain that a bit more?  Is he saying he could collectively bargain with employers for a 5% increase in the PRSI levy for employers, but that 2% of that would go into something specific?  I want some clarity on that.  Where I think the whole process has fallen down is in the issue of universal old age pensions, which the Citizens' Assembly has raised, to deal with inequalities.  We know child benefit is the only the universal benefit that we have in this country and it plays a key role in supporting children.  I would like Mr. Taft's opinion on the universal old age pension.  It was raised in many submissions as well, as far as I remember from reading briefly through some of them.  We raised that as an alternative.  In New Zealand, you get a universal pension after 20 years&rsquo; residency.  I would like any of the speakers' opinions on those points.</p></speech>

For something as fundamental as substantially increasing employee social insurance, you would need a consensus about that.  This is because it would have quite an impact.  You would need to get a consensus between employers and employees, especially in the phasing in, because this could not be done overnight. It would have to be phased in over years.  The employers' PRSI might go up 0.5% this year, next year, and the year after that.  In each of those 0.5% stages, that would factored into the collective bargaining arrangement.  This is because that 0.5% represents part of the employee&rsquo;s compensation.  That is the part where it is negotiated.  Employers&rsquo; social insurance and employee&rsquo;s compensation are part of the whole package.  That would have to be taken into account in a collective bargaining arrangement.  I said this before when I used the examples of company benefits, but it can be squared around between wage, benefits and all that.  That is why if we had, which we unfortunately do not, a robust sectoral or national collective bargaining framework, that would make that much easier.  It could be done in such a way that is the least disruptive to business and economic activity.  While the Government would set it, how it would be implemented at the workplace level would be collectively bargained.</p></speech>

In one of the sectors where there is a sectoral employment order, which is in construction, there is a mandatory requirement for employers to pay into an occupational pension scheme on behalf of the people they employ.  Collective bargaining has produced an occupational pension that sits alongside the State pension for those workers.</p> <p>  It is important to say as well that one of the things we put in our submission to the Commission on Pensions, as did SIPTU, I think, is the roll-out of auto-enrolment in pensions and the introduction of mandatory pension contributions across the economy.  One of the statistics that is a real problem for us at the moment is the fact the majority of workers within the private sector have no occupational pensions.  That is one of the reasons people might have no choice but to work beyond the age of 65, 66 or whatever the State pension age is set at.  The roll-out of auto-enrolment and the requirement, like there is in the construction sector, that employers make a mandatory occupational pension contribution for workers is important.</p> <p>  The question of the universal pension is a complex one.  I do not think we could do justice to a discussion on the universal pension in the short time we have available to us here.  From the perspective of the ICTU, we favour the model that exists, which is contributions and entitlement.</p></speech>

It is important in recognising the poverty that older people experience.  We see that all the time.  On carers and the social contract, this is about how we recognise, value and support carers.  The Commission on Pensions&rsquo;s terms of reference only asked it to speak about one aspect that social contract, which is a carer's eventual entitlement to a pension.  The commission makes three recommendations for carers.  In the second recommendation, it makes it clear that Exchequer paid-for contributions the State will make on behalf of long-term carers are for pensions purposes only.  They will not give the a carer an entitlement to any other benefit scheme within social welfare.  That is a very important point and I will leave it at that.  Deputy Collins is right that the broader social contract is about more than just pensions, yet the Commission on Pensions makes it clear that its recommendation is only for the pension, which cuts carers off from other important schemes.</p></speech>

I therefore know I am speaking to people who are of the same mind as me.  Let us get that on the record again.</p> <p>  I am fascinated with the debate on affordability and our choices, as though PRSI and social welfare were self-financing arrangements.  They are not, of course.  For many periods, and I am not talking about the crisis periods in more recent times, such as in the past two years, but about when pensions were initially introduced, the Exchequer always contributed to the pension.  Not only that, there was a much higher percentage of non-contributory pensions in those days than there are now.  This is because a higher proportion are getting contributory pensions.  The non-contributory was always 100% Exchequer-funded.</p> <p>  The world is our oyster in how we fund this.  We could raise PRSI.  I would argue to people and to anybody who comes to me that PRSI is probably the best value pension policy ever bought into.  We are saving at today&rsquo;s rates.  I often say I started working for &pound;16 per week.  Then, I was paying the same percentage in the stamp duty.  It was a physical stamp in those days.  It would not put much into my pension fund now.  The great thing about the pay-as-you-go system is that it is in today&rsquo;s money today.  You are getting paid back out in today&rsquo;s money because somebody else is funding in.  That is one way.</p><p> The second way that is obvious and is mentioned in the report is that the PRSI self-employed rate be increased because it is, on average, actuarially the steal of the century in value terms.</p><p> The third way is that we honour the promises that we gave - I was there and the Chairman was in opposition - when we said that the USC was a temporary phenomenon and that we would replace it by putting more into the social solidarity fund if necessary.  It was to be a temporary expedient to get us over the crash.</p><p> There is also Exchequer funding.  One could hypothecate any amount of funding that could be sourced from wealth or whatever and, therefore, that sourcing would not hit the ordinary person.  Some &euro;10 billion in Exchequer funding goes in every year, including this year.  Exchequer funding into the social welfare system amounts to slightly less than 50% of the overall system.</p><p> In looking at the whole maw, what is the right decision for pensioners and those who are ageing in society?  How do we respect them?  Let us then see how to fund that decision without limiting how we do so.  Why constrain ourselves with arbitrary rules?  I would be interested in the witnesses' views.</p><p> It seems that what is being proposed is being justified on some principle of social solidarity.  Thankfully, the majority of people who are young now will get old, so it is not really a question of intergenerational solidarity.  Young people are being told that, if they are generous today, they will get their turn tomorrow.  They are not being told to give and that they will never get it back.  They will of course get it back when they reach the necessary age.  Unfortunately, it creeps up on us all a little faster than we thought.  In my opinion, social solidarity with older people means someone who reaches that age cannot be automatically expected to work, can retire and still have a modicum of income, and social solidarity from my generation to the younger generation should be that we insist on affordable housing, good childcare and elements such as Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  I mention the last two elements in particular, given that children are our future.  In other words, I do not believe that this version of intergenerational social solidarity is the paramount one.  It is a reordering of our society in a much wider way than just penalising age.  I would be interested in knowing how the witnesses view this point in terms of helping people of working age, particularly those with families.  Let us be honest about it, in that children are the future, so if we are really interested in intergenerational sustainability, we must make them affordable, to put it bluntly in economic terms.  Are we overly confining this debate about what we fund, how we fund it and how we realise intergenerational solidarity compared to the way it seems to be laid out in the report, which proposes that we do this not because we would like to do so but because we must do something for younger people and cannot put the burden on them?  It would not be put on them, though.  If they make a small extra contribution, it would be like they were putting that into their own private pension funds and reaping the benefit when they got to 66 rather than 68 years of age.  According to social statistics, the vast majority of them will get there.</p></speech>

I welcome her to the meeting.  I will let her contribute first if she wants to respond to some of the comments that have been made.</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's points, the evidence that we have received this morning is that people on lower pay and in manual labour, women in particular, are disproportionately impacted upon by the increase in the pension age.  We also know from the evidence given to us as part of our hearings that people on higher incomes benefit disproportionately from the tax relief on pensions.  Is there a need to examine that relief and share it out in a more equitable way towards meeting the cost of State pensions?</p> <p>  In his evidence, Mr. Taft made the point that the healthy life expectancy was, on average, 12 years after the age of 66.  Sadly, that may fall temporarily due to Covid-19.  Is there merit in tying the retirement age into that benchmark?  If it increases or decreases over the generations to come, could that be the benchmark used for determining the retirement age so that the average person would be guaranteed ten to 12 years of healthy life after retirement?</p> <p>  Ms Duffy made the point that 70% of carers were also in employment.  Would she be prepared to comment on a question that I raised with the Minister for Finance on the floor of the House recently regarding the incapacitated child tax relief?  The Minister referred to the 2009 Commission on Taxation, which recommended that this relief be removed, but Ms Duffy made the point that it could be used to help compile the carer register.  Clearly, there is some thinking within the Department of Finance that we should be considering removing reliefs in respect of incapacitated children and older people.</p> <p>  I will start with Dr. Bambrick and then invite the other witnesses to conclude.</p></speech>

As with other issues around universal pensions that have been raised during the short time I have been at this meeting, this was outside the scope of the commission but I have no doubt that it will be closely examined by the ongoing Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  We must remember that the policy objective of the State pension is just to keep people out of poverty.  It is not about meeting their normal living standards.  As such, it is important that people not only have access to the State pension but also to a top-up, be that an occupational pension or a private pension, so that they do not have a significant collapse in their living standards when they reach retirement age.  While there are improvements to be made in tax-free allowances around second-tier pensions, we must recognise that they meet an important policy objective in and of themselves.  That will be part of ICTU's submission to the current commission.</p> <p>  The question on linking the pension age to demographics was recommended in previous pension policy, in that, in 2035, which will be seven years after the pension age eventually reaches 68 years of age in 2028, we would start to link the pension age to demographics.  As life expectancy extended, so would the pension age.</p><p>The assumption would be that if life expectancy stalled or reversed in some way, we would have a corresponding change in the pension age.  The issue that unions have always had with that is that life expectancy increases but they do not happen universally.  We can see from health research done by Trinity College that there is a difference between the poorest and richest parts of the country of six years and four months for women and seven years for men.  If we are going to link the pension age to demographics, we must recognise that while we all might, on average, be getting older we are not all getting older to the same extent.  That would be the real concern for us.  This is why Congress has for a long time pushed for what is recommended by the commission in that the State pension would not only recognise the number of candles on one's birthday cake but would also recognise the number of years that one has contributed into the system through paid or caring contributions.  That would come into effect because we know, on average, that the younger one enters employment, the more likely one is to do hard, physical labour and therefore the more likely one is to die at an earlier age than a professional who is universally educated, in a non-manual job and, as Mr. Taft said, is going to live longer and have more years of healthy life.</p></speech>

Family Carers Ireland has called for an entire reform and overhaul of the current tax regime and how that supports working carer families.  At the moment we have four tax reliefs or credits for carers.  We have the incapacitated child tax credit, which is &euro;3,300.  We have the home carer's tax credit, which has doubled in the last five years from &euro;800 to &euro;1,600.  We have the dependant relative tax credit, which was only &euro;70 but in the budget before last it was increased to &euro;245.  Finally, we have the tax relief on the cost of employing a home carer.  There are so many anomalies and inconsistencies across those four tax reliefs or credits.  For example, one can only apply or benefit from the home carer's tax credit if one is married or cohabiting and assessed jointly for tax purposes.  I have often had a single carer ask me why he or she cannot have this tax credit.  I do not have an issue with the suggestion to abolish the incapacitated child tax credit as long as it is done in the context of overall reform and the current system is made better for working carer families.</p> <p>  I will finish by repeating what I said earlier.  The best way for us to secure a State pension for any family carer is to support him or her to remain in employment, where possible, because in many caring situations it is not possible.  In order for these people to remain in employment, we need to support them with a robust and sensible tax relief system.  I have no issue with that as long as the overall tax regime is reformed to make it better.</p></speech>

That is never more obvious than in the case of social insurance pensions.  On the Continent, pay-related pensions are paid through PRSI or social insurance forms whereas we have a flat rate.  They have a much more elevated and enhanced approach.  That is important because social insurance is the ultimate in solidarity.  It is the ultimate in insurances.  We can talk about widening the pool and de-risking the population.  We all rely on each other.  We put in what we can afford and we take out what we need.  It is the ultimate principle not only of solidarity but also of something that can transcend ages.  Interestingly, after the general election the Red C poll asked people whether they supported an increase in the pension age, which was the third largest issue in the election, and two thirds of respondents were opposed to raising the pension age.  The highest age group to oppose an increase were young people at 70%.  There is a generational war type of commentary that we get in some parts of the debate.  Something like this issue is an example of why some of that type of commentary, and I do not want to call it nonsense, does not really reflect what people believe.</p> <p>  On the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, what I put in as a young person to fund - metaphorically - my grandfathers means that when I become a grandfather and retire, I will get supported.  If I put in money to support somebody who is going on maternity benefit, I may not benefit from that but my partner and my family will.  They put in money because I might rely on sickness pay.  It is true that the Exchequer has had to give a subvention in three quarters of all the years since 1950 and since the Social Insurance Fund was taken up.  I think there is an argument for making the Social Insurance Fund more robust and better able to withstand recessions in order that it does not have to rely on the Exchequer, although Exchequer funding will still be there.  If it were not for the pandemic, the Government's budgetary papers in 2019 projected that this year there would have been a social insurance surplus of &euro;2 billion, and in 2023 a surplus of &euro;4 billion and an accumulated surplus of &euro;15 billion.  Social insurance brings in a fair bit of money and we can afford the expenditures.  Given that SIPTU's analysis, and this seems to be confirmed by IFAC, is that pensions will not increase as a proportion of national income between now and 2030, we have time - we cannot be complacent - to come up with more fiscally robust measures that are socially equitable and build on the insurance principle that has been mentioned.</p></speech>

They are the people who can afford this - not the young people for whom we are cutting off a long-term benefit.  If they were asked whether a change in the pension age would make a difference, they might say "No" if they were selfish.  The people who have already reached 66 years of age might want to pull up the ladder after them and say that it is tough on anyone who comes behind them.  It is very prescient of the younger group to say "hang on a second" and to query the fact that they are being asked to get rid of the ladder just because they do not need it at the moment.  It has actually inverted who might have a selfish interest in pulling up the ladder and getting increases in the pension as opposed to allowing people in the 66 to 68 age group to get it.</p><p>If, in 20 years, people find that such a thing is unsustainable, they will have to think it out again.  There are many ways to think this out.  It is not a one-trick pony.  Having worked in the Department for a while, I have a suspicion that the terms of reference are written and it gets the answer it wants.  It is a cynic's view of the world.</p></speech>

As my colleagues from Family Carers Ireland said earlier, if we were designing the system for the State pension today we would not start from where we are now.  We would have a different system.  In light of the commission's report, one of the issues that it is important for people to understand, or for the committee to reflect on, is that there is a strong sense of solidarity among younger people for the continuation of the State pension.  As Mr. Taft said, in the poll published in one of the national newspapers last Sunday there was strong support among young people for the State pension and for not increasing the pension age.</p> <p>  It is important that we use this opportunity of examining reform to make a clear connection and give young workers who are beginning to pay into the State pension system some assurance that their contributions will result in them being able to get a State pension when, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, they come to the age they are entitled to receive it.  This level of certainty has to be implicit in our State system.  To have constant uncertainty about when people might receive the pension diminishes support for social solidarity.  Certainly in the redesign of the system and whatever reform is undertaken following the commission's report, a crucial pillar in the design of the new system will be providing it for as long as we can.</p></speech>

I intend to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, and Media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, will address matters related to sport.  I understand that matters relating to the Gaeltacht will be dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Irish-speaking Community.</p> <p>  I am pleased to have this further opportunity to address the committee on the key priorities of my Department and to set out the vision for these wide-ranging and valuable sectors.  I spoke to the committee last about my priorities in April this year.  At that time, I said that these sectors contribute significantly to our country&rsquo;s economy, while also supporting individual and community well-being right across Ireland.  However, there is no doubt that the diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been, and continue to be, amongst those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.   These sectors are fundamental to societal well-being.  They encourage public confidence and our collective resilience as we continue to emerge from the pandemic over the longer term.  They also remain among the most vulnerable to the cruel unpredictability of this devastating disease.  It has been said many times that they were the first to close and last to reopen.  A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, in order that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery.</p> <p>  During 2021, the &euro;55 million support fund announced as part of budget 2021 for strategic tourism businesses, and the &euro;5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector, continued to be provided.  These measures have complemented the horizontal measures employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS; the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS; and the restart scheme.  I also launched a &euro;17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme, which is delivered in partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and local authorities across the country.</p><p>For the coming year, &euro;288.5 million is allocated for tourism services, which represents an increase of &euro;67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation.  The additional funding will help to address immediate survival-related concerns for business continuity, domestic and international marketing, and support for tourism product development, while also enabling further resilience and recovery across the industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> I was very cognisant of the challenges the restrictions caused for the arts, culture and live entertainment industry in 2021, and I allocated more than &euro;60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crew through the introduction of several new schemes.  Those included the provision of support for live entertainment businesses, encompassing a new live performance support scheme, a new support scheme for live events and entertainment businesses, and funding to support local authorities for outdoor live performances.  As part of budget 2022, I maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record level of &euro;130 million.  This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties.  With these ongoing levels of public funding in 2022, the Arts Council is empowered to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead.</p><p> I have also allocated &euro;25 million for the live entertainment sector as part of budget 2022, and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible.  The supports provided have been essential for those hardest-hit, and I will continue to do everything possible to ensure necessary provisions are in place to allow these sectors, which are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being, to thrive once again.</p><p> Regarding my Department&rsquo;s capital programme, I worked closely with colleagues across Government to renew our national development plan.  The programme for Government makes strong commitments to continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure.  My priorities under the renewed national development plan are aligned under three categories of activities my Department undertakes to support and develop its sectors: supporting economic recovery and resilience, promoting well-being and social cohesion, and providing sustainability and guardianship of our cultural, linguistic and environmental resources.</p><p> A key priority for my Department is the continued safeguarding and modernisation of institutions through the national cultural institutions, NCI, investment programme in the national development plan, NDP.  This is an ambitious &euro;460 million programme of capital investment across all our NCIs which will ensure they can continue their legacy of providing engaging cultural and artistic offerings to the people.  The national development plan also includes &euro;265 million for a cultural and creativity investment programme.  The large-scale sports infrastructure fund and sports capital and equipment programme are also key elements of my Department&rsquo;s NDP plans, which will be further addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.</p><p> As we continue the recovery, my Department will work to deliver on priorities that are informed by the programme for Government.  My Department&rsquo;s key priorities for economic recovery are also informed by the tourism and arts and culture recovery task forces, which were established to provide recommendations for overcoming the challenges faced by these critical sectors.  Ireland&rsquo;s tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits the development of rural Ireland, especially in regions that lack an intensive industry base or are economically fragile.  For tourism, recovery and sustainable growth are essential.  This will begin with a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme informed by the recommendations of the tourism recovery task force as well as inputs from the tourism recovery oversight group.  I continue to work on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years towards ascertaining that we have a tourism sector that is socially and economically sustainable and that ensures sustainability is at the heart of the recovery in the sector.</p><p> This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment as we develop our national tourism product.  This investment programme will take a regions-led approach and will include investments in activity-based tourism, with a particular emphasis on the outdoors, and the development of strategic tourism locations.  As well as investing in our tourism product, these investments will provide important supports for regional enterprise and employment, and these are often located in areas where tourism is a key driver of the local economy.  The significant increase in funding for this sector provides an opportunity to reimagine and reconfigure Ireland&rsquo;s tourism for the future.  With the climate emergency as our backdrop, we must also play our part.  The future we imagine is one that will tell the story of our ancient past and our current modern communities, and one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty.</p><p> Turning to our arts and culture sector, last year the arts and culture recovery task force submitted to me its report, entitled Life worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors.  We have made significant progress already on implementing the report.  For example, I was particularly pleased to announce &euro;25 million for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022.  This is a major policy intervention for the arts and culture sector that requires significant resources from my Department to develop.  Work is ongoing and regular engagement with the sector is taking place.  My ambition is to open the pilot scheme for applications early next year.  I believe this makes a strong statement about the value we place on the arts sector, where employment is characterised by low, precarious and sometimes seasonal income.  Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society, and perhaps never more so felt than during this pandemic.  I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector, and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists after the difficult circumstances they have endured during the crisis.</p><p> The report of the night-time economy task force was published in September and contained several practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy as well as some pilot measures to support new developments in this area.  Work is also ongoing on the flagship digitisation of the 1926 census records this year, which will provide a further valuable set of records for genealogists across our global Irish community.  My Department has a range of key priorities in this area and I look forward to discussing them with the committee.  These include support for culture activities in the State-supported and commercial sectors, in which the Arts Council will play a central role.  My Department also continues to work on supporting the creative industries, including the audiovisual sector.  A key priority in this area will be the continued implementation of the audiovisual action plan over the coming years.</p><p> It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and to safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content that are so essential to a democratic society.  I am very aware of the important role played by the broadcasting and media sector in delivering key and necessary public health messages in recent times.  Some examples of measures in budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional &euro;4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which is the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the &euro;5.5 million allocated for the media commission.  This funding will be used for the setting up and commencement of the media commission&rsquo;s functions, to recruit an online safety commissioner and to lay the groundwork for an effective regulatory structure.  The spread and amplification of harmful online content raises serious concerns, and this will help us close a gap in Irish and international law concerning online safety.</p><p> Regarding the enabling legislation for the online safety and media regulation Bill, I also thank this committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill.  I commend the thorough and consultative approach taken by the committee in conducting its pre-legislative scrutiny.  It represents a continuity of the approach in developing the general scheme, which involved public consultation and significant stakeholder engagement.  I am closely considering all the recommendations.  Some deal with issues I have been examining for some time, and this includes how the Bill can be further strengthened to better protect individuals online, including by addressing issues relating to the appropriate avenues of complaint or redress.  I intend to progress the Bill as a matter of urgency following the current consideration.</p><p> Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and democracy.  As Minister with responsibility in this area, I will continue to advocate intensely for these sectors, as we all understand there is still much work left to do.  I will also continue consulting with the sectors and assessing supports in that regard.  We are operating in the shadow of Covid-19 and our recovery will not be easy.  It will not happen overnight, but I am confident Ireland will recover.  Our world-renowned tourism industry will welcome visitors back better than ever; our vibrant arts and culture sector will flourish again, showcasing our incredible talents both at home and abroad; we will have a rich landscape in which our language can continue to grow; and we will see our dynamic sports and media sectors strengthened, reinforced and supported.  This will require a long-term approach, and all of us here understand these sectors are critical to our lives.  I am deeply committed to supporting and realising this strategic vision.</p><p> I am happy to take any questions members may have later, but I will hand over to the Minister of State now.</p></speech>

The Department will continue to prioritise engagement across the sport sector, which, over the past number of months, as members will be aware, has highlighted the significant adverse impact of Covid-19 at all levels.  </p><p>Sporting organisations should continue to implement strong protocols with regard to training, competition and other sporting activities.  These include initiatives such as the collection of contact tracing data, recommending symptomatic individuals do not participate in or attend sporting activities, the ongoing promotion of good respiratory and hand hygiene, and the wearing of face coverings in relevant settings.  As we recover from the current crisis, the Department will work diligently with stakeholders across the sector to work out ways of meeting our target of 60% of the population participating in sport by 2027 and focussing on areas of gender diversity and inclusion.</p><p>We have started work this year on a number of actions that I believe will be of real benefit to sport and we will work on delivering others during both next year and in 2023.  There are a number of priorities that I would like to briefly emphasise, all of which are broadly connected to the sports participation theme.  First, I want to embed the idea of sport for all across all strands of the sports sector, whether at national governing body, NGB, level or more locally in sports clubs.  We have a record &euro;12 million budget from the Dormant Accounts Fund for investment in 2022 where we can focus increased efforts to help those from disadvantaged backgrounds and people with disability.  Second, there is a priority need to address low levels of participation among our schoolchildren.  We are planning to intensify our engagement with our colleagues in the Department of Education to identify some practical steps to secure improvements in this area and we will meet them before the end of this month.  We are also planning to hold a major, youth-centred stakeholder forum on how to address and rectify the fall-off in participation rates among young people, especially young girls in their teens, in the new year. </p><p>Third, we will work on other priorities such as winter initiatives for both 2021 and 2022, as well as the development of a national swimming strategy and a national digital database to provide people with key information on sport and recreational facilities in their localities to help them be more active.  We are also delighted that Sport Ireland published its new high performance strategy for </p><p>2021 to 2032, which received full Government approval.  It is a long-term plan for the Irish high performance system over the next three Olympic and Paralympic cycles.  This high performance strategy will support and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s position internationally.</p><p>Another strand of our work for the future is to enhance the governance capacity of the sector in partnership with the NGBs and other stakeholders.  We will also continue to improve the facilities available for everyone who wants to participate in sport through new rounds of the sports capital and equipment programme and progressing projects under the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF.  We are providing additional funding of up to &euro;65 million this year in Covid-19 funding to support the sector.  Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26 million already provided to Sport Ireland in budget 2021, a total of &euro;91.3 million will have been allocated in additional current funding to support the sport sector in 2021.  We are also providing an increased allocation of &euro;96.2 million for Sport Ireland in 2022, which will enable it to continue to support the sector through various funding programmes.</p><p>In recent years, Ireland has won bids to host the Ryder Cup in Limerick in 2027, a section of the UEFA Euro 2020 finals, the Women&rsquo;s Rugby World Cup 2017 and the T20 Men's Cricket World Cup 2030.  We are engaging with the UK Government to assess the potential to submit a co-hosting bid for the 2030 FIFA World Cup and work is also under way to consider other events.  As set out in the programme for Government, we are currently developing a major sports events policy and strategy, and are moving now to the public consultation phase of this process.  Major events have the potential to drive participation in sport, contribute to our ongoing economic growth, drive a sense of national pride and affect both how we see ourselves as a nation and how we are viewed internationally.  Trade, tourism, business, community pride and community engagement would all benefit.</p><p>Turning to capital investment in sports projects, the 2022 provision will allow for new grants to be announced under the sports capital and equipment programme.  The latest round closed for applications on 1 March this year.  By this date, a record 3,106 applications were received seeking more than &euro;200 million in funding.  The equipment-only projects were assessed first and grants with a total value of &euro;16.6 million were announced on 6 August 2021.  The letter of provisional allocation encouraged all grantees to draw down this funding before year-end and in recent weeks the Department has been prioritising the payments of all existing grants.  Ensuring that as many older grants as possible are paid before year-end will maximise the funding available to allocate for the existing sports capital and equipment programme applications.  </p><p>Assessment work is continuing on the remaining applications for capital works and every effort is being made to complete the process as quickly as possible.  Given the record number of applications received, however, it is likely to take a further number of weeks to have these assessments complete with final recommended allocations expected shortly thereafter.  In addition, resources have been provided in 2022 to continue to progress the first projects allocated funding last year under the new LSSIF.  The priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects but as it is now more than 18 months since the first allocations were made, and in view of the issues faced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is timely to review progress on all projects allocated grants.  The Department has now consulted all grantees in this regard.  This review is considering the scope for awarding new grants to projects that missed out under the first set of allocations and the timing of any new call for proposals.  It is expected that the review will be completed in the coming weeks. </p><p>I wish to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing the Sport Ireland campus at Blanchardstown.  The Government reaffirmed its commitment to the development of the campus in the new national development plan published on 4 October.  The 2022 allocation of &euro;9.2 million<b></b>will allow Sport Ireland to complete ongoing projects and progress the planning and design of the national velodrome and badminton centre.  Sport Ireland has just completed a new master plan, which will be the framework for the development of facilities at the campus over the next ten to 15 years.  We will bring the master plan to Government shortly for approval. </p><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for their time.  I am happy to take any questions they may have, along with the Minister, Deputy Martin.</p></speech>

I will now turn to our members, who have a rota of speaking slots in front of them.  I call Deputy Mythen, who has seven minutes for questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021112400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.  Their Department's sectors are, arguably, the most volatile and at risk from the Covid-19 restrictions.  Many who make their living in the areas of tourism, hospitality and entertainment experience work conditions that are often unstable and precarious.  A recent survey by the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, found that almost 75% of its members are experiencing cancellations of events for the month of December.  The survey also discovered that nearly 40% have had to take up work outside the industry, with 40% saying they may have to leave music and entertainment for good to earn a living.</p> <p>  The failure to extend the PUP in alignment with the recent tightening of restrictions on the sector is an almighty blow to many.  Workers in the entertainment, hospitality, nightlife and tourism industries are being left high and dry.  Taking into account the new restrictions, does the Minister agree that corresponding supports for those employees and their families who are most at financial risk must follow?</p> <p>  Is there currently any plan or procedure in place to monitor the impact of the latest public health restrictions on incomes and well-being within the sector, particularly the impacts on those in precarious work scenarios without the safety net of the PUP?</p> <p>  One of the key recommendations from the Life Worth Living report was making space for arts and live entertainment to contribute to national recovery.  The Dun Mhuire Theatre in Wexford has been a hub of activity for many years and the many groups that have used that space have contributed to the social and artistic fabric of the county.  The Department has been involved in the purchase of this site, along with Wexford County Council, and I believe that purchase is near completion.  I ask that the Department would engage with the council to address the issues of the arts and performance groups that now have nowhere to go.</p></speech>

We are all very much aware of the serious impact the pandemic has had on the live performance sector, our musicians and artists.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with a wide range of stakeholders across the sector, with a view to understanding the pressures that are faced and to ensure that the supports meet the needs of the sector.  In 2021, I allocated more than &euro;60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities.  I also introduced &euro;25 million for the live performance support scheme, &euro;16.5 million for the events sector Covid support scheme, &euro;10 million for the local live performance support scheme, &euro;4 million for the music and entertainment support scheme, &euro;5 million for the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme and &euro;1 million for the St. Patrick's Festival.</p><p>In budget 2022, I allocated &euro;25 million for the live entertainment sector.  I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at a record level of &euro;130 million.  This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and to assist arts organisations through financial difficulties.</p><p> My Department will continue to receive feedback on evolving challenges facing the sector.  It is on foot of these engagements that the significant supports have been provided.  Further funding is available in the recently secured budget.  We have continued to engage with the sector on how the supports can be better tailored to meet the needs.  The engagement will continue in the coming weeks with a view to opening the supports for applications as soon as possible.  If it is the case that these supports are exhausted in 2022 and the pandemic continues to impact on the sectors, we will review the situation.</p><p> In terms of the social welfare supports, the Department of Social Protection stands ready to provide support to those impacted in the short term.  To date, the Government has responded appropriately and has paid out more than &euro;8.9 billion through the PUP and a similar amount via the EWSS.  The Government has not been found wanting.  I assure the Deputy that we are monitoring the situation closely.  The position remains under review.  We will take the appropriate measures to support people, if and when required.</p><p> I also remind the Deputy that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, clearly signalled in his budget speech that he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are holding approximately &euro;4 billion of the Covid provision as a contingent reserve in order that we can adapt if faced with the unexpected.  Should further measures be warranted to support the sector, I will talk to those Ministers.</p><p> Regarding the query relating to Wexford, I will revert to the Deputy with more detail on the position in that regard.  Wexford is very important from a cultural perspective, not least because of the Opera House and the opera festival.  I will revert to the Deputy on the Dun Mhuire Theatre.</p></speech>

There has been ongoing engagement and an oversight group was set up.  Everything is being done in close consultation with the sector.</p> <p>  A tender has issued for a partner to develop an online application portal.  On 8 December, a significant stakeholder engagement will take place to hear the views of the artists, creatives and the relative resource bodies and representative organisations.  This scheme is so important and must be designed in close consultation with the sector, and 8 December will be a key date for the scheme.  Stakeholder engagement is key to the success of this policy and has been a cornerstone of my approach to the sector during the pandemic.  The launch date for applications and the eligibility criteria will be announced in January following the consultation on 8 December.  The consultation will be a global caf&eacute;-style event.</p></speech>

Departmental officials have met with every applicant who was awarded funding to get a sense of timelines and how to progress the projects.  We are anxious to see the capital budget progressed as quickly as possible to get projects moving.  The shutdown of the construction sector, first, and the requirement to balance finance has meant that some projects have not been able to commence.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State indicate the status of that project?  In recent weeks there has been a lot of controversy because the Dublin City Council manager, Owen Keegan, moved with a draft development plan for the city that included zoning for Tolka Park, which is a key component in terms of the financing of this project.  The latter angered many councillors, given that it was a material change within their powers.  Is the redevelopment of Dalymount Park contingent on the sale of Tolka Park, a move to which there is huge opposition?  Can we see development in Dalymount Park commencing in the next two years?</p></speech>

We take applications whether it is for Dalymount Park, Tolka Park or for any other use.</p><p>We expect drawdown in respect of the design work for Dalymount Park to happen shortly; it may already be under way.  That is one of the few projects on which there has been progress in that design work has commenced.  We are hoping it can advance to planning permission stage at some point next year.  The funding arrangements are a matter for Dublin City Council.  I know there is a campaign around that issue.  As I have previously stated in responses to parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il, it is a matter for the councillors.</p></speech>

The Minister of State alluded to a sum of &euro;200 million in respect of applications received this year.  In his budget speech, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, committed to additional funding for this area.  What is the expected overall spend?</p> <p>  The FAI published a report last week, launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, with Packie Bonner, on the social return of Irish football to grassroots.  One of the points made by the FAI officials was that while there is a huge gain to society, we need to spend more on facilities and, in particular, to look at the shared campus model that is in place across Europe.  We need to break away from our model.  It is galling for sports lovers when towns and villages located side by side submit applications for funding for clubs, primarily GAA but also soccer clubs.  We do not get the best bang for our buck from that.  Is it time to knock heads together?  We need to put Tom Ryan, Jonathan Hill and Philip Browne into a room to discuss how best we can move to the shared campus model across towns in Ireland into the future.</p></speech>

I am engaging with the Minister, Deputy McGrath, on the final figure and what we can allocate.  I expect the final amount to be very significant.  I do not propose to give a figure until it has been agreed with the Minister but there is a commitment, reaffirmed in the national development plan, around sports capital and equipment programme.  I expect that - this is also relevant to the Senator's point on the FAI report - to be of huge benefit to our grassroots football, but also across many other sports.</p> <p>  On the point regarding multi-use and shared facilities, I share the Senator's view on that.  We try to encourage sharing of facilities and multi-use sporting facilities in our sports capital and equipment programme.  Across Europe, the proliferation and development of sporting infrastructure has been on a shared basis in communities, as mentioned by the Senator.  We are trying to encourage that through our capital investment.  This is evident in the sports capital plan, where we reward clubs and communities that come together to share facilities.  There will be an overall net benefit for all sports where that happens.</p></speech>

Where is the creative industries roadmap, as promised in the programme for Government?  The Creative Ireland website states that Creative Ireland has been working throughout 2019 to finalise the roadmap.  Where is the roadmap as promised most recently in the programme for Government?  When can we expect a plan for the future of Creative Ireland, which concludes in 2022?  I raised that issue with the Minister when she last appeared for the committee.  We have not yet seen any progress on the plan for Creative Ireland.  </p> <p>  Yesterday, I had a Commencement matter on a digital legal deposit taken in the Seanad.  The Minister will be aware that we are losing our country's memory at an alarming rate.  We are creating a black hole in our country's memory because the National Library of Ireland does not have the power to sweep the .ie domain and nobody in government appears to care that we are losing Irish web records at such an alarming rate.  Where is the leadership on this issue?  Under the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Act 2019, the Government was required to bring forward a feasibility report on establishing a digital web archive within 12 months of the passing of that Act, which occurred in June 2019.  It is well and truly more than 12 months since then.  Why is the Government breaching the Act and breaking the law in not bringing forward that report?  When will we have a digital legal deposit so that we can protect our country's memory for current and future generations?</p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that the committee has been working on gender representation and a safe and respectful working environment in the arts for women.  I am conscious that funding allocated by the Arts Council on one hand is contingent on policies and procedures in regard to dignity and respect being in place.  The Arts Council awards marks to applicants and applicants are assessed on how they demonstrate awareness and understanding of equality, diversity and inclusion.  That is just a small sample of what the Arts Council requires of its funding partners.  What does the Minister's Department require of funding partners such as Comhaltas, whose representatives appeared before the committee recently?  What conditionality does the Department place on organisations in receipt of significant public moneys?</p></speech>

As he indicated, the current iteration of Creative Ireland comes to an end shortly.  My officials are preparing proposals which seek to extend the programme, in particular the creative communities via local authorities, which I will shortly bring to Cabinet.  The work of Creative Ireland in increasing access to creative opportunities for young people has been impactful and will continue.</p> <p>  On the creative industries, the Creative Ireland programme consulted extensively with industry bodies, businesspeople, practitioners and academics in the field of design-based digital creative and content creation sub-sectors and with other Departments, agencies and enterprise partners.  A roadmap for the creative industries was drafted in 2020, as the Senator will know.  However, the Covid-related issues have been prioritised over the past year.  With a view towards economic recovery, discussions are again under way concerning how best to finalise and implement the draft roadmap.</p> <p>  Comhaltas has committed to the area of dignity and equality in the context of the recent launch of its results and in regard to Speak Up.  We are doing a lot of work to reinforce the importance of dignity at work for the creative sectors.  For example, we have worked extensively with, and funded, the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, survey and report on bullying and harassment survey.  The ITI will be funded to continue its work, as a starting point in regard to the findings of the survey.  It will develop a code of behaviour that organisations can adopt and, in doing so, declare their commitment to provide a safe and dignified workplace.  The code will be accessible online and will include a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign.</p> <p>  A dignity in the workplace toolkit will be developed for arts organisations and individuals.  It will contain comprehensive information on supports and resources for independent workers.  This will provide a suite of training tools, starting with bystander training and intimacy co-ordination, and incorporate behaviour modules onto all arts-related accredited courses.  It will expand existing resources, including access to counselling, human resources, mediation, and legal consultation, free of charge, to artist art workers.  In this area, Minding Creative Minds, which is funded by my Department, has been providing an exemplary service since 2020.  We will be developing arrangements for confidential reporting of harmful behaviours without fear of reprisal; build cross-sectoral support for change; continue research in this area; and, as committed to at the launch of the survey, commit to further follow-up service so that we can monitor the success of our actions.</p></speech>

It should not be the job of the National Library of Ireland to reach out and make requests in respect of websites.  We know it is understaffed compared with its equivalent national libraries elsewhere in Europe.  It should not be its job to request web records.  It is a significant job of work.

It is very important to have that report under section 108 of the 2019 Act back as quickly as possible.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is responsible for this area in the context of legislation that may be forthcoming.  This is an important issue.  There are a lot of physical and social records being lost from websites that are gong offline.  It is important to keep those archives for future generations.  I urge the Minister to prioritise the report and try to speed up the changes that are needed in that regard.</p> <p>  Will the Minister address the issue of the pub and restaurant sector?  There is significant concern among those in the sector that they do not have enough of a voice at the tables that matter.  Will particular consideration be given to ensuring representation of pubs and restaurants on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in light of their very important role in tourism and hospitality?  I ask her to address the issue of pubs and restaurants not being included in the F&aacute;ilte Ireland business continuity grant scheme.  That is of concern to the sector.</p> <p>  There is much uncertainty and fear, as well as many rumours, in respect of further restrictions coming in.  The word "lockdown" is even being used.  There is a requirement for certainty and clarity for the tourism and hospitality sector as it plans for the period up to Christmas and into the new year.  Will the Minister give clarity and certainty to the sector today in the context of its plans for the next six weeks in particular which, it is to be hoped, will be a very busy period for all in the sector?</p> <p>  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, on his work to try to get more money into the sports capital programme.  It is very important and he has my full support.  It is important the fund be increased given the significant demand that exists.  Will the allocations under the local scheme be announced before Christmas or is it more likely to be after Christmas?</p> <p>  In the context of large-scale projects, given the time that has elapsed since the announcement of those grants and the significant construction inflation in the meantime, does the Minister of State consider there will be a requirement for top-ups of some of those grants for projects that were funded?</p> <p>  What is the position in respect of the appointment of a new CEO to Sport Ireland?  Is there a timeframe for that?  What is the process?  Does the Minister of State have further information on that appointment?</p></speech>

As regards the issue he and Senator Warfield raised, as I stated, it is being considered and we are consulting the National Library of Ireland.  I will revert to both of them on that specific issue.</p> <p>  As regards clarity and certainty for pubs and restaurants, I wish I was in a position to provide that.  The only thing that is certain about Covid-19 is its uncertainty.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will be meeting this week.  We await its deliberations.  Just like everyone else, I am not in a position to give clarity or certainty, unfortunately.  I can point to the budget, which included an increase of more than 30% for the tourism sector in my Department, and the cross-sectoral supports that are in place already, such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the restart grant, the credit guarantee scheme, the &euro;55 million for the tourism business continuity scheme, the &euro;26 million in the Covid adaptation fund, the &euro;10 million allocation for coach tourism, the &euro;10 million for Ireland-based inbound agencies, the &euro;8 million in restart grants and all the outdoor dining and urban animation schemes.  We have not been found wanting in that regard.  I do not have a crystal ball - none of us have one - in the context of this awful pandemic that has had a devastating impact on our tourism sector that supports more than 250,000 jobs.  The Government will not be found wanting.  We will keep everything under review.</p> <p>  As regards the business continuity scheme and the money that was ring-fenced in the most recent budget, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is in consultation with relevant stakeholders to assess where that money will go.</p> <p>  It is open to anyone to apply to the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Obviously, we will be looking for specific skill sets, in consultation with the chairman of the board.  It is open to anyone to apply to that process.  Of course, the hospitality sector does have a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum I and the T&aacute;naiste co-chair.</p></speech>

Obviously, she is the Minister who makes those appointments.  Is it a part of the criteria that she will seek people who are recommended and that consideration will be given to that particular part of the sector?  It is important for that to be the case.</p></speech>

It then goes through the Public Appointments Service process and that shortlist is brought to me.  As I stated, it is open to anyone to apply.  It is a fair and transparent process.  The hospitality sector has a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum.  I know this has been a devastating time for those in the sector and that the uncertainty for the sector as we approach Christmas is awful.  The Government has not been and will not be found wanting in the context of supports.</p></speech>

On the sports capital programme, as I stated in the D&aacute;il last week, there has been a delay of several weeks as a result of incomplete applications in certain counties.  Clubs have been given an opportunity to respond.  We were hopeful to conclude the process by the end of November, but I expect it will be just before Christmas or, more likely, the first two weeks of January that we make the announcements.  We have had positive conversations with the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  As I stated to Senator Cassells, we await the outcome of that.</p> <p>  To provide more detail on the large-scale sports infrastructure fund, progress has been made in recent months.  Two projects have finalised a funding agreement, ten projects have completed due diligence and are progressing, while 17 projects are at further due diligence stage.  The first payment has been made to fund the Newcastle West athletics hub in co-operation with Limerick City and County Council and, as I stated to Senator Cassells, there have been payments to Dublin City Council in respect of the Dalymount Park project.  It was slow due to Covid but it is progressing now.

I am going to focus my questions on the area of arts, media and culture.  The Minister mentioned the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is critical legislation.  I welcome the fact the Minister is committed to the recruitment of the online safety commissioner.  Will she indicate when that recruitment process might start?  In the context of the legislation, the Minister will be aware that our committee made a recommendation around an individual complaints mechanism.  Can she indicate if, in principle, she is supportive of that and if it will inform part of the legislation?  Our committee also recommended the introduction of a content levy on the streaming services to help with the development of production here.  Again, the Minister might indicate if she will be supporting our recommendations.</p> <p>  I would be grateful if the Minister could indicate when we will see publication of the report of the Future of Media Commission.  She will be aware there is also a vacancy on the RT&Eacute; board after a process that this committee engaged in.  She might outline if she intends to fill that vacancy and when she might do it.</p> <p>  I echo the concerns around the entertainment sector and providing the supports for those working in that sector, as well as the Minister&rsquo;s commitment on the pilot universal basic income, UBI.  I hope that a broad a range of artists and arts workers is included when it is introduced.  We are obviously talking about everybody from choreographers to set designers.  It is a huge area, so that is key.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the importance of our theatres, arts venues and galleries for national well-being.  They are extremely safe venues.  With other members of the committee, I was at a theatre last night and I have been in a number of theatres in Wexford in recent weeks.  They were all operating in a very safe way, with Covid certs being checked.  I am looking for assurances that there will be no effort to close some of these vital venues in the weeks and months ahead, particularly given these venues have scheduled quite a number of shows well into next year.  It is important that assurance is given to try to support those venues.  Again, I echo colleagues&rsquo; comments around continued support for those in the entertainment sector who are being badly hit.  I accept there are quite a few questions.</p></speech>

In regard to the media commission, it cannot formally be established until the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is enacted.  However, it is my intention to go to the Government in the coming weeks to seek agreement to start the recruitment process for key personnel on an administrative basis in advance of this.  That would enable preparatory work to be undertaken to ensure the commission hits the ground running on establishment.  The provision of the &euro;5.5 million in funding that I secured in the recent budget will enable that.  I reckon the commission will probably require 120 personnel for the start-up phase, with a number of these to be hired before the formal establishment.</p></speech>

The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is, of course, complex.  I am currently looking at the 33 recommendations.  I have to commend the committee for the detailed and thorough pre-legislative scrutiny that was done.  Although the Senator is talking about one specific recommendation, to have made 33 recommendations shows the complexity of all of this.</p></speech>

I appreciate there is complexity but it is the principle of redress and an individual complaints mechanism.  I appreciate the detail of it has to be worked out but it is the principle.</p></speech>

It is a complex issue.  Ireland could actually be regulating for the whole of Europe in respect of video-sharing platforms.  That is approximately 450 million people and it brings various languages and cultural norms into it all.  It is about how we would actually manage that volume.  I am examining how these issues could be overcome in the context of that specific recommendation.  That is where we are right now.</p> <p>  In regard to the levy, the Bill already provides that such a levy may be introduced by the media commission once its viability has been assessed with regard to whether or not it would have any negative effects.  The proceeds of any such levy will go into a content production scheme from which producers could apply for funding, similar to the sound and vision scheme, with which the Senator will be familiar.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  In regard to the Future of Media Commission, that report currently lies with me and the Taoiseach.  We will be consulting key Cabinet colleagues and then bringing it to government.  As the Taoiseach said in recent weeks, the terms of reference and recommendations of that commission are pretty substantial so we are giving it consideration.  We will consult the relevant Ministers and then bring it before Cabinet.</p> <p>  In regard to the basic income, the Senator may have heard me answer on that earlier.  There is a key stakeholder agreement consultation on 8 December.  We went out to tender for the facilitator of that and it will be a sort of global, caf&eacute;-style forum.  I would like as broad a range as possible, which was the Senator&rsquo;s question.  It is so important that the sector is with us all the way in the design of this process, so I would see all of that being discussed on that key date of 8 December.  The invites will issue shortly for that consultation process.  Was there a final question?</p></speech>

It is important to try to provide them with some level of certainty.  I know these are difficult times but they are operating safely.  It is that they can continue to open while operating within the rules.</p></speech>

However, as I said earlier to Deputy Griffin, I cannot give a definitive response on the pandemic and the twists and turns it will take, nor is there any ambition to impose any further restrictions at present.  We have to wait and assess the impact of the changes introduced last week and the consistent messaging around individual behaviour.  I am, of course, hugely sensitive to the impact of this on live performances in all the venues the Senator has mentioned.  As I said earlier, we will not be found wanting in regard to supports.  There is the &euro;25 million that was ring-fenced in budget 2022 and there is the money in the Covid fund mentioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  It will come through him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, if needs be.  We have them open and I want to keep them open and I want them to be viable.  I hope that is the case.  If that does not happen, I can assure the Senator they will receive the supports they need.  Let us hope we can turn this around.</p></speech>

As the Senator will know, arising from the most recent joint Oireachtas committee process, the Government approved the nomination of four persons to fill the four vacancies.  There is now one vacancy because a subsequent resignation took place.  I have engaged with the Senator on this.  I look forward to hearing from members of the committee regarding a new nominee to the RT&Eacute; board.  This is a challenging time for public broadcasting and I look forward to working with the board of RT&Eacute;.  I understand that this replacement process is ongoing.</p></speech>

My first question is for the Minister of State.  It is on the importance of the role the Government plays in sports programmes and how it contributes to a healthier and more active society.  It was mentioned earlier that promoting sports participation is a key priority and that the Department is collaborating with the Department of Education.  Will the Minister of State expand on the work that is being undertaken in that regard?  We are all aware that students and children are probably less active in the school environment due to the curriculum that is currently in place.  The number of hours being allocated to sporting activities certainly needs to be revisited.  I would like to get the Minister of State's comments on this topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021112400002#H00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I referenced the Department of Education and I met representatives from Sport Ireland this morning in respect of this matter.  We have a new winter initiative, the Let's Get Back campaign, which is based around trying to encourage the return to indoor and outdoor sport.  When it comes to schools, representatives from the Department of Education and a couple of the working groups at Sport Ireland have worked on participation and the physical literacy plan that will be launched next year.  A great deal of work has been done by the Department of Education on the use of school facilities in recent times.  The Deputy will probably know that in his community, and across many communities, we are seeing sporting infrastructure being integrated into educational facilities and the use of that infrastructure in the evenings and during the day.  It is a key piece in the context of trying to marry physical activity and sport with our education system more generally.</p> <p>  We will have ongoing engagement with the Department of Education.  The Covid pandemic has obviously presented a challenge with protocols and, as we all know, the school setting has been challenging for the past 18 months.  As Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I am keen to see much greater co-operation and to build on a lot of the work many of our governing bodies do.  For example, members of the GAA or other sporting bodies go into schools.  There are development officers who facilitate basketball, some football and other activities.  We are trying to support and enhance that, in addition to strengthening coaching.  We will launch a new coaching plan in the coming weeks that will be about strengthening the whole coaching system across the sports system generally and the opportunities that are there between schools and our sporting system.  It will be a major opportunity to improve physical literacy among our young people and give them the tools to promote physical activity in their lives.  That is something we are ambitious about.</p></speech>

I have highlighted the lack of provision of sporting facilities in the primary and secondary school environment to the Minister for Education.  I welcome the expansion of the sports capital and equipment programme that allows schools to make applications in this regard.  While physical education is a senior cycle subject, certain schools are using facilities that are not in close proximity to the school, which causes major issues and concern.  I would like to see this programme expanded and more collaboration between the Department and the Department of Education to ensure that we provide adequate funding in this regard.  There is funding in the NDP, but it needs to be targeted and specific to school environments and made more accessible to school management and principals.</p> <p>  The Minister of State made reference to initial delays, and allowing a number of weeks for clubs to respond, in respect of the sports capital and equipment programme.  Were clubs that were not successful in being allocated funding for sporting equipment communicated with?  Will there be an opportunity for them to reapply in future in order to secure funding?</p></speech>

There was a little confusion around that.  I can state that if a club had, for example, some sports capital and equipment on the same application, that is still a live application and has not yet been decided on or assessed.  Some clubs that might need a hurling wall or a lawnmower might have thought that they would not get the equipment if those items were included on the application.  However, that is all still in the mix when it comes to equipment.  There was a little uncertainty around that but there is an appeals process.  Very few applicants missed out, although I know some did, in the equipment-only programme, but an appeals process was open to them.  As I said, we expect the sports capital programme to conclude now.  We hope to announce details of it in the first two weeks of January at the latest.</p></speech>

Has the Minister of State any detail on the programme of expenditure for hosting this event that is currently in place in the Department?</p></speech>

There is an expanded envelope under that subhead for next year of just over &euro;6 million.  We had under &euro;6 million this year.  To go back to Senator Cassells' question on the World Cup, we expect to spend more than &euro;2 million over a four-year period.  We have spent a very limited amount so far, but it could be up to approximately &euro;500,000 by the summer of next year.  I will have to get detail on the breakdown for the Ryder Cup.  I will be happy to provide that directly to the Deputy or to the committee.</p></speech>

That is not an answer to the question.  I refer to page 5 of the Department's briefing for the committee.  It shows the numbers of workers in the sector under its remit that rely on the PUP.  At the end of October the number was 15,000.  The EWSS supported 115,000 in the accommodation and food sector.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It shows that 62% returned to the same employer, 12% moved to a different employer and 26% moved to a different employer and different activity.  Four in ten tourism and hospitality workers on the PUP did not return to their pre-pandemic employers.  Some 18,500, or 15%, had moved to a different employer in the same sector while 33,500, or 27%, had moved to a different sector.  This summer one in three workers were new to the sector.  Up to 40,000 vacancies, 24%, are at senior level.  Those are the details I have on tourism.</p></speech>

The sector stated that 75% of its members are experiencing cancellations for events in the month in December.  It also said that is happening against a backdrop of cuts in support and, in some cases, withdrawal of those supports.  It said that it proposed a new scheme in September.  We are now four weeks from Christmas.  The Minister said there is ongoing engagement with her.  That proposal would have safeguarded the workers against losses incurred right up to Christmas.  Where do things stand with that proposal?  Does the Minister support it?  If so, we are four weeks out from Christmas and what is the hold-up?</p></speech>

One of the greatest threats to tourism and hospitality at the moment is the skills shortage.  We know that a significant part of the problem is working conditions.  The committee recently heard from union representatives and some of what they said made for very disturbing listening.</p> <p>  In correspondence with the committee, the Minister said that working conditions in the hospitality sector are ultimately a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, she said she was concerned about issues that would negatively impact on tourism enterprises.  We heard some horrific stories.  The committee is trying to do work on this issue.  It does not help that the Minister is not taking much of a part in it and is automatically deferring to her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, the Minister has said she has concerns about issues that would negatively impact the tourism sector.  Did she meet the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this?  Did she have a conversation?  If so, what was that conversation?  Has she raised it?</p></speech>

As the Deputy can imagine, the current evolving situation with Covid has been taking all our attention where we are assessing and reviewing the supports that are needed.  We are seeking to address skill shortages.  Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge in the sector.  Two thirds of businesses have reported reduced capacity.  We can see that.  I was glad to see the work done by F&aacute;ilte Ireland on a new recruitment, marketing and awareness campaign.  It continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry with its content and social media strategy.</p></speech>

One recommendation was that there would be a representative on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland from the industry.  I want to highlight that.  It is extremely important that that happens.  It is tourism and hospitality, not just tourism.  We need to make sure that the hospitality industry is fully represented on the various boards.</p> <p>  I apologise as I had to go out because I was caught with a vote at another meeting.  Is there a timescale for the Future of Media Commission reporting?  The report was expected some months ago.  Can the Minister give a date?  Is the funding sufficient to fully resource it?</p><p>I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the vacant position on the board of RT&Eacute;.  It is disappointing that when we wrote to RT&Eacute;'s board asking that its representatives come in to discuss what happened with that position, which had been nominated by this committee, RT&Eacute; did not do so.  It has indicated that representatives will appear.  That is disappointing given that RT&Eacute; is fully funded by the taxpayer.  Will the Minister comment on that?  <br/><br/>With regard to sport, I am delighted the Minister of State has gone to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to get extra funding for the sports capital programme, which is money that is well spent throughout the country.  I am glad he has held back on making announcements until he gets further funding.  I will be parochial by highlighting figures I raised with him previously with regard to Longford.  The county received the lowest <i>per capita</i>funding in the country in the previous rounds of funding.<br/><br/>We spoke at our previous meeting about an audit of sports facilities.  What is the position with that audit and an audit of participation across sports?  We should highlight the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, when it is opened up in order to identify areas where facilities are lacking so that they can be prioritised for funding through the scheme.  None of the midland counties of Longford, Leitrim and Roscommon have an athletics track.  We need to prioritise that through the fund.<br/><br/>The 2020 campaign was successful.  We see that in the national media reporting of women&rsquo;s sports.  However, the campaign needs to be improved.  Should we extend it or have a 2025 campaign to make sure we get higher levels of participation in sport among women and recognition of ladies&rsquo; sport in the media?<br/><br/>The Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, has featured in the media in recent weeks.  It is disappointing to see dragged out in the media the suspension of people who have served the sport for generations.  This was done in the middle of a democratic process to elect a new central council.  We live in a democracy.</p></speech>

It is an open and transparent process.  The voice of the industry is heard already in the hospitality and tourism forum.  As I said, it is an open and transparent process and anyone can apply to it.</p> <p>  The work of the Future of Media Commission has been completed and the report of the commission has been submitted to the Taoiseach and me.  We are currently considering its contents.  We will then decide the next steps with Cabinet colleagues.  In relation to funding, the Senator may be referring to the media commission, which cannot be formally established until the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill has been enacted.  It is my intention to go to government in the coming weeks to seek an agreement on starting the recruitment process for key personnel.  This is to ensure we can hit the ground running on an administrative basis.  I understand the Senator was referring to that commission when he spoke about the &euro;5.5 million.  I secured that funding to ensure we can have a parallel process and hit the ground running when the Bill is enacted.  Those were the key questions addressed to me.  I will hand over to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I will try to get through them.  On sports capital, which we have discussed before, I take the Senator&rsquo;s point on County Longford.  We have structured the funding this year by splitting it half-and-half between demand and <i>per capita</i>.  This will allow for a fair distribution across the country.  On the Senator&rsquo;s point, we are developing a national digital database which will show the deficits in certain regions, pockets and communities around the country.  It will map every indoor and outdoor facility, enable participation across organisations, identify opportunities and support funding models into the future.  Work has commenced on that database and involves an audit of every sporting facility in every town, village and townland.  We expect it will take approximately two years to complete.  It will be a public-facing portal accessed using an app.  People will be able to see every piece of working infrastructure in every townland and region.  It will be huge for participation and helping to inform further funding models.</p><p>I agree with the Senator that the 2020 campaign was very important for the promotion of women&rsquo;s sport.  That is why the Minister and I increased the funding allocation by 33% on the previous round.  It is a two-year programme and has been allocated &euro;4 million for this year and next year.  As the Senator will know, we equalised grants for male and female players in Gaelic games.  On grants generally, we also enhanced the international carding scheme for all athletes in recent days.</p><p>On the issue with boxing that has been in the public domain recently, Sport Ireland appeared before the committee on 3 November.  Sport Ireland has commenced an independent governance review, which is being carried out by Brian MacNeice of Teneo.  It will assess the full governance structures.  We expect the review to report by the end of November.  There are other concerns in the public domain around particular individuals.  There are structures in sporting governance whereby people who have particular concerns can appeal through Sports Dispute Solutions Ireland, SDSI.  These rules are set out within the IABA and other sporting organisations.  It is an independent structure and the mechanism for dealing with that.  There is also a separate independent governance review.  </p><p>To speak generally, boxing is an important sport in Ireland, across many communities, both as regards participation and competing.  We achieved great success in boxing last summer.  I hope we will see progress around the review.  I accept there is tension around different individuals and in different areas but we need to keep focused on participation, performance and communities, as well as any governance issues that arise.  That is why the independent governance review will report by the end of November.  There will have to be recommendations and an implementation plan arising from that.  That will be overseen by Sport Ireland with the IABA. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the Secretary General, Ms Licken, whom have I have not seen in a long time.  I always knew she would hit the top.  Well done.</p> <p>  I will first address the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  The social return on investment in sport infrastructure was alluded to briefly by Senator Cassells.  The UEFA and FIFA model has been rolled out across the world.  We had our own national launch, in which the Minister of State may have been involved, with Packie Bonner.  It is great to him see back as a non-executive director of the Football Association of Ireland.  Aside from the sports capital programme and the various other support mechanisms we have, is this a model the Minister of State is going to embrace?  Will he start perhaps with the main pillar banks by asking them to partner on this model?  In case anyone present is not familiar with it, the model basically involves setting tangible achievables from a health perspective, for example, reducing diabetes or obesity, and there are metrics to measure their success.</p><p>It could also be related to increasing literacy rates, the number of young people in education, training or employment or the reduction in the number unemployed.  It has been proven to work throughout the world.  Some &euro;56 million has been collected internationally to date in the 40 countries participating in the initiative in Europe and there are approximately 140 participants in it.  The initiative is working to bring down those numbers.  Basically, the Government would go to the bank - let us say the Bank of Ireland for the sake of argument - and advise that Sligo Rovers has a development, with which I know the Minister and the Minister of State are familiar, which would cost &euro;16 million.  It seeks to come up with &euro;10 million of that cost from a particular source and the Government would advise the bank it would like it to lend the club &euro;10 million and in five years&rsquo; time provided the club has met its plan, which tangibly is to have reduced obesity levels, reduced incidence of heart disease or other various measurable outcomes from a social perspective, the Government would pay the bank back that money.  That is an infinitely cheaper way to tackle those health and social-related problems that might face a regional capital like Sligo or any town around the country.  To touch on something Senator Cassells said, it could result in a large sporting facility being delivered which caters for multiple sports.  As the Minister and Minister of State know, that plan incorporates rugby and hockey and would be a community facility.  Will the Minister of State bring in the banks and drag them around the table?  We all know about their systemic nature.  They are great people when they are looking for you but now we are looking for them.  Will they divvy up?  Can the Minister of State get them to partner on this initiative?</p></speech>

I was involved with some members of the FAI, including Packie Bonner and its president, Gerry McAnaney.  I have read the report on the UEFA model and it is excellent.  As the Deputy said, it sets out funding structures that parallel social outcomes.  Where there is a front-loading of investment from other sources, the State oversees the outcomes to that end and then provides the end funding when there is delivery.  I was very impressed by it.  As the Deputy said, it has worked in other places that have tried it.  I have spoken to the officials about it and certainly we will be exploring the opportunities it presents for football and for sporting investment more generally.  It offers a serious potential to leverage funding into sport beyond our traditional programmes, which involve the State front-loading with the balance of investment from others.  However, this model offers other opportunities.  Where the metrics are clear and outlined, we should embrace it.  We will be exploring what is possible and I am open to that.  The Deputy was right in what he said.  He set out potential achievements in the area of health, such as reducing obesity levels or improving physical health, or with regard to literacy levels, mental health, or education and employment.  It is a new funding model that offers serious potential for Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to have a conversation with it too.  We will engage with the banks.  That will not be a difficulty.  We received the report last week and we need to know what way we would structure this model if we were to embrace it.  We will engage with the financial-----</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Central Bank seems to have a basic aversion to allowing the credit unions to do anything with their &euro;20 billion other than hide it under the bed.  All that money is there and we could use it.  My respectful suggestion to the Minister of State would be to grab it by the scruff of the neck.  He should drag in the banks because if we wait for the administrative merry-go-round to dish it out, he and I will be old men, or I will probably be dead and the Minister of State will be an old man.  That covers that element.</p> <p>  I welcome this opportunity to engage with the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I know the Chair will cut me off if I go over my time.  I sympathise with the Minister's position on the night-time economy and hospitality sector because there is an irrational focus on the ability of six people sitting in a bar to spread Covid with 51,000 people singing in the Aviva Stadium not appearing to be capable of doing the same or worse.  Who from the Minister's Department is a member of NPHET?  Some 38 people are members of it.  They are all physicians and nobody from the Department is a member of it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.871" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021112400002#L00700"><p>I know and that is a major issue.  I knew the answer to that question.  We have 38 people, who are not qualified to do so, deciding on the safety or otherwise and the implications of working in the hospitality environment.  If the Minister reads the Health Protection Surveillance Centre's weekly reports, as I do and as I am sure her officials do, she will be aware there are outbreaks of Covid-19 in private homes in the region of 6,000 per week, very high outbreaks in residential settings in hospitals, institutions, nursing homes and so on, and outbreaks are creeping up in schools.  Collectively, outbreaks in hospitality are quite low.  It is in the region of 100 as opposed to 7,000.  The issue I have is that any of us who have been to a pub or a restaurant &ndash; unfortunately, my nightclub days are over - will find, in most instances, we are asked to show a Covid-19 certificate and to give our name, we are shown to a table, we must wear a mask when walking to and from the toilet and, as we know, there is no dancing, as it seems that is far too dangerous.  If we limit controlled hospitality, as has been the practice up to now, we are encouraging people to go to each other&rsquo;s homes.  That is where outbreaks will happen.  If you visit my house or I visit your house, I will not sanitise the worktops when you leave and, presumably, you will not do so either.  That is why we are all more relaxed at home.  The figures show that.  Equally, Dr. Holohan, at the weekend, said that the midnight issue would not particularly make much of a difference but it would send a message.  I find it reprehensible that we have in some way decided to victimise one sector to be the vehicle with which we send a message to the wider public.  Many people are suffering as a result.  I put those points to the Minister to get her view on them.</p></speech>

The Secretary General gets to feed into that process.  I would add that dancing is allowed in certain circumstances.</p></speech>

There are strict regulations on it.  I will make sure the Deputy gets the relevant information on that.  If one has a relevant licence, the dance-floor space and the event is ticketed, it is allowed.  The restrictions are about the layering process.  I know the decision on the midnight issue is very tough on the night-time economy in particular.  That is what the Deputy is fighting for but at least the sector's doors are still open.  Up to two months ago, they had been closed for 18 or 19 months.  This is about simply reducing socialisation and the interaction that involves.  That is where the decision came from.  The doors of the sector are still open and we want to keep them open.  I am determined to do that.  We will keep the supports in place.  That would be my comments on that point.</p></speech>

I would like to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate, and I hope both the Minister and the Minister of State will join me in doing so, Maggie Farrelly from Laragh in County Cavan who a few weeks ago became the first woman ever to referee a county final in Kingspan Breffni Park.</p><p>It is extraordinary on so many levels that it was 2021 before this occurred.  The match was a replay between Gowna and Ramore United.  Ms Farrelly did an extraordinary job at a very tough game, particularly considering that it was a replay.  I acknowledge her extraordinary achievement in breaking the glass ceiling to become the first woman in Ireland ever to do what she did.  Both Ministers might join me in congratulating her.</p><p> That leads me neatly to the question of women in sport.  What are the plans of the Minister of State to encourage all women in all sports?  Senator Carrigy talked about the success of the 2020 campaign.  Perhaps he is right.  Perhaps the Minister of State and the Department have plans to follow up on that.  Could he comment on the matter?  It is not just about getting women to engage in sport; the bigger problem concerns the retention of young girls and women and what we do to support them.  In the new year, we are going to have a hearing on this issue, but I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments and plans.</p><p> Could the Minister outline the eligibility criteria for the basic income guarantee for artists under the associated scheme?  I congratulate her on ring-fencing &euro;25 million in that regard.  She spoke about an app.  Perhaps she could give us some more insight into the roll-out of that and how soon we might see it.</p><p> What are the Minister's plans for the Creative Ireland programme?  It has led to extraordinary work in bringing professional arts to young children in primary schools and, perhaps, secondary schools.  It has been very successful in terms of its engagement and partnerships with local authorities and education and training boards.  Has the Minister plans for arts education officers?  There are three in place with education and training boards around the country.  This is certainly a model that could be expanded and developed.  Could the Minister speak to the points I have raised?</p><p> We will hear the responses of the Minister of State first.  Maybe he will mention Maggie Farrelly's achievements first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021112400002#M00200"><p>It was fantastic to see Maggie Farrelly referee the senior county club final.  I hope she is the first of many female referees to officiate across our club and county systems.  When she spoke about this, she wanted to focus on the future and on her being one of many female referees.  It was brilliant to see what she did.</p> <p>  Through our women in sport programme, we are trying to fund officiating, along with coaching, active participation and reducing the gender gap we see in sport.  Having female referees from grassroots level all the way up to the top of our refereeing system is key for all women and girls across the sporting landscape.  We are supporting this to the women's sport programme, which focuses on coaching, officiating, participation, leadership and other areas.  I congratulate Ms Farrelly and hope she will be one of many female referees.  I hope we will see many more county and inter-county finals refereed by women referees.</p> <p>  On the next question, on women in sport more generally, a priority regarding players was to send a strong signal around equality of treatment and parity of esteem.  That has happened this year.  We have increased the funding allocation for women in sport by 33%.  We are trying to be very positive.  We are seeing significant growth in participation by young girls in particular.  We are seeing this across all sports.  There is significant participation in clubs across the country.</p> <p>  As said before, there is attrition, particularly in the teenage years.  Sport Ireland is doing a lot of work with the governing bodies on trying to mitigate the attrition in our sporting landscape.  Through our local sports partnerships and clubs, a lot of work is being done.  In the sport action plan that we are to publish shortly, we will focus very much on trying to narrow the participation gap and make sure women and girls have a full opportunity across the sporting landscape.  To be fair, many sports are embracing that agenda in a really positive way when it comes to leadership.</p> <p>  We have a women in sport lead in Sport Ireland, Ms Nora Stapleton, whom the Chairman knows.  Ms Lynne Cantwell is the chair of the women in sport steering committee.  We are committed not only to matching the funding increases but also to ensuring we see delivery across the participation gap.  I am aware that this committee has been very interested in this in recent times.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, it is shocking that she is the first despite it being 2021.  We have a long way to go.  Maggie has definitely played her part.  As the Chairman knows, young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see.  Maggie will definitely inspire young girls to referee in the future.  The members should rest assured that the Minister of State and I are absolutely determined to increase the participation of women in all areas of sport, as the Minister of State has outlined in so many ways.  We are committed to that.</p> <p>  With regard to eligibility for the basic income, a lot depends on the engagement on 8 December at the global caf&eacute;-style event.  We are considering the possibility of having two streams, one being for professional artists, most likely based on membership of a resource body such as Visual Artists Ireland or Dance Ireland.  That stream would also include emerging artists to ensure developing artists are given the opportunity to develop their creative practice.  There would be a second stream for those working in the arts sector who have a creative input into the final output of an artist's practice, such as screenwriters, directors and costume designers.  We are considering this.  Participation will not be based on a means test; it will be a non-competitive process.  We will have a control group, a meaningful number of unsuccessful applicants, so we can capture the important data and determine the impact on both unsuccessful and successful applicants, creative output and artists' well-being.  A tender has been issued for a partner to develop the online application portal.  Maybe that is what the Chairman was referring to.  The key date in the basic income guarantee pilot is 8 December.  All the artists issued with invites will get to help to shape the scheme.</p> <p>  With regard to Creative Ireland, together with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Arts Council, the programme has seen investment of approximately &euro;13.4 million in the Creative Youth initiative since 2017, with a further &euro;6.8 million in 2021.  That will considerably enhance children's and young people's access to creative activities.  Three additional education and training, ETB, initiatives are being advanced in Cork, Galway&ndash;Roscommon and Mayo&ndash;Sligo&ndash;Leitrim.  The ETBs have been really brilliant at targeting the disadvantaged</p> <p>  Responsibility for the decisions on the local Creative Youth partnerships lies mostly with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  A total of 651 schools have chosen to participate in the Creative Schools programme since its introduction, and a further 299 schools have been chosen to participate in the Creative Clusters initiative of the Department of Education.  The current iteration of Creative Ireland is coming to an end and my officials are preparing proposals to extend the programme that I will bring to the Cabinet.  Creative Communities, with the local authorities and Creative Ireland, has resulted in incredible work on increasing young people's access to creative opportunities.</p><p>It has been and will continue to be a real positive.</p></speech>

In most instances Oireachtas Members and witnesses may now be physically present in the committee room, or they may join remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to attend where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, members who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I ask members to please identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report.  Members should mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that they use the raise hand button when they wish to contribute because we do not have a speaking rota for this.  If there is something about which they have a particular interest, they can indicate to me and I will take them in that order.  I remind all those present to switched off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  I now ask the Minister of State to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.892" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021112400002#A00400"><p>I am joined by my colleague Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in, assistant secretary general, with responsibility for sport and tourism.  As committee members will be aware, the sports sector has been and continues to be severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Throughout this time, Sport Ireland and the Department have been continually engaging with the sector, and we know sporting bodies and clubs have been severely hit in every aspect of their operations, not least financially.</p> <p>  Last year, the Government approved a Covid-19 package of &euro;88.5 million that helped ensure our sporting bodies were in a position to maintain operations, avoid insolvency and prepare for a return to activity.  The package benefited all levels of the sports sector, including thousands of grassroots clubs across the country, and provided some certainty for sporting organisations in their planning for this year.  In terms of sports clubs, the 2020 funding provided support for more than 166 rugby clubs, more than 400 grassroots and League of Ireland clubs, along with more than 33,000 Gaelic games teams.  In addition, support was provided to 1,637 clubs throughout the country as part of small grant schemes operated by local sports partnerships, and 310 swimming pools were supported in reopening.</p> <p>  The financial impact of the pandemic continues to be a challenge for many sporting bodies and clubs, with losses and additional costs putting a severe strain on their finances.  Many organisations and clubs have lost significant amounts of revenue owing to the restrictions put in place for much of this year.  The indoor sports sector has been particularly hit, with indoor sports only resuming in October.  Many challenges still lie ahead for sports organisations and clubs in encouraging all members and volunteers to return, as well as attracting new participants.  We need to support participation programmes and initiatives now to ensure the long-term sustainability of clubs' structures and for the health and well-being of the nation.</p> <p>  The Government has approved a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;35 million towards a Covid package of up to &euro;65 million this year, and the rest will be provided from savings from within the Department's Vote.  This funding will allow Sport Ireland, through a number of different schemes, to assist sporting bodies and clubs that are in greatest need as we strive to ensure our sporting sector is supported at every level across the country.  The schemes will be run by Sport Ireland and the funding will be distributed through the national governing bodies of sport, similar to last year.  The schemes will ensure that grant aid will only be provided by Sport Ireland and that the governing bodies are satisfied this funding is absolutely required.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland is currently assessing funding applications from sporting organisations with a view to funding allocations being announced and paid in December.  Funding will be allocated as follows: field sports funding to support the main field sports, that is the FAI, the GAA, and the IRFU; a reliance fund to support the national governing bodies of sport other than the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU; a sports club resilience fund to support clubs from all sports; a swimming pools and facilities fund; and a resumption of physical activity fund that will include indoor sport.  Allied to the additional current expenditure of &euro;26.3 million already provided to Sport Ireland, this will mean a total of &euro;91.3 million will have been allocated in addition to the current funding to support the sports sector in 2021.</p></speech>

I went through sports capital in a previous meeting and this does not relate to that.  In terms of Sport Ireland, the funding position next year will merge in the increase and some of that embeds some of the Covid funding as well.  I am not sure where the Deputy saw that reference.</p></speech>

What the Deputy referred to could be related to some of the Covid funding, but I will check that out because I do not have the figure she has referred to.</p></speech>

On the resumption of the sport and physical activity fund, will he explain what that is about and how it works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.903" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOS2021112400002#A01500"><p>It is split between the three main governing bodies for the field sports, the other governing bodies, and the club resilience fund for clubs.  The resumption of sport and physical activity fund is targeted through many local sports partnerships.  It also looks at opportunities around additional physical activity in hard-to-reach groups, such as those in disadvantaged areas, people with disabilities and indoor sports as well.  A similar scheme was run through the local sports partnerships last year.  I can provide the funding amount for that.  Last year, in the Covid-19 package that we funded, &euro;3 million went to local sports partnerships schemes for small grants for clubs and community groups and innovation and restart schemes.  More than 1,600 clubs benefited from that across 28 local sports partnerships.  We also had supports for disabilities, older adults supports and a restart and renewal fund.  It will be similarly funded this year.  There are opportunities in areas of biggest impact.  This year, we want to avoid the scarring effect particularly among indoor sports.  There will be a big emphasis on indoor sports that were closed for the majority of the last 15 or 16 months, as members know.  We want to limit the scarring effect on that.  There will be targeted support through the local sports partnerships and the governing bodies.  That is why we are running this through a number of funding streams.</p></speech>

They have been engaged with by Sport Ireland directly on funding opportunities and new activities.  They tend to target hard-to-reach groups, such as in disadvantaged areas or those with disabilities.</p><p>From last year's announcement there was a specific and even a geographical breakdown within different counties of different initiatives being funded by this Covid-19 fund.  All local sports partnerships would have been engaged with Sport Ireland around what different initiatives they might like to fund relevant to their local areas as well.  The Deputy previously served on a local authority, like me, and there are local sports officers who shape a local sporting initiative relevant to a local community, engaging with volunteers and trying to create something that would make a difference to local communities around sport.  That gives flexibility within local sports partnerships to act.  There will be further opportunities this year.  We can send on the specifics for Louth to the Deputy.</p></speech>

With regard to the part funded by the national lottery in the Revised Estimates, will the Minister of State indicate how much that is?  Is it part of the good causes scheme?  Will he provide some detail on that?</p> <p>  I certainly welcome the Minister of State's support in levelling the playing field with regard to the Women's Gaelic Players Association and its merging with Gaelic Players Association with equality of treatment and the grants associated with that.  It is a very important step and I commend the Minister of State on that action.</p></speech>

It sends the right message to all women and girls around opportunities in sport and participation, particularly in Gaelic games.</p> <p>  The majority of the Sport Ireland budget is funded directly from the Exchequer.  I do not have a breakdown but it would be a very minor amount funded by the national lottery.  I do not have the figure to hand but we can get that for the Deputy.  I have the combined amount for Sport Ireland in subhead D5 of &euro;104 million and it will be &euro;105 million next year.  I do not have the specific breakdown on the national lottery.  I can get that for the committee.  The vast majority of the amount is direct funding from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

This is very welcome and needed.  After nearly two years, it is only recently that sport has kind of opened up.  I would like to get the exact figure on the national lottery as well, particularly what it does and how much it takes in.  What proportion of its money did it give to Sport Ireland?  Will the Minister of State send me the specifics for Wexford?</p> <p>  Recently a few constituents asked me about the organisation for pony racing in Ireland.  I know little about it.  Very often this produces top-class jockeys and it is where they start.  It receives no funding whatever and I was told that even this year, insurance costs were &euro;30,000.  I was told that from the same programme, meanwhile, a golf club in a certain area got &euro;50,000 for a lawnmower.  Pony racing in Ireland should be represented because, as I said, it produces top jockeys and uses all those technical skills.</p></speech>

We can send the detailed breakdown of all counties and local sports partnerships so everybody on the committee can see the specific initiatives relevant to their counties.  That will allow them to see the detail under the figures.  We can do the same when we make our announcements.</p> <p>  On the national lottery point, the amount from the national lottery comes into the general Exchequer balance and sport is one of a number elements that receives an allocation across multiple Departments.  The number is not broken down as to what is specifically national lottery funding but if we can get further detail, I will provide it.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about pony racing and I will follow up with Sport Ireland on that.  What was the Deputy's specific point?</p></speech>

It is a serious sport and it is probably in every parish in Ireland.  It also helps children with autism etc.  As I said, it often produces top-class jockeys, and this is where they start.  It is their first experience in dealing with horses.</p></speech>

One of the criteria to get funding from Sport Ireland is to be a registered and recognised national governing body.  I will have to check if the organisation in question is such a body.  It could be a case of the organisation formalising the arrangement with Sport Ireland, registering as a national governing body and then applying for different funding streams.  I could ask Sport Ireland to send a note to the committee on that.</p></speech>

As a sports person and on behalf of all sporting organisations, I thank the Government for the funding.  The &euro;88.5 million last year was a lot to keep operations going.  It was very good for health and well-being.  This is my first opportunity to wish Mr. John Treacy, chief executive officer of Sport Ireland, the best of luck for the future.  He has done a fantastic job being involved with the organisation since 1999 and since the establishment of Sport Ireland in 2015.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland has distributed money to all levels and the three main national bodies.  I have a fear and I asked this question before.  I have spoken to people in grassroots clubs and as I said, it has been a tough two years.  Many of these clubs have done much fantastic work in the local community.  Is there any way we can audit or check to ensure money is being distributed correctly?  I know a certain amount goes to the three main organisations but there is much money.  Are we following this money?</p> <p>  There are many clubs involved with the three main sports.  I have spoken to people in clubs involved in all sports and some seem to find it very hard to get the money to survive.  What mechanism do we have to examine this?  This is money from the Government and the taxpayer and it is going to the right places but how do we know it is being distributed fairly among organisations?</p></speech>

It has grown as a structure around sport to see Sport Ireland as it is today, with a very professional structure that oversees sport and delivers policy outcomes.  I welcome the Deputy's remarks on funding.</p> <p>  As part of the application process for Covid-19 funding, there is a sport club resilience fund for grassroots.  The three main governing bodies are the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA and within their application process they are asked to be very clear about what supports they are seeking for grassroots or what schemes will be developed so clubs or local organisations can apply for the various supports.</p> <p>  There were supports given as part of last year's package.  I know many football clubs that benefited and it was the same for the GAA.  The GAA made a decision so much of the funding from the Covid-19 package covered basic insurance costs faced by every club.  Maybe people did not connect the Covid-19 funding with the reduction in insurance costs that faced different clubs.  It was one element of the funding package from last year that was directly supported by the State.</p> <p>  There is strong oversight provided by Sport Ireland.  Every aspect of funding is overseen so it goes directly to where it is being sought.  There is a structure around managing and overseeing the process being run by Sport Ireland to ensure the funding goes to where it is sought.</p></speech>

Our first session an engagement with the chairperson designate of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, Ms Rose Hynes.  The purpose of the meeting is to engage with the chairpersons designate of the IAA and An Post, discuss their strategic priorities for their roles and their views on the challenges currently facing their organisations.  For this session, on behalf of the committee, I welcome the chairperson designate of the IAA, Ms Rose Hynes, and Mr. Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile, regulator with the IAA.</p> <p>   Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If a statement is potentially inflammatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.  They may not benefit from the same level of immunity to legal proceedings that a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  For anyone watching this meeting, members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  That will change next week.  We very much welcome that our guests have come into Leinster House.  They may be the only witnesses to attend in person for a long time.  It is a far better experience for witnesses and members when witnesses are physically present.  I thank our guests for attending.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practising of good hand hygiene and that people leave at least one vacant seat between them and others in attendance.

I am delighted to have been appointed chairman of the IAA on an interim basis on 12 January 2021 by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I am accompanied by Mr. Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile, the IAA regulator and CEO designate of the new IAA, who was appointed on 1 January 2021.  He has not previously met the committee.</p><p>In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities as chairman, I was requested on appointment to focus on guiding the IAA&rsquo;s regulatory reform process.  We have made significant progress to date in preparing for the restructuring of the IAA.  I have included my background and professional experience details in the statement submitted to the committee.  I have over 30 years&rsquo; aviation experience across all aspects of the industry, as a senior executive and at board level.  Additionally, I have multisectoral experience in corporate restructuring and comprehensive experience in board and corporate governance as chair and non-executive director. </p><p> The Air Navigation and Transport Bill will result in significant institutional change when enacted.  It will ensure Irish aviation continues to be served by a regulatory regime which is internationally respected.  The Bill provides that the commercial air navigation functions of the IAA will transfer to AirNav Ireland, a newly incorporated semi-State company.  The IAA will continue to have its primary role as the regulator and will absorb the regulatory functions of the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, to form a single national regulator for aviation.  Extensive work continues within the IAA on all practical measures necessary for the separation, in anticipation of the Bill becoming law.  This is no small task as the largest part of the current IAA, its staff and resources, is transferring into AirNav Ireland.  Currently the IAA employs over 700 staff in six locations across Ireland.  In addition to the effective discharge of my statutory functions, the board&rsquo;s focus is to ensure the timely delivery of the transition arrangements.  This includes appropriate oversight of decision-making, governance, financial preparations and the implementation of HR strategy. We have made significant progress and are working to ensure the necessary conditions are in place for vesting day. </p><p> On the air accident investigation unit, AAIU final report, speaking personally and on behalf of the IAA, I again express our deepest sympathy to the families, friends and colleagues of the four crew members of Irish Coast Guard R116, Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy , winchman Paul Ormsby and winchman Ciar&aacute;n Smith, who tragically lost their lives while undertaking a rescue mission on 14 March 2017.  We have welcomed the publication of the AAIU&rsquo;s independent and comprehensive report into the accident, which we believe will contribute to the prevention of future aviation accidents. We fully accept the recommendations addressed to the IAA, are in the process of fully implementing them and will verify our progress in this regard to the AAIU.  As the aviation regulator for Ireland, the safety of air crew and passengers is our number one priority.  We are fully committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve this aim, including the implementation of all safety recommendations in the AAIU report. </p><p> I will speak on industrial relations, IR, matters.  Following the outcome of the mediation process, the IAA and staff representative bodies are working to implement the several recommendations which are contained in a confidential report from the mediator, Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  All recommendations will be actioned by the IAA and some have already been actioned.  It is important to note that the safety culture and commitment to safety of the IAA air navigation safety provider has remained robust through this period of IR issues. </p><p> Concerning aviation recovery, in 2020 and 2021 the reduction of traffic handled by the IAA was nearly 60% relative to 2019.  I was about to say we are experiencing a recovery but the problem is that now with the fourth wave, it is difficult to know where we are going.  Members might have seen Michael O'Leary saying airlines are in for a fraught period between now and the new year.</p><p> On the financial side, Covid-19 directly impacted the IAA&rsquo;s performance in 2020 and 2021.  The group reported a modest operating profit in 2020 of &euro;2.1 million, compared to a profit of &euro;27.8 million in 2019. </p><p> I will finish on something positive.  New opportunities include drones, which represent the potential to be the next great disruptive technology in our lives.  The IAA recognised the growth of drones early and in 2015 Ireland was one of the first countries in the world to start registering drones and authorising operations.  Other areas of opportunity, as I see them, include the production of sustainable aviation fuel in Ireland and the digitisation of aviation records.</p><p> My role as chairman is to lead and support the board and management and continue to focus on guiding the IAA&rsquo;s regulatory restructuring process.  I thank my colleagues on the board and across the IAA for their support and assistance over the past number of years.  I thank members for their attention and am happy to take their questions. </p></speech>

I wish to put a number of things to them.  I spoke in recent days to some IAA workers and asked if there were any points they wished to put.  Their response was that they are happy that mediation is finally under way and that many of the problems that were being buried and whose existence, in some quarters, was being denied are now being looked at and examined independently by Kieran Mulvey.  That is a good thing.  They basically said they had no questions.  When a process is under mediation, it is important we adhere to that but I have my own question arising from it, particularly given the looming separation of the company at the end of March 2022.  Will the big issues, which are IR and pension issues, be resolved at that point?</p></speech>

They will have to be resolved.  It is a condition we have set ourselves because the legislation provides that after the separation, everybody has to end up in the same position they were in before it in relation to arrangements, including pension arrangements.  We are having extensive discussions with various staff members and representatives on pensions, in particular, as well as conditions and everything to do with that.</p></speech>

The AirNav company will become more and more commercial and the new IAA will deal with regulation and all matters associated with that.  One of the early functions of each of the two new boards will be to decide what is required by way of culture in order to deliver the mandate of each of those two companies.  We have already discussed that at the IAA board, have decided that it needs to happen and will pass on that we believe it should be done almost immediately.  That will involve the two CEOs.  Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile is the CEO designate of the new IAA and Peter Kearney is the CEO designate of the AirNav company.</p></speech>

It is an impressive headquarters but it struck me it is very removed from where the real action of the IAA is happening  Most of the authority's workforce is based in Shannon, with many more in Ballygirreen, Cork, Dublin, Knock etc.  Would the authority consider coming out of Dublin city and basing themselves below in Shannon?  I met Ms Hynes below.  She has spent much time down in Shannon.  I am sure it would be personally advantageous to her to be there.  There was a good day there a few weeks ago when all the people from headquarters were down.  Someone remarked to me as those people left, not as a personal comment but as a matter of fact, that it was a long time since they had seen all the senior management down there.  They should consider, when the separation occurs, bringing senior management back to County Clare where most of the workforce is based.</p></speech>

The first is on the amendments put forward <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Air Navigation and Transport Bill.  Four amendments were outright refuted.  They came from the Irish Air Line Pilots Association, IALPA.  Was there a reason the IAA objected to those?</p></speech>

I understand that this matter is under discussion between the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and Members of the Seanad.  Hopefully, that will come to a conclusion.  I do not want to say anything to interfere with that process.</p></speech>

That is important.</p> <p>  Those four elements were coming from various concern angles.  In Ms Hynes's time, I would like if IAA could respond giving a reason under each amendment as to why the IAA feels it is being catered for or why it should not be accepted.  It would be important for us to know that as well by way of reassurance.</p></speech>

This relates to Rescue 116.  Ms Hynes referenced it in her opening statement here today.  It was an awful tragedy and a needless loss of life.  I am glad that the Department of Transport, the Irish Aviation Authority and many entities are putting their hands up and saying that there were failures and they need to respond to them.</p> <p>  One of the statutory obligations of the IAA is to have up-to-date databases, terrain mapping and modelling available to those who take to our skies and I am glad that is being tackled.  It concerns me that while that voluminous body of work is getting under way, there will be many more rescue missions.  There will be many more helicopters taking off from Shannon, Sligo, Dublin and elsewhere, and there will be civil flights taking off as well.  It concerns me that there may not be the in-house capacity to get to that point from having a weak database to having a full database of charts, maps and terrain modelling.  Will the IAA outsource some of that and when does Ms Hynes believe the IAA will have a fully comprehensive set of database maps, records and charges for all of Irish airspace that people need to fly, particularly on rescue missions?</p></speech>

Of the 42 recommendations within that report, there are five that apply to us.  Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile is specifically dealing with those five recommendations and will be able to answer the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021112400002#C00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  First, it is a pleasure to be here to have the opportunity to meet the committee.</p> <p>  Most important, we offer our condolences again to the friends and loved ones of the four crew members who tragically lost their lives in the R116 accident.  The Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, has produced a comprehensive, independent and exemplary piece of work which is several hundred pages long.  We welcomed the publication of that report.  There are 42 recommendations in it in total.  Five of those are addressed to the IAA.  We fully accept the recommendations and are making progress in the implementation of those recommendations.  We will, of course, update the AAIU on our progress over the course of the next number of weeks.</p> <p>  In regard to maps, it is a complex enough area to summarise and there have been some confusing statements about it.  I would ask the Deputy to consider two different types of charts.  There is one set of charts which are produced by the IAA on behalf of the State.  These are visual flight rules, VFR, charts.  These are charts that are intended for use in visual flying conditions.  These charts specify safe altitude minima for different sectors of airspace.  Those charts are provided by the IAA in compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, requirements for these specific VFR charts.  The charts provided by the IAA are accurate.  The charts provided at the time of the accident included Blackrock - that obstacle.  The chart was accurate as to its location and its characteristics and that is reflected in the AAIU report.  Those are the charts that it is the obligation of the State to provide.</p> <p>  Within the cockpit - one will remember this was not visual flight rules as this was in the middle of the night and there was poor visibility - the aircraft has other navigational aids which the crew relies on.  These aids are provided by third parties and the obstacle, Blackrock, was not included in some of those third party databases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.945" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021112400002#C00800"><p>If I may intervene, the enhanced ground proximity warning system, EGPWS, is what I was angling towards.  I respect the point about the visual flying charts.  It was specifically the EGPWS which was referenced in the air accident report and which was referenced on multiple occasions in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Where the IAA functionality ties into that, I refer to the deficiencies, how the IAA hopes to address it and, more important, the timeframe because there are many pilots taking to the skies each night wondering whether the kind of terrain mapping that was needed that night out at Blackrock is now in place or when will it be in place.</p></speech>

Those charts are extant.  They are up to date and they are accurate.</p> <p>  The IAA is not and cannot be responsible for ensuring that every geographical feature on those maps is rendered into third party databases.  The third party databases are provided by contractors who themselves are approved, not by the IAA but by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA.</p> <p>  Of course, parking for a moment the direct and immediate responsibilities of the IAA, if we look at this from a broader context what is important for Ireland Inc. is to ensure that these missions are undertaken safely.  As I said, there are 42 recommendations to improve the safety performance.</p></speech>

We fully accept those recommendations and we are in the process of implementing them.  We can go into those in a little more detail.</p> <p>  The issue on the night in the cockpit, I would say, related fundamentally to a number of failings which were identified in the AAIU report.  One of them related to the company route guides used.  The second identified the fact that the EGPWS that Deputy Cathal Crowe referred to did not contain the obstacle and there were two other navigational sources that did not contain the obstacle.</p> <p>  There is no lacuna, as such, here.  The IAA is responsible for the provision of State maps.  It provides those maps for visual flight conditions.  The aircraft has other navigational sources available to it.  The providers of the kit and the providers of those maps are approved by EASA.</p></speech>

I will go back to the fact that the maps produced by the IAA on behalf of the State are VFRs, that is, for visual flight rules.  What they do is specify safe minimum altitudes for particular sectors.  For instrument flight procedures, and that relates to specific approaches to aerodromes, they also give more detail and routings.  Those more detailed route procedures relate to, as I said, access to aerodromes.  They do not relate to the totality of Irish airspace and you do not have instrument flight procedure rules for the majority of the airspace off the west coast, off the east coast and in the hills.</p></speech>

As an ordinary person looking at this situation, I am going to say that there is a lacuna.  It follows, as clearly as night follows day, that the same type of safety procedures should be in place, based on the IAA's mapping, at night as during the day.  I thought that would be something that the IAA would like to see being in place for all equipment used in aeroplanes, and specifically at night.</p></speech>

They specify a minimum altitude for sectors, and they are not for use in poor visibility.  In situations of poor visibility, instrument flight procedures are used and those are specified for given routes in and out of aerodromes.  We have hundreds of miles of coastline, and thousands of miles when we consider all the inlets and so forth, and they are not designed for that.</p></speech>

This language will make perfect sense to the witnesses.  It contains a bit too much jargon for us, but we will have a go.  The plan states:</p> <blockquote> 	In Ireland, the IAA provides Electronic Terrain And Obstacle Data, ETOD, for use by industry stakeholders, such as GPS and FMS database suppliers.  The ETOD helps to eliminate database transfer errors in on-board TAWS [terrain awareness warning systems] equipment and thereby helps minimise [controlled flight into terrain] CFIT occurrences. </blockquote> <p>I assume that last term, controlled flight into terrain, means collisions.  Do the witnesses accept that the IAA's obligations are set out in that section?  Are those obligations being fulfilled?  This is the matter in essence.  I am referring to the authority's own text.</p></speech>

We make that information available to the aviation sector to import into databases used for navigation.  It would not be possible for us to analyse every geographical feature of a database to ensure that those maps have been rendered correctly.  In the ordinary course of events, what would be expected is that where crews are flying routes and are aware of routes, they would identify obstacles they wish to have charted.  We have such a process in place, and we are in discussion with the sector in this regard.  Those in the sector ask us if we can map certain things and chart these additional obstacles in certain approach routes, etc.  We have a workshop process in that context.  We do respond to such requests, and we confirm that we can map such additional features.  Typically, however, this process relates to approach routes into aerodromes, which are frequently used routes.  It does not relate to areas of the coast that are infrequently used or flown over.</p></speech>

I do not wish to dwell on the R116 incident.  It is technical and a tragic situation, and I want to make other points in my five minutes.  Surely, though, if the IAA is the body responsible for aviation safety, there must be rules.  If there are no rules, they should be inserted into the legislation to ensure that anybody providing maps to anyone using Irish aerospace must have maps that are accurate.  Is that not the most basic requirement of a safety organisation?  It is all very well for the IAA to state that it is issuing VFR maps and that other people did not transpose them properly into their systems.  Surely, however, it should be a requirement of the legislation that anyone transposing the IAA's maps must bring all the details and all the information concerning dangers and hazards on those maps into the equipment that is being used, and particularly at night when VFR is not that useful.</p></speech>

What occurred on the night of the R116 tragedy was that the crew were flying a company-specified route and were not aware that at the altitude the aircraft was flying, the route would bring them into collision with the island.</p></speech>

Surely it is the most basic thing for any safety organisation to ensure that obstructions are highlighted on a map and that those obstacles are included in all equipment being relied upon.  If that means having to negotiate, navigate and input more data, then so be it.  People have lost their lives because their equipment did not warn them of obstacles that were there and that it should have warned them about.</p></speech>

The AAIU report highlighted that aspect and generated several recommendations to improve the safety performance and the regulatory safety oversight of SAR.  We give search and rescue operations several exemptions.  One of those includes exemptions from minima that would generally apply to civil aviation.  That is because if a search and rescue flight is winching someone out of the sea or conducting another aspect of a rescue operation, then it will be likely that it will be necessary to deviate from the rules of the air.  We explicitly give the SAR operator exemptions from the rules of the air.</p> <p>  Returning to the matter of the charts, the chart generated by the State, as with almost everything we do in regulation, is determined by the ICAO.  We fulfil that production requirement for those charts.  They are VFR charts.  As I said, we are in discussions with the sector and we seek to help those involved in the sector.  If they ask us to chart these additional features on a particular approach route, then we will do that.  Generally speaking, flights are not flying at low altitudes in these areas and the VFR charts we produce specify a minimum safe altitude for the use of those charts.  It is important, therefore, not to ask that the charts do more than they are designed to do.</p></speech>

We are interviewing the chairperson-designate of a company that will no longer exist in three or four months' time.  However, that is beside the point.  When the chairperson of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, appeared before the committee, he made the point that the level of charges the airport was allowed to levy was based on the fact it was dealing with up to 32 million passengers a year.  Clearly, it is not seeing those passenger numbers now and the passenger charge is unsustainably low based on current traffic levels.  What is happening in terms of liaison between the IAA and the DAA to ensure Dublin Airport is in a position to keep itself going sustainably?  What is the IAA's role in facilitating sustainability as part of its economic regulation function?  How will it ensure the airport is sustainable into the future?</p></speech>

One of its early tasks will be to look at that issue.  I watched the proceedings when Mr. Basil Geoghegan was before the committee and what he said makes commercial sense.  I cannot say any more other than that when the separation happens, this issue will be a major matter for consideration.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Hynes and Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile to the meeting.  Ms Hynes's suitability for appointment is not in question and I wish her well in her role.  She is aware of the committee's overarching discussion with Mr. Geoghegan, who appeared before the committee regarding his reappointment.  The issue of sustainability is a huge challenge and cost for the aviation sector that will require expensive infrastructure around sustainable fuelling, electrification of aprons, solar farms and so on.  As Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile and Ms Hynes know, the DAA set the limit for charges around the country.  Dublin Airport significantly reduced its charges, which had a significant effect on all other airports, including Cork, which can charge adversely.  There are insufficient allowances for investment in the area of sustainability and a change is needed to allow for the cost of sustainability initiatives.  The current charges do not account for that.  Will Ms Hynes comment on whether this issue will be a priority?</p></speech>

I listened to what Mr. Geoghegan had to say when he appeared before the committee and I understood his points.  He said he was looking forward, when the separation happens, to engaging with the regulator on this issue.</p></speech>

The important point is that there is an implication for the rebuilding of connectivity in a post-Covid world.  There needs to some economic regulatory function in that regard.</p> <p>  It is fair to say there is much unhappiness and disquiet regarding the Bill that is coming through the Seanad.  I have never experienced as much engagement on legislation by a whole host of people, including air traffic controllers and pilots.  Their concerns are a source of worry.  I appreciate that Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile has facilitated meetings with us and with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  The latter has been more than accommodating of Oireachtas Members in this matter.  There are concerns that the Bureau Veritas report on the IAA has not been made public.  Is there a commitment to make it available to Members of the Oireachtas or the Minister of State?  Will it be made public at all?</p></speech>

There is a culture within the IAA.  He has seen the emails that we have got and he has been involved in different engagements.

The board of the IAA has discussed that recently and said that now is not the time.  We cannot decide for the two new entities but it is something we will pass on to the two new entities.  We will be saying that we regard it as important that each of the two new entities considers the corporate culture required to deliver their mandates.  They cannot just continue with the exact same culture and will need to look at what is required to deliver on their mandates.</p></speech>

I have every faith in her.  In her capacity as chairperson, she will need to take a hands-on approach to drive this change to bring staff with her.  It is unusual for someone like Kieran Mulvey to be appointed in the way he was.  Given her personal and professional background, Ms Hynes is eminently qualified.  Given the importance of connectivity, our aviation sector is pivotal to the country's recovery.  In her address to us she mentioned industrial relations matters.  I appeal to her to take a hands-on approach in driving change and bringing people with her.  There is an element of jaded discontentment among staff and I hope she can change that outlook.</p></speech>

All of that is happening.  If employees have issues, those issues are being dealt with.  I have every faith in that process and get regular updates back from it.  I know it is going very well.  I do not just rely on that; I actually talk to employees.  Many employees have contacted me and I have arrangements to visit various places.  I would have been to many more of them were it not for Covid.  I am in touch with people in the various entities.</p></speech>

There seems to be an ongoing issue over whether it is part of the European safety agency.  I ask for clarity on that please.</p> <p>  Finally, I thank Ms Hynes for being here.

I add my voice to what has been said.  Obviously, Ms Hynes's CV speaks for itself regarding her ability to do the job, which to a degree is to see the end of an outfit and hopefully the successful creation of two new outfits.  Significant work needs to be done on safety given the conversation we have had earlier.</p> <p>  I seek clarity on a technical issue.  The visual flight rules, VFR, charts are provided and they have all the necessary details.  I do not want to get into the details of legislation.  I accept, as the Chairman said earlier, that we can write to the Minister if we identify weaknesses or question marks.  That information is then basically imported into an air navigation system and then it is down to the system as to how it deals with that information and whether it garners all the information.  All the necessary information regarding somewhere like Black Rock or anywhere else is contained, including the information on proposed minimum flight altitude.  I accept that search and rescue is different and allowances need to be made so that we do not make it mandatory.  Am I right on that?  While I do not want to apportion blame, are we to a degree talking about a systems failure where that information was not garnered within a system?</p></speech>

It indicates exactly which navigational sources did and did not contain the information and makes recommendations for the correction of that.  Fundamentally what the Deputy is saying is right.  We produce a set of charts; it is the obligation of the State to produce them.  They are VFR - for use in visual flying conditions.  Obviously in this case it was nighttime and moreover the visibility conditions were poor.  The databases bring in that information.

That is a piece of work that we can follow up on later.</p> <p>  On the wider issue in relation to safety, what I am trying to get at is the question of whether, in the Air Navigation Transport Bill 2020, we have all the checks and balances we require to catch mistakes.  Mistakes happen.  We commonly use the example of global air travel.  The system started working properly when operators were told they had two weeks to basically give notification of a near collision.  At that stage, protocols were improved.  Heads did not roll, but the system improved and it saved lives.  Do we have that?</p></speech>

The first point we should emphasise is that aviation is an extremely regulated activity, necessarily and rightly so, and it is a very safe activity.  I have a statistic with me that I was discussing with the Chair earlier.  In 2018, before the pandemic hit, 4.3 billion passengers travelled globally on 46 million flights.  In terms of fatal accidents per 1 million flights, in 1992, it was 0.95; in 2016, it was 0.2.  Therefore, there has been a huge improvement in safety performance across the industry as connectivity and the number of journeys have increased.</p> <p>  On the question of how we regulate, as a regulator we have 12,000 standards and recommended practices from the ICAO.  We have thousands of pages of European Union Aviation Safety Agency regulation.  The EASA regulation transposes the ICAO regulation, but it goes beyond that.  It also gives us acceptable means of compliance.  It sets out the law and how operators or licence holders can comply with the law.  Further, it provides additional guidance material.  That is done at European level and it is standard across Europe.  For example, if I am an airline, a pilot, an engineer or a maintenance organisation, I can go on to the EASA website, or link into it through the IAA website, and see exactly the structure of regulatory oversight and what I have to comply with.  As the IAA, we audit against those compliance requirements.  We do thousands of audits each year, and we audit on the basis of compliance checklists.  For example, if there are 100 requirements in the regulation, we will say that we are going to audit against every single one of them.  We may randomly pull out records relating to a particular area.</p> <p>  Aviation is a very safe industry that is comprehensively regulated.  What the AAIU report and the tragic accident of R116 tell us is that in the area of SAR, there are important improvements that we can make.  We are committed to making those improvements.  To give one example, SAR was previously usually conducted by the State in different jurisdictions.  It was outside the remit of the ICAO and the EASA.  Therefore, the regulation of SAR is less developed than civil aviation generally.</p></speech>

We have a statutory basis for the regulation of SAR.  At the time of the accident, and before and after the accident, we exercised oversight of SAR, and we still do.  We did that through a number of statutory instruments, which hang from our primary legislation, and also by issuing an air operator certificate to the operator and a national SAR approval.  We exercised safety oversight and we had a statutory basis for that.</p></speech>

It is very clear to me that, as a matter of fact, we did exercise safety oversight at the time of the accident.  There are one or two legitimate reasons for confusion.  One is that we did not regulate the Irish Coast Guard <i>per se</i>.  The Irish Coast Guard is separate from the operator that provides the search and rescue services.  The Coast Guard has marine and aviation activities and sits in the Departments with responsibility for transport and the marine.  It is not an aviation operator.  Therefore, we did not have regulatory oversight of it at the time and do not now.  As a consequence of the air accident investigation unit, AAIU, report, however, that has been clarified.  The Bill will give us regulatory oversight of the Coast Guard.  We are already in touch with the Coast Guard on developing a memorandum of understanding as to how we will fulfil that regulatory oversight, and we will issue regulations for the Coast Guard, in particular on its tasking of search and rescue, SAR, missions.  I think that that was one reason for the confusion.  Another was the fact, to which I have referred, that, as the Senator will be aware, the ICAO and IASA do not provide regulation material on SAR, which is unusual in civil aviation.</p></speech>

Those aircraft were retrofitted for night vision technology.  Maybe it is a bit unfair to ask Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile this, and by all means he may tell me he cannot answer it because it was well before his time.  Clearly, those aircraft were retrofitted.  After the retrofitting there were complaints about the level of lighting in the cockpits.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile find it extraordinary that, first and foremost, the State paid for the retrofitting in 2013-----</p></speech>

After the retrofit, was it the responsibility of the IAA to inspect the aircraft and make sure they were operating correctly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>cockpit lighting and so on?</p></speech>

The fitting of the kit into the aircraft was approved by IASA.  It is a design modification of the aircraft.  The retrofitting was done by the manufacturer.  Such an approval would include a safety risk analysis of any impact such retrofitting would have on other aspects of the technology or operation of the aircraft.  The night vision imaging system, NVIS, is available to the aircraft for their normal commercial aviation flights, let us call them.  We are finalising with the operator a review of its safety risk analysis for NVIS to be used on SAR flights.  That process is well advanced.  We expect to give that approval within a matter of weeks if not before.</p></speech>

I am a little concerned the charts and maps that are provided to aeronautical companies can be scanned incorrectly.  It appears from the report that that seems to have been a problem.  Four navigation systems, from what I can recall, failed on that day.  I am sure the IAA has plenty of work and I would think Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile has plenty of work ahead of him to put all these things right.

This is no reflection on Ms Hynes or any of the others.  However, the Minister got a call from the Taoiseach minutes later.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.1196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021112400002#J05700"><p>I have made no allegations.  I am asking questions, and if Ms Hynes chooses not to answer anything, I have no intention of badgering her because, on a personal level, I have good regard for her but we are talking professionally.</p> <p>  In 2011 and 2012, Ms Hynes led a campaign to separate Shannon from the DAA promising a bright future for Shannon if it could compete effectively with Dublin.  It was often said, and I do not attribute the comments to Ms Hynes, that if the dead hand of the DAA could be taken off Shannon, it would prosper in a free market.  The Government at the time went ahead with that.  As Ms Hynes identified, the current T&aacute;naiste, who was Minister for Transport at the time, initiated that separation and rewarded her with chairmanship of the airport in 2013.  That was a quasi-executive role for Ms Hynes.  During that time, Shannon went through three CEOs and numerous managers were hired and left.</p> <p>  In 2013, tourism was at an all-time low.  Numbers through the airport were at an all-time low because of the global financial crash.  In that year, Shannon launched a five-year plan to grow passenger numbers from 1.4 million to 2.5 million.  Back in 2007, prior to the crash, numbers going through the airport were 3.65 million, so 1.4 million was a very low base and, therefore, 2.5 million was seen as possibly being conservative.  The reality is that over that period of time, passenger numbers at Shannon grew by only 300,000 to 1.7 million while the numbers at Dublin grew by 13 million.</p> <p>  That was on Ms Hynes's watch.  What was her role at that time?  Was she the chair?  Was she involved in any way in management?  Did she see herself as having an executive role?  Did she initiate or involve herself in any of the day-to-day management?  Was she involved in procurement of any services for the airport?  Did she lobby for any members to join the board of the airport with her?</p></speech>

I did not perform an executive function so that is clear.  There were returns for any lobbying I engaged in.  I tried lobbying to get things to happen for the airport.  It is a normal feature of doing business there.  I cannot remember what the other question was.</p></speech>

From then on, a lot of the press releases spoke about the performance of the group in financial terms and there was a lot less discussion about passenger numbers.  Was that something initiated by Ms Hynes?</p></speech>

That was Government policy.  Government policy was that upon separation from the DAA, Shannon would be merged with certain aspects of what was previously Shannon Development.</p><p>That took some couple of years of restructuring.  Once the de-merger of certain aspects of Shannon Development occurred we ended up with the property and heritage portfolios and they were merged.  That was all part of Government policy. </p></speech>

Then whoever puts a hand up to stay will form part of a panel.  Obviously there is a shortage and, therefore, the panel will be augmented by a process operated by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to add to the panel.

The causes have been identified by the AAIU.  There were approximately 70 findings.  There are 42 recommendations.  Those recommendations will improve safety performance for search and rescue in Ireland and globally, because other people will look at this report.  There are recommendations for the IAA.  We accept those recommendations and will implement them.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Hynes to the committee.  Mediation is important.</p><p>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  His work is going really well.  That appointment was made on foot of a recommendation of this committee.  Many members called for his appointment.  There is still a significant body of work to be done.  What is the view of Ms Hynes in that regard?  All Oireachtas Members received a significant volume of correspondence from concerned people within the IAA in respect of the culture that has developed there.  I hope those issues will be addressed in a substantive way and will not obstruct the fundamental reform package that has now been introduced, with Ms Hynes at the helm.</p></speech>

Kieran Mulvey did a great job, as he always does.  We are now in the implementation phase in the context of those recommendations.  They all went to a ballot and there was a very successful outcome to that at union level.  We are now in the implementation phase.  Several of the recommendations have been implemented and the remainder are ongoing.  Discussions are continuing with the relevant staff members to fulfil the process.  It is a completely different scenario now that we have moved to implementation and everybody involved is positively disposed and working in the belief that the issues are being heard and dealt with.  Obviously, the past two years have been tough on everybody.  Every business has experienced issues as a result.  I can safely say that all of the matters are being dealt with now in the implementation phase.</p></speech>

The AAIU report is a comprehensive, independent and exemplary piece of work.  There is no finding in that report against or in respect of the IAA in the context of charting information.  It is important to make that point.  It may suit certain narratives to seek to criticise the IAA and IAA charts but that is not a valid criticism.  If one looks at the detail of the report, there is nothing there to cast any doubt in respect of the IAA's fulfilment of its charting obligations on behalf of the State.  There are recommendations addressed to the IAA and we accept those recommendations.</p></speech>

No one disputes that fact.  Obviously, if the mission had been during the day, there would not have been an issue.  The incident occurred at night.  Four people lost their lives, affecting four families.  It is clear that the mapping system in the cockpit on the night did not show the island.  I am a layman.  We need to ensure, whether through regulation, legislation or whatever, the accuracy of mapping in all situations in terms of the IAA's visual flight rules, VFR, maps.  Am I correct to refer to VFR?</p></speech>

There are other mapping databases available.  There is a significant amount of geo-information available.  It is clear from the report of the AAIU that there was a lacuna or gap, as the Chairman stated, in the rendering of information accurately in those navigation sources.  That was picked up by the report, as it had to be.  I agree it is something the sector collectively needs to address.  The role of the IAA in that regard will be through oversight of the operator through the safety management system.</p></speech>

If I am an operator and the IAA provides me with charts and I scan them, somebody somewhere has to have oversight of what I scan and make sure that I have imported into my system what the IAA has on record and not missed out on part of it.

We look forward to the transition of the IAA, with the separation and formation of AirNav Ireland.  We are conscious of the 735 employees involved.  As Ms Hynes will be aware, as a committee, we recommended that Mr. Mulvey be appointed as mediator.  We think he is very competent in the role.  We wish Ms Hynes and &Oacute; Conghaile well.  I thank them for appearing before the committee in person.  A letter and transcript of this meeting will be issued to the Minister of Transport informing him that the committee has met with Ms Hynes.  I am sure that she will appreciate that robust exchanges, in their own way, are healthy.  It is something that I value.

We are here to discuss Ms Bolger&rsquo;s strategic plans for the role and her views on the challenges currently facing the organisation.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege such that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  </p> <p>  Witnesses who are participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.

We look forward to her contribution.  I call her to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I look forward to engaging with it.  I have served as a board member of An Post since 2017.  A few months ago, I was invited to become chairperson.  I joined the board just on the cusp of the transformation programme and have seen significant changes in the past four years.<br/><br/>I would like to start by giving the committee some information about myself.  I have 30 years&rsquo; broad banking experience gained in Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  I worked in corporate and business banking, retail banking and credit risk.  I also held senior roles, including chief operating officer of business banking and director for strategy and planning in corporate banking.  In recent years, my career has been focused on the area of governance.  I am a chartered director and a board evaluator with the Institute of Directors in Ireland, where I also tutor on the chartered director programme.  I am a non-executive director on the board of BCMGlobal ASI Ltd, I chair Utexam Solutions, which is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas and I also chair the audit committee of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I was previously a member of the board of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  I am a certified bank director.  I hold qualifications in finance, strategy and innovation and I am an accredited coach.  I am fellow of the Institute of Banking, IOB, and I was a council member there for many years.  I also acted as vice president there for a time. <br/><br/>Turning to An Post, it is a company with a proud record of service to the people of Ireland and the communities we serve.  I see An Post as rooted in that fine tradition, working hard in the present but firmly focused on the future.  I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution of Mr. Dermot Divilly, who chaired An Post from 2015 to 2020.  I have served as the <i>pro tempore</i>chairperson of An Post in the interim before my appointment last July.  <br/><br/>In that capacity, I outlined in our 2020 annual report how An Post put the common good and the national requirements at the forefront of its response to the pandemic.  We put in place an enhanced service to vulnerable sections of our community, and we provided easier access to social welfare payments.  We were asked by Government to help maintain the supply of cash to local communities and to keep the mail system open.  We delivered on all of these requests.  An Post doubled its efforts to facilitate home delivery.  We removed much of the pain for the economy.  A price increase that had been announced before the pandemic was postponed in our desire to support SMEs.  An Post bore the burden of this in its own financial results.  <br/><br/>The board and myself are proud of the achievements of the organisation.  We have reiterated our commitment to play a positive role nationally in dealing with what continues to be unprecedented times for our country.  Our challenge now is maintaining that high level of service to a rapidly changing Ireland and building a future based on the needs of our customers, grounded in the firm principles of sustainability.  The challenges we face impact locally but are generated globally and are similar to those being faced by post companies worldwide.  <br/><br/>An Post initiated a new strategy in 2017, which saw the business move forward significantly.  We recorded a profit before depreciation of &euro;79 million in 2019.  This has contracted since the pandemic, and a profit before depreciation of &euro;32 million was recorded in 2020.  All post offices have continued to provide services and our delivery network has emerged as an essential service.  We handled an increase in e-commerce traffic during 2020 of more than 100%.  Brexit and customs changes have proven to be a disruptor but An Post has emerged as a significant solution.  We continue to put in systems and processes to enable e-commerce to flourish.  The group has a defined strategy and is looking forward to emerging from the pandemic period and returning to growth in 2022.  We will continue to work with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the officials in their Departments.  Our strategy for the years ahead will see An Post play a leading role in the national recovery.  That strategy, which I will oversee, will involve an investment of &euro;200 million to &euro;300 million in our networks over the next five years for physical and digital infrastructure.  <br/><br/>We will continue our push ahead and develop a leading logistics network to meet the growth in e-commerce while building a sustainable mail delivery service.  We will do this in line with our ethos of providing decent work for our people in contrast to the so-called gig economy.</p><p>We will invest in a transformed and sustainable post office network for customers, communities and SMEs.  </p></speech>

We are committed to investing in the national post office network while also investing heavily in enabling customers to do their business with us at a time, place and method of their choice.  We are constantly developing a new omnichannel capability that combines the latest digital technology with our unique human touch and our extensive post office network.</p> <p>  The decline of core business lines such as social welfare transactions, BillPay and mail services has meant that we have had to reinvent the role of the post office and come up with new services to meet the changing needs of customers.  An example of this is our green hub, which supports the national sustainability drive in helping homeowners to live a greener, more sustainable life.  We have a one-stop home retrofitting service and green loans with a 4.9% interest rate, the lowest rate of any provider in the country. </p> <p>  It would be remiss of me to appear before this committee and not make reference to the availability of government services through our post offices and our desire to do more.  We are a point of contact between Irish citizens and Government.  We want to work with Government to expand the range of services we offer.  That, too, will continue to be a key element of our strategy in the years to come and a key demand of ours to Government.</p> <p>  My particular areas of interest are in governance and in the pursuit of good governance, openness and transparency.  This has been a feature of the work of the board of An Post and that will continue.  I am now engaged in a process to appoint three new members to the board as we deepen our skills and experience to meet the challenges ahead. </p> <p>  I am excited to chair a company that has set a number of firsts in recent years, including becoming the first major institution in Ireland to eliminate the gender pay gap and to remove carbon emissions from our cities.  That ambition and innovation will continue to be the hallmarks of An Post in the years to come.  Both will be central to our efforts to deal with the challenges we face in building a company that is fit for the needs of the developing Ireland helping the national recovery.  Our purpose is, and will continue to be, to act for the common good, now and for generations to come. </p> <p>  I thank committee members for their time and I am happy to take their questions. </p></speech>

The first person up is Deputy Crowe.  Since he is not here, I will take the couple of minutes assigned to him.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Bolger for her work on the board to date.  I know the role she will take on as chairman.  She comes with considerable experience of An Post, in the first instance, and a very wide area of expertise.  She is very much valued by the company.  I served as Opposition spokesperson for this area in the past.  I recall a time of considerable difficulty for An Post.  The then Minister ring me late one night to say he was going to Cabinet the next day with a proposal to increase the price of the postage stamp, such was the perilous nature of the company.  I had to go to my parliamentary party and get them to support it from an opposition perspective.  We did so because we believed in An Post, its management and board, and all the staff around the country who do a hell of a good job.</p> <p>  We have had issues in the past about the closure of post offices and we would like to keep that under review because we see the post office as a vital component of the heartbeat of many villages.  Where post offices have, sadly, closed, it has taken away a significant State involvement in the village.  I ask Ms Bolger, in her role as chair, to keep an eye on that, to look for opportunities to retain post offices wherever possible and to try to retain the network.</p> <p>  In recognition of the work of An Post, I would like to particularly compliment to Mr. David McRedmond and Mr. Angus Laverty.  They are two people who engage fully with Members of these Houses.  Whether the news is bad or good, they are always available.  From time to tome, as I have said, we have to deal with the bad news of the closure of post offices on the behalf of our constituents.  I have found Mr. Laverty and Mr. McRedmond to be of the greatest support and assistance.  I want Ms Bolger to convey to them and to all the staff my thanks and the thanks of all Members of these Houses for the tremendous work they do.  They are an invaluable element of the company.</p> <p>  I do not have any direct question for Ms Bolger.  I wish her well.  She has my support and that of the committee.</p></speech>

I will pick up in a couple of the points he has raised.  He has mentioned some very important elements.  I see this as a company that belongs to the nation.  In the opening address of the 2020 annual report, our CEO stated that in 2020, An Post found its soul.  The Acting Chairman referred to it as a heartbeat and there is something about An Post that makes it the nation's darling, in a sense.  When I was appointed to the board, the Minister at the time told me An Post was the jewel in the nation's crown.  I had not looked at the organisation in that light before then but I think it is a jewel.  It is an amazing company.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman mentioned management and we have an amazing leadership team.  I appreciate the Acting Chairman's acknowledgement of Mr. McRedmond, Mr. Laverty and all the management team.  There is an amazing leadership team in An Post and they do a lot of the heavy lifting and hard work.  The board also adds a lot of value but we must appreciate the management and all of our 9,000-odd staff who work hard every day to deliver the services.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman also mentioned our postmasters and local post offices.  My big request today relates to government services, of which we want to provide more.  Mr. McRedmond mentioned that on "Today with Claire Byrne" yesterday.  We are serious about this.  I hope in my tenure as chair over the next few years that we will be able to move forward and add that value.  Our nation is bereft of touch-point social contact.  We believe we can do a lot more to generate the footfall and business for our postmasters.  I thank the Acting Chairman for his remarks.</p></speech>

It is obvious from her CV that she has the qualifications, knowledge and experience to give good leadership and guidance to An Post at this time, particularly to the board.  There is no doubt this is a time of exciting opportunity for An Post.  It is important in the new environment that the opportunities are tapped to their full potential.</p> <p>  I also compliment everyone who has been involved with the company during the Covid-19 outbreak to date.  As public representatives, we hear complaints from everybody about access to public services.  An Post is to be complimented because I have received no complaints about it over the past two years.  The team at An Post has done a fantastic job.  It has maintained its obligations to the public and has given an excellent service under a lot of pressure.</p></speech>

Will she elaborate on that?  What is intended in that regard?  When does she expect to have the full complement of board members appointed?</p> <p>  I would like to be associated with the expression of thanks to Mr. Laverty and Mr. McRedmond.  As public representatives, it is heartening for us to be able to make direct contact with people and to get responses.  Part of our job is to represent the views of the public and in many cases, we do not get a response.  I compliment An Post for the fact that it keeps in contact with us, makes responses to representations and does the best it can to fulfil the needs that exist on any particular day.  I wish Ms Bolger well in her term of office.  I hope the future is bright for An Post.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear he has not received any complaints.  We obviously do get complaints but we deal with them as best we can and, hopefully, resolve them.  Overall, our brand is held in good stead.</p> <p>  Deputy Lowry has asked specific questions about our investment in the post office network, and about board members.  Our strategy for the next few years outlines our intention to invest between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million in our post offices generally.  That is broadly split on a 50-50 basis between our retail business and our mails and parcels sector.  An Post has been reinvigorated in recent years.  It has rebranded.  We want to become a digital company.  We want people to see us as a modern organisation.  That investment will continue to see that modernisation in the post office network.  Likewise, in the mails and parcels sector, we want to see a best-in-class logistics network.  That is where investment will take place.</p> <p>  We have a meeting next week to consider the situation around board membership.  We hope to move forward then and I hope we will have made three appointments before Christmas.  That might be a challenge but those appointments are imminent.  There is great interest in the board, which I find heartening because we need to get the best people we can to lead this organisation into the future.  We are aware of the skills we need.  We are looking to our organisation for the future and asking where we are taking the organisation.  Sustainability is one of our key requirements.  We want somebody around the table who can challenge the organisation and support the board in our sustainability agenda, which is a top priority for us as an organisation.</p><p>I hope I answered the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

I hope its ratification will be a formality.  I join previous speakers in congratulating Ms Bolger, Mr. Angus Laverty and their team for their engagement with us over the years, particularly during the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>  On post office consolidation, 190 post offices closed in the past two and half years.  This has a devastating impact on rural communities.  The last post office to close in County Clare was at Broadford, just a few miles back from my home.  Under the consolidation plans of An Post, post offices will serve a 15 km radius.  How does Ms Bolger see that progressing?  Given that the Broadford post office is closed, does this mean that the post office 15 km away or within the 15 km catchment will be saved?  Is it about the survival of the fittest, whereby if one falls, the other one is saved?</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million investment that is planned for the post office network, what weighting is given to PostPoints, which may be situated at the back of a shop, versus the physical traditional post office building?  PostPoints are great for picking up a few stamps or have a personal weighed and sent off but they do not add real value in terms of the full suite of post office services.</p> <p>  The deal struck by An Post with Bank of Ireland has certainly been a win from a consumer's point of view as people in small villages can carry out banking services at a post office hatch.  It has not, however, been a win for postmasters because the post office has largely become an agency bank.  The stickers of Bank of Ireland and An Post are visible around the window hatch, but in real terms the service is only worth about &euro;1,200, on average, per postmaster.  I hope Ms Bolger will address some of those points in her response.</p></speech>

On the first question about the radius, I will not pretend I know the specifics because I do not.  I have a notes but I do not have with me.  I will certainly revert to the Deputy on the matter.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether when one post office falls, another one is saved.  Our objective is to have post offices that are viable.  That is a big objective.  If the very small post offices do not have the footfall or the business, they just cannot be a viable business with individual postmasters.  If I may, I will come back to the Deputy on that point after the meeting and provide him with specific detail on the radius and his questions.</p> <p>  Our intention is to support postmasters.  They are entrepreneurs and businesspeople who are running their own businesses.  If I flip to the Deputy's final question about Bank of Ireland, the objective of that is to increase footfall and develop a suite of products and services.  We are currently doing this so that when people come into a post office perhaps to use agency banking, they will then buy additional products because we are selling them and they are exactly what they need.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that PostPoints do not add real value.  We must consider our consumers.  What does the nation need and what do people need?  How do people need to get their parcels delivered and how do they need to collect them?  This is a very complex business we are running.  Our objective is to deliver to our customers but also to make sure our postmasters can have a viable business.  It is a challenging agenda but we believe our strategy will get us home.  We have had a very difficult year in 2020 and 2021 with the pandemic.  We have survived and we will survive the year.  Next year we will, I believe, come back into very good stead with regard to our overall balance sheet and numbers.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  I will come back to him on his question on the 15 km radius because I do not want to give him the wrong information.</p></speech>

The clock is against us this afternoon.  I thank Ms Bolger and wish her well as she starts out in this role.  I would, however, argue with one of the points Ms Bolger has made.  It is not personal but I believe the track record of An Post over the past several years has been to consolidate the post office network.  That is a nice soft way of saying it will close down every second post office in rural Ireland.  That is what has happened in reality.  Very few of those 190 closures have happened Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford or Galway.  They have happened in rural parts, such as County Clare and other counties in the west.</p> <p>  We need to look at what the post office really provides  I accept the Bank of Ireland partnership has benefited the consumer and PostPoints are very convenient for periodic users of the post office network, but in real terms we must consider the postmasters who have been the backbone of the community for many years.  There are so many other roles they could have, such as in community banking.  Many parcels are darted across the country each day.  People may order four or five pairs of jeans, keep one pair and send the others back to the retailer.  That kind of retail is where consumers have gone.  I am not sure An Post is perfectly positioned for that.  I hope Ms Bolger can lead that in the chairperson role.  Perhaps she will cast a fresh eye over the rural post office network and try to right some of the wrongs of recent years.  I wish her every success.</p></speech>

I hear that what he is saying.  We have a postmaster representative on our board and he is a voice for the postmasters.  It behoves us to ensure everybody gets a fair slice of the cake.  At the end of the day, we have to be a viable and sustainable business.  These people are self-employed.  We want to support them through our products.  I believe the Deputy and I are actually singing from the same hymn sheet in what we are saying.</p></speech>

I am relatively new to this committee but I was in the Chair in the Seanad back in 2017 when the price increase was approved.  I remember listening to the Minister at the time saying how important it was.  It was a substantial increase but it has been shown to have been necessary as the company may have been facing a real viability crisis at the time.  It has come through that very well.</p> <p>  The delivery side seems to be going very well, with parcel post and people ordering online.  All of that is helping the business and helping the future.  I will touch on how An Post will do that sustainably, especially in the cities where electric vehicles and bicycles can be used.  I see these around, but postmen and postwomen have been using bicycles for parcels and so on for a long time.</p> <p>  Has an analysis of the company's customer profile, including the age profile, been done?  Older people are very comfortable and more willing to put their savings into An Post than into our pillar banks.  It is a real credit to An Post that the brand is so strong.  People see it as safe and State-backed and understand that it was not responsible for or involved in the crash.  Ms Bolger has had a career in banking.  I do not mean anything personal in that.  People see An Post as strong and safe and, as Ms Bolger said, an asset of the people brand.</p> <p>  Given An Post's customer profile, particularly in respect of age, what additional State services would An Post like to provide?  I have in mind the public services card, for which I had to go to an Intreo office.  Perhaps postmasters could provide those.  Driving licence centres have been set up but could driving licences be processed through An Post?</p> <p>  What services could An Post offer to broaden its customer age profile?  People save, use banking services and so on.  With Ms Bolger's experience in banking, she will have seen people are not using cash in the same way they were using it even two years ago.  I am concerned about broadband, not that it is a bad thing but that it may impact on An Post's customers and its customer base.  People using post office services may be able to do this online when they get broadband, thereby bypassing the post office.  What strategy does An Post have to address those issues?</p></speech>

I will go back to what he said about the price increase.  I thank everybody for their support on that.  That price increase was at a very important time in An Post's history and ensured our viability at the time.</p> <p>  When one considers our balance sheet, as an organisation we have a very low gearing.  We do not take State subvention.  We have two loans, one from the European Investment Bank and one from the State.  The total drawn at the moment is, I believe, &euro;50 million.  It must be remembered that our gearing is about 30% as an organisation, which is quite strong.  Even though that price increase was critical at the time, viability is something that we are constantly looking at and we are looking out to the future.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned analysis of our customer profile.  An Post is now investing in technology.  We have great plans to start to segment and understand our customer base.  That is the true way of really understanding what customers need.</p><p>The Senator asked what we can do.  He asked whether we can do TV licences and INTREO services and the answer is "Yes".  We can do everything and we want to provide these services.  We are knocking on the Government's door, asking to be given more.  If this committee can use its influence in that regard, we would be delighted.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for that suggestion.  The Senator also spoke about the age profile in the context of broadband.  Even though we are moving into a technology-driven world where everything is touch point, if there is one thing we have realised during the pandemic it is that people love people.  People love dealing with people.  They want to talk to other people and that is especially true of Irish people.  Even though we are moving forward with technology, there is always a need for the human touch.  I want my daughters to be attracted to An Post and to want to go there for their services.  That is my barometer.  In fairness to Ms Debbie Byrne and what she has done to our retail side, she has come up with some really innovative products.  I urge people to go on to our website and look at our green loan facility.  I hope people are thinking of retrofitting their homes and if so, An Post is there to provide the service in that space.</p></speech>

I am glad I know about it now but An Post may have a job to do in terms of making others aware of it.  As I said, An Post is a really strong and trusted brand.  People might be wary of companies offering retrofitting loans but would be much more comfortable with loans that are guaranteed and resourced by An Post.</p></speech>

We cannot know everything.  An Post has a target to provide 30,000 customers with green hub loans by 2030.  Hopefully we will stretch that target further but we have put specific key performance indicators in place for ourselves as an organisation.  This is in the national interest.  Retrofitting is very topical.  Loans are also available for electric vehicles.</p> <p>  I will get a list for the Senator very soon.</p></speech>

The cards that An Post gave out during the pandemic allowing people to write to others for free went down really well with people generally but particularly with older people.  They missed that human connection, when they were not able to see their grandchildren in person and so on and the card was a really nice touch.  It was very well done and I commend whoever thought of it.  I wish Ms Bolger the best and encourage her to engage with all committee members.  As she said, An Post is a State company, it is our company and we all want it to do well.</p></speech>

I join with colleagues in commending the work of An Post staff, including our postmasters, during the pandemic.  They were absolutely wonderful.</p> <p>  Ms Bolger has served on the board of An Post since 2017 and I am happy to support her nomination as chairman today.  The CEO, Mr. McRedmond, commented earlier this week on the EU custom rules, which he described as anti-postal.  I ask Ms Bolger to expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.1413" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carol Bolger" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021112400002#R00900"><p>Mr. McRedmond was interviewed on "Today with Claire Byrne" yesterday and he said that what is happening is maddening and is anti-postal.  The customs rules have been in operation in Ireland since July, although they will not be mandatory until the end of next year.  We have adopted them in Ireland and our customs service has taken them on board.  This means that customs duties are payable on items coming in from non-EU countries and obviously, with the UK in that category now, this is causing a lot of angst for customers.  Mr. McRedmond argued that the rules are anti-postal because they require small consumers to take action that they do not know they must take.  People are supposed to use new forms but they are not aware of them.  When they put something through the Royal Mail, they do not realise they need to do something else and ultimately, the parcel does not get to its destination.  That is the problem, put simply.</p> <p>  Our CEO would be able to articulate this much better than me but in its simplest form, the rules have changed.  I would stress that around 90% of parcels are getting through because the big e-tailers are aware of the rules.  We have worked with them but it is impossible for us to work with everybody who might send a small parcel through the post.  We cannot communicate with every grandmother sending a parcel to a grandson or every aunt sending one to a nephew or niece.  We are doing our very best, along with Royal Mail, but it is messy, complex and hugely frustrating.  It is taking up a lot of time in An Post which is costing us money.  It will resolve itself over time and certainly by the end of 2022 but at the moment, we are caught in the middle.  We are doing everything we can to ease the burden on customers but the duty is payable.  As Mr. McRedmond said, it is the law and we must collect the duty.  We are not, as an organisation, going to break the law but unfortunately, it is causing a lot of angst for customers and for some Irish consumers.</p></speech>

He also spoke about the price of stamps potentially increasing again next year.  I understand the difficulties around transport inflation.  I also accept that there is a need to invest in good infrastructure and in that context, I commend An Post on the roll-out of electronic vehicles in Cork recently.  It is brilliant to see an emissions-free delivery service.  I am concerned about the potential increase in the price of stamps and ask Ms Bolger to elaborate on that before I move on to a question on the post office network.</p></speech>

If we stand back from this, at the end of the day An Post must be a viable business.  Like all other businesses, our costs are increasing.  Mr. McRedmond referred to transport inflation of 13% and to a 300% increase in the cost of flights.  We have to take those costs on board.  We do not want to increase our prices and would prefer it if we did not have to do so.  However, in order for the business to be viable and for An Post as a company, which is 200 years in existence, to continue for hundreds more years we have to balance the books.  Unfortunately, pricing is one of the levers that we have to utilise.  That said, if one compares An Post to its peer organisations globally, we are very competitively priced in terms of our fees and charges.  We make all of these decisions very carefully and we sense check with the market.  To be honest, we feel we give good value.</p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond mentioned the &euro;3.50 handling charge which is to cover the additional costs incurred in handling the problematic parcels.  If parcels come in and we cannot deliver them, which is what we are passionate about doing, we have warehousing costs and handling expenses we must meet.  He mentioned a figure of &euro;6 million to &euro;8 million for this year for those additional costs.  In terms of good governance and good business, we have to accept that price increases are sometimes inevitable.  That said, it is not our first port of call.  We want to become a much more efficient organisation and one of our strategic objectives is to keep working on our efficiencies.</p></speech>

This committee has done some work on this issue previously.  Senator Carrigy in particular has done a lot of work in this area and has championed the cause of post offices and postmasters.  What is Ms Bolger's rallying call to the postmasters and post offices around the country?</p></speech>

We have reviewed their contracts and new contracts are now in place.  The pandemic took the wind out of the sails of postmasters because footfall dropped significantly.  We have supported them this year and that will continue into next year.  My rallying call is actually to the Government to enable us to deliver more services.  The postmasters are chomping at the bit to serve their customers.  They want to do more and if we can give them more products and services, particularly government services, they will be more viable.</p></speech>

Our CEO would be much closer to this than me but I know it has been a source of frustration for us.  I accept that the Government is very busy and there is a lot going on but we believe we can do more.  We really do believe that.  A previous speaker mentioned things like licences.  I have a colleague who is currently trying to get a licence and if that could be done through the post office, it would be much quicker.  There is a lot we can do.  We want to speak to the Government about services it currently undertakes or may undertake in the future.</p><p>There is a harp above An Post's door for a reason.  We want to provide Government services and we feel we can do more. </p><p> The sky is the limit.  Can we help more with the HSE?  I am not sure.  Maybe there is much more we could do but I will commit to getting a list as promised after the meeting. </p></speech>

We saw what happened with the banks leaving rural Ireland.  In many places the post office has also left because you cannot get postmasters to come in and replace outgoing or retiring postmasters.  That is something we need to have a real conversation about.  I thank Ms Bolger and her staff.</p> <p>  I have another meeting that I must go to at 4.30 p.m. so I thank Ms Bolger and Mr. Laverty for being here and wish them well.</p> <p>  We need to have a conversation about our post office network infrastructure, particularly in rural Ireland.  We have a society that is migrating more online.  It worries me when I see people talk about Black Friday and deals online.  It is a contradiction given that An Post is delivering parcels but we should support local.  I see our post offices as being that local entity.   </p></speech>

We have good interaction with its team.  I thank Mr. Angus Laverty in particular for the work he has done.  He has always been entirely accessible.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  Some of the difficulties that have arisen since July relating to customs since Brexit were mentioned.  Some smaller operators did not have the wherewithal to get their acts together.  I understand there has been interaction with Royal Mail but I believe that some difficulty arose because the filtering system was not working in Britain.  Packages would land, be sent to Ireland and it was at that stage a mistake would be discovered.  An Post had a huge amount of work to do on warehousing and that clogged up the flow of packages where there were no problems.  Where are we with this now?  There was talk that there would be a Santa Claus supply chain problem.  Are we there or are we beyond that? </p></speech>

It is very much an issue for the smaller retailers and consumers.  It is a current problem and I think that we have to accept that.  We are working to our utmost with Royal Mail to resolve the issue.  The other challenge in the UK is that the Royal Mail and Post Office are two separate businesses.  Royal Mail is a listed company.  Even that entity is not like ourselves.  All I can say is that we are doing our absolute best.  Resolving this is the one thing that is exercising the leadership team's agenda at the moment.  We are doing everything we can but the ultimate fix is not within our gift.  We must collect the duties and unless these parcels and packages arrive in the right format, we have that challenge.  I want to leave here today having let the committee know that we are serious about this issue.  We are passionate about trying to resolve it.  It is breaking our heart as an organisation that we are having complaints from people because it is not the way that we operate or want to operate but it is a very complex problem.  We believe that in time it will resolve itself but at the moment it is a big issue.</p></speech>

Are we still talking about a situation where warehouses are full and this is delaying other packages coming through?  Is it as bad as it was a couple of months ago?  Is it worse?  Where are we at in resolving that?</p> <p>  What interaction has An Post had with Customs and Revenue here in relation to any possible fixes or mitigations?  </p></speech>

As a board member, I have not been involved in those discussions myself.  I know that our CEO is and is doing everything he can to resolve the issue.  I have not had the latest information on warehousing.  I did not get any reports of a problem around warehousing but I will investigate that and respond to the committee.  I can give an update on the situation.  We would get updates if there was anything serious and I have no updates on any backlogs at the moment.</p></speech>

I was hoping this would be an opportunity to get a complete update on where we are now and how serious the situation is now compared to a month or two ago.  If Ms Bolger could come back with that information, it would be vital.  It is something that the committee needs to tease out.  If something needs to happen at our end, we need to make sure that we have the conversation.</p> <p>  I refer to An Post's business model.  At one stage it was the delivery provider for Amazon which provided it with a huge amount of work.  It is still doing that for Amazon in harder to reach rural areas but that probably does not provide the same revenue.  Amazon has taken over its delivery in many urban areas.   How will that impact on An Post's business model in future?</p> <p>  There are complaints at the other end of the spectrum.  Small online operators here would say that Amazon and other large operators get a really good deal from An Post which they feel they do not.  Those are two separate questions relating to companies at either end.  </p></speech>

Our model is very different in how we operate, with elements such as the way we engage with and employ our staff, and decent work.  It is a competitive business.  Our business model factors that in.  We factor for growth and for changes.  Who would have ever thought that we would have this pandemic?  We have had to pivot the organisation and thankfully we have survived.  Similarly, with the likes of Amazon, who knows what might be coming down the tracks?  Our challenge as a board and leadership team is to try to look around corners and see what is coming and make sure we keep the organisation fit for purpose.  People will always have a challenge on pricing.  We pride ourselves on our ability to deliver to 2.2 million addresses in Ireland every day, right across the nation.  That is one of our strong points.  Not every delivery company can do that but we can.  We will go to the Blasket Islands or whereever we need to go.  Sometimes I feel that we do not compare like with like when we look at organisations like Amazon.  For our business model we look at all factors that might come into play for the future of this industry which is ever changing and very dynamic.  Even on that, what happened in 2020 accelerated parcel deliveries by about ten years.  We achieved a level that we did not think would happen so quickly.  It is ever changing.</p> <p>  We have seen a change recently with things improving slightly and retailers reopening so there was a drop in parcels.  That is increasing again now for Christmas.  We are learning all the time and building our business model around those kinds of models and natural things that happen.   </p></speech>

I welcome Ms Bolger and I wish her well in her new role.  It is important to first put on the record that I am a postmaster in Longford.  I am well aware of the situation.  As pointed out by Ms Bolger, the An Post network is a jewel in the nation's crown.  Somebody else mentioned that it is our national company and that, as in the case of Aer Lingus, we should take pride in it.  An Post needs to be supported and maintained.  A recent Grant Thornton report included a modelling exercise on the value of the network to the country based on a report done in the UK.  It put the value of the network to the country at &euro;500 million, which is a significant amount.  It is imperative that Government supports An Post.</p> <p>  We are in a very difficult period.  The pandemic payment put in place by An Post runs until 31 December 2022 but the reality is there has been a significant reduction in wages for a large number of postmasters.  Many of them will, I believe, decide to leave on the basis of gratuity payments etc.  It will be extremely difficult to get other people to fill those positions and this may lead to significant closures in about 18 months' time.  There was mention of the type of services that Government should provide.  I refer to the recent issue with regard to the delays in respect of passport applications, which we are now dealing with daily.  Under the Passport Express service, one can wait up to two months to get a passport.  That is wrong.  We have seen figures in regard to the significant number of applications made online in respect of which issues arose with regard to documentation.  The postmaster goes through an application to make sure it is correct and so such applications should be dealt with and prioritised in the same way as applications made in other ways.  Motor tax is a no-brainer in terms of roll-out across the post office network.  When the tender for the driving licence service was issued a number of years back, An Post could not tender for it even though it has a network of offices across the country.  The decision was made to set up approximately 60 new offices throughout the country to which people now have to travel 40 or 50 miles to complete the paperwork to apply for a driving licence.  They are only a small number of the services that Government can provide. </p> <p>   The bedrock of An Post service provision is social protection payments.  As I understand it, there has been a 12% decline in welfare payments by An Post and that is continuing on a downward spiral.  Social protection payments are the foundation of the network.  We will be in a very difficult situation in a very short period if that trend continues.  Throughout Covid, the Department of Social Protection officials were contacting people and asking them to move their payments from the post office to the bank.  That has to be called out.  </p></speech>

We want to do more.  We are trying to develop products and services that people want from post offices.  As mentioned yesterday on "Today with Claire Byrne" we do not want to be "me too"; we want to have innovation around our products such that they will be products that will attract people into the post offices.  We need to be much more innovative about how we get people in and how we ensure transactions are profitable for postmasters as well.  The Senator mentioned the reduction in welfare benefits, which is huge.  The post offices also suffered losses last year in regard to foreign exchange because of the pandemic.  It has been a very difficult year for postmasters.  I understand that.</p> <p>  We need to put on our thinking caps and to go through the list of services that could be provided by post offices, some of which the Senator listed.  We are chomping at the bit to provide those services.  Today, maybe, is a catalyst for us as an organisation in that through our engagement with Government through this committee we will open a door.  We will do everything we can to support the postmasters to have a broader suite of products and services that they can sell.  </p> <p>  Co-location has been a positive for us as well.  Senator Carrigy mentioned that where postmasters have retired it has been difficult to replace them.  That is a challenge that we and postmasters are faced with.  Approximately 67% of our contract offices are co-located.  That is a model that will serve us well into the future.  We continue to explore that.  I thank the Senator for his contributions.</p></speech>

I accept that throughout Covid it was safer for them to be paid into bank accounts.  The reality is banks are closing.  I understand AIB is to close more of its branches.  Where these payments are paid into the banks rather than through the post office network a significant amount of money is being lost to the Exchequer.  The latter requires people to turn up every week to sign for their payment and this ensures that only the person who is entitled to the payment gets it and, therefore, there is less fraud.</p></speech>

That needs to be looked at by the Department of Social Protection.  I understand that in 2019-2020, unclaimed payments amounted to &euro;60 million.  If one takes out of that payments that were stopped, in the region of &euro;30 million would have been refunded by An Post to the Department.  However, once that money went into the bank accounts it was gone.  We need to look at that bigger picture.</p></speech>

All of us have a great pride in An Post.  That is to be seen when people, including politicians, rally together when a post office is to be closed owing to lack of footfall.  There is always a great regret when that happens.  Throughout Covid, the staff of An post and our postmen and post women have been a credit to the organisation.  Their communication with people, in particular older people and people with disabilities, has been extraordinary.  Like many politicians, I deal with a lot of older people and people with disabilities and that was the message often relayed to me in regard to An Post.  I have a brother who is a postman.  I know from him of all of the extra work being done by our postmen and post women.  The men and women of An post who knocked on doors and engaged with people throughout Covid deserve every good thing we can say about them.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for Ms Bolger.  She may not have answers to all them now and, if so, that is fine.  Before doing so, I ask Ms Bolger to put on her Santa Claus hat.  I love letter writing.  Three or four years ago when I was a Deputy I launched a campaign to encourage people to send a Christmas card by post.  One of the asks at the time was that An Post would reduce the price of a stamp for Christmas.  I do not think I am going to win on this one, but it would be a great if An Post, to encourage people to buy a card and stamp, reduced the price of the stamp to &euro;1.  It is just a thought but it would be a lovely-----</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Bolger's point.  On the promotion of post offices, have the witnesses ever gone onto university campuses, spoken to young people and encouraged them to become part of An Post business or sell its business?</p><p>There could be small units on campuses.  A lot of young people might buy into that.  People tend to assume technology does everything these days and that we should not even bother trying to sell something.  I am a great believer in getting among people and telling them what a business offers.  I ask An Post to consider, on a temporary or pilot basis, putting temporary post offices on campuses.  It might be worth doing.</p><p> Are any post offices being opened nowadays?  We all hear about the closures, but is any being opened?  I do not want to go back and forth, but I have another question.  I agree with Senator Carrigy regarding social welfare payments.  They are vital to the survival of post offices, in particular in many rural areas.  Ms Bolger may not have this information, but has the workforce reduced or increased in recent years?</p></speech>

On Christmas cards, I hope everybody posts plenty of them this year because we need a bumper Christmas.  The idea of post offices on campuses is something we can explore.  I do not know if we have looked into it.  I could be wrong, but I could definitely look into that.  When I was in the bank we regularly went on to campuses and talked to people.  It is a great idea.</p> <p>  I cannot answer the question on whether we have opened post offices.  I do not believe we have.  We have revamped post offices, including St. Andrew's Street, Merrion Row and Castleknock, which is my locality.  There has been huge investment in revamping.  One of the challenges is getting postmasters to operate new post offices.  What was the final question?</p></speech>

Our complement is around 9,700, of whom 1,000 are casual staff.  When we set out our strategy in 2017, the objective was to have a more efficient organisation and a right sizing of the organisation.  Given the pandemic, we have to move our staff towards becoming involved in parcels.  There has not been a significant change in numbers.  There is always natural attrition and reductions taking place.  We have far fewer staff than we had years ago, but it is something we keep our focus on.  Efficiency is what we want to talk about all of the time.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

I have a few brief questions.  I wish Ms Bolger well in her new role.  In a former life, I was a self-employed chartered accountant.  I dealt with many people who were setting up a business.  If they came to me, we looked for core things in any town and village, namely a national school, a church, a bank and a post office.  If there was a post office in a town or village we knew there was activity in that town or village which was a key part of infrastructure within any town or village.</p> <p>  Broadband and telecoms companies all want to set up networks.  Not too long ago there were railways in every square inch of Ireland.  For whatever reason, many were disbanded and houses were built instead.  We now want to rebuild our railways.  I ask that everything is done to maintain and use the An Post network.  It brings links to communities.  There is a review under way.  Ms Bolger is the chair of a board.  What can be done to enhance the services and ensure that An Post keeps its network?  Once a network goes, it is very difficult to bring it back.  Ms Bolger might comment on that, and the priorities for An Post.  </p> <p>  It is about ensuring that we do not throw out the baby with the bath water.  Myriad areas are affected when a network goes.  We are now considering establishing rail links the length and breadth of Ireland.  In many cases, we may have to purchase land where tracks were previously laid but which are now in private ownership.  Ms Bolger might give her perspective on that.  I represent Limerick City.  Postmasters are extremely worried at the moment.  They are apprehensive.  They provide a vital service.  Ms Bolger might give me her overall thoughts on their future.</p></speech>

I agree with him.  It behoves us to keep a vibrant network.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance launched the terms of reference for a banking review.  When I read it last night I was struck by whether that would involve a role for An Post.  We do not have a banking licence, but we have significant financial services activity.  Much of that is done through postmasters.  I would be interested in seeing what comes from that because the answer is providing more products and services through our post offices.  We have to be viable.  Sustainability is the other word I will bring into that conversation.  If we can provide more services and they can be viable we would all be happy.</p></speech>

They are already playing a role in that they provide banking services.  We should consider an enhanced role.  Having enhanced services would enable An Post to retain and deliver its core services as well.</p></speech>

With the dislocation in banking and Ulster Bank and KBC pulling out of Ireland, we will be left with a lot of issues in rural Ireland.  If we can step in in some way within our remit and all of the things we do, we would be very happy to support that.  It is something that would be on our agenda.</p></speech>

It was pointed out to me previously that if one is talking about new services from the State, if anything requires tendering An Post would fail unless the tendering process was changed to a degree that would take into account the social and community work of post offices, to paraphrase what was said.  Could Ms Bolger comment on that?</p> <p>  We will need a further interaction to get an update on the proposals and where we perceive changes can be made, whether that involves financial or Government services.  The ongoing Government review of the future of the postal service is also relevant.  If we cannot supply new services and the post office network does not provide a business model that works, we are into a PSO.  We all accept the necessity of keeping the post office network up and running.</p></speech>

We have to tender for the TV licence renewal.  As with any tender, we may not always win.  We have very high standards in our tendering and have policy on it.  Sustainability comes into our tendering.  It is a level playing field when it comes to tendering.  I am not saying it should not be, but when it comes to Government services there should be a special place for An Post in terms of being able to deliver many of the services that our citizens and communities require.</p></speech>

I totally support fair tendering but I think we have unique circumstances when it comes to Government services and the way we can deliver these services to our communities, given the national reach we have.  We have over 900 postmasters and we have 45 post offices that are An Post-operated, so we have a strong distribution channel and network within the country, which means we are ideally placed to provide those services.</p></speech>

I thank members for their work and the excellent interim report they have produced.  I look forward to the publication of the final report later this year.</p> <p>  I thank the various witnesses who have shared their perspectives with the committee.  The committee provides an important platform for voices from across politics, business, community groups and civil society.  Continued engagement from across these spheres illustrates just how relevant and important the outworking of Brexit remains for all of us.</p> <p>  Almost 12 months ago, we welcomed the finalisation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  This was the final element in a sequence of agreements negotiated to allow the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU and underpin the framework for future relations.  Since then, the work of the joint implementation bodies under the agreement has begun.  In June, we saw the first meeting of the partnership council of the TCA and its subsidiary bodies continue to meet, including, for example, the trade partnership committee which met on 15 November.</p> <p>  The TCA, like the withdrawal agreement, was jointly agreed by the EU and the UK.  Through its joint implementation, we want to maximise the opportunities presented by the TCA.  We want to see the future relationship with the UK develop positively.  To achieve this the parties must work together in a spirit of partnership and trust.  When trust is compromised, progress is threatened.  The recent UK approach to the protocol has, unfortunately, called that trust into question.  I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum towards agreeing a constructive way forward through compromise and partnership on the protocol.</p> <p>  The EU has an unwavering commitment to the people of Northern Ireland and the implementation of the protocol.  Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has repeatedly stated, including before this committee, that the Union's number one priority remains to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is protected, a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided and the integrity of the EU Single Market is maintained.</p> <p>  In October, following extensive engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders, from political leaders to businesses and a cross-section of civic society, the Commission published a package of proposals setting out creative and practical solutions designed to help Northern Ireland deal with the consequences of Brexit.  These non-papers cover the issues of customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, medicines, and improving engagement with Northern Irish stakeholders and authorities.  Since their publication, the EU has been in dialogue with the UK with the ambition of achieving agreed solutions that can ensure greater stability and certainty for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I remain in close and regular contact with Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and we met last week.  He remains committed to finding credible and durable solutions for the genuine concerns raised with him by people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  Last week, I also met Lord Frost and reiterated the need to engage constructively in this process, grasp the current window of opportunity and agree a deal that can address the real-world concerns of people in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I believe the remaining issues can be resolved.  However, to do so, we need to get to a much more positive, stable and trusting EU-UK relationship.  We have some way to go to get there.  I assure the House that the Government will not stop doing all it can to help develop, support and sustain such a relationship in the interests of all of the people on this island.  I look forward to members' questions and comments. </p></speech>

I listened to it in my room due to the Covid regulations.  The whole issue of Brexit and where we will go and how we will move forward in the next few months is important.  How will this affect the agricultural community, in particular?  I mention the origin of Irish products and how Irish products could be affected by any disruption of trade.  Some 40% of the North's milk comes South to be processed.  How will that be looked at in the long term regarding the Brexit negotiations?  It is a significant issue for an industry that is worth &euro;19 billion to the economy.  That would be the all-Ireland milk processing potential we have.  It is one of the major drivers in the economy.  How will we work with the companies involved in cross-Border activity regarding the processing of milk products?  How can that be looked at going forward and how will that be affected?</p> <p>  Can the Minister update us on how the ports have handled themselves over the last six months, including on tariffs and the implications of and the work that is required to get through the port network?  A significant amount of product now goes directly to the Continent, which is a step forward, but there is still a major proportion using the land bridge through the UK.  Where is that process at the moment?  What are the failings and positives regarding how we could appropriately manage those issues?</p> <p>  The last issue has to do with cross-Border healthcare and how it could be, or is, affected by Brexit.  There is an issue regarding the cross-Border directive that allows for patients to go to a European Union country and this has been slightly changed regarding Northern Ireland and how that fits in.  There was a temporary situation put in place last year for it.  Can the Minister update us on where that issue will go?  It is a significant issue for many people, particularly in the northern half of Ireland but even in my own constituency as well, who would avail of the scheme.  How will that scheme work its way through the system so we can have an appropriate scheme where people can get cross-Border healthcare?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.1484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021112400002#D00500"><p>Let me start in reverse.  First of all, it is welcome that the Northern Ireland planned healthcare scheme and transition cross-Border directive arrangements have been successfully in operation since 1 January.  Both these measures continue to ensure that patients have access to healthcare in Northern Ireland and, in limited circumstances, the UK.  While the scheme has been operating on an administrative basis to date, the Government intends to place the scheme on a statutory basis.  An extensive examination of options to inform the drafting of the general scheme is currently being undertaken by officials in the Department of Health, and that work continues at pace.  Effectively, there has been an <i>ad hoc</i>arrangement in place since 1 January, but we will put that on a statutory footing and the Department of Health is looking to finalise how to do that.</p><p>On ports, it might be good to put a number of things on the record.  Initial difficulties in adjusting to the new trading environment have largely settled.  The vast majority of goods movements are now green-routed, which means they are not checked at all and are permitted to leave the port without any interaction with customs or the other regulatory authorities.  Well over 80% of goods are green-routed now.  Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and the HSE Environmental Health Service are actively working together to streamline processes and reduce the administrative burden for traders as much as they can, while continuing to meet our obligations under EU law.  Work is under way to improve inter-agency communication, increase data sharing and reduce duplication and to streamline processes as much as possible while ensuring that the necessary controls are performed.</p><p>The committee raised the issue in its interim report, in that it wanted State agencies to effectively be in one location in ports.  To be fair, they are trying to do as much of that as they can.  There have been a number of developments since the start of the year and further developments are intended to address the key requests of traders.  For example, a key request from trade was to provide an interface that allowed system-to-system communications between traders, customs systems, and the Revenue RoRo system.  This has been delivered and has removed some of the manual work involved in completing the pre-boarding notification.  There are limits to what can be done in terms of co-location of authorities at ports.  At Dublin Port, for example, there are space and layout limitations.  In addition, certain checks such as animal health checks or food safety checks may require dedicated infrastructure to ensure that such checks can be safely undertaken, like stables in Dublin Port, for example.  That said, the agencies continue to work together to identify ways in which the passage of trucks through Dublin Port, in particular, can be streamlined.Since the start of the year we have seen a very significant increase in the traffic from Dublin and Rosslare directly to mainland Europe, into France, Belgium and the Netherlands.</p><p>We have seen quite a significant reduction in the use of the land bridge, but also quite an increase in UK-Northern Ireland trade, with product coming in through Larne and Belfast.  A significant amount of Northern Ireland product would previously have come through Dublin.  Approximately 40% of product coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain would have come through Dublin Port, and some of that has now been diverted directly into Larne and Belfast.<br/><br/>There has been a dramatic shift to direct ferry routes.  There are about 36 direct ferry routes a week now.  That figure would have been less than a dozen this time last year, so it happened in the space of a short period of time.  We had conversations about whether the State needed to subsidise direct routes and our response to that was that we believed the market would respond.  If you subsidise it, you could undermine market forces in terms of the viability of that.  To be fair, the advice from the shipping companies was not to subsidise these routes.  If it makes sense to do it from a commercial perspective, it will happen anyway.  That is exactly what has happened, and it continues to grow.  If anything, we are investing in port infrastructure in mainland Europe to streamline a number of those routes.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, has visited a number of those ports in relation to the investment that is taking place.  The port infrastructure story is a positive one.  While there much focus in Northern Ireland on the problems in terms of checks and goods coming in from Great Britain, the ports in the South have just got on with making the changes and trying to make it work, and some of the supply chains have changed accordingly.<br/><br/>In terms of an update on agriculture and on Brexit in general, having a trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, in place is hugely important for agriculture.  A big part of our agricultural trade is with Britain, but a big part of Britain's food trade comes to Ireland as well.  It is an &euro;8 billion trading relationship back and forth across the Irish sea.  It sells much food to us.  It is not quite as much as we sell to them, but it is still a very significant figure.  Therefore, avoiding tariffs on that trade with a TCA was, and is, hugely important.<br/><br/>In terms of the protocol, anyone in the food industry in Northern Ireland, and certainly the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland, recognises the value of the protocol.  Whether you are nationalist or unionist, the capacity for seamless all-island trade in terms of the food industry is really important, and the protocol guarantees that.  However, one of the problems with that has been the country of origin rules.  What was clear through the Brexit debates was that even though the protocol effectively extends the EU Single Market for goods to Northern Ireland, <i>de facto</i>, the country of origin issues were not solved by that.  If a dairy product is produced in Northern Ireland, it is Northern Ireland product.  It is not EU origin.  Even though it is produced to EU standards and it is produced within the EU Single Market, it is not EU origin.  This has allowed that product to be sold into the EU Single Market seamlessly.  However, if the product is going to take advantage of EU trade agreements with other parts of the world, because it is not origin EU but origin UK, that creates a difficulty.  <br/><br/>I have been raising this issue for three years.  We wanted to try to get it resolved in the Brexit negotiations but it was not possible to do that.  There was not a big ask from the UK Government to solve this issue.  Many dairy processors, such as Lakeland Dairies, source a significant portion of their raw material from farmers in Northern Ireland.  That is really important for Northern Ireland agriculture.  I would like to see a situation where the EU works to accommodate Northern Ireland produced product in future trade agreements and to look at whether it is possible to amend existing trade agreements to facilitate Northern Ireland product being considered as EU product of origin, because it is EU standard.  Therefore, if we are going to have Northern Ireland as part of an extended EU Single Market for goods, then one of the upsides of that is to benefit from EU trade agreements in terms of origin.  We have to find a way of doing that that does not undermine the UK origin as well, in terms of potential future UK trade agreements for product produced in Northern Ireland.  That is tricky and it has not been solved yet.<br/><br/>The truth is that it has not been that disruptive to the dairy industry.  Dairy prices are strong at the moment.  Senator Lombard and other dairy farmers will know that.  That has not been a big issue yet because there has been a strong demand for dairy products across the EU Single Market.  This will only become an issue if you are relying on that product, or mixed pools from North and South, being sold under EU trade agreements to other parts of the world.  Companies have managed that in a clever enough way so far, and it certainly has not undermined price or market access so far.  However, it is something that the dairy industry would like to have resolved.  It is not just dairy; it is other product as well, including beef, sheep meat, poultry product or whatever.  We import a lot of poultry product across the Border from Moy Park and others.<br/><br/>It would be useful if we could facilitate a sort of dual labelling, if you like.  If a product is produced to EU standards, it should, therefore, be seen as part of the EU system, but of course it is UK product and should, therefore, be facilitated as UK product in the future as well.  That is a tricky issue that is not resolved yet.  If we can get the protocol settled in terms of its implementation on the basics through the negotiations between the &Scaron;efovi and Frost teams, then hopefully, through partnership, we might be able to find ways of dealing with that country of origin issue over time.  Luckily, for now, dairy prices are strong so the industry has managed to cope with that country of origin issue, from what I have heard.  It is not an anomaly; it is a real issue.  This could be problematic if there were an oversupply of dairy product in the EU and people were looking to rely much more on access through trade agreements and so on.  Those are the long answers to three short questions. </p></speech>

I understand you were discussing the House of Lords letter before I arrived.  It raises some very interesting questions about pharmaceuticals, medicines, licensing and the like.  Are we running into any difficulties with British medicines imports in the Republic?  Is it causing any difficulty at our ports and for our health system?  Boots operates in the South as well as the North.</p><p>Is it suffering difficulties?  Are we aware of that and has any of that come to our attention?  It cannot be only a Northern problem.  We must be having some problems too, certainly in relation to over-the-counter products.  Many of them used to be made in Britain, and a lot of British products are available in Ireland.  On pharmaceutical and quasi-pharmaceutical products, there are chains like Boots functioning in both jurisdictions.  Are we suffering problems that are different from those being encountered in Northern Ireland?  Would the outcome of the current negotiations, including the possibility of arriving at some middle-ground solution, have any implications for us in this State?</p></speech>

Certainly, there is a fear that certain drugs may not be able to get into Northern Ireland because they are certified in Great Britain and that certification would not be recognised by the EU, and therefore that product coming into the EU Single Market for goods would be problematic because it is not certified by the EU.  Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has committed to a proposal that would resolve that issue.  In fact, it very much mirrors a UK paper that was presented to the Commission in March, and that is effectively the basis for the solution the EU wants to provide.  It will effectively change EU law to recognise UK certification for Northern Ireland, therefore guaranteeing a seamless supply of medicines into Northern Ireland.  There has been much talk about that.</p> <p>  My understanding is that as of yet there has not been a significant shortage of medicines in Northern Ireland, but that was a fear that could develop.  This was a big fear about a year out from when Brexit was likely to take effect.  There was quite a lot of discussion with the pharmaceutical industry on this issue.  It was not just about human medicines, but it was about veterinary and animal medicines as well.  To date, there has not been a shortage.  I have yet to see empty shelves in any Boots stores.  There is one across from my office in Carrigaline, in my constituency.  This has not been an issue.</p> <p>  The solution the EU is putting together is a solution for Northern Ireland, not for the EU as a whole.  What we are seeing is the industry responding by altering its supply chains.  There may be some changes in some brands and the use of generic drugs in terms of certain types of drugs and so on, but I am not aware of any concern or panic in the industry that this will lead to a shortage of drugs here.  It has had quite a long lead in time to be able to change supply chains and to ensure EU certification.  I will ask Mr. Karl Gardner to comment on that, but that is my understanding.</p></speech>

Is there any difficulty for Irish pharmaceutical manufacturers selling into the UK market?  This should be considered at the same time if we are going to have a common branding for Northern Ireland.  There is a possible risk that people might transpose their manufacture to Northern Ireland to avail of the best of both worlds.</p></speech>

If you take my constituency, for example, which probably has the second largest cluster of pharmaceuticals in the EU, all the big brands are there and nearly all of those companies have a big footprint in the UK as well.  The manufacturing systems effectively relied on Ireland and the UK seamlessly interacting on ingredients, packaging and research and development programmes and so on.  Some of that was restructured recognising the likely outcome of Brexit and ensuring that products being produced for the EU market were being finished in the EU.  Every company is different, but that is my understanding of what many of them have done.</p> <p>  I am not aware that the UK is looking to ban EU certified medicines coming into the UK.  However, the reverse is not the same.  Within the EU, because of its size and scale, it essentially does not recognise approval bodies from third countries.  I would be very surprised if the UK were to reciprocate and only to be able to access medicines that are certified in the UK.  Maybe I will ask Mr. Gardner to come in to make sure what I said is accurate.</p></speech>

One area we are working with the Commission on is to ensure continued market access to what they call the small member states of Cyprus, Malta and Ireland and which are English speaking small member states.  It does not want any fallout from any impact the hubbing and the warehousing of products would have in the UK.  As we saw with a number of issues, goods are brought in and dealt with in the UK and then are redistributed.  That is an area we are working with the Commission on and it is well aware of it and it is in train.</p></speech>

That redistribution centre covered the UK and Ireland.  They were not even re-boxed; they were just redistributed from the UK.  They then became stateless in terms of origin because they came from the UK into Ireland.</p></speech>

They could not be treated as UK product because they originated in EU.  Those redistribution centres have had to change their systems quite fundamentally.  Many retailers in Ireland now access directly through hubs in France, the Netherlands, Germany and so on.  However, it is not as easy to do that for medicines.  It is not like a box of corn flakes.</p></speech>

There are many more upsides than downsides to the protocol.  All of the political focus has been on the negative, in terms of the number of checks required, the limitations and the chilled meat issue, which became sort of an identity issue of British sausages coming into Northern Ireland.  More and more people are starting to look the positives.  When you speak to business leaders, they are very clear on two things.  First, they think the protocol needs to stay, but we have got to make it work a bit better and, second, they do not want Article 16 triggered because they think that is going to have a knock-on consequence in terms of the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  The ask that I get from Northern Ireland, apart from some unionist political leaders, but certainly from business leaders, is that the protocol is not perfect, but let us make it work as best we can, and let us start talking about the upside, because there is very significant upside.  Northern Ireland has this unique opportunity to access a very large UK single market and also the much larger EU Single Market.</p><p>If you ask anyone in the agrifood sector, in particular, and many other manufacturers in Northern Ireland, the protocol for them is very exciting in terms of business opportunity.  As Senator McDowell said, there is potentially a pull factor into Northern Ireland in terms of foreign direct investment.  If the protocol is stable and predictable, you could access both markets very efficiently from Northern Ireland.  You might have some country of origin labelling issues, but if your target market is the EU Single Market and-or the UK as a single market, you have a very attractive opportunity for seamless trade into both, which you do not have south of the Border.  </p></speech>

It seems that <i>a priori </i>it is not a huge advantage if you are thinking of making a big investment and the whole thing could be radically different.</p></speech>

One of the asks of the British side was that the protocol should and could never be imposed on Northern Ireland against the will of the majority there.  That is something I absolutely agree with.  As much as I think the protocol can work, if the majority of people in Northern Ireland do not want it, we have to accept that.  The are extraordinary consequences if we do away with the protocol.  It raises all sorts of questions around the all-Ireland economy and a whole range of other things. However, there needs to be a democratic endorsement of what is effectively an international agreement.</p></speech>

If there is a large majority of more than two thirds, then the next vote can be put off for eight years.  My hope would be, and this may be naive, is that if we can get compromise and flexibility in a way that allows business and many in the unionist community to accept the protocol, then we could get to the point where there is a very strong endorsement of it and then it does not need to come up again for eight years.  Although for now, it is every four years.</p> <p>  While of course you would like cross-community support, you could credibly have a situation where a minority of people in Northern Ireland could do away with the protocol when a majority of people want it.  Cross-community support is part of the Good Friday Agreement on issues that are devolved to the Executive and the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  Cross-community support is not part of decisions for the UK Government, in terms of international decisions.  The principle of consent is about what the majority want and cross-community support is a separate and important issue in Northern Ireland.  The protocol issues relate to a British Government agreed international agreement, and therefore it would be a very perverse approach to say that because of the need for cross-community support, you could have a minority of people deciding the future of the protocol against a majority.  That does not mean we should not look for cross-community support; of course we should.  That is why, despite the fact that many in the unionist community think that I have been very unreasonable in relation to the protocol, its construct and so on, we are probably the strongest advocates for flexibility and compromise on the EU side to try to respond to the legitimate concerns that many have raised.  </p> <p>  We should be able to significantly  reduce the checks burden on goods that we can show are staying in Northern Ireland and are at no risk of crossing the border into the EU Single Market or into the EU.  That is what we have been pushing Vice-President &Scaron;efovi on, and to be fair, he has responded.  On the food side, he thinks we can reduce sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks by 80%, as long as we can show those goods will be sold and consumed in Northern Ireland.  Likewise, on the customs side, he thinks that we can reduce the burden by 50%.  That is the space for agreement.</p> <p>  Lord Frost wants more than that.  What he is asking for is that all goods that are being sold in Northern Ireland and are staying in Northern Ireland that come from Great Britain should be exempt from any form of checks, customs declarations and so on.  That is a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver and it is not consistent with the protocol.  However, the EU can go a long way with it to reduce that checks burden significantly in what Lord Frost would describe as inter-UK trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  That is the space in which the teams are currently talking.</p></speech>

We will see if the communications are back running.  We still cannot hear him.  Senator Gallagher, if you want to send your question by the chat function, I will ask it for you.  I might ask the Minister a question while Senator Gallagher is doing that.</p> <p>  At our last meeting, we had Vice-President &Scaron;efovi before our committee and he gave us a very comprehensive update and was quite candid in his contributions.  He was questioned around the accuracy of the current proposals on reducing checks by 80%.  His remark was that we know the Single Market and the customs union.  He was quite strong in his remarks that what it has offered is good and doable.  When pressed on what might happen if there is not a resolution or if Article 16 is triggered, he said that the EU was ready to take whatever steps are needed.  A week is a long time in this process.  What is the current state of the negotiations?  Do you feel that there is a mood there to try to resolve this?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-24a.1512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2021112400002#G00700"><p>I have not received a briefing from today's discussion.  Generally what happens is the two teams meet on Wednesday and Thursday, and it is every second week in Brussels and London.  Then the two principals meet on Friday to assess progress, or not, as the case may be.  Two weeks ago, there was a noticeable change in tone coming from the British side, which certainly suggested to the EU that the negotiation was worth investing in.  Before that, the negotiations were going nowhere.  Last week was difficult, but at the same time, substantive in terms of the discussions.  The Lord Frost and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi meeting was professional and constructive.  Let us wait and see what happens this week.</p> <p>  There is no secret in this because in Lord Frost's briefing of party leaders in Northern Ireland and other stakeholders, including business leaders in Northern Ireland, he has shown much scepticism as to whether or not the &Scaron;efovi or the Commission proposals can deliver what they say they are going to deliver; that is, the 80% reductions in SPS checks on food and agrifood products coming in to Northern Ireland and staying in Northern Ireland and the 50% figure on customs checks.  I have put that directly to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and his team and they are very clear and strong on that, in that they believe they can deliver those numbers.  Not only that, but they are looking to work with the British Government to show how it can be done.  Of course, that will involve input from the British side too, in terms of the sharing of data and labelling so the EU can fully understand that there is a trusted trader system that both sides can see in a transparent way.  A company like Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, for example, has systems that can show where a product is distributed from in Great Britain.  The product comes into Northern Ireland and it will be able to show the shelf from which it has been sold.</p><p>If information like that is shared, then the EU can get much reassurance around trusting that a product is staying in, sold in and consumed in Northern Ireland, and therefore the checks burden on us should be reduced dramatically.  That involves partnership between both sides in terms of sharing information and data and potentially labelling as well.  That is what Vice-President &Scaron;efovi means when he says we can deliver this, but we need partnerships with the British Government and the British regulatory system to make it work.</p><p> I am more hopeful than I have been.  I spoke to Lord Frost last week and it was a good conversation.  He reminded me that they still regard Article 16 as a perfectly legitimate tool to use.  I do not believe Article 16 was ever designed to set aside large parts of the protocol.  It was essentially a safeguard clause in an emergency situation to make a temporary amendment, but then to return, in time, to the normal functioning of the protocol.  I do not believe that is what the British Government is suggesting it would use Article 16 for.  It is effectively suggesting that if it cannot get the compromise that it is looking for from the EU, it may act unilaterally and use Article 16 to set aside elements of the protocol that it does not believe are necessary.  If it does that, I do not believe the EU will respond well; in fact, I know it will not.  The EU will respond very robustly and it will regard it as a fairly serious breach of good faith in terms of the protocol and the Article 16 mechanism.  I am sure Vice-President &Scaron;efovi told the committee that the EU regards the withdrawal agreement and the trade and co-operation agreement ,TCA, as inextricably linked to each other.  Therefore, the EU would not even agree to start negotiating a TCA until there was a withdrawal agreement in place, backed by a treaty, that is, international law.  If the British Government decides to set aside elements of the withdrawal agreement, that is, elements of the protocol, then that has a carry-over into whether or not the EU can implement the TCA as agreed.  That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland, or in the UK, for that matter.</p><p> There is much at stake over the next few weeks, and the focus probably needs to be on what percentage of, and what elements of, checks can we effectively do without, and at the same time protect the integrity of the EU Single Market.  How do we put systems in place that can dramatically reduce the checks burden on goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we know are staying in Northern Ireland and can show and prove that?  How can both sides work together to remove that burden and make it easier for businesses to source from Great Britain in terms of their supply chains?  If we can make a lot of progress in that area, that will deal with many of the unionist concerns and many of the business concerns in Northern Ireland linked to the protocol.  The EU is in that space, but it cannot remove 100% of the checks.  That is not credible and it is not consistent with what was agreed.  However, it can certainly show a lot of flexibility, and it is willing to do that.</p><p> I will get a briefing on where we are again on Friday.  There is still quite a big gap between the two sides, if we are honest.  At least the negotiations now are focused on and are serious about trying to find landing grounds, which is a welcome change.  We should give those negotiating teams time and space and also the confidentiality of what goes on in the negotiating rooms that, hopefully, can facilitate the building of some trust.  Trust is possibly the biggest problem.</p><p> If I am frank, the EU is concerned that if it makes a concession it will be banked and Lord Frost's team will then take that and look for more.  The UK side has got to give something here, too.  It is not all about the EU giving.  If you look at what has happened since the start of the year, all of the concessions and flexibility have been moving in one direction only, and that has been a very successful negotiating strategy for Lord Frost and his team.  However, there are limits to that as to how far the EU can go if it does not believe it is moving towards an end point through negotiation.  We are pretty close to that end point now. </p></speech>

Lord Frost is a good and tough negotiator and good luck to him.  The EU also has concerns that need to be protected.  As Vice-President &Scaron;efovi said at this committee, its priorities are the integrity of the Single Market, not compromising it, protecting an all-island economy, protecting a peace process and ensuring there is no need for any physical border infrastructure to re-emerge on the island of Ireland.  That is what the protocol is there for, and it does that job.</p> <p>  What we are now trying to do is to reduce the checks burden on east-west trade only, from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, which of course is the price of the protocol.  Those are goods coming into the EU Single Market.  I think Vice-President &Scaron;efovi has gone a long way to try to respond to the asks and frustrations of people in Northern Ireland on those issues.</p> <p>  The medicines issue has a solution that involves the EU changing its laws.  The sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks burden can be reduced dramatically as indeed can the customs issue.</p> <p>  The other big question that continues to be asked by leaders in Northern Ireland is on the democratic deficit issues linked to the protocol.  This impacts on Northern Ireland, but it does not have a say in the future application of the protocol apart from through joint committee structures and so on.  Therefore, the Commission is willing to look at formalising more structures in terms of communication.  That has to be supported by the British Government as well, if it wants to do it.  That is where we are.</p></speech>

Senator Gallagher has joined us in the committee room because the technology is not working and we will take a question from him.  Senator Wall sent me a question because again the technology is not working.</p> <p>  You mentioned the word "trust" at the end of your comments, which leads on to my next question.  We have just discussed the state of the current negotiations.  What is the state of the current relationship between the Irish Government and the UK Government?  While Lord Frost's negotiating tactics might be considered to have been quite effective, they have left a sour taste in the mouths of many people in Ireland and indeed in Europe.  The consistent threat to trigger Article 16 and to undermine years of negotiation and work, to the detriment of people on this island, North and South, has been a regrettable way for the UK team to be doing business.  There is a considerable body of work there for us now to try to rebuild those relationships, because they are quite strained.  What is the level of engagement now between Ministers and their UK counterparts?  What is that relationship is currently?</p> <p>  I will read Senator Wall's questions.  You mentioned seizing momentum in your opening remarks, so what are the next steps?  What supports are in place to deal with Irish exports and UK tariffs?</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher, I invite you to ask your questions.  We will then go back to the Minister, because we are tight on time.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and thank him for taking the time out of his busy schedule to update us on where things are in relation to Brexit.  For someone from the outside looking in on all of this, it must be hugely frustrating to be dealing with this particular issue.  Following the Chair's comments, where would the Minister rate the current relationship with the British Government, on a scale of one to ten?</p><p>Perhaps he has just answered that question.  In many ways, for somebody from the outside, who does not know all the facts, looking in, it is like dealing with a spoilt child in that they keep putting the hand out for more.  When is a deal a deal?  When is a deal finally sealed?  Everyone thought this was all done and dusted, tied up legally between the two parliaments.  We thought the deal was done.  Here we are now renegotiating again.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the tactic employed by the UK has been very rewarding as far as it is concerned.  It seems to be a case that the EU negotiating team keeps on giving.  If I were part of the UK negotiating team, I would want more of the same because it seems to be paying off.  For how long will this process go on?<br/><br/>Another question relates to the positives that Northern Ireland would enjoy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the protocol, which the Minister touched on.  It puts Northern Ireland in a unique trading position whereby it can trade unencumbered and have access to the EU market, while at the same time trade within the UK and be part of any future trade agreements the UK may negotiate.  There has been some evidence of that unique position already.  There have been two major job announcements recently, one announced by Coca-Cola in regard to a large number of jobs being created in Belfast, and one by Almac in Craigavon which is creating 1,000 jobs over the coming three to five year period.  In regard to that, Craigavon is approximately half an hour to 45 minutes from Monaghan town.  As someone who comes from a Border constituency, I wonder should we be making more of those job announcements in Northern Ireland.  It is a good story to tell, not just from a Northern Ireland perspective but for those of us who live in Border counties, including my colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly.  It is not that long a journey to travel from Monaghan town, north Monaghan or even Cavan to Craigavon.  There are benefits for the Border community, if not for the island as a whole.  Should we make more hay, if you like, out of those announcements?  Should we market ourselves across the EU and across the globe, based on Northern Ireland's position, from an all-Ireland perspective?  We could benefit from that unique trading relationship Northern Ireland currently has.<br/><br/>My final point is somewhat connected.  The Minister might use his good offices to talk to the relevant people north of the Border.  In early January the minimum unit price on alcohol will come into effect.  For those who live along the Border, many retailers fear that day coming.  We are all in favour of the minimum unit price on alcohol coming in.  It has proven beneficial in Scotland in that it has had the desired effect.  It was my understanding that this issue was going to be tackled on an all-island basis.</p></speech>

There will be plenty of opportunity to do that if we can get an agreement.  I am anxious to focus on the limited but nevertheless evident progress over the past ten days or so and to try to encourage that progress even further.  It is not helpful for me to talk about how people have behaved or what they have said over the past ten months or so.  Clearly, it has put a heavy strain on relationships between the EU and the UK, between Ireland and the UK, and at times also between the UK and Washington in regard to the concerns coming from the White House and others on Capitol Hill.  However, there will be a time to discuss all that.  For now, we have a little bit of momentum in these talks and we should focus on that.  I will encourage both sides to try to make progress.</p> <p>  When I said that the British negotiating tactic has been very successful, that is true in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU, but it is not true in terms of reputation and relationships which are very important for a country the size of the UK and a country as globalised as the UK.  That is all I will say on it.</p> <p>  As for the next steps in regard to momentum, there are two very experienced and smart negotiators with very good teams supporting them.  Let us hope that they get the political instruction to do a deal, because that is what is needed here.  Negotiating teams can only do what the key decision makers, politically, allow them to do.  What is needed between now and Christmas is for the British Prime Minister to give a signal to Lord Frost that we need to try to conclude these negotiations and get the best deal available, and we need a signal from President von der Leyen to Vice-President &Scaron;efovi that he needs to do the same.  I have spent a good deal of time speaking to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  We are very lucky to have Mr. &Scaron;efovi.  He is very interested in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  He is very interested in being helpful and in solutions.  He has pushed the Commission really hard, right to the edge of the boundaries of what is legally consistent with the protocol.  That is because he wants to get a deal done.  They are very much in that space.  I hope the British side is too.  They have achieved much in this negotiation in regard to changing how the protocol is both perceived and implemented but, as Mr. &Scaron;efovi said, if they ask for the impossible, then it cannot be delivered.  That is a political choice for the Prime Minister.  I am more hopeful now than I was a fortnight ago.  Is this hugely frustrating?  Yes, of course it is.  We thought this issue was put to bed.  Do not forget, the protocol was agreed two years ago but on 17 December 2020, the British Government agreed an implementation plan for the protocol.  Michael Gove was then the key negotiator and he agreed that with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi.  The approach changed then, as January and February passed.  The personalities on the British side changed from Michael Gove being the lead negotiator to Lord Frost being the lead negotiator and, as I said, they have achieved much since then.</p><p>The EU is getting close to its horizon of what it can do.  Hopefully, that is recognised in London. </p><p> Regarding the positives for Northern Ireland, finally some people are starting to talk about that.  Instead of politicians leading the debate, industry is starting to be part of that discussion in a major way.  Some people have asked me if there is a threat that businesses and investment in the Republic may potentially go north?  I do not see that as a threat.  I would welcome a significant increase in investment in Northern Ireland.  It is good for the all-island economy and, God knows, Northern Ireland deserves it, given the pulling and dragging that Northern Ireland has had to put up with throughout the Brexit debates and so on.  I would not begrudge Northern Ireland that economic success at all.  We have a very competitive proposition for foreign direct investment south of the Border but increasingly now, there is a strong and growing proposition for foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland.  Personally I would welcome that.  It is a great opportunity.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the mechanisms and compensation for tariffs.  First, the TCA guarantees there are no tariffs, unless the TCA is called into question because the protocol gets called into question, as the two are interlinked.  It would be incredibly frustrating if, after all the negotiations, decisions and compromises to get the TCA and withdrawal agreement in place, all of that started to unravel because of a unilateral decision in London.  I hope that does not happen but if it does happen, the EU is prepared for that, I would say.  I do not want to go into that too much because, again, I do not want to focus on failure when we need to be focusing on achieving an agreement and a compromise.</p><p> On minimum unit pricing for alcohol, which does not have anything to do with the protocol or Brexit, when I say we could not get the Executive in Northern Ireland to agree, I do not think that is fully fair.  We have certainly indicated that we would like to do this on an all-island basis because we do not want people going across the Border to shop for cheap alcohol because we have introduced minimum pricing here.  We believe it is a good public health measure to ensure that alcohol is not being used as a loss-leader or being sold for half nothing and being abused as a result.  We believe that has worked in other jurisdictions and it will work here.  We would of course like Northern Ireland to do this with us at the same time but we do not have any guarantees on that and we cannot wait forever.  The Government's view on this is we would like to do this on an all-island basis if we can but, if not, we need to move ahead anyway.  We need to try to manage the cross-Border trade consequences of that as best we can.</p></speech>

This is a political decision for the Executive.  I will not overreach as I sometimes get criticised for doing that by politicians in Northern Ireland.  This is a matter for the Executive.  It is its issue.  We have signalled for some time that we want to do this, we think it is a good public health measure and we would like to do it together but it is a matter for the Executive to respond as to why it either does or does not want to do it on the same timeline as us.  Efforts to do this on an all-island basis have effectively delayed this measure for longer than it would otherwise have been delayed.  The view of the Department of Health is that while it may potentially cause some trade disruption potentially and cross-Border shopping, which would be frustrating, we still think that, on the whole, this is a public health measure we need to move ahead with.  I think it will happen.  It is a fair question and a matter I will raise with some of the political leaders in Northern Ireland whom I will meet next week.</p></speech>
