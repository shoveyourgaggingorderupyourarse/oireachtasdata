    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#B00500"><p>I would like to start by thanking the committee for giving me the opportunity to address members here today on the important role forestry policy will play in climate change mitigation.  The challenges of climate change and the global effort that is required to meet those challenges will require significant action across the whole of society.  The recently published climate action plan provides a whole-of-government approach to reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions and provides a range of actions for all areas of our economy, which includes the agriculture and the forest land use sectors.  We know the mitigation potential from agriculture is limited but the ag-climatise strategy in the Department, which is currently out for consultation, sets out an ambitious strategy for our agriculture and land use sectors.  The Government's climate action plan sets out ambitious targets for forestry, which can be broadly summarised into the following three main pillars: maintaining the existing forests through sustainable forest management; expanding the forest area through afforestation and; promoting and increasing the use of harvested wood products, including the use of energy derived from sustainably produced forest biomass.</p> <p>  The existing forest estate has grown steadily over the past 100 years to just over 770,000 ha today.  The national forest area is 11% and is at its highest level for over 350 years.</p><p>This expansion is testament to the significant efforts made by generations of foresters and landowners who have built a forest resource that is providing multiple benefits to society.</p><p> Successive Governments have provided significant financial supports in the creation of the public State forests but also in the creation of the private forests owned by more than 22,000 forest owners.  Some 350,000 ha have been planted since 1990.  In 2018 more than 3.69 million cu. m of timber was harvested from Ireland&rsquo;s forests with more than 1 million cu. m coming from private forests.  However, it is important that we continue to manage these forests sustainably to ensure that they continue to provide a range multiple benefits, including carbon sequestration.  Based on the national inventory report, Irish forests remove more than 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.  In addition, the carbon stored in harvested wood products, amounting to an additional 0.73 million tonnes, demonstrates the importance of increasing the use of timber across the whole of society.  The climate action plan also acknowledges that we must continue to protect and monitor our forests for disease, fires and deforestation which can also be a source of emissions.</p><p> The second key pillar of the climate action plan is to continue the efforts to increase the size of the national forest area through increased afforestation.  The climate action plan has set an ambitious target of achieving 8,000 ha per year and this will present many challenges but also opportunities for landowners who wish to plant.  The performance of meeting our afforestation targets under our current national forestry programme has fallen behind in recent years for a variety of reasons, including land availability and increasing land prices.  However, this trend must be reversed.</p><p> We have made significant changes to our forestry programme as part of the mid-term review and we are seeing some progress in certain areas but more needs to be done.  We must also work harder to communicate to the wider public the importance of forestry and ensure that the forests created reflect good practice in forest design.  We must continue to support species diversity and ensure that forests have a positive impact on the environment.  The recent changes made to the existing forestry programme are having positive impacts in increasing the percentage of broadleaves planted which amounted to more than 27% of the species mix in forests planted in 2018.  We must also continue to support and encourage forest owners in the management of their plantations and encourage a diversity of species and sustainable management practices.  I am encouraged to see the increased take up in the use of continuous cover forestry and agroforestry, although small-scale, these certainly have an increasing role to play as an alternative management practice in certain locations.  Species selection and tree breeding can also play a significant role in ensuring that existing and future forests are resilient and can adapt in a changing climate.</p><p> It is clear there is no silver bullet to achieving higher planting rates and that a multifaceted strategy must be employed.  This means putting in more efforts to get farmers to re-engage with the programme and better communication of the farm-forestry message.  It means better integration between the next Common Agricultural Policy and the next national forestry programme.  It also means better use of suitable public lands for afforestation and we have already seen some significant announcements here through collaboration between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na, for example.  We also need to share knowledge and build and manage more resilient forests for the future and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with stakeholders and the COFORD Council through various working groups.</p><p> The forecasted increase in volumes from the forest estate is set to double to nearly 8 million cu. m by 2035, and it is important that we continue to mobilise this timber to all available markets.  The climate action plan contains a number of actions which will continue the good work already taking place in areas of research and innovation.</p><p> Forestry is a climate change solution and combined with emission reductions across all sectors, we will continue our efforts to meet our climate change commitments.  I look forward to discussing with the committee the role forests plays in climate change and to hear members' views on how we can maximise the contribution that forests will make now and in the future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputies and Senators for the opportunity to engage with them today.  I joined Coillte as CEO just over one month ago and it is already very clear to me that responding to climate change will be one of the defining challenges of my leadership of this organisation and, for this reason, I welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee at this early stage of my tenure.</p> <p>  The 2017 Citizens' Assembly recognised the important role forestry has to play in tackling climate change in Ireland.  Last April this committee published its report, and in June the Minister, Deputy Bruton, published the Government&rsquo;s first climate action plan.  Each of these valuable initiatives have highlighted the same core message, which is that forestry is a key enabler in Ireland&rsquo;s response to climate change and I believe that there is a serious responsibility on all of us to respond positively to these clear calls to action.</p> <p>  What strikes me about the debate on the role of forestry in supporting climate action is that almost everybody agrees that we need to plant more trees and that we need to manage our existing forests responsibly.  However, there are differing views on forestry practices and systems and on the direction of forest policy.  I am very happy to be here with my colleagues today to listen to those views and to offer insights and perspectives from an organisation that has spent 30 years managing forests on behalf of the State.  </p> <p>  Coillte is custodian of approximately 7% of our total land area, so we clearly have a vital role to play.  We do not have all the answers but what we have within our organisation is a deep well of forestry knowledge and expertise and, as the largest manager of woodlands in the State, we are acutely aware of the threat posed by climate change and our role in helping society meet this challenge.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s forests represent our largest carbon sink and store.  They also offer solutions to many of the other challenges our society faces.  Our forests support a vibrant forest products sector which employs 12,000 people in rural areas.  They provide sustainable building materials to replace carbon heavy products such as steel and concrete.  They can also improve our biodiversity, clean our water, reduce the risk of flooding, and provide great places for people to get active outdoors and experience nature.  On this last point, Coillte&rsquo;s forests are entirely open access and we have an estimated 18 million visits to our forests each year.  We already have over 3,000 km of hiking trails, 12 forest parks and nearly 300 recreation areas.  Looking forward, we will continue to enhance our outdoor forest recreation offering.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s forestry is very young in international terms.  When the State was formed nearly 100 years ago our country had almost no forest cover, but as a result of significant public investment over the second half of the last century, it has increased to approximately 11%.  However, despite this expansion, we still have one of the lowest levels of forest cover in Europe.  That said, Ireland has exceptionally good conditions for growing trees.  Our soils and our mild, wet climate mean that some tree species grow faster on this island than anywhere else in Europe.</p> <p>  As a country, we have an opportunity to increase our level of forest cover and realise all the benefits that forestry has to offer.  However, to achieve this we need a vision for the future of forestry that enjoys broad public support.  Forestry is a long-term commitment and decisions taken today have consequences far into the future.  We therefore need to focus on identifying a vision for forestry that responds to the challenges we face in the century ahead.  In my view the vision of the future of forestry can, and should, be inspiring and appealing, but it also needs to be realisable and sustainable.  This is where balancing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of forestry is crucial.</p> <p>  In this context it is important that we recognise that managed forests are highly efficient at sequestering carbon.  As forests grow and mature the rate at which they sequester new carbon eventually begins to decline.  The advantage of an actively managed forest is that when trees mature, they are removed and replaced by new young trees, which are more effective at absorbing new carbon, thus starting the cycle again.</p> <p>  Actively managed plantation forests have a really important role to play in tackling climate change.  This is due to their triple benefit whereby in the first instance trees sequester carbon as the tree grows.  This carbon is then locked away in timber products when the mature tree is harvested thereby providing a second benefit.  Timber products substitute other carbon heavy products like concrete or steel.</p> <p>  As the transition to a low carbon economy begins to take hold, we are already seeing innovative new applications of wood fibre and it is likely this trend will accelerate as the circular economy and the bioeconomy scale up and become mainstream.  In continental Europe, we are already seeing engineered timber construction being deployed in high-rise structures and wood-based products being developed to replace plastics and synthetic textiles.</p><p>At Coillte, we are committed to building on the momentum we have achieved in recent years to contribute further to Ireland's approach to forestry, climate change and the use of our natural resources for the greater good of Irish citizens.  The challenge, as we see it, is to continue to get the balance right between the commercial, environmental and social or recreational dividend from forests in the ever-evolving world in which we operate.  We are always looking to strike the right balance and for us, it is about planting the right tree in the right place with the right objective.</p><p> Today, we manage one fifth of our estate primarily for biodiversity purposes.  In order to underpin how we are responding to changing societal demands, we recently established a new non-profit entity, Coillte Nature, which will focus exclusively on increasing the delivery of non-commercial woodlands, undertaking major biodiversity projects and large-scale forest conversion projects.  Forestry has never been more relevant than it is today.  Our objective is to work collaboratively with the Government, the Oireachtas, this committee, our customers and the public to ensure we optimise the contribution Coillte can make in the years ahead.  My colleagues and I look forward to elaborating further on the points made in this short opening statement and to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#D00300"><p>I thank committee members for this opportunity to address the Joint Committee on Climate Action on the subject of forestry, climate change and the social impacts of forestry.  My statement will cover the social impacts of forestry.  I am joined today by Dr. Eugene Hendrick, who will take any additional specific questions on forests and climate change.</p> <p>  As stated in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's forestry programme, one of the aims of the current afforestation programme is to increase forest cover so as to "capture carbon, produce wood and help mitigation".  This programme will require a significant number of landowners to change land use by undertaking afforestation.  Such a change will have both climate impacts and social impacts.  Let us look at what are the social impacts of forestry.  In its narrowest sense, the social impact of forestry can be measured in terms of employment generation.  Based on research carried out by me and a number of colleagues, we estimated that the total employment, direct and indirect, associated with forestry is 5,531 full-time jobs, while estimates for total employment in the wood products sector is 6,408 full-time jobs.  This research dates back to 2012 and I am involved in new research to get more up-to-date estimates of current employment in the two sectors.  Employees in the forestry and wood processing sectors are, in the main, rural based and a recent study suggests that a significant proportion of these are part-time farmers.</p> <p>  In recent years, the understanding of what is meant by social impacts has broadened to include impacts on quality of life.  Forests may generate social values or be connected with people's lives in ways that contribute or deduct from social well-being.  For example, forests provide opportunities for recreation and amenity.  Based on published research, estimates of visitation rates to Irish forests vary from 18 million visits per annum to 29 million visits per annum.  Recreation in Ireland generally occurs in the public forest estate as there is no right of access to private forests.  Other quality-of-life impacts are generally assessed by investigating how local stakeholders perceive forestry as a part of their social and physical environment.  In Ireland, a number of social impact studies of forestry have been undertaken.  These have focused on case studies in the north west, east and south west of Ireland and have employed structured interviews with stakeholders.  The findings from this research indicate that the reaction to afforestation and attitudes generally to forestry are context-specific.  Where planted forests have been a feature of the landscape for a long period, more positive attitudes to forestry and afforestation have been recorded.  Among the factors that influence reactions to afforestation is the question of who is doing it, whether it is local people or outsiders.  If it is the latter, it can lead to a sense that afforestation is replacing people, thereby threatening cultural identity.  Even if local people, typically farmers, are the ones engaging in afforestation, there can be a concern that if trees replace agricultural activity this will in turn replace people.</p> <p>  The evidence to date is that the majority of the 22,955 owners of forests planted since 1980 are farmers.  The statistics suggest that these have chosen to afforest only a portion of their farm, as the average size of afforestation parcel is 8.7 ha.  Typically, afforestation has been carried out on the poorest parts of farms.  The income from the forestry premium contributes to farm income and enables those who wish to do so to remain in farming.  In 2017, of the &euro;72 million paid in forestry premiums, &euro;67.5 million or 94%, was paid to farmers.</p> <p>  Social impact studies have consistently highlighted the often dramatic effect of large blocks of forest, in particular conifer forests, on the landscape.  As trees grow, they heighten the sense of social isolation that prevails in many rural areas.  Afforestation has often coincided with social changes, such as a decline in the agricultural labour force, ageing of the agricultural population, and population migration to urban areas.  For some, forests are the manifestation of this rural transformation.  Afforestation often also challenges long-held beliefs as to the appropriate use of agricultural land.</p> <p>  At a broader scale, public attitudes to forestry in Ireland have been gauged in a number of large studies.  In the most recent study, the majority, that is, 88% of the almost 1,000 people surveyed, agreed that forests were an important part of the traditional landscape of the Irish countryside and agreed that all types of forest are good for the environment.  Nevertheless, the study showed a strong preference for mixed forests and broadleaf forests over conifer forests.  It also showed, as have similar studies across Europe, that the forest outputs that the public rank as the most important tend to be the ecological ones such as the conservation of plants and animals rather than the timber production and employment outputs.  I look forward to taking questions on my opening statement.</p></speech>

We look forward to dealing with questions from members afterwards.  Pro Silva Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation supporting the use of alternative forest management systems to the clear-fell system.  These alternative systems are generally called continuous cover forestry, CCF, and these systems do not clear-fell the forest but instead involve thinning trees periodically while allowing the retained forest to grow and develop.  Pro Silva Ireland is part of a wider European network of Pro Silva organisations across 27 countries.  We have a diverse and dynamic membership of foresters, forest owners, contractors, ecologists, wood scientists, artists and others.</p> <p>  Well-managed forests can provide many functions.  They can produce timber for domestic and industrial use, be places of recreation while enhancing our landscape, protect and clean our water while helping prevent flooding, stabilise and improve our soils, harbour and enrich biodiversity, sequester carbon, shelter our farms and be places of inspiration, wonder and calm.</p> <p>  Successive forestry programmes and forestry practice in Ireland has concentrated on the timber-production function.  This has resulted in the successful establishment of a vibrant timber processing sector and in vital job creation in rural communities.  The clear-fell system has been used in efficiently producing timber to feed this industry.  However, this management system struggles to satisfactorily deliver the other services that society requires from forests and this is at the heart of recent protests against forestry in Leitrim, for example.  It is clear that society wants more from Irish forests in the form of the aforementioned multiple benefits.  That has been recognised in the forestry sector and many positive initiatives have developed over the past 20 years in that regard.  In Pro Silva Ireland we believe that CCF will deliver these multiple benefits in a sustainable way that will rebuild a forest culture, be profitable and at the same time deliver a range of environmental services.  We know from the experience of CCF forests managed in Ireland, and more so from those under longer-term CCF management in Europe, that it is possible to sustain commercial timber production while delivering the multiple benefits.  This committee's role is to consider action on climate change and what measures can be adopted to mitigate this hugely serious issue.  Well-managed forests are excellent carbon sinks and we are paying the price both globally and nationally for both current and historic deforestation.</p><p>How we manage our forests also has a significant effect on the efficiency of carbon sequestration.  CCF is an efficient means of optimising carbon storage in forests as it avoids the large-scale release of soil carbon that occurs when plantations are clear-felled, given that more than 70% of forest carbon is held in the forest soil.  It produces a higher percentage of high-quality and long-life timber products, in which sequestered carbon is locked for a longer timeframe.  Moreover, it increases forest biodiversity in general and provides permanent forest habitats that keep carbon locked in the forest and results in more resilient forests, with lower biotic and abiotic risks.</p><p> Planting new forests has been widely recognised as a way in which society can take positive climate action.  We must, however, maintain a focus on delivering the multiple benefits of forestry, rather than just one function, whether timber production or carbon sequestration.  The question of monocultures inevitably arises in this regard.  Pro Silva Ireland is deeply concerned with the continued predominance of monocultures in Irish forestry.  Even aged monocultural crops are incapable of delivering the wider long-term social and environmental benefits of forestry.  There is also considerable concern about their resilience in the face of climate change.  The very forests planted to mitigate climate change could become casualties of it.  Concerns about the sustainability of monocultures are not new and at present in central Europe, bark beetles devastate large areas of monocultural spruce plantations, which suffer drought stress directly related to climate change.  In Ireland, we have our own problems, with ash dieback disease devastating monocultural ash plantations.  </p><p> To date, most policy initiatives to encourage or require greater levels of diverse planting have ended up compartmentalising different species into small monocultures.  We believe that new planting must be robustly mixed with greater utilization of native species and that we should cease planting monocultures.  It is important that expectations be managed in respect of what is possible from CCF.  Forests, by their nature, take time to plan, develop, grow and transform.  Similarly, if we want to achieve a cultural change in Irish forestry, this will also take time and investment.  No magic wand can be waved to transform Irish forests overnight.  It will take long-term planning, with a refocusing of forest policy and programmes.  There are significant challenges in the form of training and capacity building within the forestry sector, transforming existing monocultures into more diverse forests, maintaining commercial timber production and associated jobs through the necessary changes, the reliance on private landowners and private forestry businesses to deliver new forests, educating wider society of the multiple benefits of forestry, managing invasive and unsustainable deer populations, as well as restructuring inappropriately located and designed forests.</p><p> Tackling climate change and specifically reducing our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions is a multifaceted problem and no single policy, such as planting more forests, will solve it.  Nevertheless, well-designed, well-managed and resilient forests can play their part in tackling this great problem of our time while at the same time doing much more.</p></speech>

Forest Industries Ireland, FII, is only one year old.  We want to increase knowledge and awareness about forestry and timber.  We would love to better inform our fellow citizens about the industry, its prospects and challenges and its contributions to climate change.</p> <p>  I am the chief executive of Balcas Limited.  We have two factories, in Enniskillen and Invergordon in Scotland.  We process 1 million cu. m of sustainable forest output annually, from which we produce a range of wood products for construction, fencing and packaging.  We generate all our own electricity and spill the same amount to the grid, which is enough electricity for all the homes in County Fermanagh.  We also make wood pellets, and our heat fuel from the forests of Ireland and Scotland annually displaces 100 million l of oil from Ireland and Britain.  We have no wood fibre waste.</p> <p>  I am also the chairman of FII, an all-island body constituted within IBEC.  Our member companies cover the whole supply chain.  There are nurseries that grow saplings, forestry consultants who work with farmers and landowners to plant and manage their forests and factories that convert the forest crop into construction timber, panel products, fencing materials, packaging and biofuel.  For many decades, the State and our people have invested in increasing afforestation in Ireland.  In return, our island now has an industry that provides 12,000 jobs throughout our rural communities.  The economic contribution is approximately &euro;2.3 billion per annum.  Over the coming years, the private forests planted in the 1980s and 1990s will come to maturity and will deliver a major supply increase onto the market, which is a further opportunity for Ireland.  Today, we work with more than 20,000 farmer-forest owners, most of whom have planted a portion of their land.  They receive a steady and reliable income and it delivers a valuable crop when the forest matures.  Farmers are invariably interested in the environmental contribution their forests make.</p> <p>  Ireland's forests produce timber at three times the rate of Scandinavia's and are a major carbon sink.  Forestry in Ireland is already a large part of this island&rsquo;s fight against climate change.  Irish forests capture 3.6 million tonnes of CO2 yearly, while the total carbon store is more than 300 million tonnes.  This is testament to the policies of successive Governments to plant trees and create and support a vibrant forest sector.  Throughout the world, forests have been identified as the most scalable opportunity to absorb CO2.  In Ireland, we have learned a great deal.  We are increasing diversity and balance, are providing more leisure and recreational opportunities for our citizens and are increasing the provision of one of nature&rsquo;s great renewable raw materials.  </p> <p>  We should increasingly seek to use our own timber as a mass-market construction material.  Wood can displace cement and steel in our built environment and is doing so today throughout the world.  The world&rsquo;s tallest timber building was completed in Norway this year, with 18 storeys of apartments.  Wood is used to remodel, expand and extend the life of existing structures, maintaining the existing foundations.  In Ireland, too, we should embrace the greater use of timber, which will require changes to our building regulations.  The Government can take a lead by enabling the construction of more timber housing, and procuring new greener schools and civic buildings that use cross-laminated timber as the backbone of their structure.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitments to climate action are already supported by our growing forests.  To continue this into the future, we must plant more and continue to improve forest management.  We have done well to climb back from less than 1% forest cover 100 years ago to the 11% of today.  Now is the time to redouble our efforts and build a coalition of farmers, foresters and policymakers to drive continued forest development.</p> <p>  Farmers are the foundation of future policy, and industry and the Government must rise to the challenge of rewarding them.  The climate action plan produced by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has an annual target of 8,000 ha of new afforestation.  We need to support our farmers and rural communities.  We want them to feel encouraged to see forestry as a positive option on their farms, both for the sake of the environment and for a reliable family income.  We all want to find ways to diversify the forest estate.  Already, approximately 30% of the trees being planted are broadleaf.  We want to increase the creation of native woodland and can do so in a way that will go hand in hand with the creation of conifer forests and will sustain the economic value they contribute.  Currently, the greatest driver of broadleaf planting in Ireland is the planting of Sitka spruce.</p> <p>  Our sector calls for a renewed vision for forestry in Ireland, based on economic development, climate change goals, biodiversity and social values.  We need all the stakeholders to come together and agree the way forward, rather than have different groups pulling in different directions.  Forestry and timber can make a great positive impact on climate change.  If we get it right, it will work for everyone and for once, the economic and environmental stories will work hand in hand.</p></speech>

I will start with the Department.  I want to assess where the Department is with the recommendations that the committee made.  We asked the Government to commission a study to quantify the climate mitigation and adaptation functions of hedgerows by 2021.  We also asked that it improve the national forestry programme to better support native species and ensure that communities are included in the process.  We asked for a review of the Forestry Act 1988 to ensure that the policy is consistent with the objective of environmental, social and economic sustainability.  Will the Department respond to these commitments so that I can get a sense of where it is on them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#F00300"><p>The committee's report fed into the Government's climate action plan and we implement the goals of the plan.  Hedgerows were mentioned in the plan as something that should be explored in more detail.  They are a sink since they sequester carbon.  They do not have an accounting value <i>per se</i>under the international climate change agreement as I understand it but there is a commitment that the Department and local authorities should do a more detailed assessment of the density of hedgerows within their confines.  There was previously a study by the EPA, with some input from Teagasc and the Department, which examined this issue.  We are a significant funder of hedgerows under our GLAS scheme.  We fund the creation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 km of new hedgerows and that scheme is ongoing.  In the past three successive agri-environment schemes that we have run, we have funded the creation of approximately 6,000 km of new hedgerows.  The challenge is to find a mechanism for how the sequestration ability of hedgerows can be better factored into climate change policy.  It is a key recommendation that was taken up in the climate action plan from this committee and needs to be looked at in more detail.<br/><br/>The second question was about the Forestry Act, which established Coillte.  I am not sure whether that was taken up in the climate action plan as a result of this committee's report.  We are not actively looking at it right now.  Our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are the shareholders in Coillte, so we have ongoing engagement with it.  We have a shareholder letter of expectation every year, which outlines what we expect to see Coillte do each year.  It reports to our Ministers for consent for any activities.<br/><br/>The final matter related to broadleaves.  I am glad this has been raised, with different speakers mentioning it in different ways.  In my opening remarks, I mentioned the mid-term review of the forestry programme, which was about reorientating the programme and moving it towards a greater penetration of broadleaves.  We looked at a number of ways of doing that.  We gave a commitment to try to reach a target of 30% broadleaves as part of the national programme.  We recognised that that was not being met mid-way through the current forestry programme.  It was at approximately 21%.  We did a couple of things as part of the mid-term review.  We made it mandatory for the percentage of broadleaves in every plantation to be increased from 10% to 15%.  No forestry site is being planted in the country without a minimum of 15% broadleaf plantation.  We put in place some key enhancements, so any additional investment that we put into the mid-term review was directed primarily at broadleaves.  We had a 7% increase for all broadleaf and diverse conifer grant categories.  We had a 5% increase in the premium category, so if the farmer wants to plant, he will get 5% more than he would previously.  We have had different initiatives since then which were outlined.  One was the woodland environment fund, a partnership between corporate Ireland, businesses, farmers and the Department.  It has taken off recently.  A couple of high-profile companies were investing in that recently.</p></speech>

How many ecologists are employed in the Department or Teagasc to carry out ecological assessments and identify the important species and ecosystems that are at risk?  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, published a study regarding the failure of regulations to require biodiversity assessments for forestry.  Will Mr. Hayes respond to that and what the Department is doing?  Does the Forestry Act 1988 need to be updated to meet our biodiversity and ecological requirements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#F00500"><p>On the question of ecologists, we are, as we speak, interviewing new ecologists for recruitment into the Department, specifically for forestry but some will go into other agri-environment areas.  We have two full-time ecologists as part of our forest service.  Other ecologists work in the nitrates section of the Department.  I cannot speak for Teagasc so the question about its resources is best directed to it.</p> <p>  With regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle's, statements, this is a key issue, which is delaying the release of licences.  We are the planning authority for forestry and, therefore, we have to make any licence consistent with all of the relevant legislation, which is mainly EU legislation as it is applied and interpreted here.  Case law means that that legislation gets amended and updated.  We are no different from any other public body and have to respond to that.  That includes the environmental impact assessment directive and the habitats and birds directives.</p> <p>  We are going through a challenging process to essentially reboot our planning process for the appropriate assessment procedures that are required for the issuing of forestry licences.  We are putting a lot of investment into this because it is not just a matter of updating the procedures but it is about updating protocols and investing in our own staff in order that they are skilled enough to interpret the legislation and issue the resulting licences.  It is also about engaging with the sector so that it understands the changes required and can adapt.  We are very public in saying, as is the Minister of State that we expect to see a better quality of application coming in.  We are ready to work with the sector on that.  A key part of the response is the answer to the Deputy's first question, on the recruitment of additional ecologists.  I have been working in forestry in the Department for two years.  I have seen substantial environmental regulation in that period, and it has happened over previous years as well.  It is a constant challenge for any public body to keep up with that, but that is the issue that the Minister of State referred to.  We continue to issue licences all the time.  The tap is on but it is not flowing to the extent that anybody would like.  We are confident and hopeful that we will get there.</p></speech>

I understand the background to it but I think, at best, that one could say that the Department's response has been less than one would have expected.  It should not be a surprise to the Department or the Government that we should have been making progress in setting the appropriate standards for afforestation.  It has been known for a considerable period that it has a positive impact on carbon sequestration.  Mr. Hayes has answered that but we need action.  It is damaging in a number of ways.  It is damaging for farmers who have got to a point where they are ready to plant, which he will be aware is challenging.  They see it as placing their land outside their control for the rest of their lives, which is a big move for them.  One can get farmers or others to do it and then they are seen to be blocked by the State, which is asking for it to be done on the other hand.  I understand the reasons behind it but we need to be more proactive in going out to farmers, otherwise it turns off a swathe of people who say that they will not bother going through the entire process and spend the money, when it then may not happen.  It also damages the industry and efforts to keep people involved in planting in jobs.  They do not see the commitments or a future in it.  Mr. Hayes has covered this but I wanted to make those comments.</p> <p>  Coillte has done a lot of good work over the years but over the past ten years, it started looking at its asset base.  When it started to worry about selling off certain plots of land for building or getting into wind energy, that was all great because it is a semi-State company, but the company lost its focus to some extent.</p><p>The company looked at replanting rather than having an ethos of identifying more parcels of land and aggressively and broadening its footprint.  Coillte should return to its core terms of reference of increasing our landmass covered by woodland because that has important benefits that probably were not envisaged ten, 15 or 20 years ago. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Imelda Hurley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#G00400"><p>Albeit I am new to Coillte, the use of land over the lifetime of the organisation was something that I wanted to understand before I joined and, indeed, understand further.  I note the point that the Deputy made about Coillte not increasing its landbank in respect of increased afforestation.  There are enablers that, ultimately, are somewhat challenging for Coillte in that regard.  One is that we do not have access to grants and premia that are available to the private sector.  As a result, when land becomes available there is competition for that land and it is question of financial wherewithal.</p> <p>  Second, the availability of land and finding land to plant is an issue in the first place.  As alluded to earlier, farmers find it difficult to give up their land almost forever.  When we think about that we think forward and that it would be important that land suitable for forestry is identified and, hopefully, that will be a key enabler of allowing increased afforestation. </p></speech>

Ms Hurley has made a good point.  Coillte is observing what is going on in the farming sector at the minute with the more marginal land, which was borderline viable at a stage.  However, the beef and suckler cow sectors have changed.  The next generation may not have the same attachment to such land but they certainly do not see a future in it and, therefore, opportunities exist.  Coillte must become aggressive in marketing the potential returns for farmers.  There would be a significantly positive impact from an environmental point of view in terms of carbon capture.</p></speech>

I have been party to very recent discussions, in light of my new role, as to the role of forestry and how it can coexist with farming.  There is work to be done to help everybody understand how they can coexist.  Coillte is very open to playing its role in that regard.  There is a cultural thinking around forestry that we all have work to do to move forward but I accept the Deputy's point made.</p></speech>

Earlier Dr. N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in mentioned people's attitudes to forestry.  How can we change the attitude of the agricultural sector towards forestry?  At the end of the day, none of these targets will be met.  I have not heard anything today to convince me that anything has changed and the targets will be met.  The farmers of Ireland own the land.  Within the farming community, planting forestry is seen as the lazy option and an avoidance of hard work.  How can we change that mentality or attitude?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#G01200"><p>A cohort of farmers have made that decision and they can be the champions for other farmers.  If they have a positive story to tell or if they can show that planting has enabled them to stay in farming where they otherwise might not have done so, that build-up of numbers can encourage others to get involved.  There is a lot of interest now in a different approach to farm forestry because it means the farm, the forest and the two not integrated.  There is a lot of interest now and research beginning to ramp up into having these two together.  It might be better referred to as agroforestry or silver pasture systems where the farmer can continue to farm.  I am well aware that farmers want to be farmers and produce food.  If that was possible along with planting trees, albeit less densely, that might be something farmers might find more acceptable but we do not have enough examples of that yet.  Approximately 51 ha of such mixtures of trees and grassland have been introduced in the past year or so under the agroforestry grant scheme introduced by the Department.  The fact that a farmer does not have to give up on farming and can do the two together might be more attractive.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and I listened attentively when Dr. N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in said that the farmers who are planting forestry can be the champions of the future.</p> <p>  Mr. Hayes made numerous references to communication in his opening statement.  The communications strategy must be put in place is key.  I have rarely heard, when the benefits of forestry are being communicated, that forestry is the second most profitable agricultural enterprise after dairying.  This story must be told around the country if we are going to get new producers into forestry.  There is no doubt that the key driver of forestry in the future will be those people who are under pressure at the moment in their current enterprises.  There has been a great deal of discussion, this year in particular, about the challenges facing the beef sector.  The most profitable agricultural enterprises are dairying, forestry, tillage, sheep and, unfortunately, beef-suckler is at the bottom of the pile.  A communication strategy in respect of that has to be developed.</p> <p>  Dr. N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in said the farmers who are planting forestry at the moment can be the champions of the future.  Some of those so-called champions have been badly let down over the recent period.  They have a negative story to tell about Coillte and the difficulties with farm partnerships.  Last week, a delegation from Coillte appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and they gave an update on the current position.  Since then, I have received communications from a number of farm partners around the country who told me bad stories about the way they have been, and still are being, treated, unfortunately.</p> <p>  From the point of view of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there is a very negative story about the ash dieback issue, which was mentioned by a number of witnesses earlier.  The Department and State let down a number of farmers who saw forestry as a pension fund but their hard work has been wiped out as a result of ash dieback disease entering the country.  For many years nothing has been done for these farmers and they feel very let down.  If we are depending on them to be the champions of the future, which we should be, then we will find ourselves in great difficulty.  How can we address these issues going forward?</p></speech>

Regarding Senator Daly's question, without doubt farmers are the future of forestry in Ireland.  Without the farmers and the support of communities, forestry does not have a strong future ahead of it.  Allied to that is the confidence of individual farmers.  That confidence has been undermined at certain times over the past number of years.  We must restore confidence.  We must have the farmer going to the mart and meeting people somewhere and saying, "Yes, I have had a good experience".  Hopefully, we will get a lot more of that.  We now have a very strong wave of timber coming through from the plantations done in the 1980s and 1990s and I hope a lot of positive stories will come from that.  People will have been to the market, sold their timber to the local sawmill and will have a good story to tell about the returns they made.  Connecting with communities and individual farmers is the future of this industry.  If we do not have that support and if we are not building our policy, as a country, and building our industry around that, then we are going to struggle.</p></speech>

We will continue to work to ensure we have strong communication with our farm partners.  I fear that because of the history of the set-up of farm partners and the experience from a couple of years ago, we will have an ongoing communications challenge associated with that history.  We will continue to work hard to communicate with our farm partners and to continue to develop strong relationships with them.</p></speech>

The analysis we have for the reasons the current programme is not hitting its targets indicates farmers are disengaging from the programme, to be honest.  We want to see them back where they were and being the main beneficiaries.  The messages here are absolutely around agroforestry schemes and the farm forestry message.  We are working very closely with Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants Association - the private advisers - to get that message out there.</p> <p>  It is not about one or the other and having livestock or trees.  It can absolutely be both and one can maintain the same number of livestock while planting some trees.  There is massive benefit in a diversified income and a person would not be subject to the fluctuations in a market in a particular year.  That person would also have a State-backed guaranteed premium for 15 years.</p> <p>  The question of ash dieback was raised but I dispute slightly the idea that the State left people hanging.  The Department swung into action very quickly with a scheme on foot of the discovery of the presence of Chalara at the time.  We suspended the scheme last year, as the Deputy knows, and we engaged with stakeholders on that.  The suspension occurred because the science changed and when the science changes, the policy must also change.  The science indicated the original aims of the scheme, laudable as they were, concerned eradication and that was no longer possible.  The disease is now essentially endemic.</p> <p>  We pulled the scheme and worked on it.  It has gone out to the relevant stakeholders now for consultation and there is a date of approximately mid-January for feedback.  The supports that were there will still be there, albeit modified.  People who are dealing with infected trees must know it is there.  They know it is there, although it may not be moving at the pace they would like.  There are supports for those who, unfortunately, are dealing with infection.</p></speech>

My first question is to the Department.  I know we have an ambitious target of 8,000 ha per year for afforested land but what exactly is the target for the percentage of forestry to be covered and by when?  I wish to ask Pro Silva about concerns people might have on planting forestry.  We hear that it ties up the land but in what condition will the soil be afterwards?  I have been asked if the land would forever be under trees.  There was a comment in the presentation about more resilient forests but will Mr. Purser outline a little more the biotic and abiotic risks referred to?  There is also the question of training and capacity building in the forestry sector.  How many foresters will be required if we want to get where we wish to go?</p> <p>  Another question coming to me from the farming community concerns the impact of increased acidic degrading of pine needles in waterways, so will Coillte address this?  This occurs if there are many streams running through forests etc.  Is that an issue, as farmers are very concerned about it?  On the appropriate use of agricultural land, will Dr. N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in expand a little on her point?  Mr. Brian Murphy from Forest Industries Ireland indicated that 20,000 farmer-forest owners have made a decision to plant a portion of their land but what is the average size of the land holding put under forest cover?</p></speech>

There was a question on the replanting of land but it is not particularly relevant to us because it is a legal matter.  Felling licences are issued for clear-felling, of which we would not be strong advocates.  Normally it comes with an obligation to replant.  That is not particularly relevant to continuous cover forestry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Purser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019121100002#H00800"><p>That is right.  It becomes a permanent forest.  There is still a licence to harvest trees on a periodic basis but it would be a thinning licence, as opposed to a clear-fell licence.  The Deputy mentioned biotic and abiotic risks.  Abiotic risks include elements like wind and fire.  We know the risks for even-aged forests and monocultural forests are higher with wind damage, particularly in cases of poor management, including if they are thinned late, for example.  Fire is an increasing risk with climate change as we are getting drier summers.  We are also getting increased wind storm events because of climate change.</p> <p>  In my presentation I outlined the concern that we may drive to plant many new forests, which is a fantastic objective that we should all aspire to, but if they are not made resilient they could become casualties of climate change themselves.  The design and management of those forests is really important.  On the biotic front, I referred to the bark beetle infestation in central Europe, which again has come as a result of very hot and dry summers.  The spruce bark beetle affects monocultures in particular in central Europe and it attacks stressed trees.  When trees and forests come under stress, they are much more prone to the infestation and it has had a knock-on effect here.  As the forest industries know, it has affected timber prices because there is a flood of timber on the market in Europe as those forests had to be felled in an unplanned way.  That has depressed the price of timber.  The cheap timber is going to England now, and that is our main market.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about training and capacity building.  While there is a very strong cohort of foresters and forestry contractors in the country, we advocate a rethink or transition of silvicultural systems in Ireland whereby those same foresters and forestry contractors, as well as the forest owners, will upskill in alternative management of those forests.  We are not looking at an entirely new resource of people or recruitment.  We are trying to broaden the skills base of the forestry professionals out there in order that they can offer services to the forest owners of this country and to the State that will deliver on the multiple benefits that forestry can provide.</p></speech>

The research comes from the belief among most farmers that good agricultural land is for agriculture and food production, with forests being more acceptable if they are planted on poor quality land because it does not compete with agriculture.  It was in that context I mentioned the argument and it related to a comment from Senator Paul Daly.  Farmers feel that land, and particularly good land, is for producing food.</p><p>That is the context to which I was referring.</p></speech>

First, we are very mindful of it and deal with it through our environmental risk assessment system.  When we are planning any forest operation we carefully monitor the impacts it could have on water courses.  Second, in carrying out our forest operations we follow best practice regarding setbacks from streams and relevant water courses and silt traps.  We carry out extensive water sampling and water monitoring as well.</p></speech>

Private forests account for approximately half of all forest.  We have tens of thousands of very small forests, which has an implication for how they are managed and what the return on them needs to be for the owner.  One must be quite careful about how one manages that because these are very small forests.</p></speech>

I understand there was a setback distance of 30 m, which was subsequently increased to 60 m.  A question arises with replanting and so on.  As I understand it, private forestry must stay with the 60 m minimum regime.  Is Coillte sticking with that or replanting into the original 30 m setback from dwellings?</p></speech>

Where a lot of our old forest was planted too close to roads and infrastructure, we are correcting that through our forest planning for the second rotation.  We will keep to the same setbacks as with afforestation, that is, 60 m for dwellings and roads.</p></speech>

In this case the company failed to return the 30-year lock-in investment.  The Central Bank has confirmed that the company in question was neither authorised nor supervised by the regulator, which puts any claim of mis-selling for the shareholders outside of the jurisdiction of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  Can the Department comment in general on how a Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this case, was given grants and incentives - Exchequer money, taxpayers' money - to subsidise or incentivise these commercial companies, which are now apparently beyond the reach of the financial regulator?  Could one of the Department officials comment on that?</p></speech>

The issue the Deputy raises concerning the fund, I understand, is the return to the investors, which has nothing to do with the Department.  The matter is entirely a commercial venture between that fund and the investors.</p></speech>

The question I asked concerns the Department providing incentives or grants to companies or any kind of investment entity that is not regulated by the financial regulator or registered.  Such a company is then beyond the reach of the financial regulator.  What checks does the Department carry out to ensure that that does not happen?</p></speech>

Farmers are the priority but the scheme is obviously open to private investors as well.  I am not aware that we do the background checks as to what are the requirements of the financial regulator.  The financial regulator is needed to advise on what companies are allowed and not allowed to do in their business activities in this country, so the Deputy's question would probably be best directed at the regulator.</p></speech>

In the light of cases such as this arising, is it the Department's intention to pick up the phone to the financial regulator to ensure that before the Department pays out any subsidies, grants or incentives, the regulator checks that the company is registered with the regulator?

Coillte was seen as a company that took over, acquired and bought huge land masses.  In the constituency I live in, Laois-Offaly, there is a big footprint.  In this regard, and bearing in mind that Coillte does not get the same incentives as the private investors, which puts it at somewhat of a disadvantage, does Coillte see its role into the future as increasing its land mass and doing wide-scale planting like it did in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, or does it see its role as just being involved with the partnerships and the farming schemes?  Related to that, while the on-farm schemes have been mentioned, does Coillte see a role in the cutaway of Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and planting there?</p></speech>

We want to play our part in how that is achieved and to contribute towards that target.  We are working with the Department on all options that might be available to us such that we can contribute in an economically viable way to the afforestation target.  Today, 20% of the landbank we have is managed for biodiversity and we have always been very mindful of managing our forest in a sustainable way.  As to how we think forward, it is all about balance - the right tree, the right place and the right objective - and balancing economic, environmental and social aspects.  We will be mindful of that as we move forward but we certainly see our role as playing a part in the next stage of what the State needs from its overall landbank.</p></speech>

Clearly, this is a matter for Bord na M&oacute;na as well.  We are trying to ensure we follow the national peatlands strategy.  We need to take the best ecological advice on this as well.  If an area is fit and appropriate for forestry, that is what we should do.  Coillte can certainly play a role in that, creating native wilderness forests.  Where peatland is more appropriate to rewetting, that is an option.  It is perhaps best to leave certain areas alone.  It is important we follow the peatlands strategy and choose the right treatment for each area.</p></speech>

The first is for Dr. Hendrick.  I refer to a study by Dr. Kim Naudts at the University of Amsterdam.</p><p>She stated:</p><blockquote>	In Europe, two and a half centuries of land-use change increased the forest area by 10% and has put over 85% of the forests under management, but it has failed to result in net CO<sub>2</sub>removal from the atmosphere, because wood extraction released carbon otherwise stored in the biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil carbon pools.  In addition, converting deciduous forests into coniferous forests resulted in changes in albedo, canopy roughness, and evapotranspiration from the land surface, which contributed to<br /><br />warming rather than mitigating it.  Hence, any climate framework that includes land management as a pathway for climate mitigation should not only account for land-cover changes but also should equally address changes in forest management, because not all forest management contributes to climate change mitigation.   </blockquote><p>Could the witnesses comment on her findings given the Irish context and their opinion of the future of our forest management?  <br/><br/>My second question is for Professor N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in.  The comprehensive study showed that the percentage of forest cover in Leitrim is way above the national average.  She also noted that spruce is the dominant species at 61% compared with 51% nationally.  Almost all of those surveyed - 96% - said that they would not under any circumstances consider selling all or part of their holdings for forestry purposes?  They were quite opposed to it and indicated that they did not favour any further afforestation of the county yet Professor N&iacute; Dhubh&aacute;in states that the resistance to afforestation is often proportional to the length of time a community has been associated with forestry.  Given that Leitrim has seen almost a century of afforestation policy and has very high coverage, does she agree that the resistance to further expansion in this instance is not based on time to afforestation?  <br/><br/>I have two questions for the Department.  I come from Dublin city so I am an urbanite.  Twenty years ago through Dublin City Council, the Tree Council of Ireland gave a lot of residents, who took it up, a free tree.  I see that rowan tree growing in my back garden.  It is a private place.  Twenty years ago, we did not have an appreciation of the environmental good that trees do but we do now.  Is involving, educating and encouraging urbanites, who cannot be forgotten when we talk about afforestation, part of the plan?  Does the Department plan to plant 440 million trees by 2040?  <br/><br/>My last question is for Ms Hurley, Mr. Murphy and perhaps the Department.  It was said that timber will provide sustainable building materials to replace carbon-heavy steel and concrete.  Walking around Dublin 15 years ago, the facades were wooden.  They became ugly and were banned by Dublin City Council.  Is there a need for local authorities to stipulate that a percentage of the interior infrastructure - not the wooden panels but the holding and bricks - needs to be put in for when submitting a planning application to replace the steel?  When we first started talking about timber frame houses at about the same time, there was stuff about insurance.  Insurance would be so high as to be unaffordable.  Would this still be the case if we were to use wood as a replacement for carbon-heavy steel and concrete?</p></speech>

In its fifth report, which it issued a number of years ago, the panel concluded conclusively that the best mitigation we can get from forests is threefold - material substitution, sequestration and the use of bio-energy.  This has been endorsed by quite a number of scientists in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  The best way to mitigate climate change is by managing the forests sustainably, increasing forest cover, reducing the amount of deforestation and using wood products to substitute for energy-intensive materials.  This has been endorsed and agreed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p></speech>

The national average is 11% while in Leitrim, it is 18.9%.  That is what we found in the national forest inventory.  This is partly reflective of the fact that the quality of the land in Leitrim is possibly marginal for agriculture but very suitable for afforestation.  Although Senator Devine quoted figures that about 96% did not want to sell land for forestry, this figure is from 1975.  There has been long-documented resistance to afforestation in Leitrim, nevertheless 18.9% of the county has been afforested, half of that by private individuals, so certainly some of them have changed their minds regarding afforestation and have planted.</p></speech>

I can say that timber frame housing is becoming ever more popular.  Over 15% of houses in England are now timber frame while the figure in Scotland is over 30%.  Most houses in the US and elsewhere in the world are timber frame so there is no reason for any issues with insurance premiums.  Timber frame is very safe.</p></speech>

What the Senator might be talking about is possibly an initiative of the local authority but we would be happy to discuss with the local authority if it wants to get back into that space.  We do things around national tree week, particularly with schools.  We did a lot of stuff with science week recently with Science Foundation Ireland, again, around schools.  Many schools in urban areas would have received trees and would have had planting ceremonies.  We are very keen.  It goes back to communication.  Everybody must understand the multifunctional benefits of forestry irrespective of where they live.  Even if someone lives in Dublin, chances are he or she makes good use of the forest resources in the Dublin Mountains.  Not to speak for Coillte Nature but one of its high-level goals in its early announcements was around reorienting some of the forests in the Dublin Mountains.  That is the kind of thing that will certainly engage the urban population as well.  There are a lot of things.  I agree with the Senator that we need to engage everybody in understanding the benefits of forestry.</p></speech>

I will start with Forest Industries Ireland.  I was pleasantly surprised by the submission we received because if I interpret it correctly, there is a very clear message from Forest Industries Ireland involving a reaching out to all other stakeholders in respect of a vision for forestry for the future.  I perceive - correct me if I am wrong - that there is a tension between the forestry industry and people in NGOs who are advocating for mixed use, greater use of broadleaf species and mixed forests, and there is an ongoing battle involving the dreaded conifer and so on.  Am I interpreting Forest Industries Ireland's statement correctly when I state that there is a mood within Forest Industries Ireland that wishes to reach out to those NGOs and a broader set of stakeholders to have that engagement to see if there can be some meeting of minds regarding what the future looks like?</p></speech>

Moving the business forward will require all of the stakeholders and parties to be for forestry and afforestation and to be supportive of the timber industry.  There is no value to any of us in trying to plough on alone.  I apologise if I get slightly parochial but one of the things I have spoken to my own team about is that we want to grow and must move forward but we cannot have another beef crisis, as we had recently.  We must be able to continue to make the growers and landowners prosper.  The processors must be able to do it and we must increase the markets for timber, which people want to buy, so that we create more value and can afford to reward all of the people investing in it.</p><p>It is a very competitive world.  We have to balance commercial competitiveness and making money out of what we harvest with the environmental mix and the beauty of broad-leaf trees.  Driving that forward is a matter of everybody talking and recognising each other's viewpoints.  The industry wants to reach out and do that to ensure a bigger future for it and for the people.  We see ourselves as a major employer, creating jobs in the area I live in, for example, and keeping people living there. </p></speech>

If there was a clear offer on the part of IBEC, Forest Industries Ireland, FII, or the relevant NGOs to start this process with some sort of summit on the future, that would be a very good result.  I would welcome that.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the multi-annual financial framework.  I do not know what stage it has reached or where forestry sits in that.  Farmers are arguably farming to schemes.  We recognise that from a social and cultural point of view it is very difficult for farmers to give up farming livestock if they have been doing so for three or four generations and switch to afforestation.  I take the point made by the two doctors about the proportion of a given holding that is given over to forestry.  Is there scope within the next round of CAP and the next multi-annual financial framework to have clear schemes and financial packages to incentivise climate action among farmers on this island?  That could include afforestation or biodiversity measures.  Is it the understanding of Mr. Moore or Mr. Hayes that the CAP is moving in the direction of incentivising climate action on the part of farmers and landowners?</p></speech>

The Commission and the Ministers are very clear that the next CAP is about delivering more environmental dividends than have ever been delivered before and responding to the climate emergency.  Some 40% of the next CAP will be set aside for climate and environmental measures.  In my opening remarks I stated that one of the key factors which will drive the success of the climate action plan and help us meet its goals will be better integration between the next CAP and the next national forestry programme.  That could mean that agri-environment schemes under the next CAP will involve significant amounts of tree-planting, which was not always the case in the past.</p></speech>

That is at a high level and is broader than CAP, so I will not comment in too much detail.  The Commission has produced a proposal for a transitional regulation which will take us from the end of the current CAP in 2020 to the next CAP.  There is an expectation that the next CAP will be slightly delayed.  Whether that transition period is one year or longer, these are all the issues that are being discussed by agriculture ministers in Brussels, the European Parliament and the Commission.  There is no final decision on that.  It is all a bit up in the air but to answer the Deputy's original question, nobody is taking their eye off the ball when it comes to driving climate measures under the next CAP.  That is very much a part of our thinking.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses disabuse me of my perception that the COFORD Council is nothing but a talking shop and that no real policy interventions arise from it?

In the last several years the COFORD Council has developed a range of policies and advice for the Department.  As the members know, the COFORD Council is appointed by the Minister to advise him on matters of forestry policy.  In the last several years, the COFORD Council has been actively involved in producing a range of reports on climate change, ecosystem services and the availability of land for afforestation.  The Minister of State is currently examining several reports on the reasons foresters do not engage in certain services and farmers do not engage in forestry.  It has also done very important work on timber mobilisation and production forecasting.  I am pleased to note that the next COFORD Council will run for three years, from 2019 to 2021.  We have set up a range of working groups.  The first working group concerns forestry and climate change and will advise the Government on a range of issues.  We also have a group working on the socioeconomic impacts of forestry.  Another working group has been set up to look at forest genetics, tree-breeding and forest resilience.  The work of the COFORD Council is very important.  It helps to inform policy and will inform the direction of funding in the next several years.</p></speech>

To add to what Mr. Moore said, the COFORD Council is a very important forum for stakeholders.  It is not a talking shop.  It comes up with recommendations which are passed to the Department.  For example our wood forecast, which runs to 2035, has been developed by the COFORD Council and stakeholder forum.  This forum brings saw-millers, end users and so on together.  It is a very important forum which allows stakeholders to see that they are being listened to and are influencing forest policy developments.</p></speech>

My understanding is that under the climate action plan Coillte is committed to replanting or restocking a total of 34,770 ha between 2016 and 2020.  Is that effort on target?  Moreover, the witnesses mentioned that 20% of the estate is managed for biodiversity.  Will that be extended across that 34,770 ha?</p></speech>

In fact, we are ahead of our target.  This year we will carry out a planting programme of 9,000 ha.  We will plant 9,500 ha next year, so we are on target.  Biodiversity is accounted for within that.</p></speech>

I want to start by reminding everyone that the emergency we are currently going through is both a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency.  This is important in the context of this discussion, particularly where Coillte is concerned.  Its representatives say that Coillte manages one fifth of its estate primarily for biodiversity.  I am disappointed to hear that.  It falls well short of what is required.  I used to live beside a Coillte forest in Donegal and I utterly hated it.  The forest floor was dark.  Nothing grew on it.  There were no insects, butterflies or bees and consequently no frogs.  The run-off from the forest made the water acidic, to the point that it would sting.  In discussing reforestation and the number of hectares that are planted we need to be very careful not to repeat the mistakes of the past.  As Einstein said, we do not solve our problems by repeating the mistakes that created them in the first place.  We need a clear path for Coillte to pursue afforestation to the extent that is required in the country without the destruction that has happened in the west of Ireland.</p><p>Anyone who has driven through counties Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim or Galway knows that the level of Sitka spruce planting there is offensive to the eye.  </p><p> I acknowledge that Ms Hurley is new to the job.  In 2012, there was an attempt to privatise or part privatise Coillte.  I was part of a successful campaign led by Deputy Boyd Barrett to stop the privatisation of the forests.  Are there any plans to sell off part or all of Coillte to private enterprise?</p><p> One of the priority recommendations of the working committee that held several meetings on these issues was that there should be a full review conducted of Coillte.  That does not form part of the Government's climate action plan, but it is something that the committee wanted to see happen.  There are many legacy issues in that regard.  May we see the memorandum of understanding between Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na?</p><p> That kind of leads on to my next question, which is more for the biologists, scientists and eco people.  There is a concern that reforestation of the wetlands may have a net negative effect on sequestration and carbon emissions because bogs and wetlands sequester more carbon than trees potentially do.  If we are going to plant trees on the wetlands, will there be a net impact on our CO2 emissions?  Would it not be better to focus on regenerating the bogs?  Of course, if one does so, the problem is what one says to farmers and others in places such as Leitrim and Mayo in the west of Ireland.  It seems that most of the incentive for reforestation is not going to small farmers of the sort shown in the "Ear to the Ground" television programme which featured a lovely farm where trees, cattle and sheep mixed together because there was a lot of space between the trees.  The Department referred to that model.  Where is the financial incentive for the poorer smaller farmers to gain from such reforestation?  All the incentives seem to be going one way.  A resident of County Leitrim interviewed on the RT&Eacute; "CountryWide" radio programme stated that Norwegian and Danish investment funds are buying up land.  There are approximately four such funds operating in his village.  Some regular people who have money are buying up the land around the country in order to make more money.  The residents of the village do not want any more Sitka spruce planted.  As was pointed out, 18.9% of County Leitrim is afforested, most of it with Sitka spruce.  To reach the national target of 18%, are we going to further saturate places such as County Leitrim?  According to the man interviewed in that recent edition of "CountryWide", global companies are buying up land in poorer areas to plant more forestry.  I would like all or any of the witnesses to try to answer my questions.</p><p> On a lighter note, something struck me when Mr. Murphy referred to Forest Industries Ireland making wood pellets: was it involved in the cash-for-ash scandal?</p></speech>

Coillte is the custodian of a State asset and it is ultimately a matter for our shareholders to decide how we are dealt with.  I wish to clarify that I am unaware of moves for any part of the business or its operations to be sold off.  Indeed, in my short time in the organisation it has been very clear to me that Coillte provides many social benefits.  I understand the Deputy's earlier question, to which we will return.  Many social benefits such as recreational facilities, hiking trails and so on are provided because they fit within what Coillte does.  I am unaware of any plans to sell off part or all of the business.  I am aware of the suggestion that Coillte be subject to a full review. </p> <p>  On the memorandum of understanding with Bord na M&oacute;na, we would be happy to revert to the committee with further information.

We recently carried out a full bioclassification of that 20%, or 90,000 ha, and identified international, national and local level biodiversity value.  Part of that exercise identified 20,000 ha of international class biodiversity which we are now investing in enhancing and restoring.  That does not mean there is no biodiversity in the rest of the estate.  There is biodiversity across our estate.  As the Deputy stated, from a commercial point of view Sitka spruce is the predominant species, at 53%.  That is so because of its success in terms of productivity, timber products, climate and carbon.  However, we are very mindful of biodiversity within our forest operations outside of certain areas.  We always seek to enhance and restore where we can.</p></speech>

One sometimes gets an increase in greenhouse gas emissions when one starts to rewet them because there is a change from a degrading CO2 to methane being emitted, but that gradually alters.  There is much good evidence that rewetting of wetlands and peatlands gives a net carbon benefit over time.  The forest service has moved away from grant aiding afforestation on peatlands for a significant period.  Some areas with small layers of peat are afforested but they would not be classified as peatland.  There is good research evidence to show that on those soils, which can be highly productive for forestry, that gives a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  Basically, one must look at the site type and so on.</p> <p>  On rewetting and the midland peatlands, a landscape level approach is taken.  It is probable that a substantial portion of the cutaway is suitable for rewetting, which will deliver climate change mitigation benefits.  Other parts are suitable for planting trees.  One must bear in mind that some of these areas in the midlands were once forest.  Some of the basal peat layers come from wood.  Birch, yew and oak grew in those forests a long time ago.  Those areas are suitable for growing trees.  The goal is not blanket afforestation of cutaway, which would be a bad idea.  A sensitive landscape approach needs to be taken, looking at afforestation, rewetting and other land uses in the context of biodiversity and climate change mitigation.</p></speech>

I do not intend to comment on the specifics of the Coillte-Bord na M&oacute;na proposal.  Like any other planting proposal in this country, this project will be subject to the full rigours of our approvals process, which involves appropriate assessment.  In light of the scale of this project, an environmental impact assessment will probably be necessary as well.  All of the issues raised by the Deputy need to be teased out.  When one is pursuing a project like this, one does not plant trees just for the carbon benefit.  I say that in response to what has been said about the issue of biodiversity.  All of these broader environmental dividends will need to be factored in as well as the environmental challenges.  We are a bit away from that because we are not even at the application stage.  All of these things will be factored in.</p></speech>

When I was in Brussels last Thursday, I met people from around the Commission.  The vast majority of them are foursquare behind additional forestry in Europe.  The Deputy is absolutely right when she suggests that there is a wind of change towards more mixed forests with more diversity.  This is being advocated with a view towards protecting our forests against future climate change, as well as using them to combat future climate change.  The situation is changing.  A new green deal will come out of Brussels shortly.  That will contain a lot of talk about what forestry will look like in the future.</p></speech>

Some of my questions have been asked already.  I would like to ask the witnesses from Coillte about the planting of forestry on peaty soils.  This matter has been discussed already.  The reply to a parliamentary question that was tabled last week clarified that we do not have a current estimate of the net carbon losses as a result of peatland afforestation.  Surely this is the kind of thing we should be looking at.  Discussions about such ideas should be taking place within Coillte as an organisation.  I accept that everything it does is subject to assessment.  I assume Coillte looks at this stuff.  What is Mr. Carlin's view on the estimate of net carbon losses?  Has anything been done in this respect?  I have to admit a personal interest in the question of Balcas wood pellets.  It was suggested recently that wood contributes to smoke damage for people.

We are working with the Council for Forest Research and Development as well.  More than ever, when we are doing forest operations like clear felling on peaty soils - deep peat, in particular - we are open to being really careful about what we do with the next rotation.  In some areas, it is right to put the forest back in place.  In other areas, it is a question of what makes sense from a commercial forestry point of view.  In some cases, we decide to leave the biodiversity forest alone as part of an effort to recreate and protect the carbon store.  In some areas in which we have taken trees away, we have rewetted over 3,000 ha.  We have another 2,000 ha to look at.  We are more conscious than ever that we have to be very careful with the reforestation of these areas.  There is work to be done on the carbon equation.</p></speech>

We are just starting our next cycle.  The results of the inventory are taken with the modelling to estimate the total amount of carbon in the forest estate.  We know exactly how much forest carbon is distributed across the entire estate.  It depends on the types of soil and species.  In general, we report to the EPA, which then reports to the UNFCCC on the total carbon sequestration of the forest estate for Ireland, which includes the Coillte forest estate.  It is true that peat soils have a different carbon dynamic from mineral soils.  Overall, the entire forest estate is still a net sink for carbon dioxide.</p></speech>

Wood pellets would have 3% of the particulate emissions if they were burned wet without any of the protection of burning wet firewood.  They are 97% better in the sense that they have 97% less particulate emissions.  If one puts any sort of half-decent small ESB or electrostatic precipitator onto that equipment, it will bring that figure down to virtually zero.  I do not expect wood pellets to be classed in the same breath as a smoky wood fuel.  That is because they are dry.</p></speech>

The wood fuel quality assurance scheme, which is operated by Ervia, certifies wood suppliers that meet certain standards.  Anyone who wishes to become a member of the International Standards Organisation's standard on wood fuels - ISO 17225 - has to provide wood fuel firewood with a moisture content of 25% or less.  There is very good evidence to show that if we reduce the moisture content of wood fuels in Ireland from 30% firewood to 20%, which is eminently achievable, we can reduce particulate emissions by a factor of two or three.  As we all know, there is a lot of wood fuel out on the market that has a moisture content of considerably more than 30%.  If we combine the use of proper combustion technologies with the new ecodesign regulation, which is coming in on 1 January 2020 with regard to boilers and from 1 January 2022 with regard to wood stoves, there will be a considerable reduction in emissions from wood combustion.

They have given rise to more questions that I would like to ask.  However, I will try to focus on a few clear points.  While I do not wish to contradict Mr. Hendrick directly, it is important to clarify that when the UN talks about material substitution, sequestration and bioenergy, it is not talking about the same tree.  The need for large numbers of trees requires a huge scale of afforestation - not necessarily commercial afforestation, but afforestation which serves a role in terms of sequestration.  We need to be really clear that there is not an endorsement that all forestry must be commercially exploited as substitution or indeed bioenergy.  That is certainly not the position as I understand it.  The most recent IPCC land use report, which came out earlier this year and has been debated at this committee, seems to contradict any such suggestion.  Other witnesses may wish to comment on this in their responses.  While the report does not use such language, I suggest that a "keep it in the ground" perspective is a core element of its approach to land use.</p> <p>  The other key function, in addition to those functions, is biodiversity.  We are facing the twin crisis of an ecological crisis with a huge level of species collapse and an absolutely linked climate crisis.  I sometimes worry that the focus on carbon maths causes us to forget about the accelerants of climate change, one of which will be biodiversity loss.</p><p>I will focus on that and build on some of the questions Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith asked.</p><p> Mr. Purser mentioned that 70% of the carbon capture is in the soils.  We know that, for example, in the first five years of a tree being planted there can be a carbon loss during that period because of the turning up of soil and so forth.  That is one of the reasons retention of trees for longer and moving away from clear felling is so important.  Mr. Purser indicated that he has concerns about clear felling but I ask the Forest Industries Ireland and Coillte witnesses to be clear on where they stand on continuous cover and whether that is a future policy they will move towards, as they have moved on broadleaf, and the extent to which that policy will become central in the future.</p><p> On the issue of broadleaf, we are still looking at a figure of 27% in terms of the species mix in forests planted in 2018.  However, I hear from people who have engaged around forestry and they still find that many foresters talk to them about the practice of broadleaf fringing, that is, broadleaf around the edge of a core, which might be a monocultural crop like Sitka spruce.  That is a major concern.  What measures have been taken to address that practice?  If we are talking to the witnesses in two years time, will Sitka spruce still be a majority in terms of species mix?  What will be the percentage of Sitka spruce in our future forestry plans and what measures will the witnesses introduce to achieve that?</p><p> Broadleaf fringing is also an issue in terms of wildlife and biodiversity corridors, and the national pollinator plan.  We have not heard much mention of the national pollinator plan.  How are the witnesses' forestry strategies ensuring effective enhancement of the national pollinator plan?</p><p> That brings me to the CAP.  With respect, policy is our business.  We are legislators.  Policy is not an issue that is out of discussion.  We are not asking these questions for the good of our health.  I ask about future policy and the advice, suggestions or recommendations this committee might give towards future policy, which is the reason we are here.  We need more clarity on current policy from the Department.  The application for CAP funding may be a period of time away but as Mr. Hayes acknowledged, the negotiations are happening now.  What is the Irish position on the negotiations in terms of issues such as broadleaf percentages in forestry, the pollinator plans and co-benefits?  That is something that relates to the CAP because rather than talking about an individual farmer, for example, will there be a layer of co-benefits where landowners co-operate with each other around the creation of, say, a pollinator pathway?  Is that something we would be looking to be additionally recognised for and that would be reflected in payments?  Is that an issue on which we are advocating?</p><p> Has Ireland taken a position on the issue of clear felling versus continuous cover?  Are we in that discussion?  The reason we are here is to talk about our plans and if a national climate plan is being produced in the coming weeks, it is relevant that we would hear where we are in the negotiations.</p><p> There are many issues I want to raise but I will conclude shortly to ensure I have a chance to come back in.</p></speech>

Those are issues internationally.  In terms of the regional economic development, RED, funding, and under the UN funding, we know that farmers in Uganda, Kenya and other countries around the world are facing issues in accessing these mega-schemes.  Can Ireland be an advocate within Europe, and in the international discussions, and say that when we looked at those in detail we realised that they were issues?

The general point I would make around that is that what we try to do all the time is strike a balance in terms of the economic, social and environmental aspects.  From an economic point of view, house builds need to double in Ireland and in the UK.  There is a demand for 3.4 billion cu. m of timber, and timber is a good product.  It is a better product than other carbon-heavy products.  We need those products.  Forty per cent of the world's timber comes from 7% of the world's forests.  Getting timber products efficiently from plantation forests allows us to safeguard our own growth forests.  We need these timber products and we need to get them in an economic way but also in a social and environmental way also.  It is critically important that we understand that we need the timber products.</p> <p>  When it comes to silvicultural systems, we operate different silvicultural systems.  We operate long-term attention where we want to keep the forest covered, particularly in recreational areas.  We operate small group felling where we want to change the age structure within the forests.  We operate clear felling reforestation, which is the most productive in terms of timber production, and we operate continuous cover forestry in areas particularly of high biodiversity or landscape sensitivity.  We are trying to look at that balance all the time and ask ourselves what is the best silvicultural treatment to deliver the economic, social and environmental benefits from our forests.  We are open to any dialogue on the best way to achieve that but it is important that we achieve all of those.  We have to have a good recreation and social policy but also protect, enhance and restore biodiversity while keeping a vibrant industry that is producing sustainable products.  The great point about forestry is that every single tonne of timber that is used is saving 2 tonnes of carbon.</p></speech>

To answer the Senator's question, there are areas of forest that should never be touched because their nature value is extremely high.  They should be retained and not used.  There are examples in Europe and across the globe.</p> <p>  On the general question as to whether it is better to tackle climate change by not felling managed forests or to keep the carbon in the forest, the scientific census I indicated is that it is better to harvest the managed forests in the context of biodiversity enhancement and so on.  That was the point I made.</p></speech>

On the type of forestry we want to do, the industry's position is that we should do both.  We should do more close to nature forestry and more biodiversity, but we should also produce products for that benefit.</p></speech>

Let us see where it goes from here.  It will probably move in a particular direction.</p> <p>  The bigger point is that if we want to take advantage of forestry for climate change benefit, it has to scale.  If we continue to come up with many reasons not to do it, it is similar to coming up with many reasons not to do wind farms, allow people get on bicycles-----</p></speech>

The questions from the members have been fantastic.  As elected members, I presume they reflect the demands on forests from society.  It is clear that a great deal is asked of our forests in terms of the social, environmental and commercial services they provide.</p><p>It is not a question of saying that these forests are delivering biodiversity, these are delivering recreational value and these are where we go to get our timber.  We can do all those things.  In some forests there is a greater emphasis on one product or service than in others but all forests should be capable of producing many or all those products and services.  We need to get away from the idea that the function of a forest is to produce timber and nothing else.  That has been alluded to and I know that Coillte is working on policies and practices around that.  What we are advocating is the continuous cover forest management system which offers the opportunity to commercially manage forests.  I am speaking from experience here.  Deputy Niamh Smyth very kindly referred to me earlier as an ecologist but I am not an ecologist.  I am a commercial forester; that is my job.  I manage commercial forests for private forest owners whose bottom line is that they need a cheque from timber sales.  They get that cheque but we are also able to manage those forests through skills we have developed to deliver the other social and environmental services.  This is part of a forestry culture that we need to develop in Ireland.  The way in which the forest sector in Ireland developed was related to the fact that we had only 1% of land under forest at the start of the last century.  There was an emphasis on planting new forests and that was achieved.  Now we need to move on and figure out how to transition those forests into more permanent and multifunctional spaces that deliver on the demands of society, as reflected in the questions posed today.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the question as to why we are not engaging in more detail on the CAP right now and to dispel the notion that detailed consideration is not ongoing.  There is a whole other forum out there which is considering the shape of the next CAP and what it should look like.  The Minister has established a CAP consultative committee on which there are environmental NGOs and various other social partners.  That discussion is very much ongoing.  What will the next CAP look like in terms of biodiversity and climate?  It will be a mix of trees, organic farming and a whole host of other things.  I am not sure if Senator Higgins or this committee has made a submission to the CAP consultation process.  Lots of people have made submissions so perhaps that is something for the committee to consider.  Obviously, the high level point still stands.  We do not even know what the budget for the next CAP will be and without an idea of the budget, one cannot fix the individual schemes.  That said, one can still have the discussion and that discussion is taking place.</p> <p>  Finally, pollinators were mentioned and the Department is hugely supportive of the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  We are also a significant financial supporter of the National Biodiversity Data Centre and its work.  I would like to give one example of the crossover between woodlands and bees.  Earlier this year we launched an initiative to encourage owners and local bee organisations to use native woodlands to host beehives and open up these habitats to foraging bees.  This is part of the implementation of the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  There is a huge amount going on but this type of whistle-stop format does not allow us to elaborate further.  However, I would be happy to bilaterally deal with any issues or questions.</p></speech>

I note that the average size of a forestry plantation is 7 ha.  I own a young plantation and am very interested in this issue.  I welcome the establishment of Coillte Nature and look forward to seeing how it pans out.  There was some discussion around planting on cutaway bogs.  I accept that some bogs are so cut away that they can only be planted on and cannot be re-wet.  However, data suggests that drainage of peat soils for forestry has a negative effect on greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions into surface water.  We should probably be avoiding draining such soils.  However, Dr. N&iacute; Dh&uacute;bhain indicated that planting on peaty soil no longer happens.  I ask the representatives from the Department or Coillte to confirm that is the case.  If not, should we consider discontinuing that planting practice?  A decision not to drain peat soils for planting means that we need to increase planting on what could be described as better soils.  What is the Department's view of this aspect of our forestry programme?  Agroforestry has been mentioned a number of times today.  I am a big fan of agroforestry and am staggered to hear that we have only 51 ha in the country under agroforestry.  I do not know of any near my home but would love to have some on my own farm.  It is a forestry model that the Department should be really getting behind because it facilitates farming animals along with growing forests.</p></speech>

I absolutely agree with the Senator's comments on agroforestry.  One of the main initiatives we took in the mid-term review was to treble the rate of agroforestry.  The Minister hosted an open day recently on a site in Kilcock, County Kildare.  We also increased the grant rates.  It is a bit of slow burner.  Some of the feedback on it suggests that the premium period needs to be longer and the Minister has publicly commented on that.  That is something that we need to reflect on in the context of the next forestry programme.  I share the Senator's enthusiasm for agroforestry because it is a good gateway into forestry and allows for farming and forestry to co-exist.  We are big supporters of it and we will definitely see more of it in the future.</p></speech>

We have rules which do not allow for any planting on blanket or raised bogs.  The vast majority of planting takes place on mineral soils which are basically wet clay soils that cover large parts of Ireland.  Planting on soils that are a bit peaty can produce emissions in the first number of years but as the forests mature and close canopy, they become a net sink of carbon dioxide.  The Senator is correct in terms of plantations and soil disturbance.  When there is soil disturbance it produces some emissions but generally when the forest starts to grow, develop and close canopy, those emissions reduce and the forest turns back into a net sink.</p></speech>

How many years after planting can thinning begin?  I am thinking of farmers or landowners who are considering adopting this method from scratch rather than converting an existing forest.  How soon can thinning take place and what sort of revenue might they expect from their thinnings?  Are there any special infrastructure requirements for continuous cover as opposed to standard monoculture forests?</p></speech>

Obviously, as Coillte has said, it is important to plant the right trees in the right place, with the right management.  That is the best time to set out compatible species that are suitable for the site.  Most of the work we are doing in Pro Silva and in continuous cover forestry in Ireland is in transforming even-aged monocultural crops and that starts at the time of first thinning which is somewhere between 15 and 20 years of age.  Early thinnings in that process are very similar to what one might do under a conventional system but things change over time.</p><p>There is an emphasis on timber quality and forest retention.  There are specific techniques we use.  In the transformation period, the first few thinnings do not differ significantly from a conventional management approach.</p></speech>

To give a little bit of context, Coillte has been managing its forests on a sustainable basis for a very long time.  There has been a great focus on balance.  As the organisation thinks about balance, we think about social, environmental and economic factors.  We continue to evolve and to recognise changes in requirements and in what we can offer to Ireland.  Coillte Nature was established this year.  It is a non-profit entity which aims to increase focus on certain areas.  I will give three very brief examples.  There was mention earlier of the Bord na M&oacute;na memorandum of understanding.  That is part of the Coillte Nature initiatives on which we are working.  There was also a mention of the Dublin uplands and the conservation of what are currently commercial woodlands which will, over time, become recreational forests.  There is also a focus on biodiversity.  One of our early initiatives in that regard is a biodiversity restoration project in Hazelwood in Sligo.  Coillte Nature is a further evolution in what we can do to improve balance in a given area.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Murphy.  I will not mention the companies involved but am I correct in saying that cut-offs and waste timber left over from a site can be used for different processing or generation activities in Northern Ireland but that the EPA will not grant people in the South licences to use timber in that way?</p> <p>  Mr. McAuley asked why people do not want to get into forestry.  He is right.  There is a need for commercial operators.  The likes of ECC Timber and Murray Timber Group provide employment.  We need a certain amount of activity to ensure that we keep jobs in certain areas, such as in Connemara.  The problem is that what has gone on has left a bad taste in many people's mouths.  We have an estimate at the moment.  Will Mr. Hayes tell me what we have not achieved in the last few years?  My understanding is that we have 5,000 ha or 6,000 ha less than our target.  We are now saying that we will plant 8,000 ha per year.  Some 80% of land west of Galway has been designated such that it cannot be planted.  One cannot plant in Mayo.  Going around the country, where will we get the land?  We are living a lie in this room if we believe we are going to achieve something which we will not.  </p> <p>  I hope I will be corrected if I am wrong but I have dealt with Departments with regard to people who have bought land from Coillte on which the trees were fit for cutting and in respect of which there was an obligation to plant on raised bog - wet peatland.  Can anyone here tell me that one does not have to replant in that situation?  The fact is that one has to replant on raised bog.  </p> <p>  Some 6% of our countryside is covered in forestry, much of which is broadleaf, planted by farmers and State bodies.  Not one bit of this is used in calculating our emissions.  What is our Department doing to resolve that issue?  Such forestry all over Ireland is excluded from these statistics.  Why do we not have schemes for areas of 0.5 acres to 50 acres and an acre to 100 acres?  If we want to encourage the planting of broadleaves to reduce net emissions, shelter belts of 30 broadleaf trees could be planted along ditches under an environmental or CAP scheme without interfering with farming.  We could plant 60,000 ha in one year.  Our big problem is that we do not have the money for it.  </p> <p>  Mr. McAuley has asked why farmers are not willing to go down this road.  Coillte has partnerships with farmers with which there are problems it has not addressed.  Mr. McAuley and I both know that, in the business world, one person tells another who tells another.  Coillte says that it is engaging.  Engaging is not solving.  At one time, when one was sowing timber, it was done on the bad piece of land at the back of the garden or the end of the field.  That day is gone now.  That will not happen.  One has to have a better standard of land.  This has left a bad taste in the mouths of many farmers and word spreads.  Farmers are becoming reluctant to plant.  Mr. Hayes will be familiar with the case of a farmer who has been in forestry for three years.  I have contacted him and his people over the last year or 18 months in this regard.  This farmer wants to brash trees for access.  A licence was given to dig drains.  This has been going around in circles.  This person who has planted forestry is trying to improve it and the Department has not addressed the problem.  People wonder why more people are not going down the road of forestry.  How many licences are being stopped by the so-called environmentalists who are going to save the world?  How many roads are being blocked?  How many areas in which people want to plant trees are being blocked?  This in not being addressed.  The Derrybrien case has been a problem.  We have addressed nothing.</p></speech>

This morning's meeting is a quarterly review of the health service with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, his officials along with the chief executive officer of the HSE and his staff regarding the current state of our health service.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister and Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health.  I understand that a number of junior Ministers will attend later this morning.  We will welcome them as they arrive.  I also welcome Mr. Paul Reid, chief executive officer of the HSE, Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, Mr. Liam Woods, national director, acute operations, and Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer.</p><p>I would like to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#D00200"><p>I thank the committee members for inviting me to attend today.  I am pleased to be joined by the Secretary General of the Department of Health, the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive and senior HSE officials, and to have an opportunity to update the committee regarding current issues.</p> <p>   Regarding Sl&aacute;intecare, officials at my Department have been engaging with stakeholders to gain insights into what they want and expect from our health services.  One of the resounding messages to emerge is the need to have a clear and coherent plan.  Sl&aacute;intecare is now that plan.  I am pleased to say that the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is now well under way.  Planning and co-design for the new regional health areas has begun.  Co-design is an important part of Sl&aacute;intecare and means that patients and staff who live and work in the region play a part in setting up that regional structure.  Following consultation with the Sl&aacute;intecare office, I will make a recommendation to the Government on the exact structure of each region early in the new year.  </p> <p>  A forum to provide a regular platform for dialogue between the State and voluntary providers of health and social care services is also being set up.  It will have an overarching mandate to build a stronger relationship between the State and voluntary providers for the benefit of patients and service users.  The forum will meet for the first time in December.  I had an opportunity to address an initial meeting of that forum, and I thank Mr. Peter Cassells for agreeing to chair it.  The integration fund of &euro;20 million is supporting 122 projects across the country and, via that &euro;20 million, we will hire 300 additional staff to work in the community.  In each of the Deputies' constituencies, therefore, Sl&aacute;intecare projects are now up and running in each county delivering reform in health services on the ground in our communities.  </p> <p>  To reduce community waiting lists, an important and sensitive issue, we will spend &euro;60 million between now and 2021 to employ an additional 1,000 community healthcare staff by the end of 2020.  These will be people able to treat our citizens closer to home.  In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of primary care centres.  Some 127 primary care centres are open, but it is fair to make the point that we need to staff them better.  Deputy O'Reilly has made that point vigorously and regularly.  We have fine buildings and they are needed because they bring about a new and better way of working and new opportunities for our patients to access services locally.  We need to increase the staff in those facilities now, and that is what these 1,000 additional staff, the Sl&aacute;intecare workforce as I like to call them, are about as well.</p> <p>  I am acutely aware that along with any long-term plan, and we do need a long-term plan, we also need to address the issues facing us today.  I acknowledge the challenges facing accident and emergency departments in our hospitals and I accept that in some it is particularly difficult for our patients and staff.  The Government allocated a budget of an additional &euro;26 million to assist the HSE over the winter.  Specifically, this funding was to support and improve access to the fair deal scheme, helping our citizens to get into nursing homes quicker and to also provide additional homecare, transitional care, aids and appliances and other local actions to facilitate timely hospital discharge and reduce congestion.  </p> <p>  Specific funding has been allocated to local winter action teams to support initiatives at local level.  This is important.  Everything cannot just be about the Department of Health, the HSE and Dr. Steevens' Hospital deciding what individual areas are doing.  This process has to be about resourcing and empowering local winter action teams to enable them to respond to issues as they arise in their regions.  I am pleased to confirm a range of new and additional measures to alleviate pressures on accident and emergency departments.  The HSE has reached an agreement with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to open up to 190 extra hospital beds in the coming weeks.  When we factor in these 190 extra beds with the 40 additional beds in the modular unit in Clonmel, due to open in the new year, that brings us to a total of 230 additional hospital beds that will open between now and the start of 2020.</p> <p>  Importantly, the NTPF has written to each hospital groups and, as of today, I confirm that 83 beds have now approved, of the overall 190 beds.  These additional beds are in Letterkenny, Tullamore, Waterford, Cork, the national children's hospital and Limerick, in St. John's Hospital.</p><p>It is a matter that Senator Kieran O'Donnell has pursued with me as well.</p><p> The NTPF is continuing to engage with hospital groups to finalise the details of the additional capacity but the message is very simple.  If a hospital has opportunities to open additional capacity in its facilities, a nearby hospital or a level 2 or level 3 hospital, we will look at how we can fund that through the NTPF.  I commend both the NTPF and the HSE on the collaborative way they are working in this regard.  There are 230 additional hospital beds, including the Clonmel modular unit, and it is a very significant increase in capacity on top of the &euro;26 million already provided.</p><p> I confirm that in the coming week, I will sign a new statutory instrument to reduce the cost of attendance at a minor injury unit to &euro;75.  For many years, people have commented on the fact that it seems a little bizarre that we are trying to encourage people to attend a minor injury unit if it is the appropriate place to go but the cost of going to the minor injury unit was the same as the cost of going to an accident and emergency department.  That is &euro;100 if a person does not have a medical card.  In an effort to further incentivise use of our minor injury units, I have decided to reduce the cost to &euro;75.  That statutory instrument is currently being legally drafted and I expect to be able to sign it in the coming week.  I know the HSE will then implement it with immediate effect.  It will also provide an opportunity locally in the 11 minor injury units across the country to reinforce the importance of using the minor injury unit where we know people can be in and out in 90 minutes, two hours or even less time for many conditions.  That is without needing to go to the accident and emergency department, which is good news.</p><p> I am also working with Government colleagues to identify some additional funding for more social care supports on top of what we have already done.  There is &euro;26 million already in a winter plan and additional money is going to the HSE for the NTPF to open more beds; this relates to the 190 additional beds and the 40 beds in Clonmel.  On top of that I expect to be in the position within the next week to make further announcements on additional funding for extra support for home care, transitional care and some very good and innovative ideas that HSE colleagues have been working on at a hospital group level in recent days and weeks.  I wanted to update the committee on those new measures to try to provide additional assistance to our health service at what is a very busy time.</p><p> We have seen significant progress on waiting times for scheduled care.  It is not often heard or articulated but we should be clear that as a result of increased activity and the ongoing work between the HSE and the NTPF, the number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure - a hospital operation or procedure - fell to 66,594 in November from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017.  Month on month we are seeing in this country the number of people waiting for a hospital operation falling and the number of people having their hospital operation in less than three months is increasing.  Approximately 32% of people were getting their hospital operation in three months or less in 2017 and that figure is now 42%.  More than four in ten of us are now getting a hospital operation in 12 weeks or less, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare target.  We must build on that and increase the 42% figure even further.  We have seen an overall reduction of 23% in the number of people waiting for a hospital procedure.  The number of patients waiting more than three months has fallen by 21,400, or 37%, from July 2017 to November 2019.  There are fewer people waiting for a hospital operation and more people are being seen more quickly in connection with that operation.  There are fewer people waiting longer for such hospital operations as well.</p><p> We speak of waiting lists as if they are part of a global conversation but we can consider some of the specialties.  Ophthalmology relates to the treatment of eyes and the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure in this area fell by 63% from July 2017 to the end of November 2019.  In the ear, nose and throat specialty, the number of people waiting over three months for a procedure fell by 58% from 2017 to 2019.  The number of people waiting over three months for a cardiology procedure fell by 33%.  The world and its mother knows there are major challenges in our health services but it is important to acknowledge the progress being made by very hard-working staff, coupled with significant investment from the Government, in decreasing waiting times for hospital operations or procedures.</p><p> The key must now be our outpatients.  We need to consider how we can drive down the length of time people are waiting to see a hospital consultant.  That is why we will use a significant amount of the additional resources being provided to the NTPF to put in place further targeted measures in this regard.  We have seen the outpatient waiting list fall for three months in a row and we will see it fall for four months in a row.</p><p>For the first time in a long time the number of people waiting to see a hospital consultant is falling month on month, although it is still far too high.  My conversations with consultants will focus on how additional money for them will be about reforming how they work and how we make sure that public patients are not continually pushed to the bottom of hospital queues over those who can afford to pay for private health insurance.  We will be working with the HSE, the NTPF and the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office to produce plans for 2020 that will build on the progress that has been made to date.  We are working to identify initiatives that will meet the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare.  This is not the bad old days of the NTPF turfing out money to private hospitals.  Any initiative funded through the NTPF in 2020 must meet the Sl&aacute;intecare objectives and must include innovative approaches to increase activity, avoid hospital attendances and better utilise our smaller hospitals and our primary care centres.  The NTPF is not the NTPF of the Celtic tiger, when it was just a funding pot for private hospitals.  It must be used as an access fund for the public health service as well.  </p><p> A key focus for 2020 will be on moving care to more appropriate settings.  We have a number of specialties working in this regard, including ENT, orthopaedics, dermatology, ophthalmology, urology and gynaecology.  There are significant opportunities to make progress in those areas in 2020.  We will also be seeking to maximise the use of advanced nursing practitioners.  The days of everything being done by the doctor is an outdated model.  We have extremely well-qualified nurses in this country and advanced nurse practitioners who can lead clinics and provide entire episodes of care.  We also have physiotherapists who can manage orthopaedic clinics and people who can provide ophthalmology services in the community.  This extra funding must be about reform as well.</p><p> I would like to comment briefly on the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, aggregate report on cervical cancer and the CervicalCheck programme.  As the committee will be aware, on Tuesday, 3 December, I published the aggregate report of the independent expert panel review led by RCOG.  The committee will have an opportunity to discuss the report in detail on 18 December, when it will hear from both patient advocates and the college.  I do not intend to fill either of those spaces but it would be remiss of me not to make some comment.</p><p> I thank the expert panel who conducted this review and, in particular, all of the women and their next-of-kin who agreed to participate in it through the examination of the performance of the CervicalCheck programme.  The findings and conclusions contained in the review provide reassurance and, I hope, assist in restoring confidence in our programme and address its importance and quality, while also highlighting the sad and painful reality of the limitations of all of our screening programmes.  RCOG was asked to do this body of work for two reasons.  First, we felt, and rightly so, that the women of Ireland who had had cervical cancer deserved to have an independent clinical review of their screening history.  Second, the Government and I, as Minister for Health, wanted to be able to answer the questions that women were asking at a very difficult time for our screening service, namely, "Can I have confidence in our screening programme?" and "Is our screening programme working effectively?".  The good news is that the report finds that the CervicalCheck programme is working effectively and, crucially, that women can have confidence in the programme.  As I said earlier, the committee will have an opportunity next week to tease through the report in much greater detail with RCOG.  The key conclusions of the expert panel are that the CervicalCheck programme has undoubtedly saved the lives of many of those who participated in the review, that the programme is working effectively and that women can have confidence in it.</p><p> The panel emphasises that it is important to recognise the serious impact that screening failures have on the lives of women and their families.  Cervical cancer is a disgusting and devastating disease that disproportionately affects younger women.  It takes the lives of approximately 100 Irishwomen every year.  Some 300 women will get a diagnosis of cervical cancer each year.  Screening, in every country in the world, inevitably will have limitations.  There are limitations when it comes to cytology-based screening but this should not be taken to suggest the programme overall is not working.  As Minister, I have to reference the importance of the programme and how effectively it is working but that is not to in any way not acknowledge the significant pain and trauma of those who have cervical cancer and those who have been caught up in this awful debacle in regard to the non-disclosure of an audit.  If we are to achieve our goal of making cervical cancer a rare disease in this country, effectively eradicating it within a generation in Ireland, it is vital that women continue to attend for screening and that we continue to build on the considerable progress in other areas over the course of this year.  Smear test turnaround times, an issue on which I have been rightly scrutinised at this committee on many occasions, has stabilised.  I thank the staff of CervicalCheck and the HSE for their incredible work in this regard.  Implementation of Dr. Scally's recommendations is well under way.</p><p>In the first quarter of 2020, which is only weeks away, we will move to HPV primary screening, becoming one of the first countries in the world to do so.  I have written to the HSE to ask it to consider the recommendations from the review in the context of this crucial project to ensure it absolutely is delivered by the end of the first quarter of 2020.  I know it absolutely will be.</p><p> I am also pleased we have put in place another key element in restoring trust and confidence not just in screening but in our health service.  This is the patient safety Bill, which committee members will scrutinise here and in the D&aacute;il.  It will commence in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  It will bring about mandatory open disclosure.  As Dr. Scally said, when things go wrong in the health service, people want a sincere and genuine apology.  They want to know there is an understanding of what happened and an assurance it will not happen again.  The patient safety Bill will focus on open disclosure and will signal a new era for the health service.  The legislation will establish a robust and future-proofed framework for mandatory open disclosure.  Importantly, it will require notification of serious patient safety incidents to the external regulator, be it HIQA or the Mental Health Commission.  No doubt, this will contribute to national patient safety learning and improvement.</p><p> Importantly, mandatory open disclosure will apply not just to the public health service but also to the private health service.  For the first time we will extend the remit of HIQA to the private health service.  The new patient safety Bill places clear responsibilities and obligations on health service providers to ensure mandatory open disclosure occurs and external notification to the regulator takes place.  It is a significant cultural and legal change.</p><p> I understand the committee is interested in the care of women who have been affected by the use of mesh implants.  I have met the mesh survivors group on a number of occasions, most recently on 11 November, and I have listened to their personal stories.  I acknowledge very sincerely Deputy O'Reilly's work in this regard as an advocate and, perhaps, and interlocutor on occasion, for the advocacy group with the Government and the Department.  I acknowledge the very constructive way she has put forward their case and engaged with me.  I want to be very clear that I am fully committed to ensuring that all women who develop mesh related complications receive high-quality, multidisciplinary and patient-centred care.</p><p> Since the issue came to my attention in late 2017, an ongoing priority focus for the Department and the HSE has been to understand the clinical and technical issues and to put in place the necessary structures for, and the provision of, care for women who have been affected by the use of mesh.  It is very clear to me when I meet the women and hear their stories the trauma, pain and agony they have been put through.  Quite frankly, there has been physical agony and mental anguish.  I requested the chief medical officer to do a body of work.  He thoroughly examined the issue and prepared a report for me on the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures and responding to women experiencing mesh complications.  We published the report in November last year.  It includes a number of significant recommendations in a number of key areas.  It also put a pause on the use of mesh in Ireland until we get to a point when we can be satisfied that all of the recommendations have been met.  The HSE has advised that a package of care is now available for women who have been identified with urgent or immediate needs.  In addition, the HSE's service plan will ensure the continued implementation of the chief medical officer's report on transvaginal mesh as a priority action.  We are also continuing to progress the delivery of care pathways for women, including a specialist, multidisciplinary national mesh complications service.</p><p> I am also looking at the issue of access to medical cards.  I had a very good discussion with the group and Deputy O'Reilly about whether we can provide a medical card in circumstances where somebody has been through the service and an identified issue has been established.  I believe we can make progress.  I have been asked to put in place a process for the voices of women to be heard and I have made a commitment to do this.  We are developing proposals on an independent compassionate process for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard.  I have written to Mesh Survivors Ireland in this regard.  Work is under way.  I am happy to deal with any questions in this regard.</p><p> I do not underestimate the significant challenges our health service faces but I do not accept that everything in the health service is bad or in crisis.  Every day our staff do an excellent job of providing high-quality care to many people.  We are making progress when it comes to waiting lists.  Today, I announced a significant number of measures on additional capacity in the health service and additional resources for the winter.  We will build further on this in the days and weeks ahead.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms. Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, and Mr. Liam Woods, national director for acute operations.</p> <p>  The latest financial position, from the end of the third quarter, shows a variance from budget, including first charge, of &euro;319 million, or 3%.</p><p>Of this, &euro;119 million or 37% is in respect of our operational service areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was almost 100% higher at &euro;636 million, with &euro;507 million of that overrun, or 80%, in the operational service areas.  Pension and demand-led areas account for &euro;200 million of the variance as of September 2019.</p><p> A key priority for the HSE is to maximise the provision of safe services to the people we serve while operating within the funding provided to us.  This continues to be a significant challenge in the context of the ever-increasing level of demand for our services.  This demand is influenced by factors such as a growing population, an ageing demographic, changes in technology and clinical practice, as well as ongoing societal and economic change.  We have continued with our intensive focus on current year financial management and financial planning for 2020.  Senior managers across the organisation have been engaging with us regarding activity and expenditure and the related challenges of operating within available resources.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services are in respect of providing residential placements to people with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialist emergency care within the acute hospital setting, particularly in the context of an ageing population with increasingly complex needs.  The costs within our pensions and demand-led areas are in the main driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic environment and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  State Claims Agency reimbursements are also within this area, and there is a significant and ongoing focus on mitigating, in so far as is practical, the underlying risks and issues that give rise to claims.</p><p> A key focus for our ongoing financial management efforts has been on improving compliance with our pay and staffing controls, including whole-time equivalents, WTEs, agency and overtime.  Although staffing levels will increase again in 2019, any increases must be managed in a way that is both planned and affordable.  This necessary adjustment to the controls on pay and staffing is proving difficult but it must become part of our normal way of working.  I acknowledge that this is a challenging process, but I and the board are committed to ensuring that there is an improved culture of delivery within the funding provided by the State.  I fully believe that this will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which ultimately will be in the best interest of our service users and their families.</p><p> My monthly financial meetings with community healthcare organisation, CHO, chief officers and hospital group CEOs will continue to year end.  All areas are very clear about their allocated financial limits and performance expectations up to year end to mitigate in so far as practical any deviations from those limits, thereby reducing the extent of any challenge to be dealt with in 2020.  The discipline of these monthly financial meetings will continue throughout 2020.  Indeed, I met all the hospital group CEOs and CHOs just yesterday.  The HSE's national service plan for 2020 was adopted by the HSE board and submitted to the Minister for consideration.  The approval process is well advanced and I expect that the plan will be published within the next week.</p><p> The Minister has made some comments on winter planning.  Following on from the briefing provided to the committee in September of this year on winter preparedness planning, the HSE has prepared a detailed winter plan, which was launched in November.  The plan clearly reflects the year-on-year growth in demand for unscheduled care services that is growing at a rate of in excess of 5% in attendances and 2.7% in admissions over a mean annual population growth of 1.7%.  In response to this increased demand, an additional &euro;26 million has been provided to year end to fund a combination of nationally and locally managed initiatives aimed at improving overall patient flow from community, through the acute hospital and back into the community.</p><p> A sum of &euro;19.2 million from this funding is specifically focused on egress initiatives, including home care packages, improving access to the nursing home support scheme or fair deal, and transitional care beds for patients awaiting nursing home places.  The initiatives have in fact been in place since October in preparation for the anticipated winter surge and have enabled the system to respond.  Nine local winter action teams are in place and are co-chaired by the relevant community healthcare organisation chief officer and their hospital group CEO colleagues.</p><p> The balance of &euro;6.8 million has been distributed on the basis of population associated with each of the winter action teams, and this is funding initiatives such as enhanced community intervention teams; additional frailty intervention therapy teams, FITTs; aids and appliances to assist in discharge; enhanced triage capability; and additional bed capacity in private facilities.  The HSE at national level and at winter action team level is also engaged with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, in providing enhanced access to diagnostics, which will improve overall patient experience times and alleviate pressure in the emergency department and wider hospital services.</p><p>On Sl&aacute;intecare, the HSE and the Department of Health continue to engage and work collaboratively on its implementation.  A key element of this work is service redesign to plan for the implementation of the new regional health regions and social care delivery structures.  In parallel with this work, I have also commenced a review of the HSE staffing and structures at the centre of the organisation as part of the preparatory work to inform the service redesign for the HSE to become a more strategic and patient-focused national centre.</p><p> I mention employment levels and recruitment.  In October 2019, our overall employment levels stand at 138,080 personnel, equating to 119,473 whole-time equivalents, WTEs.  This represents a total growth in our employment levels this year of 1,616 WTEs and year-on-year growth from October of last year of 2,562 WTEs.  Our continued growth is important in the context of our overarching pay and numbers strategy.  We have filled and continue to fill approved and funded development posts in order to maintain and enhance key services for patients and their families.  In parallel, we are working to ensure levels of agency, overtime and pay costs, which reached unaffordable levels by the end of 2018, are brought within what is affordable and sustainable during 2019 and into 2020.  We have continued to grow our workforce, and year-on-year the largest of this growth in WTE terms, is in our staff categories of nursing and midwifery and patient and client care, which predominantly concerns healthcare assistant staff, with both categories showing growth of 650 WTEs and 646 WTEs, respectively.  In percentage terms, our largest year-on-year workforce growth is in our medical and dental staff category, which has seen a 3.7% increase since October last year.  Similarly, it is also the largest staff category growth in percentage terms this year to date at 3.4% growth.  Notably within these figures, our consultant workforce has grown by 142 WTEs year-on-year, with 135 WTEs of this increase recruited since January 2019.  As we draw to a close in 2019, we will continue to proceed with the approved and funded development posts in tandem with the requirement to keep within an affordable funding level that is sustainable both in 2019 and 2020.</p></speech>

I would like to start locally with Purple House Cancer Support in Bray.  It is an incredible cancer support service that the Minister for Health and I know well.  It supports families and cancer survivors all over Wicklow and in south Dublin.  It has to leave the premises it is in on an extremely urgent basis.  It has found a fantastic premises that will allow it to expand its services and it looked for &euro;650,000 from the State with a view to doing matched funding.  After conversations with the Minister, staff from Purple House Cancer Support have told me that figure came down to about &euro;400,000.  They told me they met the Minister twice and he made promises around that amount of money.  They then said the amount promised dropped from about &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000 down to &euro;150,000 and that yesterday they got a letter which one of the Minister's team took them through.  That letter made no reference to any amount of money, it said there would be no money in 2019 and that they could apply for capital funding in 2020 but that would be considered in the round with a lot of other applications.  This is what the staff in Purple House Cancer Support have said to me.  I know the Minister and I both support this service.  Will the Minister deliver on the promise of around &euro;350,000 to &euro;400,000?  If not, can the Minister tell me why the staff in Purple House Cancer Support believe that promise was made by him?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#J00400"><p>As the Deputy said, both of us know Purple House Cancer Support very well.  I also know all the other cancer support groups across our county well and I also know that in my time as Minister, the level of annual funding for Purple House Cancer Support has significantly increased by &euro;100,000.  It now receives annual funding of &euro;175,000 and no other cancer support group in County Wicklow receives such funding.  I am sure the Deputy's concern for cancer patients in Bray is shared by a concern he would have for Greystones Cancer Support, Arklow Cancer Support, West Wicklow Cancer Support and Wicklow Cancer Support.  When one is Minister for Health, one is Minister for the whole country and one is a Deputy for one's whole constituency.  I have worked with Deputies in this committee on these matters.  For example, I have worked with Deputy Kelly to secure funding for Tipperary Cancer Support Centre and there is a process to go through.  Funding can be provided for Purple House Cancer Support and I have engaged with my Secretary General and the HSE on this matter.</p><p>That funding will assist Purple House Cancer Support in finding a new premises and I have had discussions with its representatives in that regard.  I do not relate all the discussions I have with my constituents, although of course my constituents can do that, but I believe that funding can be found.  I have had significant conversations with officials in the HSE and my Department about that matter.</p><p> I am also very much aware, as is the Deputy, of the rules on procurement and governance and that business cases and valuation reports are needed.  The letter that was shared yesterday with Purple House Cancer Support in an effort to be helpful provides some useful information on the next steps that need to be taken.  For example, the letter specifically states that while Purple House Cancer Support has produced a business case, it has not made a formal submission for capital funding.  The business case it has put together contains some of the information required but not all of the required documentation.  The letter included an offer that the local HSE estates office would assist with documentation and in completing the process.  It also made a number of other important points, including that the HSE would need a valuation report if taxpayers' money is to be spent.  The Deputy and I understand that.  If that were not the case, serious questions would be asked in the Committee of Public Accounts and other places.  </p><p> A technical report on the suitability of a building would also be needed.  It would be unusual to designate one building because generally, when one is spending taxpayers' money, one would look at a range of properties.  I am aware of the property concerned and the reason the group believes it is suitable, and I can see why that is the case.  My message to the Deputy and to Purple House Cancer Support is that we should work together on this.  I am more than happy to work with Deputy Donnelly.  We can make progress but there are rules, processes and procedures that need to be followed.  With the greatest of respect, a demand from the Deputy or anybody else issued through the local media is not how to bring about the spending of taxpayers' money.  That should be done by investing in good services and taking the very helpful advice provided yesterday by the chief officer of the HSE in the area in question on what would be required.</p></speech>

They feel strongly that they have been misled by the Minister.  Rightly or wrongly, that is what they are saying.  They believe that promises made in good faith, which they took in good faith, are not being honoured.  The Minister and I both appreciate that proper procedures must, and will, be followed.  The representatives of Purple House Cancer Support have gone sale agreed on a property and the question they and I ask is when, in the context of right and proper procedure, they can expect to have an answer from the State on whether they can proceed.  That is what this comes down to for them.</p></speech>

I am sure doing so produces great clips for social media showing the Minister in the position of not being able to confirm certain things.  My colleagues from the most senior levels of the HSE who are here today have procedures and processes that they need to follow.  My advice to Purple House Cancer Support, both as a constituency Deputy and the Minister for Health, is the same today as it was yesterday, the day before and the day before that.  It should follow the process, meet local HSE officials and provide the information that the chief officer of the HSE requires and has requested in a letter.  I believe progress could then be made-----</p></speech>

The Deputy and I both know Purple House Cancer Support well and no one doubts that it provides an excellent service but there is a process that needs to be followed.  Let us follow that process together.  I will meet the Deputy and we will go through it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the process needs to be followed.  The question that Purple House Cancer Support is asking is how long the process will take.

The Minister and I both know it is under imminent threat of closure because the funds being provided by the State do not come anywhere close to covering the cost of the service it runs.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has taken a look at the books of the centre and broadly agrees with the cost that it says is required, so it is not looking for anything that is not needed.  The HSE has moved on day care, which is welcome, but that only accounts for 7% of the facility's budget.  The other 93% is spent on residential care and the negotiations with the NTPF are going nowhere.  The Minister has promised categorically, in the D&aacute;il and on the airwaves, that St. Joseph's will stay open.</p></speech>

My understanding is that a letter issued to the Minister yesterday, which I presume he will receive at some point today, laying out the board's inability to do that.  The board will meet tomorrow week, or in eight days, to consider whether it can keep the facility open.  If there is no movement, the board may feel it has no choice but to withdraw from the deed of agreement with the NTPF.  That would mean that from 1 January there would be no fair deal funding for the fair deal residents in the facility.  While St. Joseph's would endeavour to keep the residents there for as long as possible, the reserves of the St. John of God organisation are gone and ultimately the residents would have to leave.  The situation is extremely urgent.  The Minister has repeatedly promised that what is about to happen should there be no intervention will not happen.  </p><p> I ask the Minister to consider the following two solutions.  A block grant needs to be provided for one to two years, or for an appropriate timeframe, to cover the gap between the NTPF amount, which is approximately &euro;1,350, and the run-rate, which is approximately &euro;1,750.  The NTPF fair deal scheme is under review.  St. Joseph's, the staff, residents and their families need to be given time in the context of that review.  Option one is the provision of a grant from the HSE or the Department of Health that bridges the gap until a new NTPF rate is agreed as part of a new NTPF strategy.  Option two, which St. Joseph's is open to, is that the HSE takes over the beds as section 39 beds.  The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated given that the board is meeting in eight days.  Are either of those two options viable and could movement be achieved in the next eight days?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that dementia care is different from standard nursing home care.  I have visited St. Joseph's, as I am sure has Deputy Donnelly.  The level of care provided there is exceptional.  The needs of the residents are extremely complex.  We need more facilities like St. Joseph's, not less.  I believe St. Joseph's to be a model of excellence when it comes to the provision of care for people with dementia.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly rightly acknowledged that the element directly within the control of the HSE was swiftly resolved.  I thank the HSE for engaging and providing additional funding and certainty about the day-care centre.  I appreciate that an overwhelming 93% of St. Joseph's costs pertain to the residential service, which is funded through the NTPF.  The Deputy and I know that I am precluded by law from becoming involved in the negotiations.  I call on St. Joseph's, as I have repeatedly done, to exhaust the NTPF appeals process.  The NTPF has made known to the HSE and, I think, St. Joseph's, that its appeals process will be expedited.  St. Joseph's needs to exhaust that process.  If that brings a resolution, we will all be happy.  Deputy Donnelly's question, as I understand it, is what will be done to keep St. Joseph's open if that process is exhausted swiftly and does not deliver a resolution.  My message today is as clear as it was on day one - we will find a mechanism to keep it open.  I need everyone to follow the rules in terms of exhausting the NTPF process.  That is not to suggest that people are not doing so.  No doubt, there are many other nursing homes monitoring this case.</p> <p>  As I informed Deputy Donnelly last week in the D&aacute;il, I will use every legal instrument and lever available to me to keep this facility open.  That could mean lots of different things.  My priority is that the people living in St. Joseph's remain there and that the service continues to be provided.  I have made that commitment several times and I am working daily to fulfil it.  I will also work with the Deputy in this regard.  As he mentioned, the board will meet in eight days and so no time should be wasted.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned that St. Joseph's had written to me.  I have heard that from a number of people but to the best of my knowledge, my office has not yet received that letter.  I certainly have not had sight of or read it.  I presume I will receive it today and I will act swiftly to try to provide helpful guidance to St. Joseph's on how to move forward.</p></speech>

It is a three-month appeals process.  The Minister said it can be expedited.</p><p>That is great but if it starts trading next year with a known deficit and no letter of comfort or agreement in place, it is in a difficult position.  I ask the Minister, his officials or the NTPF - whatever the right group is - to engage with the board in a meaningful way before it meets next week and provide it with some comfort.  It might be short-term financial comfort - whatever it is - so that it can at least trade through the appeal process without contravening the laws regarding boards of directors.  </p></speech>

Can I also suggest that another group of people needs to be involved, namely, St. John of God?  It is quite amazing that we have a conversation so many times about St. Joseph's and somewhat ignore the fact that it is under the patronage of the St. John of God group, which receives more than &euro;100 million of taxpayer funding each and every year.  Surely it has the ability to also provide assistance here.  St. John of God's relationship with the State needs to be examined in that context.  I hope that the St. John of God group, which, I am sure, is following this conversation as well, would see how it could assist as well considering that it does receive over &euro;100 million of taxpayer funding each and every year.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy about this.</p></speech>

I echo the constructive engagement we have had and the progress that has been made but I would like to see a date for when the medical cards will be issued and access to the translabial scanner will be officially available.  We know that it is coming and the engagement has been extremely constructive but at this stage, if the women could get some firm dates, it would be very helpful.  It might be more appropriate to correspond with me on that.  I have no difficulty with that.</p> <p>  The next issue is the departure of Dr. Kevin McCarthy from the children's chronic pain clinic at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and Temple Street Hospital.  This issue has been covered fairly extensively in the media but has also been raised directly with me by constituents.  Dr. McCarthy does an extremely important job.  He provides pain relief to children.  I do not know how he does it.  I am being told is that there has been no formal communication to date with parents.  When I say I am being told this, what I mean is that I am being told that by parents whose children are under the care of Dr. McCarthy.  I know that the consultant group at Children's Health Ireland has written to senior management.  It is asking a number of questions that I want to put here  The questions relate to an immediate clarification of how Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin plans to deliver a pain service once Dr. McCarthy has left.  There does not seem to be a plan.  When I say there has been no formal communication with parents, what I mean is that nobody has sat in a room and told parents how pain management for their children will be dealt with the consultant departs.  I am seeking an assurance that the reason for Dr. McCarthy's departure will be addressed, including the lack of funding.  He was very clear and explicit as to why he was leaving.  He cited the lack of funding and provision of support services required for the safe running of a multidisciplinary pain management team.  Obviously, reassurance is being sought that the families of affected patients will be informed formally.  Obviously, these families all know because it has been in the media but they have not received formal notification that the pain consultant will be departing and, more importantly, nobody has told them what the care pathway for their children will be.  These are children who suffer really severe pain and if they are under the care of Dr. McCarthy, as the Minister well knows, notwithstanding all the facts, they are children who have been on a waiting list because a person does not get to see a consultant overnight.  He or she must wait so these children have waited a long time and are now under the care of a consultant but that consultant is departing and there appears to be no care plan in place.  </p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Woods to come in in a moment but I want to say a few initial things in this regard.  I have also been contacted by many parents in recent days who have told me of the excellent work done by Dr. McCarthy.</p><p>I do not believe I have met Dr. McCarthy directly but I have been given extremely positive feedback from parents of children he has seen.  I understand that a pain specialist in Children's Health Ireland who operates between Crumlin and Temple Street will leave at the end of the year to take up a post abroad.  The Deputy is dead right.  It is not acceptable that parents have not been contacted.  I have asked about this and have been assured that Children's Health Ireland is now in the process of contacting each of the families who attend the service to update them on the treatment plans for their children.  A benefit of having Children's Health Ireland as one structure running our children's hospitals is that they are now working with pain specialists and clinical leads in paediatric anaesthesiology to see how Dr. McCarthy's patients can be appropriately reallocated to continue service.  It will also advertise for a replacement post.  </p><p> I will ask Mr. Woods if he has any further detail to add.</p></speech>

The multidisciplinary team the Deputy referred to includes provision to go back out for a consultant.  That is being prioritised through the consultant recruitment process.  There is also a need, probably most immediately, for additional advance nurse practitioners to support patients and families.  That is one of our top priorities working with Children's Health Ireland.  The wider multidisciplinary team will require physiotherapy, psychology and occupational therapy.  Children's Health Ireland has given us a clear expression of what that would require.  We will support immediately with advanced nurse practitioner and then recruit a consultant, which we are doing now.</p> <p>  The Minister covered communication with families but I will also follow that up with Children's Health Ireland.</p></speech>

It is going through the consultant recruitment process in the next couple of weeks.  The timescale to recruit a consultant of that specialism could be up to 12 months.  Children's Health Ireland and the HSE are very aware of that.  The immediate actions which Children's Health Ireland can take relate to the balance of the multidisciplinary team, which can support patients and families.  The advanced nurse practitioner is very important in that regard.</p></speech>

The post has not been advertised despite the fact that the consultant in question handed in his notice in September.  It is hard to believe that this matter is being treated with any degree of urgency.  That anything has been done may have more to do with media coverage than anything else.  That is wholly unacceptable.  Children's Health Ireland has known since September.  It is in receipt of heavy duty correspondence from consultants who, as Mr. Woods will know, do not often write letters and are often reluctant to get involved in these matters.  Nearly three months have elapsed without an advertisement for the vacant post being placed.  Parents are probably following this meeting online because some of them contacted me to say they knew it was taking place this morning.  This information will not fill them with any confidence.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister inject some urgency into this process because it does not appear that much has been done in the past couple of months to address this urgent matter.</p></speech>

She and I, as the Minister, as well as the committee need to have an assurance regarding how Children's Health Ireland now intends to inject that urgency.</p><p>I will ask Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, the CEO of Children's Health Ireland to formally communicate with this committee in response to Deputy O' Reilly's very direct questions.  The Deputy wants to know what is going to happen between now and the recruitment of a new consultant and how quickly that new consultant can be recruited.  She also wants to know, crucially, about communication with each of the families on the clinical pathways.  </p><p> It is my understanding that this committee has helpfully suggested that there should be hearings on mesh in January.  In addition to the correspondence I sent to Mesh Survivors Ireland recently, it would be my intention to have clarity on those issues in advance of those hearings.</p></speech>

HIQA conducted a review of the Rotunda Hospital which I will not read out in full because, quite frankly, it shames the people on the other side of this room.  The issues raised are very serious.  HIQA says that the cot spacing between babies is inadequate.  It also says that there is no additional or spare neonatal intensive care unit capacity in other units nationally and therefore the national neonatal intensive care system is in a precarious state as the Rotunda caps its admissions.  On the adult high dependency unit, it says that there is a lack of space around the bed to allow for full resuscitation to be instigated and the necessary equipment to be brought into the room.  I will not read all of this out for fear some pregnant woman is watching this and ends up terrified.  These are issues that have been raised with the Minister and the HSE on more than one occasion.  Why has Mr. Reid not met representatives of the Rotunda Hospital yet?  Is there a reluctance to meet them?  Why did the Minister not attend the meeting with the Rotunda Hospital that was scheduled recently?  I understand that officials from his Department attended.  A face-to-face meeting has been sought to raise issues that are of very serious concern.  The Rotunda serves my constituency.  My area is probably the biggest user of the hospital, notwithstanding the fact that the hospital is in the city centre.  As Mr. Reid will know, my constituency has the fastest growing population in the State.  These are services that are absolutely vital and demand is only growing.  I understand that demand is falling nationally but in the constituency that the Rotunda serves it is growing.  When will steps be taken to make the Rotunda Hospital a safer place for women, babies and staff?  </p></speech>

I was in direct contact with the Rotunda as recently as the last couple of days.  I was not in a position to attend the meeting to which the Deputy refers.  To be clear, we need to do something to help the Rotunda - of that there is no doubt.  The plan is to move the Rotunda Hospital to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown but that will not happen today or tomorrow.  In the interim, things need to happen and I accept that.  I also accept that the Rotunda has put forward a plan.  I am the Minister for Health in the Department of Health and we work with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need to see an agreed plan put in place between the hospital, the CEO of the hospital, who is also the master, and the HSE, which is then presented to Government.  That plan must then be assessed against the public spending code and so forth.  My understanding is that relatively recently the Rotunda and the HSE arrived at an agreed plan for interim works and my officials were briefed on that plan last week.  Now we need to look at moving that through the public spending code.</p> <p>  To be very clear, we need to take action on the Rotunda Hospital.  I am not saying that we are waiting for the Rotunda to move to Connolly, as I have read in some reports.  The fear of the people working in the Rotunda today is that nothing is going to happen until the big move but that is not the case.  We needed to arrive at a point where there is an agreed plan with the HSE.  I will ask Mr. Reid to elaborate further on that. </p></speech>

In my first six months in this job, I have spent most of my time travelling around the country, visiting acute care settings and meeting the management on site.  I have spent less time, to date, in the Dublin hospitals because I wanted to make my presence felt around the country.  That said, I have been in the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street and am very happy to meet management at the Rotunda.  I certainly have not been avoiding them.</p> <p>  On the overall issue of capital investment, as the Minister has said there has been engagement with the hospital in an effort to arrive at an agreed plan for such investment on site.</p><p>Mr. Woods will be able to comment further on that but certainly there has been engagement with the hospital by our estates team.  I am quite happy to meet them and certainly have not been avoiding them.  I have met hospital groups, hospital CHOs and chairpersons of boards all across the country.  I have probably met more in the last six months than any previous director general.</p></speech>

As I understand it, a request for a meeting was made and it should be granted.  That said, I am happy that Mr. Reid has confirmed that he is not avoiding such a meeting.</p></speech>

As the Minister said, there has been a meeting and the Rotunda management has made a proposal to address the key risk identified by the Deputy, namely, capacity in the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as some other facilities.  We are currently in a process and are engaging this week with the RCSI group, the Rotunda and our colleagues in the Department of Health to move that proposal forward.  The risk is clearly identified and is being actioned.</p></speech>

Again, the issues in the Rotunda are not new but there does not seem to be a massive sense of urgency about addressing them.  I welcome the fact that people are now committing to attend meetings that they were always going to attend anyway, apparently.</p> <p>  I have a question about the use of debt collection agencies, which I have raised previously.  I abhor the practice of using debt collection agencies to chase people because the people being chased are sick.  I wish to bring to the witnesses' attention one example of the practice.  An elderly lady who has a medical card needed a hip operation.  She could not wait for a public appointment so her family clubbed together, with money they did not really have, to ensure that she could get an operation privately.  Following on from that, she developed septicemia and was admitted to hospital.  However, because she had previously been a private patient, she was brought into the private wing of the hospital.  This elderly lady who had septicemia did not know where she was being brought.  She was brought to the private wing in the hospital.  She now has a bill for &euro;4,000 and is being chased by a debt collection agency.  This is one example and-----</p></speech>

She went in through accident and emergency and was brought up to the private wing.  She now has a debt collection agency chasing her.  The woman has a medical card and should not have been brought into the private wing.  We spoke about similar scenarios when we were discussing women who went for private tests in the context of CervicalCheck and the Minister confirmed that even if a woman had a private test, she could go back into the public system.  This woman, through no fault of her own, was filtered back into the private system and now has an outstanding bill and is being pursued by debt collectors.  Nobody in the debt collection agency cares about the fact that the woman has a medical card, or about her means or her capacity to pay.  All those in the agency care about is recovering the debt.  I believe the use of debt collection agencies should cease because it has no place in the public health service.  No compassion is being shown to this woman.  When a case goes to a debt collection agency, it is taken out of the public system.  A debt collection agency is just a company that is interested in recovering a debt; it does not care how the debt was incurred.</p></speech>

The Deputy and I both want to remove private practice from public hospitals but my initial sense of this is that one must opt to go private.  I do not want to comment on this specific case without knowing the details and those details should be given to the HSE.  However, my clear understanding is that if a patient is brought into a public hospital, he or she would have to opt to be a private patient.  Maybe "opt" is the wrong word but the patient would have to say that he or she is a private patient.  There is no doubt this woman was not a private patient.  She would not have the means to be a private patient and did not have private health insurance.  I respectfully suggest that my HSE colleagues take the details of the case, although I know the Deputy is making a broader point.  The specific case to which she refers sounds very traumatic and perhaps my colleagues can provide some clarity for the Deputy.</p></speech>

On the wider point, there is very significant pressure across the whole of Government in terms of debt outstanding to the taxpayer and there has been a process in place for a number of years to recover such debt.  Obviously the HSE features very significantly because of the level of debt that is outstanding.  There has been an ongoing process, led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, across all Departments to improve debt collection and it is only right that we should do so.  The agencies that we have engaged are quite professional and are well respected, which is the way it should be.  I am very happy to investigate anything that is inappropriate but we have highly respected agencies working with us.</p></speech>

The first issue is overcrowding in the mid-west, which is catastrophic and the second is matters arising from the RCOG report published last week.  A total of 190 extra beds have been promised and 83 were announced recently.  How many of those beds are for the mid-west and where are they located?  The minor injuries unit and the &euro;75 charge is irrelevant.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Mr. Reid has agreed to visit UHL because several committee members would like to go the hospital with him in the coming days.  I am not interested in dramatics but in solutions.  I have written to Mr. Reid about UHL and the mid-west more generally.  Deputy Harty is also from the mid-west and knows that what is going on there at the moment is catastrophic.  I had to beg for a new CT scanner, which is due to be delivered on Friday, because it was so obviously needed.  I have made a comparison between the resources at UHL and at Beaumont Hospital and the disparity is frightening.  These are similar hospitals in similar areas.  While it is true that apples cannot be compared with apples or oranges with oranges in the context of hospitals, the differential in staff numbers, including doctors, nurses and administrative staff, is huge and makes no sense.  The reconfiguration of hospitals in the mid-west was done at the wrong time and without sufficient money.  We all know what happened and it is not the fault of anyone in this room but we are now left in a dreadful situation, where people, including members of my own family, are afraid to go into UHL.  I do not blame them.  The differential across support staff, administrative staff, nurses, medical staff and other health care professionals is huge.  I will not even bother going through the figures, which were provided by the HSE.  In terms of the number of beds we are looking at 432 versus 659.  I know that Professor Keane is currently preparing a report but I do not have any faith in that process because the amount of time spent there was very short.  I do not want a report to be published that is about process but not about resources because the two go hand in hand.  We cannot solve problems in the mid-west without dealing with the resource issue.  People are afraid to address the resource issue.</p><p>It is then perceived as blame.  I am gone beyond worrying about blame.  Of course there are process issues but the resource gaps here are ginormous compared to other hospitals.  I put forward a range of interim short-term solutions.  I have listed them multiple times on the record of the D&aacute;il and in the committee and they have all been ignored.  I am really worried about the narrative being put out and being influenced with regard to University Hospital Limerick from a HSE corporate point of view versus what is real on the ground with the staff and management in the hospital, whom I do not blame because they work as hard as they can.</p><p> A report has come out in the past 48 hours that has been done by two pretty eminent NHS doctors, Dr. Chris Moulton and Dr. Cliff Mann.  It shows their estimate that since 2016 of those who have been waiting in an NHS accident and emergency department for between six and 11 hours almost 5,500 have died.  If we extrapolate this data what does it mean for us here in Ireland?  I ask the Minister what we will we do.  I ask him not to list all the stuff about the MRI and a few extra beds because I have heard it all before.  They will not have the impact.  I live there.  It is chronically bad.  It is catastrophic.  People will die in the coming months.  What are we going to do?  I am begging the Minister.  We need solutions.  People living near me will potentially die because of this and this is despite the fact that everyone in the hospital is working so hard.  Please, this is a last request to the Minister.</p></speech>

I do need to say, because he made the comment about the MRI, that he and colleagues, including Senator Kieran O'Donnell, at a previous committee meeting stated that based on their conversations with staff and management in University Hospital Limerick the hospital needed a second MRI and that if it got that second MRI, and the record of the committee will show this, up to 30 beds a day could be freed up.  I do not mean to throw the words of the Deputy back at him but that was the view.</p></speech>

We have asked every hospital in the country to put up their hands and state how many more beds they can open if we fund them.  They are still coming in and 83 have come in.

I expect to be able to approve that funding in the coming days.  We will open the 15 beds in St. John's next week.  The MRI will arrive on Friday.  The 60-bed block is under way.  I am genuinely trying to work with everyone to come up with ideas.</p></speech>

Quite rightly, he raised the issue of the CT scanner.  Following a conversation with the committee we progressed and his feedback was welcome.  Following the previous committee meeting, we arranged a meeting for the hospital group CEO, the national director, and the chief operations officer of the HSE to meet all of the Oireachtas Members interested in the hospital group.  I understand it was a very productive meeting and the hospital group CEO set out the various aspects of what the group is doing.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me what developments have been taken on board and I will list a few.  The new Nenagh ophthalmology centre has been opened to relieve capacity in the group.  There has been expansion of robotic surgery, the perinatal mental health service has improved.  There have been developments in community midwifery, the early transfer home service, the clinical and recovery support unit in Nenagh, the vascular hybrid theatre in University Hospital Limerick and a new medical assessment unit in Nenagh.  Extra graduate nurses, nurses, clinician and professional resources have been put into University Hospital Limerick and other hospitals in the group, and Mr. Woods can speak more about this.  As the Minister has just said, there are other short-term developments on track, including the 60-bed unit.</p></speech>

Some of them have been going on so long that I have been involved in them myself and I have been supporting them, advocating for them and getting resources for them for a considerable amount of time.  However, let us just reflect on what Mr. Reid and the Minister have said.  I accept some of the new positive changes.  I put them forward in proposals myself.  That is not the issue.  The issue is whether these actions will deal with the accident and emergency beds crisis and the resource staff crisis we face in the mid-west over the coming months.  I need to know whether these actions will work.  The answer to the question given by the Minister and Mr. Reid was to list of all of the actions, some of them dating back years.  If this is the best they can put forward, we will know in the coming weeks and months whether they will work.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly holds me politically accountable.  He comes in here and rightly says that I must provide this and if I do not he gives me a very hard time.  These are suggestions that came from the hospital when it said that if we gave it a second MRI it would free up a certain number of beds a day.  We cannot agree on the number but let us say 20.  The hospital said that if we opened more beds in St John's it would help alleviate the pressure.  I do not want to use up Deputy Kelly's time, and I am not in a rush, but there is a reality with regard to the statistics at University Hospital Limerick that I want to put on the record of the committee.  The total emergency department attendances in Limerick from January to October, as I do not have the figures for November yet, were down on last year.  There were 638 fewer people.</p></speech>

It is not a blame at all.  I must say, and I know that the Deputy is also passionate about some consultant work practices, that there does need to be change.</p></speech>

Why is this happening?  He is in charge of the HSE.  The HSE is around us here but this practice is happening.  Why is it allowed to happen?  The Minister quotes statistics, like the volume of beds.  No one wants to do a comparison with Beaumont.  No one wants to do a comparison with diagnostics, beds, resources, human resources.  Why is that?  I had to go and do it myself and dig out all the Department's own data.  It is shocking by comparison.  When I hear the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il citing Beaumont, not as best practice but good practice, it galls me when I think of all the people who are trying their best with so few resources in Limerick.  The answers to the Minister's questions are around him in this room.  If it is down to management, then management at the highest level has to be held accountable as to why we have a discriminatory situation in respect of resources for the mid-west as opposed to other areas of the country.  What is going to happen over the coming weeks and month?  I do not want this to happen.  I have had very close family members in that hospital recently.  What is going to happen?  There will be judgment on what the Minister and Mr. Reid have just said in the coming months.</p></speech>

When we look at our own activity-based funding data, and I am happy to share this, the cost per case in those environments does not vary a whole lot.  Some work has been done to look at the level of resource, and activity-based funding does this, associated with each case.  That has been helpful in examining the relative efficiency across the system.  I will not speak on that much now but there has been much work on this which I would be happy to share to help move further on that.</p></speech>

The investments around that will be very important.  The work in Ennis will be critical and the work in the community intervention team, CIT, across the road from the hospital is also hugely supportive of frail elderly management.  Part of that is reflecting in a reduced admission rate for those over 75 years which could be a very positive outcome that we need to grow.  From speaking to our geriatricians, we know we can maintain more people in the community.  The primary care investment of up to 1,000 which is indicated has a key part to play.  It can play a key role on those hospital sites, which could support Dooradoyle.  Limerick is looking at a further 92-bed expansion at further remove, but that is a larger-scale building project.</p></speech>

I will focus on one or two issues.  I have raised the issue of cataract operations in Cork over the past six or eight weeks.</p><p>The Minister will be aware there is a huge problem regarding cataract operations being done in Cork.  Last year, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital sent out over 600 cases to the NTPF.  I have made a submission to the Minister, which I understand has also gone to the HSE, that were an extra theatre put in place in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, ten or 12 cataract operations could be done a day, five days a week.  There are five consultants in that area in that hospital; they each have only one day per week in theatre.  As a result, they are dealing with very serious eye complaints and therefore, cataract operations are pushed to the back and are not being dealt with.  I am advised that were there a second theatre dealing with this, the problem would be resolved and that it would pay for itself within a year and a half to two years.  The cost is &euro;3 million.  Can I get a detailed reply to that submission?  Many people are travelling outside of Cork, some to Northern Ireland, and it is the direct result of the facility not being there to do the operation.  </p><p> The second question relates to the growth in the population of Cork.  Much work has been done around new hospitals in Dublin and we are talking about three elective hospitals around the country.  They are vital for the areas for which they are designated.  What progress has been made in respect of Cork or when we can progress the process?  Even if we identified a site this morning, it would take at least two years to go through the design and planning process and being realistic, it would be three years before reaching the stage of putting in foundations.  It needs to be prioritised in Cork.  A huge amount of work is going out of Cork at present because it lacks the capacity to deal with all the work that is there.  There is a population of more than 550,000, which will grow dramatically in the next three to four years, when one considers the development of new offices and all the companies expanding in Cork.  There will be an automatic growth in population, as well as catering for the work out of Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, and Kerry. </p></speech>

On his proposal to use the South Infirmary for cataract operations, as an example I refer to the investment we made through the NTPF working with the HSE in Nenagh hospital, where the hospital group came forward with a proposal to say that it had underutilised theatres and with an investment of about &euro;1 million, from memory, that it could open a centre of excellence for cataract procedures.  That has dramatically reduced waiting times and waiting lists for cataract procedures.  My opening statement noted the significant fall we had seen in the waiting times for ophthalmology.  The Senator has sent his proposal to myself and the HSE.  I suggest that the HSE and NTPF, working together, could consider that in the context of 2020.  I do not know enough about the individual projects but to be clear, we are very eager, and it is Government policy, to use the NTPF resource, which is now up at &euro;100 million, to increase capacity in the public health service, where possible, rather than using the private health service.  It is necessary to use the private health service from time to time but where possible, the public health service should be used.  We certainly will look at it through that prism.  I will also ask Dr. Henry to comment.</p> <p>  On the population of Cork, which the Senator consistently and robustly raises, he is correct about the population of Cork having grown so much and that the bed stock and health service needs to grow to fit the population.  I have received initial proposals and feedback from the South-South West hospital group on its views on an elective hospital for Cork.  Under the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office, we established an expert group to look at what an elective hospital is, without being smart about it.  Different countries do different things, so it is asking what is provided in an elective hospital and what is not provided.</p><p>There are different models around the world.  We expect to be in a position at the start of 2020, which is only weeks away, although it sounds ages away, to move forward on site selection.  Dr. Henry might wish to add to my points on both issues.</p></speech>

Treatment for macular degeneration sometimes constitutes an inappropriate use of a theatre.  A treatment room could equally effectively and safely provide the same treatment.  The consultant ophthalmologist community in Cork has raised this.  There have been successful endeavours in Nenagh and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital whereby we commissioned additional work in theatres through the NTPF, addressing something that lends itself readily to such initiatives, namely, day-case cataract work.</p> <p>  With regard to scheduled care, as the Minister said, the most important point is to get the design right and consider the scope of what a scheduled care hospital would look like.  Let me give two examples.  In the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, Scotland, there is a large scheduled care hospital that runs a range of services, right up to services that require intensive care, overnight stays and quite intensive, complicated surgery.  Another example is Omagh hospital in the North.  It is a scheduled care hospital that does not have inpatient beds at all.  There are day hospital beds.  The design is crucial because it has to address waiting list needs as they stand and as they are projected, and our population needs.  There has to be a model of care that is sustainable, particularly in view of the recruitment and manpower required.  The work the Minister said is ongoing will come to a conclusion soon.  Once the scope of scheduled care centres is decided, it will inform the design, location and so on the schedule care hospitals.</p></speech>

It is probably the highest number in any hospital outside Dublin.  They are technically being under-utilised in regard to eye surgery and cataracts.  There is a practical proposal, costing &euro;3 million, that would pay for itself in one and a half to two years because fewer people would be referred to the NTPF.  It is cost neutral.  It is a detailed proposal from the clinical director in South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  I ask that it be considered seriously.</p> <p>  On the second issue concerning the hospital in Cork, growth in Dublin is continuing but growth in Cork will escalate at a fast pace over the next ten years.  We need to deal with this hospital issue immediately.  There are now 130,000 additional people living in Cork without one extra hospital bed open in the period.  That is a lot of people.  There is also a change in demographics.  I ask that the hospital be given priority.</p></speech>

As I said with regard to scheduled care hospitals, the design has to be right.  That informs the model and size of the hospital, and so on.</p></speech>

The number of consultants has increased from approximately 2,100 to more than 3,100 since 2009.  Can we get current figures?  Various figures are being bandied about and we have do not have accurate figures.  How many consultants are in permanent pensionable posts, how many are locums and how many are working in an agency capacity?  Can we have a breakdown of those numbers?  It is important to know the numbers.  There is a great deal of information in circulation and it is very hard to understand who has the real figures.  I am looking for clarification.  I fully accept that more posts have been created but we have not got clarification on the number<i>in situ </i>who are permanent and pensionable.</p><p>The second issue I wish to raise regarding consultants, which I have raised previously, is the lack of planning for consultant retirement.</p><p>With regard to colposcopy and obstetrics and gynaecology, there is quite a large number to retire over the next three to four years.  What amount of planning is occurring?  I am sure the retirements are happening in other areas also.  Planning does not appear to be occurring.  Posts seem to be advertised once a person is retired and, therefore, locums have to be brought in to fill the post.</p><p> I received telephone calls from three different hospitals about people who are advised to meet Mr. Reid but who do not raise any concerns about any issues in their hospital because they want to give a good impression of what is happening there.  Staff are actually being advised not to raise concerns.  Is the feedback staff have about very genuine concerns not being fed back directly to Dr. Henry?  I have heard staff from three different hospitals raise this issue.  The only ones who seem to be raising genuine concerns are staff who are about to retire and who feel they are not going to lose out by doing so.  There has to be a different approach to ensuring the HSE is getting a true account of the difficulties staff are facing in particular hospitals.  The matter needs to be approached in a different way.  I have heard reports on this matter from three hospitals in different parts of the country.  I am raising this because I believe it is true and accurate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.414" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#W00200"><p>I will take the second point first and then address consultant numbers and the recruitment process.</p> <p>  On the second point, I do not know what the Senator's examples are so I cannot comment specifically on them.  I can say the following, however: in the six months I have been here, I have been around most of the settings, everywhere from Letterkenny and the west and south-east coasts to the Dublin locations and the midlands.  I have been to hospital, acute, community, social care and section 38 settings.  In those visits, I do not spend my time just with management.  I have a brief 35-minute meeting with management and I spend at least four hours walking around talking to staff.  I generally spend my lunch with a group of staff who decide they want to sit beside me.  I get regular and frequent feedback on the issues from staff.  This has been very valuable for me.  It is the way I operate.  It is a management style I have and it has informed me greatly about some of the challenges we face in tackling some of the pressures in the health system.  I have been very open with staff and I have been very engaged.  From the feedback I have got, I believe staff feel there is now a chance to raise the real issues they are experiencing.  I have spent a significant amount of my time on staff engagement.  I spend at least a day and a half per fortnight out in the settings.  That is how I operate.  The feedback indicates very informally the real issues that arise in the various settings, not just the acute settings but also the community settings.  The Minister was touching on process earlier but the feedback is informing me about a number of issues, the first being how those at the HSE centre really need to consider what they are doing and make sure it is adding value for staff at the front line in services and social care.  As I said my opening statement, that is a process I have commenced already.  We are going to examine what we do in the centre and ask whether it adds value for front-line staff.  If not, we will stop it.  I have very firmly flipped my focus onto our front-line service delivery teams to determine the issues that arise for them and how we need to address them.</p> <p>  In our staff satisfaction survey, which was published just last December, there were some very real issues arising over control culture.  People were feeling very motivated in their own jobs but not connected to middle and senior management.  They did not feel they were able to raise issues.  That is something I am very conscious of and that I want to change.  That is why I am spending my time in the acute setting.  I reassure the Senator that I am very happy to tackle or examine any specific issues the Senator has.  My personal style is a leadership style.  I have been in the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, central government, local government and now the HSE.  I can only demonstrate by what I do.  I have outlined what I do.</p> <p>  The second issue, that of consultant posts, is a very genuine one.  We are all aware it is not just an Irish issue but that it is also a global one.</p><p>We are making progress, but it is slow.  We want to recruit more consultants.  We have more capacity to recruit more consultants and more funding in our plan next year to do so.  We are seeing the beginning of a more positive trend this year.  As I mentioned, year on year we have 142 extra consultants and 135 since January.  The net figure, because we are losing some, is an increase of 90 consultants this year, which is the start of a trend.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly mentioned the time lag.  It is too long.  We are running some pilot projects on doing that more locally and that is probably a better way to progress quickly, but we will work with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in that regard.  We have some numbers by speciality across the country, that is, the number of consultants we have by country, by speciality and by hospital.  We will be happy to provide those to the committee.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#X00900"><p>I wish to make a few comments.  First, we must acknowledge the success of using the National Treatment Purchase Fund to cut waiting lists for various procedures, as there has been a considerable drop in the number of people on them.  For example, in the case of inpatient or day case procedures the number fell by 20,000 up to November 2019.  That is a major achievement.  There are still two tranches of 20,000 each to go to bring the figure down to zero, which should be our aim.  Do we have the commitment and procedures in place to continue on that line and to reduce the waiting lists to the necessary and desirable extent?  It is no use to say it is at a tolerable level now.  We must continue with it down to the wire, as it were.</p> <p>  My second question arises from Deputy O'Reilly's comments on the replacement of consultants.  If a consultant is due to retire, presumably notice is given by the consultant in advance.  Why not adopt a procedure whereby whatever reappointment procedures are required are put in place instantly?  I realise there is an argument that sometimes they are not approved or they could be on a list waiting for approval, but why not appoint them temporarily?  We must get away from the nonsense of this weighted procedure that is so laborious.  There are procurement procedures that must be complied with, but there should be no gaps in the provision of service.  It must be a seamless provision.  There can be no gaps in the entitlement of the public to have a continuous health service.  That should be borne in mind.</p> <p>  The Minister will be aware that we occasionally come across glitches, as occurred in our local hospital.  I am loath to be parochial but everybody else does it.  Even you, Chairman, have been known to do it from time to time.  There is a rise in political testosterone, on both sides, during the approach to general elections and one must make allowances for that, but that should not distract us from the issue of making a simple intervention that can be very cost effective.  The Minister has seen the issues in our hospital.  Some of them are ongoing and some are periodic.  I am aware that provision is being made at present, but I wish to raise two matters.  First, we need to know whether there are vacant spaces in our hospitals, particularly where patients are in corridors and awaiting treatment and where ambulances are waiting outside the hospital to deliver their patients and cannot do so for obvious reasons.  We must carry out an audit of the spaces that are available or that can be converted as a matter of urgency.  It is not rocket science.  It is very simple.</p><p> We must also examine the cost.  In most cases the question to ask is: "Why are all the waiting spaces, the emergency department and the corridors full?"  We must find out what is causing the problem.  Is it because there are no doctors or an insufficient number of doctors available?  Is it because an insufficient number of beds are available or insufficient space where beds or trolleys can be put?  Incidentally, there is no reason that a trolley cannot be put in a ward while awaiting transition instead of having patients in the front row at the entrance to the hospital, which is bad for hospital morale and bad and dangerous for patients.  It is bad for the morale of the staff and that is dangerous because there will eventually be stress, which causes other problems, and health and safety issues.  Could an urgent audit be carried out to ascertain the amount of spaces that can be supervised and in which beds or trolleys can be placed, rather than having them in corridors where patients, visitors and staff have to bump into each other?  I have seen cases where blood samples are being taken, people are being fed, patients are being visited, people are getting seriously ill and so forth in those circumstances.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this should be happening.  There is no reason for it to happen if there is covered space in the grounds.  If not, it is quite simple to get temporary accommodation that would meet that requirement.  It is not expensive.  We must look at the things we can do quickly to make it safer, better and more comfortable for patients.</p><p> On the issue of child mental health, we have all encountered situations where there are acute cases of autism and behavioural problems.  The patients are in obvious difficulty and their parents are at their wits' end trying to find something that meets their requirements.  I believe it is possible to provide an adequate service.  It is necessary to do so.  One of the things that is urgently required is a number of mental health programmes in-house where the child can be put on a programme that is corrective and has the required amount of supervision over a specified period of time, which is readily recognised.  Could that be done as a matter of urgency?  The mental health sector has always been regarded as the Cinderella, but at some stage we need to recognise that there is a growing problem in that area.  There is no necessity for it.  Two parents called to see me last weekend.  They are desperate to find a way to solve the problem for their child.  The child has a profound disability and sudden, unexpected behavioural breakdowns.  In those circumstances, we should provide the service that is necessary.  It is not massively costly.  It is simple, but we must provide the programme.</p><p> I have come to the last issue.</p></speech>

They bring forward some very good proposals and have been funded.  In most of the emergency departments I have visited we are seeing good, innovative ways to improve patient flows in acute settings.  One of the challenges is to scale up those initiatives and have a level of consistency across all emergency departments.</p> <p>  To reassure the Deputy I will give a few examples of what is happening across the acute settings.  There is a very good innovative process with streaming.  Patients who come from GP referrals with adequate information can be referred through the ED and onwards.  That is happening very well in a number of areas.</p><p>Somebody mentioned ANPs, advanced nursing practitioners earlier.  The use of ANPs in our emergency departments, EDs, and indeed clinicians and advanced medical assessment units are very successfully moving on patients with specific needs much more quickly.  Triage processes, which can differ in many EDs, have been very successful.  Emergency clinicians in EDs prove very beneficial and help patient flows so that we do not have the congestion that has been seen.  Much of our patient advocacy services specifically in terms of some mental health issues that the Deputy just spoke about on our EDs are working very well for us.</p><p> A number of initiatives are taking place.  Our challenge is definitely to use space, on which I am sure we have a very accurate picture across the way, but more importantly to scale up some of those good initiatives which are happening around the place.  What I am seeing is very innovative and something we can scale up and roll out as part of the solution.</p></speech>

The issues that arise in EDs are often symptomatic of challenges across the entire site.  It is important for us to look at the totality of the beds.  They go into a hospital on a given day and audit everybody in a bed to see who is in the bed and whether they should be there or if they should be somewhere else.  That work goes on all the time.  They have been focusing on our most challenged sites recently to ensure the best use is made of all the available beds.  I assure members of the committee that that improvement work is constantly ongoing.</p> <p>  I might say a word about mental health and children.  We currently have 71 community teams and we have beds.  Interestingly, we hear much about people awaiting mental health beds.  At any one time at the moment we might only have one or two people on a waiting list for an acute mental health bed.  Our challenge relates more to the different needs of different groups of children.  Deputy Durkan mentioned autism.  Where we have children with different types of needs, they are not necessarily appropriate for acute mental health beds.  We are developing an approach focused on in-home intensive support and in-home intensive respite.  That will come with a range of behavioural supports so that children can stay at home and be fully supported with behavioural and other supports.  That will be growing again in 2020.  We are trying to differentiate between children who have different needs and to ensure we are providing the right supports in the right place for them.</p></speech>

Running a live tracker here, I now believe it is 107 beds because 25 for Tallaght have now also been approved.  Therefore 107 of the additional 190 we hope to open have now been approved.  If we stay for the day we might get that figure up even further.  It is 107 and we can keep the committee updated as the numbers come in.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Durkan for his initiatives.  We had a very good visit to Naas General Hospital last Thursday night.  We saw a very hard-working management team and staff in a very busy environment.  Thankfully that hospital has had a slight decrease in trolley numbers this year, on which the staff are to be commended.  There has been a decrease in attendances at the ED this year, but a significant increase in attendances of people over the age of 75.  When we were in that ED last week I was struck by the age profile.  Further to Ms O'Connor's point, it raises the broader discussion about the profile of the people ending up in EDs and whether more can be done the help them not end up in them, through doing more in our nursing homes, through more of the statutory home care scheme and through enhanced primary care teams.  That is the message I took away from our visit to Naas General Hospital last week.</p> <p>  The endoscopy unit needs to go to tender in early 2020, which is the intention.  That will greatly increase the capacity for scopes.  The very dedicated clinicians there have long been promised this.  They were about to get it and then the economy crashed.  That is badly needed.  I was excited to hear that that would give rise to the possibility of building two extra wards which would also provide more capacity.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked how we can get that waiting list to zero.  He very kindly and fairly noted the progress we have made in reducing the number of people waiting for hospital operations.  If we are very honest, we must acknowledge the number will never be zero, as the Deputy knows, because people will always be joining the list.  It is much more important to focus on how long they are waiting.  Many people, who go to see a doctor today and are referred for an operation, would not necessarily want the operation immediately.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare committee proposed that people should not wait longer than 12 weeks.  When I became Minister, about 32% of people in 2017 were having their hospital operation in 12 weeks or less and that is now up to 42%.  The right question for us all to ask is how we can get that 42% up to 100%.</p><p>We have discussed at length some of the ways we can do that.</p><p> Ms O'Connor may wish to add to what was said about CAMHS.  Thankfully through the investment we have made in the new assistant psychology posts and the 20 psychology posts in primary care, we have 114 assistant psychologists now working in primary care - certainly funded posts - and we have 20 psychology posts in primary care since last year.  We have seen a 20% reduction in the number of people waiting for child and adolescent mental health services.  If it is the Deputy's child or mine, we need them in straightaway.  Those lists are reducing and we need to build on that further.</p><p> One of the reasons for that reduction is that we are widening the range of services we are providing.  Not everybody needs to go through the CAMHS.  For some people an assistant psychologist might work.  On the other end of the spectrum, we will open the Portrane hospital next year.  We need to look at the entire range of mental health services available and not channel everybody through one route.  We need to broaden the capacity through a variety of ways. </p></speech>

I have four on my list and I am dealing with them daily.  I am not dealing with them very satisfactorily because they are frustrated.  In the past couple of weeks one of the four got on to a programme which was necessary.  In one case the child severely injured themselves and was referred to an accident and emergency department.  They had to wait all day in the accident and emergency department from 8 a.m. until night and had to come in the following morning again.  This is where we need to marry up the services.  It should have been possible for somebody somehow somewhere to identify the child as an urgent case.  The child, who had suffered a really serious injury, should have been taken out of the queue and put somewhere else to be dealt with.  I am asking for a close examination of the child and adolescent mental health services with a view to addressing the issues that arise regularly.  Some of them are life-threatening and can cause danger to the child and other family members, and danger to staff as time goes on.</p> <p>  We should find out from all hospitals where there is overcrowding at accident and emergency departments if any wards are closed or if any spaces are available in the hospital that can be utilised as wards and opened as a means of allowing a smooth throughput of patients.</p></speech>

I insist on having parity will all my peers, which can be difficult from time to time.</p> <p>  The Chairman might not remember I was a member of the first ministerial drugs task force a long time ago.  We seem to have drifted away from the original purpose of the exercise.  At that time methadone was a means to an end.  Now it seems to be an end in itself which is not what the task force at the time was interested in.  Do we have a focus on the way that we should deal with the drugs issue and drug abuse with a view to providing the means whereby the patient can come off drugs?</p><p>They should be enabled to get onto programmes that will get them off drugs and offer them an incentive for doing so, both for the betterment of their own health and that of their families and the community in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#BB00200"><p>There are ways of doing that.  Methadone has been in our communities for many years, providing help for people with addiction problems to live their lives.  Many people have been on methadone for some time and want to stay on it.  Sometimes it is sometimes difficult to change people's attitude to moving from one service to another.  Methadone helps them to achieve their daily tasks.  Another drug, Suboxone, can be used instead of methadone but it is not for everybody because people with other medical issues cannot take it.</p> <p>  To answer the question on what are we doing about the drug services in our communities, we have the national strategy of Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery.  We work on the ground with the HSE, statutory agencies and other bodies to bring people with addiction problems through recovery and support and, above all, deal with their families.  The stigma of addiction is still alive and well in our communities and we are trying to tackle that and create a health-led approach to the national drugs strategy.  It is about reducing the harm and helping people who have been on methadone for a long time to have a different focus in their lives.</p> <p>  Methadone will continue to be very much a part of the service that is provided for people who are in addiction but services will also be provided by level 1 and level 2 GPs.  Considerable work is being done with people in programmes on a daily basis, trying to facilitate them to go forward and live normal lives.  I meet and speak with many people who are on methadone and it is like a long-term illness for them because they need a certain amount of methadone to continue to function.  Level 1 and level 2 GPs and pharmacists are doing their best to help people with their doses and the prescription of methadone will continue for some time.  It is not the be-all and end-all of drug treatment but it is a means by which people can be looked after on maintenance programmes.  That is what is happening.</p> <p>  That is why it is so important that the national drugs strategy is seen as a health-led document, rather than a criminal justice document, and people who have specific illnesses relating to their addiction to alcohol and drugs are guided through the services in their communities.  The HSE and some of the primary care service centres across the country provide methadone clinics and needle exchange clinics.  People are visiting these centres on a daily basis.  They are not separated, they go in the same door as other patients and participate in the healthcare system.  One of the biggest problems is the stigma relating to addiction and to the families of addicts.  People who are trapped in addiction experience that stigma every day, particularly when they are living in communities where their families can also be targeted.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor gave some data about HSE initiatives.  In 2017, a task force was established by the Government, of which I was a co-chair with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly, and we produced the end report.  That set out a range of actions in respect of CAMHS initiatives that were to be put in place and those actions still hold true.  Many of them have been done but more need to be invested in.  One of those actions that was launched recently was a helpline to support young adults at points of distress in their lives.  The National Forensic Mental Health Service, based in Portrane, is also coming on stream.  It will have a state-of-the-art, dedicated CAMHS unit with dedicated beds.  The facility is due for completion before the end of the year.  I have been in the hospital and it is a fantastic facility that will be commissioned next year.</p> <p>  A number of committee members have raised an issue about the general pressure on our emergency departments.  It has been raised in the context of UHL, Naas hospital and more generally.  My assessment of the past six months suggests the following, much of which is Sl&aacute;intecare related.  When considering the pressure points on our emergency departments, we are going to have to stand back and look at what we are going to do differently because if we keep investing in the same way we have been, we will continue to get the same results.</p></speech>

Both the Minister and the Deputy have spoken about what they have seen in emergency departments.  My experience of visiting nearly all the 24-7 emergency departments around the country is that a significant cohort of patients should be treated in a different way and in a different setting.  A significant proportion of people who attend emergency departments are members of our aged population.  These people have chronic illnesses and multiple illnesses.  This is not a criticism because people are not attending emergency departments when they should not be.  We must create new routes for their treatment.  We need more GPs.  I have met people from the training college to discuss the matter and it is positive that is looks as if more GPs are coming on stream.  We need to invest in that and that is a part of our Sl&aacute;intecare solution.  Pharmacies can play a much better role in the context of treatment and care in the future.  The contract for pharmacists will be negotiated next year and that will give us an opportunity to look at what levels of care can take place in a pharmacy setting.  The first thing we need to do is to reduce the entry points into acute settings.</p> <p>  I listed a number of good, innovative triage processes, including advanced medical assessment units, having emergency department consultants in the emergency department all the time and having GPs in the emergency department.  There is really good innovation and the challenge is to scale that up across the country.  It is an issue of capacity in hospitals and the Minister has outlined some relief that will be part of the solution.  We also need more egress points, as the Minister touched on, which means more community and step-down beds and more investment in nursing home support schemes, which we will have in 2020 when we launch the service plan.</p> <p>  We would be misleading the public if we were to say that we will make matters better in a few weeks or months by doing this or that.   We have a key performance indicator in respect of trolleys.  I have worked in capacity and workflow management all my career and we have what is called a lag indicator which looks at the measure at the end of a congestion point.  We must develop a way of looking at our setting that looks at the whole workflow management process.  That is about entry points and how to reduce pressure on them at capacity, how in-house flow can be improved and the need for more settings for patients who are egressing.  This will not be solved in weeks or months and I did not convince anybody that it would be solved in that timescale when I took this job.  This is a relentless process in which we must invest for the coming years through Sl&aacute;intecare.  We must stick to the plan.  That is the longer-term solution and that is when we will be doing justice to the public.</p></speech>

I want to reinforce the point the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, made about stigma.  I spent approximately two hours at a private meeting of families impacted by addiction last night.  It is a weekly addiction family support meeting in Dublin which I was kindly allowed to attend.  The issue of stigma came up over and over again and the fact that we always talk about the addict but not the impacts that addiction has on family members.  One person has an addiction and the ripple effect means that it affects nine to a dozen others.  The Minister of State and I will look at how we can put in place better supports for the families of people with addiction in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  There is another element of stigma that I heard about at the meeting last night and at a number of recent meetings.  We are trying to open a supervised injection facility in the centre of Dublin because there is so much evidence that it works but, sadly, some politicians from across the political spectrum are objecting to that and engaging in NIMBYism.  This process was started by the then Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and has been championed by the Minister of State, but, sadly, others are delivering literature, tweeting and adding to the stigma for the sake of trying to get a few cheap votes locally.  I echo the calls that have been made to end the stigma and shame on those politicians who are involved in NIMBYism.  They should come along to the briefings at this committee, meet people with addiction and their families, know what they are talking about and should know better.</p></speech>

We are all trying to find extra capacity to deal with the immediate problems.  We know we need to do better in terms of building more hospital capacity and more community capacity in the coming months and years.  Basically, it is a call out to the system, and I echo that call again today.  If a hospital manager or a hospital group manager believes that he or she can open capacity, that there is a space in the hospital, that staff can be recruited or that there is a smaller hospital or community down the road where capacity can be opened quickly, then I want to hear it.  I am not interested in people promising to open capacity next July.  If a manager believes that he or she can open up capacity quickly, then the NTPF is working with the HSE to provide the funding.  From talking to the NTPF and the HSE, we estimate that the figure will be approximately 190 beds.  A total of 107 have now been approved.  Applications are still coming in.  When the Deputy goes back to her constituency and to Bantry, she will see that the invitation is there for everyone to apply quickly.  In fairness, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony is not only raising the issue at this stage - she raises it all the time.  People have been asked to apply by the end of this week or certainly in the coming days.</p></speech>

The committee discussed that matter previously.  Several ladies have come to me lately who are interested in getting the Mirena coil but it is too expensive.  It is probably good value for money in that there are five years of contraception from it and it controls heavy periods, etc.  Depending on which doctor they go to, women have to pay between &euro;250 and &euro;300.  That is expensive for many people.  It is not fair that if a woman is badly off she cannot afford contraception.</p></speech>

We asked our group in the Department to bring together all the different units involved in this area in terms of eligibility and the likes as well as health and health policy.  We published the report.  My officials and others, including representatives of the Irish Family Planning Association, came before the committee in recent weeks.  The clear direction of travel here has to be free contraception for every woman in Ireland.  The question for those of us around this table - it is a genuinely bipartisan question - is how we phase it and ensure that there is choice.  My view of the world is that in 2020 we should begin the legislative process with the group most in need.  My reading of the report and my engagement with the Irish Family Planning Association and others suggests that this group is made up of younger woman and women in traditionally vulnerable groups.</p> <p>  People mentioned elections.  I genuinely believe that before we go into the general election every party in the House should try to agree on a cross-party basis, as we have done on other contentious issues, that, whoever wins the election, we have a direction of travel.  We should agree that between year X and year Y we are going to travel the journey to free contraception.  It requires legislation.  We can give out free condoms.  We are already doing that.  We have expanded the national condom distribution service this year and vending machines are going in across colleges.  There is a legislative requirement for contraception when going to the doctor and the pharmacy.  We should legislate for the availability of free contraception on a phased basis by the end of 2020 or the start of 2021, but we need to agree the roadmap to get to full coverage.</p></speech>

I presume the Minister heard the report on "Morning Ireland".  They are convinced the children will suffer as adults if they grow up in a direct provision centre given the way they are being run now.  Will the Minister outline his thoughts on that matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#DD00800"><p>I did not hear the report but I am not surprised to hear that view.  Let us consider what direct provision and emergency accommodation for people coming to our country are about.  This is about people coming from what can be a highly traumatic environment and fleeing oppression to another country.  We can all imagine the trauma of that.  We can only begin to imagine the trauma of that for a child.  It is fair to say all of us are grappling with finding the right solutions from a housing and accommodation point of view.  I note Mr. Justice McMahon's documents proposing significant reform to direct provision.</p><p>We are committed to making those improvements.  We have to take, and we are taking, a whole-of-government approach to this.  The job of dealing with immigration, refugees and direct provision does not fall solely to the Department of Justice and Equality.  We had a Cabinet committee meeting on this earlier this week.  My Department is putting in health supports as well.  That is important.</p><p> We have a major issue that we have to nip in the bud.  It relates to the creeping racism in our political debates around this.  I am not going to get into specific examples but I believe we all need to call it out.  Whoever is in government will face this challenge.  The Department of Justice and Equality is doing an excellent job on behalf of Irish citizens in responding to Ireland's international obligations to take in, support and give c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to people fleeing oppression.  That means all our communities providing support.  It means all of us providing enough resources and supports for those communities.  My Department will not be found wanting in that regard.</p><p> Is direct provision the ideal model?  Absolutely not, but the Deputy and I need to be able to answer the question of what the ideal model is.  In the midst of a housing shortage we need to be realistic.  We need to make our direct provision far better.  We need to implement the recommendations of the McMahon report and that is what we are doing.  My Department and the HSE need put in place the wraparound services and that is what we are doing.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, in Bandon we had few or no applications for two positions.  Throughout west Cork, there are pockets or areas that have no South Doc cover at night-time due to the low number of general practitioners available.  What is happening with the contract?  I know the Minister understands the importance of a new contract.  The other contract is too old to be working under.  GPs do not want to work as GPs any more.  It is serious.</p></speech>

The Chairman raised the matter with me in the D&aacute;il last week.  The first part is to acknowledge that we need to train far more GPs.  I am pleased to see that the number of GPs entering training is increasing.  That is not a political statement.  The Irish College of General Practitioners and others are welcoming this.  We are now training more GPs than ever and that is good news.</p> <p>  The second part is how the hell we ensure they stay GPs and how we keep them in Ireland.  The GP contract is an important part of that.  A doctor can now become a GP in an era that will be post FEMPI, one in which doctors will be better resourced and supported not only financially but in terms of paternity leave, maternity leave, increased rural allowance and a fund for areas of urban deprivation if a doctor is working there.</p> <p>  The third point is the immediate issue.  What I have just said is good and important but the third point is the immediate issue.  There are areas today that need a GP tomorrow.  I commend what the HSE is doing in this regard, which is trying to be flexible in terms of how we can do practical things to incentivise a GP to stay in an area.  This may include things like trying to find premises for the GP, integrating the practice into a primary care centre or trying to assist with ancillary staffing.  This are things that make it a little more likely that a GP will agree to go into a given area.  I know the HSE are working on several areas throughout the country.  I think there is locum cover or GP cover in all of them.  Certainly, that is what I understood from my last briefing note, but people want a permanent GP.</p></speech>

A hell of a lot of people put a large number of obstacles in our way.  Vested interests with deep pockets attempted to stop us passing the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  I acknowledge that we passed it together with civic society and public health advocates.  I thank people for their co-operation.  We have enacted a number of parts of the Act, including that relating to advertising restrictions.  Since last month, one cannot advertise alcohol on any public transport or in any public transport station.  It is kind of amazing that this has happened so quietly.</p></speech>

I will explain why I do not buy into the baloney which suggests that we cannot bring it in until Northern Ireland does so.  Scotland did it without waiting for England.  It is about to be done in Wales, but the authorities in England are not about to do it.  I remind the Deputy that we are talking about a certain type of alcohol.  We are not talking about high-cost alcohol.  That is the whole idea.  I do not believe 16 or 17 year old lads, some of whom cannot drive or should not be allowed to drive, will get into their cars and drive for 90 minutes to buy a few cans of Dutch Gold.  That is not the way the world works.  We should move ahead with minimum unit pricing.  It is up to me to make a call on when to bring in the memo.  It makes sense to wait for a degree of certainty in respect of Britain and the Brexit date.  There is a great deal of uncertainty in that regard.  We might have a degree of certainty very shortly.</p></speech>

I spoke to him a while ago about the lack of residential places in west Cork.  Many elderly parents of adults with special needs in the area are afraid of getting sick or getting old.  This is breaking them down.  They are afraid that they will be too shook to be able to look after their children or that they will pass away.  They need certainty about the availability of places.  I ask the Minister of State to address this.</p></speech>

The issue of residential places has been one of my top five priorities during those negotiations.  We need to deal with many issues, including day services and personal assistance hours.  The bottom line is that we have a cohort of elderly parents whose adult children with intellectual disabilities are in need of residential places.  We have not yet finalised the service plan.  The need for new residential places for people in critical need is a major issue for me.  I accept the Deputy's point that we need to focus on these issues.  We are going to exceed &euro;2 billion in the 2020 HSE service plan for 2020.  We need to ensure that we have priorities in the context of that &euro;2 billion.  Elderly parents of adults with intellectual disabilities are very worried about the future.  They have a right to residential places for their children.  I am determined to facilitate that.  I would say we will know more about this in the next week or so.</p></speech>

It should be easy to provide the information because the benefit of the NTPF is that one can track the patient through his or her entire journey.  It is not money that goes into an overall budget but is individually allocated to a patient.  I assure the Chairman that there is a direct correlation between the significant increase in funding for reducing waiting lists and the reduction of waiting lists.</p></speech>

I do not have a specific figure but we see an average of 450,000 to 500,000 people missing hospital appointments each year.  There has to be something behind that and we are digging for information about that.  It is much higher in some areas than others.  Some areas send out text reminders and some do not.  The entire number of patients waiting for an outpatient appointment is some 500,000, and 500,000 people are missing appointments, so we need to look at what is happening with the "do not attend" figures.</p></speech>

An issue that was raised was the creation of panels for appointments.</p><p>There is a problem in respect of those panels.  I understand that those panels will be concluded next year and that a new panel system will be drawn up.  On that issue, I am aware of a speech and language therapist in a hospital who has been approved to move to a different hospital but cannot because the recruitment process for the position she holds is frozen, not funded, not approved or whatever is the term.  There is an issue in respect of panels and, in particular, the geography associated with panels.  One may be a specialist in the south of Ireland and when a vacancy arises one is offered a position in the North of the country, which is not practical for one to take up.  There seems to be a problem in respect of the constituent parts of panels and the way people are offered jobs from those panels.  The Minister might clarify that when replying.</p><p> Deputy Margaret Murphy-O'Mahony raised the issue of GP vacancies.  The particular problem that arises when somebody retires is the way that post is filled.  I want to make a practical suggestion to the Minister.  The panel system for interviewing for GPs is out of date.  The marking system might be out of date also because when somebody retires, it is important to have local information on the way that GP panel is filled.  Having the retired GP who has just vacated the position as part of that panel is important because he or she may well have been head-hunting for somebody to come onto that list before he or she retires and would have a good deal of local knowledge about who would be the most appropriate person to take on the list.  It is often the case that a list is drawn up, the system of offering it to the first, second or third person is gone through and by the time the person who wants the job or could take it is reached, he or she has moved on.  The marking system is disconnected from the practical availability of GPs on the ground because the longer a panel is unfilled, the less chance we have of getting somebody from that existing panel.  The input of the retiring GP or much more local input in the interview process would speed up the filling of that position.</p><p> The MRI scanner in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, is long overdue but very welcome.  I am disappointed that it will operate only from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  The MRI scanner is essential to reducing the number of people waiting for admission to the hospital and confining its use from Monday to Friday does not make the best use of it.  It should operate for longer hours during the week but it also should function at weekends to clear the backlog of MRI scans, not only for patients in casualty but also patients on waiting lists.  Consultants in the mid-west are now advising public patients to get their scans done privately because they will not get them done publicly in a timely manner.  It is important that the Minister should consider the opening hours for that scanner.</p><p> Mr. Reid referred earlier to theatres in Ennis hospital.  It is essential that the theatres in the hospital be upgraded.  Two new modular theatres are required to allow inpatient day-care procedures to be carried out.  That would take a lot of pressure off UL and allow ear, nose and throat surgery in particular, about which we have spoken previously, to be developed in Ennis hospital in the way ophthalmology services have been developed in Nenagh.  It would be critical infrastructure to put in place to solve the problems all of us have mentioned earlier in respect of UHL.  The Minister might comment on using our model 2 hospitals to the maximum advantage.</p><p> Mr. Reid also mentioned hospital avoidance.  It is critical that we expand our community intervention team, CIT, services to allow frail elderly people remain in their homes.  CIT services are essential for that.  There is an axis between CIT GPs and public health nurses.</p><p>If they do not exist within the community, people will end up in accident and emergency services unnecessarily when they could be managed at home.</p><p> We mentioned previously that it is essential to expand community diagnostics.  That is one of the pillars of the winter plan for the mid-west but I am not aware how GPs or others access those community diagnostics because information is not available on that.</p><p> On the timeline for scheduled care hospitals, site selection will happen next year.  In terms of the process, it will then have to go to design, procurement, tendering, building and commissioning.  What is the timeline for an elective hospital to take in patients?  Is the children's hospital consuming funds that should be going to all of those other services?  The Minister might give us a timeline for that in respect of elective hospitals.</p><p> My last question relates to ophthalmology services in the mid-west.  The waiting time from seeing the consultant to having surgery is reduced but the waiting time for an initial visit, even though one may have a diagnosis of a cataract from an optician, needs to be removed.  One presents with the diagnosis.  A diagnosis process is not necessary but getting to that first visit is still taking two to three years in the mid-west.  I accept the time may be shorter after one has been seen but the time between being referred and being seen is still two to three years.  That is my first tranche of questions for the Minister.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleagues to come in on some of the questions because they are more appropriate to them, particularly the point the Chairman made on panels.</p><p>On GP vacancies, I agree with the Chairman.  We need to listen to him on that in terms of his professional experience but also his knowledge in terms of what is happening on the ground in rural parts of Ireland.  We may or may not agree on this but I am clear as to what we need to do about increasing the pipeline in terms of new GPs and trying to keep them in Ireland.  I accept that we need to do more in terms of the contract but as I said earlier, there is an immediacy now in some communities.  We are already seeing on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis communities stepping up after the crisis emerges, meeting with the HSE and asking how this can be fixed.  We are seeing good examples of some of the collaboration taking place.  I saw it in Kerry recently where the community and the HSE locally are working together but only after the vacancy arises.  One of the points the Chairman is making is that there should be greater community involvement at a much earlier stage.  We know that, say, Dr. X is due to retire so we should start that process earlier.</p><p>The Chairman's comment on the marking scheme is fair.  There might be an issue in terms of a GP choosing their successor, which is not what he is suggesting, but we need to get the balance right.  I ask that the HSE witnesses would reflect on what the Chairman has said and revert to him on it.  As an issue arises, I believe the HSE is doing a very good job of engaging with the community but can we plan better further out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#MM00300"><p>In terms of medical recruitment and the medical workforce in general, we have established a medical workforce oversight group that both myself and Dr. Henry co-chair to examine how we currently recruit and retain our doctors.  A core part of that is GPs because we are very conscious of the need to future-proof in terms of Sl&aacute;intecare, community health networks and our process around engaging with the Irish College of General Practitioners and all of that.  GPs are key in that in terms of our approach so we can certainly look at the points the Chairman raised in respect of the interviewing and the replacement process.</p> <p>  I might pick up on a couple of other points.  The MRI scanner in University Hospital Limerick is opening 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to begin with.  However, the contract with the provider has the capacity to extend that.  If the demand requires longer hours, we can certainly introduce those.</p> <p>  I agree with the Chairman on the expansion of CIT services.  We are looking at CIT services.  We will be looking at increasing the CIT capacity and the community frailty intervention team in the community in the mid-west.  We want to focus our efforts on making sure that we have CITs, that they are integrated into the broader primary care service delivery and linked with acute hospitals also.  That is very much part of our plan, and the mid-west is part of our plan for 2020.</p></speech>

I have never suggested that these are things that can be done today or tomorrow.  They are very much a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a ten-year plan.  I hope that they will be delivered during the first half of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We would have a much better outlook regarding what they will constitute - sites and the like - by the first quarter of next year.</p><p> The Chairman's point about inpatient day cases versus outpatients is valid.  It is one we have discussed quite regularly and one that the NTPF, the HSE and the Department are eager to move on in 2020.  Patients do not differentiate between the outpatient and the inpatient nor should they.  If I have a problem with my eye, I need to see a consultant.  When I see the consultant, I might need a cataract operation or whatever.  That is the wait, that is the total time.  The question is whether we can put in place a system that takes someone through the entire process and whether the NTPF can help fund that whole journey, in other words, taking somebody through the outpatient clinic, to having the procedure done and out the other end?  The way we differentiate between outpatients and inpatients is not the way real life works for people.</p><p> There are very exciting proposals, with which the Chairman will be familiar, regarding community ophthalmology and a view that a lot more can be done in that context.  In the context of that specialty and half a dozen others to which I referred in my opening statement, we can press "go" on a few in 2020.  That would make a significant difference.</p><p> I am not sure whether Ms O'Connor answered the question about community diagnostics in the mid-west and whether GPs know how to access community diagnostics under the winter plan.</p></speech>

In terms of the work we are doing with the mid-west, the head of primary care there is very engaged with us in terms of the roll-out.  That is where we have the CIT and the FIT proposals coming through.</p> <p>  In terms of how GPs access community diagnostics, I would have to check what the mechanism for communicating that is.  I am sure there is some mechanism that has been thought through but I do not know the answer to it.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and the Chairman also raised this issue with the Minister of State, who indicated that he is focusing on it.  I wish to highlight the case of families where a child or adult with particular needs relating to Down's syndrome or another condition has been under the care of their parents and the parents have become old and inform or have passed away.  I feel particularly strongly about this because when the parents pass away, the vulnerable individual really has nobody to stand up for him or her apart from Members of this House or other public representatives.  There is a particular case in Mayo involving a young man in his early 30s.  Both his parents are deceased.  My understanding is that Western Care gets a budget allocation and is to provide services in the community.  In this case, it is not delivering the service because the individual is not getting residential care and no budget is available for him.  The net impact is that this young man does not have a stable environment.  People like him want to be under the care of Western Care and live out the rest of their lives in a stable environment.  While I know this is a priority for the Minister of State, can he give me any indication as to when a space for this gentleman, about whom I have been tormenting the Minister of State since last June, will become available?  I want the gentleman to whom I refer to remain anonymous.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, there will be a significant increase in resources over the &euro;2 billion figure regarding the HSE service plan.  I want to personalise this in one way because I agree with Deputy O'Connell that the important thing is to focus on the families and the person with a disability.  In 2020, we plan to have 8,358 residential places.  We have 33,700 day respite sessions, 166,00 respite overnights and 23,000 day places so these are the kind of plans that are in place.  One goes back to the core question.  Every year, we have a number of people in those situations.  I am pushing very strongly for the extra money and resources.  I have been talking to the Minister - even over the past few days.  The Minister gets it.  He is very supportive of me.  Do we need more residential places for people in critical need who have no family?  That is the phrase I am using.  The answer is "Yes".  I hope to see some of those new residential places come into play in the next couple of weeks.  That is my view at the moment but I do accept that when we are having a debate about budgets and the service plan, when one digs deep, one must pick out priorities.  I accept the Deputy's point about those adults with disabilities whose parents are dead.  Under the UN convention, these people have a right to a service so we must push that.  I am confident that there will be major improvements in the service plan for 2020.  </p></speech>

A couple of GPs have contacted me regarding an anomaly within the system.  The example I have been given is a girl in west Dublin with a full medical card who had to travel to another part of Dublin to get a GP to carry out her termination of pregnancy.  There is an anomaly within the PCRS.  Any GP providing the service can claim the fees for the termination of pregnancy but that same GP, who is not the person's regular GP, cannot prescribe Implanon or another long-acting reversible form of contraception.  It seems like a missed opportunity when the individual looking for the termination of pregnancy is eligible under the medical card system.  This is not about getting extra eligibility.  It is about someone who is already deemed eligible for medical card services being able to avail of services such as the insertion of Implanon by the GP who carries out the termination of pregnancy in the short period of time - either on the day or a short period of time thereafter.  My understanding is that it is just a matter of the PCRS allowing within the portal for the GP performing the termination to claim as opposed to the default GP with whom the girl is registered in her own area.  Am I making any sense?</p></speech>

Regarding methadone, I am delighted to hear that the Minister met with the families of people involving in the methadone scheme or who have had their lives ravaged by addiction.  I am very supportive of the Minister visiting the families.  For many people, particularly in these Houses, it is fine to talk about people in the abstract, be they in a methadone or direct provision centre or any sort of centre, as if they are a different type or sort of person but, as I am sure the Minister saw last night, these are normal people from normal families who walk among us and have just been hit in some unfortunate way and touched by the ravages of drug addiction.  I very much welcome the Minister's visit last night.  Methadone treatment is almost regarded as being negative.  There is a perception that if somebody is on 10 ml of methadone for the rest of his or her life, that is somehow a bad thing.</p><p>To my mind, it is a good thing.  If they need a maintenance dose to keep the show on the road and keep their lives in line, it is good to have that relationship with their prescribing doctor and their pharmacist to keep them on the straight and narrow.  I very much welcome this and any additional supports that can be given to families.  I welcome any measures that highlight what they have to deal with in their lives, the impacts on other children in the family and the extended family, and also people's positions in their neighbourhoods and communities.  Stigma has been mentioned this morning.  Families who have been ravaged by drugs often face strong push-back in their communities.  I welcome any moves to support those families.</p><p> As was reported yesterday, in recent times there has been a significant increase in the incidence of mumps in our population.  In Samoa, we have also seen a shutdown with the outbreak of measles.  All of this is part of the global dumbing down when it comes to vaccination, fake news, the Wakefield generation coming of age and such.  The net impact of the mumps outbreak is that we are going to have a generation of young men who will have fertility problems when they seek to start families.  Is there any plan to try to highlight this?  I have always thought that the young people who are affected are probably the key.  If a young man discovers that his parents chose not to vaccinate him against mumps when he was a child, and now his future in terms of having children is going to be severely impacted, is there any plan to wake that generation up to the impacts of previous decisions on their healthcare?  In terms of measles, the Minister said some time ago that he was exploring mandatory vaccinations and was seeking the position of the Attorney General.  While I do not agree with mandatory vaccination in a normal setting, it is now high time we addressed this.  We have the situation in Samoa.  The UK has lost its measles-free status, as far as I know.  This issue is encroaching on us and perhaps we should be prepared, if there is a confluence of events that leads to an outbreak here, to protect the population if we had to.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give us his thoughts on that.</p></speech>

After my meeting last night, I am just so conscious of how grateful families impacted by addiction are that she and others raise these issues and that we talk about them here.  They feel they are never talked about.  We do not talk about addiction enough in Ireland but we talk even less about the impact of addiction on the family.  The Deputy is right that the reason we do not do so is that there is a nice, cosy consensus and an ignorant view that this only happens to X type of person or in Y type of place.  That is complete and utter bull.  The phrase I kept thinking of last night is "There but for the grace of God go I."  This could visit any of our homes or communities.  Frankly, it is visiting all of our communities.  A woman told me last night how the first time someone she knew became aware that her son was addicted to drugs was when she was sitting down watching Coronation Street.  There was a knock on the door and she asked her husband to get up and open it and there were two men in balaclavas with baseball bats standing at their hall door looking to recover a drugs debt.  This is a reality for people and we have to start talking about it.  It is a real health crisis, a public health epidemic.  There is a lot of that same ignorant stigma that we have around other social issues and the notion that it only happens to certain types of people.  That is nonsense and we need to call time on it.  In this committee or in a future configuration, we should be doing more on this.  I intend to do a lot more on it.  The UK has a helpline for families affected by addiction.  I want to explore how we can look at this as well.  We need to do a lot more.</p> <p>  On the issue of mumps, measles and mandatory vaccination, I know Deputy O'Connell is passionate about the whole area of vaccination.  The current status in terms of my own thought process and policy development is that I am awaiting a report from the Health Research Board, HRB.  I asked it to do a body of work on what could be effective.  I am not interested in a stunt or something that looks like we are doing something.  I want to do something.  I have asked the HRB to look at what other jurisdictions have done that has proven effective in terms of combating vaccine hesitancy.  I am expecting that report any day now and by the end of the year.  I will read it alongside the advice of the Attorney General and come forward with policy proposals.</p><p>My view is that there may be issues with the Constitution in the context of education and schools.  People have a constitutional right to a primary education.  How a constitutional rights interacts with a particular issue may present a challenge.  If, however, we are really serious about vaccination, we know that it happens prior to primary school.  It actually happens when children are in cr&egrave;ches and other childcare facilities.</p><p> I make a plea to Early Childhood Ireland and others regarding the fact that there is nothing stopping cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers from making it a requirement for parents to show that their children have been vaccinated in order for them to be accepted by those facilities.  This has become the norm in terms of how we deal with our family pets.  It is quite astonishing that it is not the norm when it comes to dealing with children.  If I were to send my child to a cr&egrave;che, I would like to know that not only have I done right by her in terms of getting her vaccinated but that she is going into an environment where she cannot pick up other illness because other people have failed in their duties to protect public health.  All of us should be calling on cr&egrave;ches and childcare providers to make this part of good practice and guidelines from today.  I do not think there is any reason that this should not happen.</p><p> In terms of the Deputy's question regarding an effective campaign, I have heard her talk about how we can have an effective campaign for the generation that were not vaccinated - the Wakefield generation, as the Deputy refers to them.  She is dead right.  It is a really important campaign that we could run in colleges, etc.  The Vaccine Alliance is looking at what is effective in terms of public awareness campaigns.  I will certainly feed that back to it.  The final point I want to make on vaccinations is that I had meetings with the social media companies recently.  Social media has been a really great tool but would Brexit have happened, would Donald Trump have been elected, and would the uptake rate relating to the HPV vaccine have dropped so significantly if we did not have social media?  Who knows.  We certainly know that the spread of disinformation and misinformation on social media has contributed significantly to a decrease in vaccination rates, particularly around the HPV vaccine but also in respect of other vaccines.  At the meetings, I was encouraged somewhat that they were doing some things and that they are certainly realising even from a business model point of view that their users expect them to do more.  I am still a little concerned with Google wanting to keep as its "secret sauce" information relating to how one becomes the number one hit on a Google search.  When I search the word "vaccination" on Google, I do not think it is acceptable that I get anything other than a reputable source of information at the top of the results list.  We have agreed to keep in touch and work with Google.  It has agreed to come in and speak to the Vaccine Alliance.  A lot more work definitely needs to be done in that area.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss primary care centres.  I do not want to land the issue on them this morning but, in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare, it is fundamental that we move things out of acute settings and into the primary care setting.  There were 341 primary care centres planned from 2008 onwards.  The matter was reviewed in 2012.  It emerged at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week that no one has reviewed position of the centres in light of Sl&aacute;intecare in order to see if they are fit for purpose in terms of what we want to deliver.  There is no definition of what constitutes a primary care centre or a primary care team.  While I am not completely hung up on that, if we are going to move towards treating defined populations, then, in the context of the connection between acute care and community care, it is imperative that the system that was embarked upon in 2008 is modified and made fit for purpose.  If we are going to add diagnostic centres, we have to ensure that capacity exists among the 341 that are planned.  Obviously, we cannot have 341 diagnostic centres but capacity must be there - dotted around the country - and it must be possible to add things so that we are not going to have to buy sites next to centres or whatever.  When we are doing Sl&aacute;intecare, it is about ensuring that we are not already tying a stone to our leg while we are doing it.  We should be able to do it with the plans that are already there.  We can modify them as we go.  I was a bit concerned last week that it was almost as though the primary care thing was put on a shelf and left there and was operating separately from Sl&aacute;intecare when it is integral to its success.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with her sentiment or direction of travel in terms of the role of primary care centres and Sl&aacute;intecare-proofing them.  As we were outlining just last week, of the 340 we have 127 in place, there is another 77 in progress and 30 are committed in our capital plan.  What we want to do now is exactly as the Deputy outlined.</p><p>We are now looking forward to a new way of treatment and care to which there are various elements, as I touched on earlier.  The first element is GPs, the second is pharmacies, and the third is the primary care centres, both in terms of entry points and egress points.  In my visits to many such centres around the country, I have seen various levels of capability and resourcing.  Centres that have a GP on-site, such as the one I visited last week in Waterford, are very successful.  Young children and those seeking paediatric services come in to them as well, which takes huge pressure off the acute settings.  The centres are very successful when they have the skills and resources in place.  There are other that are fine centres but which do not have the skills, resources, and diagnostics needed to equip them.  As we look forward to Sl&aacute;intecare and talk about new pathways, I am very committed that the investment in the next 77 centres and the infrastructure of the current 127 must be Sl&aacute;intecare-proofed.  In terms of the existing centres, the first element is the &euro;10 million investment committed to in our service plan, as part of the budget, which will rise to &euro;60 million.  That will give us the capacity for 1,000 extra resources on the community side, of which a significant proportion must be in our primary care centres. </p></speech>

I have two quick questions.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is providing funding for 15 beds to be opened at St. John's hospital in Limerick.  However, I have learned from my own inquiries made on Monday that those 15 beds have not been in use for the last three months.  At the same time, there is continuous and severe overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  By all means, we should push for the new MRI scanner there, because it would be fantastic.  Why were those 15 beds not put into use three months ago, when there is such a big crisis in Limerick on a continual basis?</p> <p>  The building of the 60-bed block is under way, and the 90-bed block will be going in for planning permission shortly.  What measures is the HSE taking, at both national and local level, to ensure all existing bed capacity is being used?  What is being done to ensure all the beds in University Hospital Limerick, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom hospitals are being used on an ongoing basis?  I was shocked to hear that 15 of the 89 beds in St. John's have been out of use for the last three months.  That is unforgivable and unacceptable.  It was a breaking point and a red line for me.  The Government is willing to give whatever resources are required, so I need an answer to these questions.  When did the witnesses first know about the 15 beds and why were they not brought into use three months ago?  What is being done to manage the beds in the five hospitals in the group, namely, UHL, St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom?  I was at a mass in a village in east Limerick on Sunday, where nursing homes were advertising that they have spare capacity.  Is due diligence is being done to ensure available nursing home beds and step-down facilities are being used?  I am looking for solutions here.  Deputy Kelly noted that we are all looking for solutions, and we must use the existing resources to the maximum.  I ask the witnesses to address why the 15 beds in St. John's were not put to use three months ago, and whether we are making use of all the available bed capacity in the region.</p></speech>

The primary focus is the treatment of patients elsewhere in the community.  The question is how quickly we can make that happen.  I welcome Mr. Reid's inclusion of a bigger input from the pharmacy community, with which I agree.  I take this opportunity to recognise that the proposed cuts to pharmacy funding are no longer going ahead, for which I thank the Minister and acknowledge his work in the area.  I would add the use of electronic records in emergency departments to fast-track patients, monitor waiting times etc. to Mr. Reid's synopsis.</p><p>Our health budget of over &euro;17 billion is up there among developed countries, as it is a high spend <i>per capita</i>.  Based on his six months in the job, does Mr. Reid think it possible to start getting value for the money we are spending?  Cataract operations are still being carried out in the North of Ireland on a regular basis, for example.  Buses go up there from Kerry and Cork.  I send patients up there on public transport and they are seen within a number of weeks.  Yet, every time I submit a query to the HSE about a cataract operation for a constituent, I receive the standard reply that the waiting list is 18 to 24 months.  Surely there is a better way of doing this.  We give that money back to these patients, so it is coming out of the same pot.  It is quicker and more convenient for a patient in the far south of Ireland to travel up to Belfast to get a cataract procedure done.  I cannot see any reason why the system in this country cannot deal with that.</p><p>Mr. Reid also spoke about delayed discharges-----</p></speech>

Delayed discharges in Kerry approached 4,000 bed nights this year.  The trolley count for the same period was also around 4,000.  A pilot scheme has been initiated which aims to get patients who are not in need of acute beds into community settings.  What progress has been made on that, and what is the likelihood that it can be extended full time?  The figures correlate, so if one problem is solved, it will go a long way to solving the other.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#SS00500"><p>I will make few comments on the various issues raised.  My analysis is definitely in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I have not invented anything different.  However, I have seen a significant amount of innovation all across our acute and community settings.  While Sl&aacute;intecare is a new direction in terms of pathways to care and devolved regions, we can also scale up and roll out much of what is good in our hospital and community settings.  I have seen a significant amount of that in terms of emergency departments, process flow, oversight of bed capacity within a unit, electronic monitoring of beds and centrally managed hubs.  We can scale up and roll out much of that innovation, on top of the direction of flight of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>We have to scale up better pathways for treatment.  That requires more GPs, more primary care investment and more utilisation of pharmacies.  I agree about electronic solutions.  Electronic health records will take time and investment.  We know it works where we have put it in place.  There is a shorter pathway we can take, which is to have a shared record of patients' care between the GP and the acute setting the Chairman has been talking about quite a bit.  That is an incremental step that we can take in advance of the major investment in the electronic health records.<br/><br/>On budget spend, outcomes and related issues, an OECD report was published in the past couple of weeks.  It is quite good and has a synopsis of this.  It demonstrates that health expenditure is above the EU <i>per capita</i>average.  Life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost six years since 2000.  The report also states that our general public healthcare is comparable with other OECD countries.  It highlights some particular issues that we have with obesity and alcohol, and the demands that places on our services.  It is a good report and I recommend browsing it.  We have a high standard.</p></speech>

On wider issues, I made a point earlier about the investment that we have made.  We have an extra &euro;1 billion in health expenditure this year compared to last year, an increase of 6.3%.  From what I have seen, investment in the areas we have spoken about is key, as is investing in a different way for the future.  We are finalising next year's service plan at the minute and it will start to make that step.  As the Deputy will be aware, the way that we can relieve the pressure on acute settings is by investment in community settings.  Our service plan for next year starts to make that shift in an incremental way, which is valuable.  There is a challenge for us, as I said in our opening statement, about how we manage with the funds that we have in an effective manner to make the right decisions and investments, and to hold local management to account.  It has to be about safety, improving access and managing within a budget.  Those are three relative challenges that have to be run in parallel, though they are not always conflicting.</p> <p>  I made the point in my opening statement that we have done the State some good this year with our oversight of the health spend.  The overrun will be less than half that of last year.  The overrun last year was &euro;650 million plus a &euro;150 million first charge for the following year.  It will be significantly less than half of that by the outturn this year.  That has largely been through the discipline of working with line managers, holding people to account and making sure that we are recruiting in the right places.  I know recruitment has been difficult for everybody.  We have to make sure we are recruiting where we have a budget and that we are recruiting skills that add to service delivery.  The point I made earlier is that we are looking at the centre of the HSE to see what size it should be in the future.  I believe it should be scaled down and that we should devolve more of what we have in the HSE centre to the regions to some hospital acute settings and community settings.  We have to look at it very differently.  That is about management of finances.</p> <p>  With regard to lay discharges, I spent some time in Kerry in a hospital in an acute setting and in a community setting.  I was a little frustrated on the day I was there when it was highlighted that there were some beds available in the community and we had delayed discharges in our community setting.  We immediately convened a meeting that evening with the relevant CHO and the hospital manager.  The CHO has worked to increase capacity through a number of initiatives that it has put in place since.  Some beds were available in Killarney at the time and some of those are being utilised.  Some of that is now built into our winter action teams.  Kerry has a good interface and integration between community and acute settings.  A number of initiatives in community settings are giving relief to acute settings.  While they have a challenge in delayed discharges, they had some good initiatives working in a way that we want them to in the future.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

It is inexcusable that 15 beds in St. John's hospital were not open during a crisis in bed capacity in the UHL hospital group.  I also find it inexcusable that doctors from the acute hospital are not willing to go to some of the smaller hospitals such as St. John's.  I referred to those two issues when speaking with Deputy Kelly earlier.  The process needs to be fixed and there needs to be management accountability.  We saw this on television last night and on the front page of a newspaper in recent days.  As soon as the proposal came in for the 15 beds, we wrote the cheque.</p></speech>

At national level, we look at all of the beds in order that we know how many beds are closed or blocked daily, primarily due to infection.  We know that yesterday, across the national system, 111 beds were closed.  We also look at the daily availability of beds in community settings.  The approach through winter is a key focus for us, to make sure that people are stepping out of the acute settings altogether and moving into relevant step-down facilities and transitional care.  At this time, nobody is waiting for transitional care approval.  We are trying to match patients from acute settings to community settings and to ensure that people who are ready to move can move.</p> <p>  On Deputy Brassil's question about delayed transfer of care, we are doing a great deal of work on that.  Last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, commissioned an independent review on delayed transfers of care.  We have been looking at how we record people who are ready to leave acute settings, etc.  Since we started to implement our winter initiative in September, one of the key measures that we have looked at is bed days lost.  We will always have people in beds but how long they are there for is our challenge.  We have reduced the bed days lost by 20% since September on foot of the initiatives we have put in place.  We are proactively trying every day to move people who have been waiting the longest from acute hospitals into more appropriate settings.</p></speech>

I want to raise a number of issues and I will focus on Limerick.  The last time I was here, I mentioned that the blood clinic in UHL closes at 12 noon on a Friday and it needs to be open longer.  It is stopping people from being discharged or some end up being sent to the hospital because there is nobody to read their blood count.</p> <p>  In regard to the beds at St. John's, while I welcome the announcement this morning, when I inquired two weeks ago and brought it to the Minister's attention, my understanding was there were 20 beds at that stage.  I want to know if five beds have disappeared since that time.</p> <p>  I welcome the centre that was opened last Wednesday by the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, on behalf of the Minister.  Mr. Reid referred to new ways of doing things in regard to the discharge of patients.  There is a proposal in the capital plan for 120 replacement beds at St. John's hospital.  If that was brought forward, it would certainly help to free up the beds in the hospital so procedures could be carried out.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, regarding respite.  He has a fund for respite homes.  St. Gabriel's School and Centre in Limerick has a six-bedroom respite unit ready to go and the HSE released funding recently for a staff member to manage the facility.  However, funding to get the rest of the respite centre open is what is necessary.  I have spoken to the Minister about it.  Will he visit the facility the next time he is in Limerick?  It would certainly help young people with disabilities. </p></speech>

Does the Minister have the Valproate response project report on his desk?  Has he been in contact with OACS Ireland and Epilepsy Ireland about this?  I asked him before about a public inquiry into this.  Is he still open to an independent inquiry or investigation into the prescribing of Valproate, given the teratogenic effects of it were widely known, even back to the 1970s, as well as the increased risk of foetal anticonvulsant syndrome around it.  I am asking about an inquiry into who knew what when, and why it continued to be prescribed when there was so much evidence worldwide on the impact it might have.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, in regard to the transition period - I do not want to say handover period - for service users going from Western Care to Praxis Care.  What is the protocol around the transition period?  I have concerns around this.  How do we ensure the organisations to which we are signing over the budget have the capacity, and have done their recruitment and everything else, to have the services and supports in place?  The Minister of State knows that, for the condition of autism, routine and familiarity are so important.  I am concerned that new teams are going in and there is no transition period, so there is no time for the service user to get used to the new practices or that can be done in a way that is streamlined. </p></speech>

I noted his statement on the RCOG report.</p><p>I have ideological issues with the way CervicalCheck has been outsourced.  I acknowledge that but I also acknowledge that the Minister needs and wants, and I accept that women must have, confidence in CervicalCheck, that it has to be used, that it is a good thing and that it saves lives.  I want to get that out of the way, and I am not confused about it at all.<br/><br/>I am, however, very confused about one aspect of the RCOG report.  The NHS screening programme guidance for applying duty of candour in disclosing results, on page 6, states: &quot;... sometimes it can be hard for screening services to know how to distinguish between a false negative/false positive that has occurred because of the limitations of screening and a false negative/false positive that has occurred because <i>something has gone wrong</i>&quot;.  I am curious as to why that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; has not tweaked the Minister's interest in investigating what went wrong in the labs.  Consistently, in the highlighted court cases that we know of involving women who are still alive and women who have died, they successfully sued the laboratories and have been paid big sums, not out of the goodness of the hearts of those laboratories, but because &quot;something has gone wrong&quot; and, clearly, they are acknowledging that when they pay out vast sums.  I want to know why the Minister is not curious that &quot;something has gone wrong&quot;, and why we are not examining what went wrong in those labs.<br/><br/>I will give a quick analogy.  If there was an accident at Dublin Airport and five or six people were killed, would we investigate the causes and what might have gone wrong, or would we say that those deaths are within the statistical norms of aviation globally, Dublin Airport is working to appropriate health and safety standards, so why would we bother investigating what went wrong?  I would like an answer from the Minister as to why he is not interested in investigating what went wrong in those labs.  It is connected with my consistent appeal for the figures in regard to which labs the 221+ women's smear tests were carried out in.  I am curious as to why that does not bother the Minister.  He is comparing the results of the RCOG report for Ireland with the results for the NHS.  However, the NHS has acknowledged that sometimes things go wrong but we do not seem to acknowledge or own up to it.<br/><br/>I believe the Minister is going to reopen the audit, which has been closed for a year and a half.  In that year and half, some women have had serious results.  The best friend of my secretary, who works in Leinster House, is dying from cervical cancer.  She was under constant screening because she had a procedure in 2009.  The woman, her community and her friends have had to fundraise to have the audit carried out privately and it has cost thousands of euro.  It has shown that, in four previous years, the screening had serious, discordant results that were not picked up and then, all of a sudden, she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  What can the Minister do for women who are caught between the date the audit closed and when it is going to reopen.  When will it reopen?</p></speech>

Respite is a very important part of our disability plan and the disability programme for the past 12 months.</p><p>It is also part of our reform agenda.  We have just completed our 12th new respite house.  As a result of the &euro;10 million we got last year, we have 12 new houses up and running throughout the country.  We are planning for 33,000 day respite places and 166,000 overnight services after Christmas and in 2020.  Respite is a very important part of the agenda.  These services are now up and running and will be developed.  With regard to St. Gabriel's, I would be delighted to take up the Senator's offer.  We are looking at that particular case at the moment.  I would be delighted to visit St. Gabriel's and to talk to the staff and families.  That is a very important part of my job.  A very important part of developing services and of the reform agenda is making sure that the interests of the families and the people who work in the service are protected.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh has left.  With regard to the protocols for transition to get new teenagers going, a lot of preparation is done before 18 year olds move into adult services.  Approximately 1,600 people, having hit 18, come into adult services every year.  The good news is that we managed to secure an extra &euro;13 million to develop these services and to keep them safe.  Every 18 year old that comes out of youth services is now guaranteed a place at an adult day service.  That is essential.  There has to be preparation for that transition.  Most sensible services provide that a few months before people move on to a new service.  Many services provide key workers, link workers and meetings with families and parents.  If members have any concerns about a particular service, they should not hesitate to contact me because we have to ensure that transitions are as stable as possible for people, and particularly for adults with autism, as these transitions can be very difficult for them and for their families.  The 1,600 who come out every year generally do get a place and get on with it.  If there are gaps, members should not hesitate in letting me know.</p></speech>

The Senator is quite correct in saying that there has been knowledge about valproate for many years.  This knowledge was heightened, as it were, in February 2018 when the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions.  Following that, we instituted a communications and support programme to increase awareness among women of childbearing age.  Through working with OACS Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland, and a support team we established, we identified 40 families who may have been affected by valproate.  Through that we developed a diagnostic pathway in Crumlin hospital, again working with the agencies I mentioned and members of OACS Ireland, including a consultant geneticist and paediatrician.  Following on from that pathway, some of these patients and their families will require supports.  We are committed to providing those supports.  The Senator is, however, absolutely correct.  There has been knowledge about anticonvulsants in pregnancy for many years.  It is also true that the degree of the knowledge and the strength of the evidence has become more powerful over time.  Our response has, therefore, become more powerful over time.  From her own work, the Senator will know that people have been alerted to the use of anticonvulsants in pregnancy.  As part of this work, we are introducing nurse practitioners to work in the area of women in pregnancy who are on anticonvulsants, in recognition of the greater risk presented by these drugs, even beyond valproate.</p></speech>

As Deputy Kelly knows, when one is a Minister one is given advice and information and one then considers it and makes a decision.  Some were of the valid view that Dr. Scally had recommended that a payment of &euro;2,000 be made to people who engaged with this process because they went through considerable expense and inconvenience.  Those who participated in the RCOG process also incurred costs and expenses in seeing clinicians and so on.  I will be confirming that in writing.  I know Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith did not ask about that directly but I thought it was pertinent to what she said.</p></speech>

I just wanted to make that point because it would be disingenuous not to do so while I was here.  I do not have a lack of curiosity with regard to what happens in the labs, as the Deputy suggested.  In consultation with the patient advocates, we commissioned work on the laboratory breakdown for the 221+ group.  I shared that with the patient advocates and with this committee and I have taken questions on it in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I do not have his words in front of me, but he did say that he did not find anything to be substandard or that there were any safety concerns.  On top of that, we now have the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists answering the question as to whether the programme working effectively.  As I said to the Chair at the start of this meeting, I am conscious that this committee is hearing directly from RCOG next week and that it would be clumsy of me to endeavour to explain its work when it is more qualified to do so itself.</p> <p>  I will now address the question on audit.  Dr. Henry may wish to add to my response.  I know a number of groups are doing work on interval cancers, following Dr. Scally's recommendations.  Audit is a really good thing.  This debacle arose from an audit that was intended to disclose but never did, thereby causing people a lot of pain and hurt.  It is really important that we get audit right.  That is a key recommendation made by Dr. Scally.  Deputy Kelly has made a point vociferously several times and I believe Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is making a similar point.  They are asking about the people affected today.  There is no audit ongoing.  When the audits recommence, will these people be covered?  I cannot pre-empt the expert group review but my view is that these people absolutely have to be covered.  Dr. Henry may also have a view.  There cannot be a gap in my view but, obviously, I want to follow the expert group's recommendations.  Dr. Henry may have information to offer the committee in that regard.  This might be helpful but-----</p></speech>

The community has had to raise funds.  It is a poor working-class community but it has had to raise funds in order that she could have an audit done privately.  She wanted to know what went wrong.  She has now found out through a private audit.  It is curious.  I have a letter from the HSE.  This woman gave me a copy.  It says that the HSE will give her the slides as long as she tells it where her audit is being done because it has to be sure about that.</p></speech>

As we know from the laboratory report provided here, the number of false negatives is very small in the context of the overall workload of the laboratory.  It is therefore very difficult to draw conclusions.  There are other measures which are equally, if not more, important such as the number of false positives.  These can cause much distress and unnecessary interventions and, in some cases, invasive surgery.  Another measure is the number of high-grade findings.  Because of the huge numbers in each laboratory, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from the report.</p><p>One other point worth making is on the timeline of the cervical cancer screening programme which started in 2008.  One would have expected a higher degree of findings at the beginning of the programme because no screening programme had existed beforehand.  There are a number of confounders when one tries to examine the relative performance of false negatives in each laboratory, for example, the timing of the laboratory for the programme and the demographics, that is, the population that that laboratory will serve.  </p><p> On interval cancer, I acknowledge that Deputy Kelly showed an interest in this matter in previous hearings.  There cannot be any gap in this regard and we recognise the position of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on an interval cancer audit.  It is worth reminding people that the core purpose of interval cancer audit, in fact any audit, is learning and improvement.  Interval cancer audit tied to the duty of candour, as prevails in England and Wales, mean that the results of false negatives would be communicated to everyone.</p></speech>

Of course, that is the case.  As the Deputy knows, determining that in Ireland is an adversarial process which needs to be reformed.  That is why we have asked Mr. Justice Charles Meenan to do a body of work on tort reform.  He is due to deliver an interim report any day now and definitely by the end of this year.

Has Mr Reid set targets in respect of personnel, money and conversion?  In the event that a hospital manager is proactive in taking the initiative on this issue, on which there appears to be a lack of leadership, and manages to convert from agency to directly employed staff, will the money saved be put directly into staff or will that dependent on remaining within budget?</p></speech>

As has been acknowledged, this was due to an inability to staff the unit and recruit consultant paediatricians.  The Tallaght urgent care centre is planned for 2020.  Does the HSE have a staffing plan in place?  The number of consultants in the system appears to be insufficient, with a shortfall to the tune of 500.  The Minister will be aware that the consultants have expressed no confidence in him and that view is shared by many.  I do not intend that in a personal way but it is a matter of public record.  We have a recruitment and retention crisis among consultants.  We discussed the case of a pain consultant for Crumlin earlier.  The urgent care centre is only open on a nine-to-five basis at the moment, which is not what was promised, and the centre in Tallaght is due to open in 2020.  Will it open on time?  Can the Minister say with any degree of confidence what the opening hours will be, given that both he and the Taoiseach gave a commitment that the urgent care centre in Connolly would be open from 8 a.m. until midnight, seven days a week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#AAA01100"><p>The urgent care centre in Connolly Hospital Dublin is currently open from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m.   I would like those hours extended by an hour either side, that is, from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m.  Children's Health Ireland is working on that.</p> <p>  I have no confidence in some of the work practices of our consultants - absolutely none - when I see private practice and income being put ahead of the public health service.  I am sure the Deputy will stand with me when I table proposals shortly to pay consultants much more money.  In return, however, consultants will be expected to work in the public health service.  It will also be expected that public beds will used for public practice and public patients, as in the case that was so well articulated by the Deputy earlier.  It may make the Deputy politically uncomfortable but on this issue, I believe the gap or difference between us is smaller than on many other issues.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has not yet made its position clear on this issue, whereas the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael have.  We believe consultants should be paid much more but if they want to do private practice, they should do it in private hospitals, not in our public hospitals.  We will have to pay them much more to do that.  </p> <p>  There is no free money here.  Nurses and midwives did not get any free money.  When they were offered an enhanced contract, better pay and conditions and improved career prospects, they agreed to a number of changes to work practices, as did our GPs.  So too will our pharmacists and dentists, and likewise our consultants.  No one is protected beyond reproach or scrutiny.  I am certainly not but nobody else is either.</p> <p>  We will have a plan on Tallaght.  I am sure Ms &Eacute;ilish Hardiman, the chief executive officer of Children's Health Ireland, who is responsible for this facility, can brief the committee on this matter.  The Tallaght urgent care centre is due to open towards the end of next year.  We will have tabled significant proposals long in advance of that offering consultants much more money to work in the public health service and I emphasis the public aspect of the health service.  I need to make this point, because one will not hear it anywhere else.  Throughout the 2000s - the years of economic boom - there were approximately 7,000 doctors working in the Irish public health service.  There are now more than 10,000 doctors in the health service.  While we have vacancies and there is more to do, there are approximately 3,000 more doctors working in our public hospitals than there were in 2007, 2008 and 2009.</p></speech>

I am with him 100% on that but the problem of resources is staring us in the face.</p><p>If I see changes in resources, particularly the area I pointed out, I will go with the Minister immediately.  If I do not see changes in resources, I will not because the Minister ultimately has that choice to make.  I have pointed this out numerous times.  I am staying with him but only for a short time because if he does not deal with the resources gap, that is his issue.  That is just reality.</p><p> Will he respond regarding John Wall and the medical card?  Deputy O'Reilly, myself and others have raised this.  It is a genuine case and a genuine issue for terminally ill patients.  We should react positively.  </p><p> I previously raised an issue with the Minister and Mr. Reid of a woman for whom it cost more than &euro;100,000 to get her gallbladder out.  That happened over 11 weeks and involved two hospitals.  I never received a response.  How can a gallbladder operation cost more than &euro;100,000 and how can someone spend 11 weeks in hospital?  It is insane and multiple hospitals are involved as well as the public-private issue.  It was meant to be investigated but I never received an answer.  </p><p> On 5 December at 2.25 p.m. a letter issued from the HSE stating that all the people in the RCOG review were not getting the &euro;2,000.  I welcome what the Minister and the Taoiseach have done today but the fact is that the people around the Minister here, representing the HSE, wrote to the 221+ group and told them they would not get it.  There is no joined-up thinking.  The Minister might reflect on that.  Why did that happen?   </p><p> I refer to the Bernadette Kiely case, and I mention her name only because it is public, in the context of non-disclosure and the issues surrounding that.  Representatives from RCOG will be before the committee next week but has the Minister initial concerns he would like to share with us?  How does he feel when Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap, Vicky Phelan - people whom he knows well, as do I - say they have no confidence in the RCOG review?  If these people do not have confidence based on what we publicly know, that is scary.  Why in that review was there a default that anyone whose slides could not be found were sent concordant letters?  Surely they should have been concordant and discordant, and a small number should have said there was something missing and a decision could not be made.  That would have been logical.  I refer to those who have serious concerns about the credibility of the review.  I was not filled with encouragement last week when the college was unable to answer some basic questions.  A small number of these women would like an independent assessment of their files.  I am sure that will happen anyway, but unlike the now-resolved matter of the &euro;2,000, can we please just deal with this now and give a positive answer to the question?  I do not think there is a large number of women in this category who would voluntarily want to go down this route but there is a significant number.  For the cost involved, the Minister should just do so.  I ask that he consider that.          </p></speech>

The Deputy and I both know Mr. John Wall well.  He is a great individual and a great advocate.  I met him most recently three weeks ago and he was also in touch with me yesterday.  We set up a new clinical advisory group to look at what is going to be an expansion of the access to medical cards for people with a terminal illness.  That is in the budget book.  The CEO of the HSE and I agreed that in advance of budget day.  From memory - and John Wall asked me this yesterday - they hoped it would have its first meeting on 18 December and I understand that is still the intention.  Mr. Wall will be invited to make a presentation.  There is an eight-week clock on it so it should be finished by February.  I will keep John Wall and the Deputy informed on that.  I had a good meeting with Mr. Wall on it.</p></speech>

I know the Deputy made a pre-budget submission which was generous and set a large sum aside for it.  It will not be that large but I am happy to let the consultant applications advisory committee, CAAC, do its work first.</p> <p>  I will not comment on individual cases, although I do not think that the Deputy is asking me to, including that of Ms Kiely other than to say that I have given a commitment to meet her and I will.  I will ask Dr. Henry to comment on the broader issue of disclosure, which is important. </p> <p>  Finally, on the broader RCOG issues, I know Stephen, Lorraine and Vicky very, very well.  I hold them all in huge regard.  Stephen has written me a letter on two issues.</p><p>I addressed one this morning and we are considering the other.  I will respond to him directly on it.  I would feel happier for RCOG to answer those questions in a public forum here next week.  </p></speech>

The Minister's commentary around the review is that it goes to confidence in screening, etc.  I am not even going there; that is not my issue.  I want to have as much confidence in this as possible, just like everyone else.  However, that is not what this is about; this is about the individual women.  The three people who brought this up say that they do not have confidence in the process.  Let us consider what happened to Lorraine Walsh and Vicky Phelan.  Out of 1,051 women, three files were mislabelled and two were those of Vicky Phelan and Lorraine Walsh.  A person would win the Euromillions quicker than this.  It is incredible that Lorraine Walsh received two reports 24 hours apart saying opposite things and we now know other women received concordant results, despite some of their data slides being unavailable.</p></speech>

I asked if it was satisfied about its independence and it said it has never been surer of anything.  Its expertise is beyond reproach.  It is true that there were errors around wrong letters and so on that it has apologised for.  I do not feel as though I have the competency to go beyond that on the methodology the RCOG used.  Dr. Henry has significant competencies.</p></speech>

On the issues he raised, we know more from Dr. Scally's report and the RCOG report about the original audit where all this began.  Dr. Scally described it as well intended and flawed in design and implementation.  The focus of the audit by CervicalCheck, like all similar international exercises, was on cytology but it looked at other elements of the screening pathway.  The problem was, as we now know, that as Dr. Scally noted, it was "impossible to reach a firm conclusion on the methods employed" in the audit based on his inquiries and "a complete presentation of the audit outcome data was impossible to locate".  For that reason, we welcome a more robust, standardised independent review which, we hope, will give greater assurance than one which was well intended but flawed in its design and implementation and which looked primarily at cytology but also other elements of the screening pathway.</p></speech>

I raised the question of drugs treatment.  I am not satisfied.  There is a greater emphasis now on acceptance and that it is inevitable that people are addicts and that nothing can be done about it.  That is a mistake.  I ask questions on the number of drug treatment programmes that are offered to addicts or users of drugs and the results among those who were successfully encouraged off drugs, those who were not, and those who were not offered a programme at all.</p> <p>  I also mentioned child mental health services and the lack of maternity cover for speech and language therapists.</p><p>The result is a gap in treatment for the child concerned, which is hugely negative.  What is being done about that?  It is not something that is going to cost &euro;10 million or even &euro;1 million.

The lack of such cover is leaving a very sizeable gap, especially for children who have difficulty communicating or who cannot communicate at all.  There is a serious flaw in the system which must be addressed immediately.</p></speech>

We try to cover gaps in service but it is not always possible.  The provision of maternity cover is a challenge for us.  We can often have a lot of staff on maternity leave at the same time.  The approach, particularly in CAMHs, is multidisciplinary and we try to move resources around to cover.  We do what we can with the resources we have but it is not always possible to cover all maternity leave.</p></speech>

What would it cost to provide cover in order to address the issue?  It is not impossible and does not require rocket science.  It can be done and it could have a significant impact on the quality of treatment for children and on their families' quality of life.</p></speech>

I am aware that data has been available on the impact of valproate on foetal development.  In terms of where we are now with the existing cohort, it is my understanding that when female patients who have epilepsy talk to their GPs about having a family, they are moved from valproate to levetiracetam or something more suitable to a hospital environment.  They get an infusion and come off valproate before starting a family.  Is that something that is <i>ad hoc</i>, where the individual GP takes responsibility or is there a programme in place to guide women through this before they become pregnant so they can manage their medication?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.688" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#DDD01500"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right that the best time to make a decision is in advance, before any harm can ensue.  In putting together this particular programme, we had to bear in mind that we did not want to alarm people who might, for example, have unstable epilepsy.  We did not want them to stop taking their medications abruptly which could cause greater harm.  The whole thrust of the programme was to ensure that they got the best and most expert advice, balancing the risks of changing or coming off medication against staying on medication which might harm a developing foetus.  The bigger question to the Deputy refers is access to specialist care and advice.  I presume she is not just interested in valproate but in other anticonvulsant drugs.  Working with the epilepsy programme, led by Dr. Colin Doherty, we are developing a specific programme.  We have now appointed two out of a planned six specialist nurses for pregnant women who are on anticonvulsant medication so that we can target them early with primary care and afford them the best advice.  We want to ensure that their epilepsy remains stable because abrupt withdrawal can be quite harmful.  We also want to make sure that they are on the safest possible medication at the safest dose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121100002#DDD01600"><p>I would see a role for community pharmacists here because they are the people who generally sell the folic acid and pregnancy tests and who also dispense medication to patients with long-term illnesses.  They are very much aware of patients' history and in well-established community pharmacies, they would have seen girls growing up and going through different phases of treatment.</p><p>While I am in favour of specialist nurses, I am of the view that there is a role for community pharmacists here in terms of explaining the science.  What is commonly lost in the chat about valproate is the issue of balance, as just described by Dr. Henry.  The risk to the woman and to the pregnancy of abruptly stopping medication must be weighed up.  If a woman with an unplanned pregnancy who is on valproate turns up at a doctor's surgery, she should be told that just stopping is not the solution.  That point is often lost in the argument.</p><p> On the RCOG report, Deputy Kelly stated that he is not filled with encouragement.  I am of the opposite view, particularly having met representatives from RCOG.  I felt that they were full of integrity and that their independence was guaranteed.  Perhaps their answers are not the answers that some of us wanted to hear but the answers we got in the private briefing last week gave me some solace.  I now feel that the future might be better.  There have been constant calls for a reopening of the audit process.  To my mind, this all went wrong with the audit.  Somebody decided to conduct an audit without considering how to deal with the results and with the fact that real people were involved, either deceased women's families or women who had adverse outcomes.  Consideration was not given to the results, the impact of same or the issue of open disclosure, and all of that fed into this crisis for people.  It is important that there is some balance here.  While I was not necessarily filled with encouragement, I felt confident that the RCOG representatives were independent and were not in the pocket of anyone, as has been suggested.</p></speech>

One of the valuable resources for us, in working through the valproate project, was working with community pharmacists who are in a unique position in terms of access to women who are at risk for valproate exposure in pregnancy because such women are known to them.  I definitely see a role for them in this programme, which is headed by Dr. Colin Doherty.  I will talk to him about how we can use community pharmacists to best effect.</p></speech>

I asked about troubleshooting when there is obvious overcrowding at accident and emergency departments.  Overcrowding is reported to a central location and it should be possible to identify precisely the cause of same.  It is no good just saying that it is a sign of the times.  If it is a sign of the times and we are not able to meet the requirements that exist, we must address that.  We need to know the cause of the overcrowding.  Is it because there are not enough doctors, both GPs and hospital doctors?  We need to know the cause of the problem.  We spend most of our time moaning about it.  I spend an inordinate amount of time asking questions about it, as do most Members of the Houses.  We must troubleshoot and find out what is causing the backlog in certain places.  What is the cause of the snarl up?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.713" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019121100002#B00400"><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and I are pleased to have the opportunity to discuss our 2019 Supplementary Estimates with the select committee this afternoon.  The Minister of State will say a few words later about his area of responsibility.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate being presented is technical in its nature as it does not seek any additional allocation from the Exchequer.  The Estimate is seeking to redistribute some &euro;15.289 million in savings to support particular priorities regarding several of the Department&rsquo;s enterprise, innovation and regulation programmes.</p> <p>  The Estimate seeks to provide an additional &euro;500,000 in capital funding to InterTradeIreland to support its Brexit activities, in particular its programme of voucher supports.  Demand for InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s Brexit planning vouchers and its Brexit implementation vouchers supports has remained high throughout 2019.  It spiked in advance of the two Brexit deadlines in March and in October.  Almost 1,800 of these vouchers have been approved by InterTradeIreland.  The additional &euro;500,000 being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, which builds upon additional funding provided in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, will be targeted at meeting the increasing demands for InterTradeIerland&rsquo;s services for the remainder of 2019.</p> <p>  The INTERREG programme is one of 60 cross-border funding programmes throughout the EU.  The current round of INTERREG, which runs from 2016 to 2022, is jointly funded by the Department and our Northern Ireland counterparts, the Department for the Economy, on a 30:70 basis.  The Department&rsquo;s overall commitment under this round of the programme is &euro;21 million.  The additional &euro;1.2 million being provided to the INTERREG programme in the Supplementary Estimate will increase the overall provision to the programme to &euro;4.2 million in 2019.  For several reasons, the drawdown in the initial years of this round of the programme was much less than anticipated.  The &euro;1.2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate is required to ensure that the Department meets its overall funding commitment within the lifetime of this round of the programme.</p> <p>  The future growth loan scheme, which was launched in April of this year, provides long-term financing support to Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment.  The scheme operates alongside the Brexit loan scheme, which provides shorter term working capital to businesses that have been impacted by Brexit.  In the period since the launch of the scheme in April 2019, some 2,000 applications have been approved by the scheme&rsquo;s administrators, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  The uptake in the scheme has increased significantly in recent months and the additional &euro;2 million being provided through the Supplementary Estimate will ensure that the SBCI can continue, in conjunction with the participating lenders, to meet this increased level of demand.</p> <p>  The humanitarian relief scheme is intended to provide humanitarian support for small businesses, community, voluntary and sporting bodies that experience flood damage to their premises as a consequence of a severe weather event and have been refused flood insurance.  The &euro;59,000 being sought through the Supplementary Estimate arises from claims relating to flood damage suffered in County Donegal in the aftermath of Storm Lorenzo in October 2019.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will set out the details of the various innovation programmes receiving additional funding through the Supplementary Estimate in his statement later.  Of the total of &euro;11.279 million in additional innovation supports being provided through the Supplementary Estimate, &euro;2.55 million will be provided to the science and technology development programme, &euro;1.999 million to the programme for research in third level institutions and &euro;6.73 million to subscriptions to international organisations.</p> <p>  The remaining element of the Estimate involves the provision of an additional &euro;251,000 to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  While the board is essentially self-funded, the Department provides funding to the board in respect of pension payments.  The additional &euro;251,000 being provided to subhead C9 through the Supplementary Estimate reflects the costs of unexpected retirements by members of staff of the board in 2019.</p><p> The savings funding our 2019 Supplementary Estimate have been generated in the following programmes: administration pay savings of &euro;448,000; agency legacy pensions savings of &euro;500,000; IDA Ireland savings of &euro;2.1 million; Enterprise Ireland savings of &euro;8 million; workplace relations programme savings of &euro;1.115 million; Health and Safety Authority savings of &euro;375,000; Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement savings of &euro;1.4 million; Competition and Consumer Protection Commission savings of &euro;500,000; and Companies Registration Office savings of &euro;850,000.  The briefing provided by my officials to the committee's secretariat sets out the details of the circumstances giving rise to the savings in each of the aforementioned subheads.  I am happy to discuss these further with the members of the committee.  The committee will see, however, that more than 60% of the savings have been generated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which account for &euro;8 million and &euro;2.1 million, respectively, of the savings.</p><p> Regarding the IDA, the savings of &euro;2.1 million essentially arise in respect of its property programme.  Large-scale capital investment in land and property such as that engaged in by the IDA is a complex and lengthy process.  The inherently complex nature of property and land development transactions, which involve acquisition, engagement with stakeholders, including local authorities, complicated commercial arrangements and building contracts, can, and often does, involve delays.  Nevertheless, regional development remains a top priority for the IDA.  In this regard construction of advance buildings in Dundalk and Galway is almost completed.  The construction of buildings in Carlow and Athlone will begin in 2020.</p><p> Regarding savings in Enterprise Ireland, the committee will be aware that in addition to the funding it receives from the Exchequer, Enterprise Ireland generates income from equity investments that it makes in the companies it supports.  Enterprise Ireland is permitted, subject to the approval and sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to retain and use own-resource income, ORI, in support of enterprise development.  Enterprise Ireland has succeeded in generating a significant surfeit of ORI in excess of the amount sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the course of 2019.  Under public expenditure rules, Enterprise Ireland is required to expend ORI before drawing down Exchequer funds.  Accordingly, the additional ORI generated by EI essentially means it will not need to call on its full 2019 Exchequer capital allocation of &euro;65.75 million under subhead A7 of the Department's Vote, thus generating a saving on this subhead.</p><p> I hope I have given the committee an overview of the various expenditure and savings elements of the technical Supplementary Estimate I have presented to members.  With the Chairman's permission I now ask the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to give some further details of the additional funding being provided to the Department's innovation programmes through the Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.715" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019121100002#C00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce very briefly the elements of the Supplementary Estimate relating to research and innovation.  Under the Department's proposed allocation, just over &euro;11 million would be apportioned to meet commitments in respect of various research and development programmes of national importance.  This will help us to accelerate delivery against our targets and goals as set out in Innovation 2020.</p> <p>  The &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate funding for the European Space Agency, ESA, will be invested across six technology development programmes to drive Ireland forward as a competitive player in the space sector.  This investment is directly aligned with the new national space strategy for enterprise, which I published earlier this year and which aims to increase public and private investment in the ESA by 50% by 2025 and develop a strong and economically sustainable space-active industry in Ireland.  As I have noted previously in committee and in the D&aacute;il, our investment through the ESA delivers a sevenfold return in terms of its ultimate impact.  It is critical that we increase our ambition in this area.</p> <p>  The specific programmes in which we will invest include telecommunications and integrated applications, exploration, transportation and earth observation.  An additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory as a contribution to our existing membership liabilities, including the joining fees, which are to be paid over a number of years, and Ireland's contribution to the extremely large telescope, ELT.  Membership of the ESO affords Irish astronomers and researchers the opportunity to be part of an international scientific community conducting groundbreaking research in the most advanced facilities.  ESO membership will grow Ireland's skill base in high-tech areas, delivering on the ambitions of Future Jobs Ireland.</p> <p>  The proposed allocation of &euro;1.5 million for Tyndall National Institute in Cork will contribute towards upgrading works to accommodate more researchers in the field of cutting-edge ICT.  This funding will enhance Tyndall's ability to support innovation and deliver significant economic benefit in the form of highly skilled jobs, new start-up activity and investment.</p> <p>  An additional &euro;1 million is proposed for Science Foundation Ireland for a number of existing commitments that fall due in 2019.  Taken together with increases in its capital funding in 2020, SFI will be able to fund additional research activity through both its research centres and its funding for individual awards.</p> <p>  The &euro;2 million for cycle 5 of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, will address existing financial commitments under that programme.  The PRTLI has supported investment in top-class infrastructure and human capital development across Ireland's higher education institutions.  It has been an important programme for creating the foundation on which further investments by SFI and our other funding agencies now build.</p> <p>  The evolution of research, development and innovation and its associated investment have been a cornerstone of Ireland's enterprise policy for many years.  In order to become an innovation leader, it is essential Ireland keeps apace with and anticipates developments in the field.  This ambition must be matched by investment in innovation, research and development and reflected in the above funding decisions.  This supplementary allocation of just over &euro;11 million will provide welcome additional funding into our system, support the quality and impact of our scientific capacity, contribute to our job creation and enterprise growth and help us to deliver on our Innovation 2020 targets and commitments as we look to the future.  Again, I welcome the opportunity to give a very brief introduction as to where this &euro;11 million is being invested.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.716" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JES2019121100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State.  I will start with the Minister of State.  He spoke about the &euro;5 million Supplementary Estimate for the European Space Agency and said an additional &euro;1.7 million will be paid to the European Southern Observatory.  As he is aware, research and innovation are vital for the Irish economy, and membership of international research organisations is an important part of increasing our own research output.  Ireland is currently one of only three European countries that does not have any formal agreement with CERN, which I know the Minister of State is very supportive of.  Innovation 2020's vision is for Ireland to be a global innovation leader driving a strong, sustainable economy and a better society.  If Ireland is to deliver on this vision, membership of organisations such as CERN, which are at the forefront of innovation, is critical.  The committee recently did a body of work on CERN and we launched our document in the past month.  I wish to put the following to the Minister of State strongly on behalf of all the joint committee members.  Some of them are not here, and I am probably straying slightly outside the committee's remit, but at the same time it is a great opportunity to put this to the Minister of State.  While concerns have been raised that Ireland may not be in a position to take advantage of all the potential benefits of membership of CERN, the committee believes that joining CERN, even as an associate member, which would initially cost &euro;1.3 million, would create an environment that would encourage Irish researchers and businesses to take maximum advantage of these opportunities.  The committee has made a number of observations and recommends that negotiations start with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  I hope we will get the opportunity to discuss the Estimates for 2020 next year but I just wanted to put out a marker on behalf of every member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation that we fully support the Department starting negotiations with CERN with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member.  Could I hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this?</p><p>Of course the Chairman can.  I acknowledge that CERN is one of the largest international research organisations in the world.  It is a leading research collaboration investigating the fundamental composition of matter.  The Government gave a specific commitment in Innovation 2020 that we would initiate discussions with several international research organisations.  Discussions with CERN started in 2016.  As a matter of fact, an Irish delegation visited CERN in 2016 and we met the director general.  The Department has been proactive in advancing Ireland's membership of CERN.  Representatives of CERN met me and departmental officials some months ago.  We continue to keep the position on CERN membership and its cost under review and we continue to contact officials in CERN.</p><p> I thank the committee for its support because I am a great supporter of joining CERN.  I hope to visit CERN in January to continue further discussions.  I should tell the committee that based on the indications received from CERN the cost of Ireland's full membership, and I believe we should have full membership, at current prices would be approximately &euro;13.6 million annually, which is substantial money.  To become a full member, a country must go through associate membership prior to membership.</p><p> We are continuing negotiations with CERN.  It is my view and that of the Department that we should join CERN.  We will continue negotiations with CERN over the coming months.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance about CERN.  I hope to have further meetings with the Minister for Finance in the coming months before I go to CERN.  I support the committee.  CERN is a premier international research organisation.  Believe it or not, it is conducting research in 2,000 areas.  I know a good deal about CERN and we should join it.  I fully support the committee.  Unfortunately, I have not given the Chairman a direct answer.  The Minister will have to give that answer.  If the Chairman were to ask whether the Government supports joining CERN, it does and it is in our programme.</p></speech>

The committee recommended that negotiations with CERN start immediately with a view to Ireland becoming an associate member as soon as possible.  The committee then recommended that after three years of associate membership the Department would conduct a cost-benefit analysis and assess whether there is a case to be made for moving towards full membership.  The committee also recommended that efforts should be made to fund the annual fee for associate membership, which we were told is &euro;1.3 million, within the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation Vote.  We felt we were trying to lead the Department towards it.  I know many in the Department are supportive.  We felt we should look at associate membership first and then, after three years, do a cost-benefit analysis to see what benefits we could get from full membership of CERN, and try to find initial funding from within the budget.  We felt we took appropriate steps in this respect.  The Minister might give us her thoughts on this, if she would not mind.</p></speech>

We are examining carefully joining CERN and this is because CERN activity involves data analysis, which is key to our enterprise sector.  We keep it under review.  As the Chairman said, associate membership is &euro;1.25 million and full membership is &euro;13.6 million.  The committee can appreciate that there are always competing pressures in the budget.  It is certainly something we are anxious to progress.</p></speech>

In the same way as with the European Space Agency, what we put in we get back.  Associate membership would probably cost approximately &euro;1.3 million but this would only allow us the same percentage return.  This is my belief and I may be wrong on this.  Importantly, the return from our &euro;18.3 million annual investment in the European Space Agency has been continuously improving, as demonstrated by the value of the contracts in Ireland, which has increased from &euro;13.9 million in 2017 to more than &euro;21 million.  There is no doubt in my mind that whatever investment we make in CERN we would get back.  I have met most of the heads of the universities and institutes of technology in Ireland, who all advocate that we join CERN.  It is a priority for the Department and the Government.</p></speech>

Not to put the Minister of State on the spot but could we get a commitment today that the Department will look initially at associate membership, which is a smaller cost at &euro;1.25 million?  I know this can be doubled or trebled with the same input.  The members of the joint committee were unanimous on this.  At the launch four weeks ago, 21 academics from every institute of technology and university in Ireland were present and they were excited for the first time.  They have been banging this drum for a long time.  Over the past ten years finances have been stretched and it has been very difficult but I believe the time is right to take a step towards associate membership.</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  We continuously actively engage with CERN.  We have met CERN.  We have been there and we have met representatives of CERN in Ireland.  I hope to go to CERN in January.</p></speech>

My first question is on subhead A14 and the future growth loan scheme.  The Government is due to carry out a review of the Brexit loan scheme.  As the future growth loan scheme operates alongside this, are there plans to review the future growth loan scheme?  According to figures I obtained in reply to a parliamentary question in mid-November only 25% of the &euro;300 million capital investment Brexit loan scheme for farmers and fishermen had been drawn down, with only 400 loans sanctioned.  What has the review of the Brexit loan scheme thrown up?  Has there been an increase in sanction and drawdown?  Does the Minister feel it is fit for purpose?  Is it easy and accessible enough for those who have need of it?</p> <p>  With regard to subhead B5, the programme for research in third level institutions, it is very welcome that we are putting additional resources into third level research, which is a critical part of what our third level institutions do.  Is this the final allocation in cycle 5 of the programme for research in third level institutions?  If not, how much remains to be delivered?  Are there plans for a new cycle?  The outline in brief lists the institutions benefiting from this additional resource.  Many third level institutions are not benefiting from it.  What process is there for institutions to avail of this funding?</p></speech>

We will review the scheme and are happy to hear any suggestions.  We have drawn down &euro;46 million of the &euro;300 million for the Brexit loan scheme, which is the overdraft working capital facility, and it has been sanctioned at bank level.  Some 798 applications were approved by the SBCI and 210 loans were progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;46.2 million.  Of the approved applications to date, 159 were reapplications, given that eligibility expires after six months.</p></speech>

There is a difference.</p></speech>

It is up to the customers thereafter and it is there for them to take.  The nature of an overdraft is that it is used only as it is needed, because it still has to be repaid and the interest on it still has to be paid if it is drawn down.</p> <p>  The future growth loan scheme makes &euro;300 million of loans available in terms of eight to ten years at a competitive interest rate.  No security is required for loans up to &euro;500,000.  There has been a strong uptake of the scheme since its launch, and to date there have been 2,374 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 2,215 have been approved by the SBCI.  Some 615 loans have been sanctioned at bank level, to a total value of &euro;116.9 million.  It is a popular loan, given that the terms extend to eight to ten years.  When we put the scheme together, we identified there was no long-term lending in the marketplace.  My Department has started to review the future growth loan scheme, in light of the success in take-up to date, and it is regarded by enterprises as addressing a need for them at firm level or for longer-term investment finance.</p></speech>

Anyone who works an overdraft will know the difference between being availing of it and not.</p></speech>

Has her Department ever considered introducing multi-annual budgets for the IDA as opposed to an annual budget?  It would alleviate the need to divert money from its budget at the end of year where it is not spent, and would give the IDA better certainty in planning for future development.  It would know exactly what level of funding it had over a multi-annual period.  There are many regions, and any of us could identify projects in our constituencies that could be delivered.  The IDA will always state it has a defined budget and must adhere to it.  At the end of the year, however, some of the agency's money will be reallocated to other projects, which a multi-annual budget might prevent happening in the future.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, the money for this year has not been spent and it will receive the money when it needs it.  The Department has made a commitment that when the IDA needs the money to fund a building programme, it will receive it.  Public accounts are controlled on a cash basis and to change that would be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the way that public funding operates.  My Department's budget is subject to the annual Estimates process, although the national development plan sets out our capital allocations until 2022, which gives some certainty.  Even though the IDA cannot spend the money this year, it will certainly receive it when it needs it.</p></speech>

We all meet representatives of the agency in our constituencies and they often give the same reason for their inability to make important investments.  I refer, for example, to Mullingar, where an IDA park lies almost empty.  If the &euro;2.1 million was invested there for an advanced manufacturing factory or a hub ready for future investment, it would be most welcome.  The issue needs to be examined.  In fairness to the Minister, she stated it is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it is up to her to push that Department to try to change the direction.  It would be beneficial for the IDA in future.</p> <p>  Health and safety in the workplace is critical.  Will the Minister confirm that the savings at the Health and Safety Authority will have no impact on the work it does and that it will not compromise the health and safety of any employees?</p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has undergone many hours of discussion by the committee in respect of critical legislation and of the essential information the committee needs to advance that legislation.  The office has to do a great deal of work.</p><p>Anybody looking at the Football Association of Ireland at present would wonder how, in the name of God, &euro;1 million can be diverted from an office that has so much important work to do.  The reason is the lack of progress in key legislation.  I know the Minister is not holding it up but we should use this opportunity to highlight the need for the information required by this committee to advance the legislation.</p><p> There are savings of &euro;8 million with Enterprise Ireland.  Will the Minister outline to us a little further where Enterprise Ireland generates its own resources?  Why is there a slowing down in drawing down supports that Enterprise Ireland makes available at a time when so many of our businesses are facing the Brexit challenge?  One would expect an increase in the demand needed for Enterprise Ireland supports.</p><p> There are savings of &euro;500,000 with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  This is the agency to which the Minister has referred matters relating to the insurance industry and requested an in-depth audit into practices.  That agency's representatives have come before this Oireachtas committee in the past quarter and have indicated the commission does not have sufficient powers and particularly sanctioning powers.  When will we consider giving this body the powers it requires, particularly at a time it is conducting invaluable work in the consumer interest?  How can we justify taking &euro;500,000 from its resources at this time?</p></speech>

It is a result of slower than expected drawing down on a number of Enterprise Ireland programmes.  Enterprise Ireland also invests equity in companies and when they become profitable, the money comes back to Enterprise Ireland.  The body received an increase in its budget last year and it was not able to spend all the income.  It had to use its own resource income first and there was therefore a surplus.  I was able to move it to other pressing needs.</p> <p>  The savings in the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, arise as a result of delays in filling new staff posts.  There is a very competitive recruitment market.  Nevertheless, the increases in funding provided to the HSA have enabled it to recruit 13 additional staff, with a number of other positions currently being filled.  The money is there but unfortunately the authority has not been able to get all the staff it wants.  The resources are available and as soon as staff are recruited, the money will be made available.  The authority is having problems because we are at full employment and it is finding it difficult to get people.</p></speech>

It was looking for 15 staff and it has recruited people for 13 posts.  There are two posts to be filled.  There may be a timing issue as well and some people may be coming on board, leading to this underspend.</p> <p>  There was a saving of &euro;1.4 million in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and I gave extra money to it last year specifically in anticipation that the legislation mentioned by the Deputy would be passed and it would be able to employ extra experts or specialists to deal with this forensic accounting.  The work done by the office is quite complex and its staff do it very well.  There have been delays in enacting the legislation to establish the new agency and the committee is very familiar with those.  When the pre-legislative scrutiny is finished, I will be ready to go.  We must get the committee's report before we can go any further.  I cannot do anything about this until the report comes from this committee.  We are ready and stand waiting to deal with that.  Another factor in this particular saving was that the provision included in the original Estimate with respect to legal costs was not fully required.  Sometimes legal costs do not materialise in a particular year.</p> <p>  There are savings of &euro;500,000 with the CCPC, which essentially arise as a result of expenditure on pay being less than estimated, which is mainly due to the significant staff churn in the CCPC.  All these agencies are the same as businesses across the country, in that they are competing for talent.  I have offered more resources to the commission to help it carry out the study of public liability insurance mentioned by the Deputy so it is a matter for it to try to recruit the people it needs.  We are here to support the commission in that in any way we can.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the powers of the CCPC.  It currently has a wide range of investigative powers provided for in the Consumer Protection Acts 2007 to 2014, the Competition Acts 2002 to 2017 and relevant statutory provisions made under those Acts.  It may also investigate suspected breaches of Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The powers of the CCPC were increased significantly by both the Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  For example, there are powers to consider commitments by undertakings to be rules of court and extended elements of the Criminal Justice Act are to apply to serious competition law offences.  Very high penalties already apply to criminal offences under the Competition Acts.  For example, there are fines of up &euro;5 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is the higher, for an undertaking, and up to ten years in prison for a person, or both.</p> <p>  The Empowering National Competition Authorities, ECN+, directive is due to be transposed by 4 February 2021, and it will give the CCPC additional enforcement powers, including the introduction of non-criminal fines for breaches of European Union competition law.  It is my intention to transpose the ECN+ directive by means of primary legislation and I am considering further provisions for inclusion, subject to advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  Any additional measures will be reviewed with due regard to the recent recommendations of the Law Reform Commission report on regulatory powers and corporate offences.</p></speech>

The CCPC has advised that the study is a priority and that it will be concluded as soon as practicable.  The CCPC is an independent body, but I have made it aware that my Department is available to support it to complete the study as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I have visited Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, Hong Kong and Singapore and a new office has been opened in Vietnam, which is an area of opportunity.  IDA Ireland is diversifying its resources in that area.  It has excellent staff on the ground, who work closely with the embassies and Enterprise Ireland staff.  It is a team Ireland effort in that region, where there are many opportunities.  We are seeing the benefit of the increased focus on this market as the Chinese market is now opening up for Irish beef exports.  That is important.  Many of our pig producers export into this market as well.  We are progressing the work to deepen our links in the Chinese market.  While in Singapore, I met representatives of a particular company that exports 20,000 ducks per week to that market.  There are many opportunities there, particularly in the food space but also in ICT.  When I was in Japan I visited the fintech sector.  I understand that the Japanese banking system was closed for a long time and that it had not embraced the opportunity of new technologies.  During my visit, we were able to introduce them to many wonderful Irish companies that are bringing solutions in the fintech space.  We have a new Ireland House in Tokyo, which will comprise staff from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the embassies and an attach&eacute; from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There will also be a departmental official in Beijing.  There is a great deal of focus on this area, where there are many opportunities.</p></speech>

Having worked in Australia I know that the Asia-Pacific region poses a huge opportunity for this country in terms of exports and foreign direct investment, which will foster more jobs and solidify our economy.  We need to be focusing on where we want to be in the next ten to 15 years.  I believe the Asia-Pacific region presents huge opportunities for Ireland.

The Asia-Pacific strategy is led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which does an excellent job.  I have also visited China and Japan, where the influence of Ireland is notable.  There are also 420 collaborations through Science Foundation Ireland in many countries across the world, including Asia, South America and so on.  The Irish footprint is developing strategically well in these areas.  As I said, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland operate from the embassies as this gives them a foothold and closer association with the Irish communities in the those countries.</p></speech>

While the budget for this scheme was the smallest, from a humanitarian point of view it is probably the scheme that had the most effect.  I note the scheme provides humanitarian support for small businesses and community, voluntary and sporting bodies which experience flood damage and have been refused flood insurance.  Am I correct that this is a new area for the Department?  It is important that businesses or community and voluntary bodies whose properties have been damaged following a flood can access insurance cover and so this scheme is very welcome.</p></speech>

We work with the Red Cross in regard to provision of assistance.  It is a dedicated funding line and we stand ready to provide emergency support when needed.  The maximum contribution under the scheme is &euro;20,000, to restore a business premises or community, voluntary and sporting body property to its pre-flood condition.  Thankfully, to date there has not been much call on the scheme this year.  However, we stand ready to do so.  A number of businesses in Donegal required assistance following the last storm and we were happy to be able to assist them.  We do this work in conjunction with the  Red Cross, which has been excellent in rolling out the scheme.</p></speech>

I am the CEO of CLM.  We have two community law centres in Coolock and Limerick and currently assist more than 3,000 people every year through our range of services, which include legal advice and representation, information and education, and mediation and conflict coaching.  It is fitting that CLM has been invited to present our views on the issue of access to justice given our origins.  CLM, originally known as Coolock Community Law Centre, was established in 1975 as the first independent community law centre in Ireland.  It originally served as a prototype of the neighbourhood or community law centre model which could underpin a nationwide civil legal aid scheme, which did not then exist.</p> <p>  The community law centre model, under which we operate, has a number of important characteristics.  Our services are free and embedded in the community, making them as accessible as possible.  Many of our information talks and legal advice clinics are delivered on an outreach basis in locations where the community is congregating such as parish halls, public libraries and community organisations.  Local organisations and interest groups are represented on our board and advisory committees to ensure our services are responsive to, and shaped by, the needs of the community.  Second, community education is a critical part of our work.  Access to justice begins long before anyone steps inside the courtroom.  It begins with creating an awareness of rights and the law, and how the law can be used to enforce those rights.  In CLM, we often encounter a lack of awareness of how the law can assist in situations of homelessness or accessing social welfare, issues that are critical to social inclusion as they most affect a person's ability to participate fully in society.  Third, the community is empowered to use the law through our legal advice and representation service.  CLM currently partners with other organisations to provide more than 180 outreach legal advice clinics every year and our legal representation work is focused on areas of law which disproportionately affect those living in disadvantage, such as employment, equality, social welfare, debt, education and housing, all areas which are not covered by the State-funded civil legal aid scheme.  Fourth, CLM campaigns for law reform, and for the safeguarding of rights enshrined in law.  Our priorities for law reform are directly linked to the issues encountered in our clinics.</p> <p>  The right of access to justice is accepted as a constitutional principle and a right under the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR.  Without it, people are unable to have their voice heard, exercise their rights, challenge discrimination or hold decision-makers accountable.  It is a fundamental tenet of a functioning democratic society.  In the absence of access to justice, challenging incorrect decisions or unfair practices by an arm of the State or other body would be more difficult, more distressing or just impossible, especially for vulnerable groups or at vulnerable times.  Access to justice is vital for social inclusion and many of CLM's legal services are focused on areas which are critical to social inclusion, for example, preventing homelessness, assisting with accessing social welfare, education and other services, preventing job loss and challenging discrimination.  Currently, the right of access to justice is being denied to many.  Susan Gogan's research on unmet legal need in Ballymun in 2005 showed that 76% of those with legal problems had sought help but were unable to obtain it.  Further, the community consultation process during the set-up of CLM Limerick in 2012 showed that community organisations rated the availability of legal services in their area as not good or bad and they had limited expertise in the areas themselves.</p> <p>  In my presentation, I will briefly address three points: barriers to accessing justice, limitations of civil legal aid and suggestions for reform, and structural barriers within the legal system itself.  Barriers to accessing to justice were first identified by the Pringle report in 1977 and its conclusions were echoed in a report compiled by CLM in 2012, some 35 years later.  These reports acknowledged that the obstacles facing those living in disadvantage, in need of legal services, are not just the cost and include intimidation of the legal world; inaccessibility of legal services; lack of awareness of rights and the law most relevant to disadvantaged communities, including among the legal profession; fear of not being taken seriously or of retaliation if legal action is taken; and time, including waiting times for legal aid and the time it takes for a case to be heard.  Our practical experience is that these factors deter people from accessing legal services and that the best way to break down these barriers is through meaningful community engagement through the community law centre model.</p><p>My second point is on the limitations of the civil legal aid scheme.  The effective availability of the services of a lawyer is a crucial element of access to justice.  If someone cannot afford a private lawyer, the right to legal aid is an essential component of his or her right of access to justice.  The Pringle report in 1977, as well as our 2012 community consultation report and Susan Gogan&rsquo;s 2005 report, recommended that a civil legal aid scheme should offer legal representation for all types of civil legal proceedings and should have a legal education and law reform function.  However, the civil legal aid scheme established in 1979 falls far short of these recommendations and as a result fails to adequately provide for access to justice.  This is due to a number of factors, many of which were highlighted at this committee by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, two weeks ago.  Those factors include the statutory limitations of the civil legal aid scheme itself.  There is no logical reason the availability of legal aid should be determined by area of law rather than need, or why tribunals such as the Workplace Relations Commission or the Social Welfare Appeals Office should be excluded from legal aid.  When an individual&rsquo;s job or welfare payments are being threatened, there is potential for significant adverse consequences not just for that person but also for their family.  Another issue is the overly strict means test, which is out of touch with the reality of the cost of living and which results in people on low incomes who cannot afford a solicitor being denied legal aid.  A further factor is the under-resourcing of the Legal Aid Board, resulting in an average waiting time for a first consultation in Dublin of up to 38 weeks and up to 58 weeks in one particular office.  This is simply too long to wait and it can cause issues for those seeking legal remedies with strict time limits, such as a judicial review, which has an effective time limit of three months.  Finally, the current model of legal aid has not adopted a comprehensive approach to the provision of civil legal aid, as there are no links with disadvantaged communities and there is no law reform or public education function.  Members of the committee can find further detail on these factors in the notes section of our submission.<br/><br/>The problems and limitations of the Legal Aid Board raise the question of whether the State is complying with its obligations under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 47 of the European charter on fundamental rights and freedoms in cases involving European law.  People of limited means with complex legal issues are unable to obtain legal aid from the State.  That said, it is important to state that despite the limitations and under-resourcing of the service, CLM&rsquo;s experience of working with Legal Aid Board staff and management has always been very positive.  In fact, Mr. John McDaid and Ms Catherine Ryan recently delivered talks as part of CLM&rsquo;s community education programme.<br/><br/>My final point relates to structural barriers within the legal system itself.  In addition to the effective availability of the services of a lawyer, a crucial element of access to justice is effective access to the courts themselves.  There are several barriers to accessing the protection of the courts, including the cost of filing fees, the complexity of the language used and the intimidating atmosphere of the courts.  The courts system as a whole is not designed to cater for children or people with particular vulnerabilities or complex needs.  To give an example, we recently represented a man with physical and intellectual disabilities before the District Court.  He had difficulties with communication and comprehension and neither the barristers nor the judge appeared to have any guidance to follow on how to approach questioning him.  His case was significantly hampered as a result.  A further issue in this area is the delay in implementing reforms contained in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  These reforms will help ensure that people whose decision-making capacity is impaired are afforded the fundamental human right of making their own decisions about their personal and financial affairs, as far as is possible.  At the moment, however, the Victorian concept of wardship still applies through the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  As a community law centre, we also encounter obstacles to taking public interest cases such as the absence of a class action mechanism, restrictive rules relating to <i>locus standi </i>and fear of costs.  We often meet clients who have made a decision not to take a case to vindicate their rights because of the fear of a significant costs order should they lose the case.  This occurred recently in the case of a woman who had a very strong legal case regarding the discriminatory provisions of the State pension scheme, which raised broader public interest issues.<br/><br/>Apart from the changes that need to happen, there is currently a threat to access to justice in the form of the proposed housing and planning and development Bill 2019, which I understand is due to be debated early in the new year.  If enacted, it will increase costs exposure and make it more difficult for ordinary citizens and environmental NGOs to achieve the necessary legal standing to take cases challenging decisions which have an impact on the environment.  Environmental democracy and oversight is protected by EU law and the Aarhus Convention and has never been so important as we grapple with the challenges posed by climate change.<br/><br/>We recommend first restructuring the civil legal aid scheme in line with the community law centre model to include a public legal education and law reform function.  In the interim, greater funding security should be ensured for community law centres, such as CLM and Mercy Law Resource Centre, which continue to meet the need arising from the gap in services.  Second, we recommend reviewing the civil legal aid scheme to ensure it is properly resourced and is provided on the basis of need rather than areas of law, and that the financial means test is more inclusive.  Finally, we need to ensure effective access to the courts by examining issues such as accessibility, cost, class actions, and <i>locus standi </i>and protective costs orders, while bearing these matters in mind with the proposed housing and planning and development Bill.<br/><br/>I will conclude by paraphrasing the American attorney Kimberley Motley, who said that the laws are ours; that they belong to us and need to be used.  If people do not know about their rights under the law, do not know how to assert their rights or are unable to do so without legal assistance, then those rights are not being protected.</p></speech>

We welcome the committee's focus on access to justice and legal costs and we are very glad of the opportunity to address its members.  They have our full statement, which I will draw on to explain the work of the Mercy Law Resource Centre as a community law centre in facilitating access to justice, and to speak to some of the specific questions set out by the committee.<br/><br/>Mercy Law Resource Centre, MLRC, was established in 2009 and is an independent law centre and registered charity, providing free legal advice and representation to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.  We have a vision of a society where each individual lives in dignity and enjoys equal rights, in particular the right to a home, which is fundamental to each human being.  MLRC also envisages a society where each individual enjoys equal access to justice and legal recourse in order to vindicate those rights.  The need for Mercy Law's services far exceeds demand.  The number of people to whom we have provided advice and representation since 2009 has increased year on year, and in 2018 we assisted over 1,300 individuals and families.<br/><br/>There is a vital role for access to justice in the housing sphere.  The UN special rapporteur on adequate housing has highlighted this, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	Violations of the right to housing are as much failures in the administration of justice as they are failures of housing programmes.  If those living in inadequate housing and in homelessness have no access to justice, they are deprived of agency to bring violations to light, to address root causes or ensure appropriate responses.  They are unable to challenge the policy choices and decisions that created the conditions in which they live. </blockquote> <p>Mercy Law sees access to justice as an enabling right which allows those who perceive their rights as having been violated to enforce them and seek redress.  Access to justice encompasses effective availability of access to legal information, timely advice and remedies, accessible legal representation, conflict resolution services, and to the courts system and a fair system of remedies.  Similarly to Community Law and Mediation, MLRC enables access to justice through the operations of legal outreach clinics, ensuring advice is embedded in the community and is accessible; free legal representation for marginalised groups; the provision of legal support for professionals and community organisations which are supporting homeless people to promote resolution of legal issues without the need for legal intervention; delivery of formal training on housing law to community groups and professionals; and active engagement in law reform and policy change.  Mercy Law's work is evidence that a community law centre model, similar to CLM's, can facilitate real access to justice.  At a recent MLRC event, the Chief Justice recognised the &quot;vital role&quot; that dedicated, community-oriented groups were providing, which would not be provided in any other way. <br/><br/>I will touch on some of the specific issues raised by the committee in its invitation.  Regarding barriers to accessing the courts, the primary challenge for any individual with a potential legal issue is access to legal advice and information in the first instance.  Many of the vulnerable groups and individuals Mercy Law engages with would struggle to access legal advice in the absence of our service, let alone access the courts system.  With respect to legal aid, the majority of our clients would be eligible under the Legal Aid Board's means test, but are essentially deemed ineligible because the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 specifically excludes the granting of legal aid in disputes concerning rights and interests over land.</p><p>An exemption to this exclusion does apply in limited circumstances but in our experience, this is not widely known or availed of.  MLRC believes that the current delivery of civil legal aid, specifically with regard to housing and homelessness matters, is wholly inadequate.  The level of legal aid provision on housing and homeless matters currently delivered by the board is negligible.  The board is not empowered or resourced to disseminate legal information and to have a community presence and outreach service, nor does it have any substantive role in law reform or policy.  The substantial delays in accessing advice present a further practical barrier in accessing justice through the scheme.  Often clients facing homelessness require a nimble service that can proactively reach out to local authorities in order to negotiate solutions.  This is not achievable if clients are required to wait weeks and months to meet with a solicitor.  <br/><br/>A common theme in our contact with lay litigants with housing issues is the challenge of identifying the relevant legal issue or rights violation without proper legal advice.  A disproportionate number of our clients who are in homelessness are migrants or those from ethnic minorities.  Together with individuals with literacy issues or a disability, as many of our clients do, these groups can face substantial challenges in engaging with court procedures and representing themselves adequately in court as lay litigants.  <br/><br/>I wish to highlight one issue regarding court structures, which is the absence of any tribunal or alternative dispute resolution process regarding housing matters.  MLRC frequently engages with local authorities on housing matters and sees the wide variation in how appeals are processed and a general lack of transparency and formalised process.  MLRC would welcome the development of an independent appeals forum outside the court system to protect housing rights and make a remedy more cost-effective and accessible, and reduce inconsistencies and related unfairness of current procedures.  In several instances, MLRC has advised and legally represented a large of number of clients who have been impacted by an identical issue.  In such situations, bringing individual sets of proceedings may be necessary to remedy the wrongs.  Class actions would provide for a much more efficient and cost-effective means of providing access to justice for a potentially large group of litigants.<br/><br/>MLRC warmly welcomes the current focus and expansion of <i>pro bono</i>in Ireland.  In 2017, MLRC initiated an innovative <i>pro bono</i>project in partnership with A&amp;amp;L Goodbody, Focus Ireland and the Public Interest Law Alliance.  This project involved corporate solicitors from A&amp;amp;L Goodbody attending a legal advice outreach clinic at Focus Ireland and providing legal advice and follow up legal representation.  Together with many other examples, this <i>pro bono</i>project has had a real impact.  This is extremely welcome but we firmly believe that <i>pro bono</i>cannot replace community-based and properly resourced legal advice and representation to vulnerable groups as a vital element of access to justice.  <br/><br/>In conclusion, I will highlight some key recommendations we made in our substantive submission.  We would like to see an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to ensure that legal aid is available on housing and homeless matters on the basis of established need for this service, a restructuring of the delivery of civil legal aid to bring it in line with the community law centre model and better resourcing, support for and visibility of existing community law centres.  We warmly welcome this opportunity to share our concerns with the committee and look forward to engaging with members on questions surrounding this issue.  </p></speech>

In my opening statement, I will address five different points.  I will start by looking at the various barriers to access to justice.  As has already been indicated, there are a number of different factors that impede access to justice.  Chief among these is the issue of cost but there is also the question of people being unaware of their legal entitlements.  The Pringle committee further identified psychological or cultural barriers between disadvantaged individuals and communities and the legal world.  The nature of certain legal problems can also be an issue here.  What are known as problems of a diffuse nature, for example, in the area of consumer protection or environmental protection, can pose particular problems because they can impact on a large number of people but not on any one particular individual significantly or sufficiently to motivate that person to take legal action.  The special position of people with disabilities is another issue.  I know the committee is aware of section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, which imposes on all public bodies a duty to address issues of discrimination in the manner in which they deliver services.  This clearly applies to the Legal Aid Board.  I thought it worth mentioning that in a High Court decision in 2012, Mr. Justice Hogan also identified a constitutional duty imposed on the courts under Article 40.1 of the Constitution to make reasonable accommodation for litigants with physical disabilities.</p> <p>  I will briefly describe the different responses one can take to these barriers to access.  Models of legal aid fall into two categories.  The more restricted or conservative model is known as the service model.  This model focuses very much on the individual litigant and seeks to address the problem of cost.  Generally speaking, a service model will not address the other barriers to access I have mentioned.  Moreover, the service model provides what I would describe as conventional legal services and would not engage in programmes of political lobbying or education.  In contrast, the strategic model does attempt to address the various barriers I have mentioned.  Whereas the focus of the service model is very much on the individual, the focus of the strategic model is on the individual as presenting or representing a structural problem in society.  Strategic models will address not only the issue of cost but will also deal with the issue of people being unaware of their legal rights by providing programmes of legal education.  They will also try to address the psychological or cultural barrier by locating their services in disadvantaged areas to put people at their ease.  They also engage in campaigning for legal and social reform regarding the problems their clients present to them.  In the Irish context,  the strategic model is represented in the voluntary sector among community law organisations while the Legal Aid Board would use the service model.  </p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to a recent report published by the World Bank and the International Bar Association entitled A Tool for Justice: The Cost Benefit Analysis of Legal Aid, which was published in September 2019.  It is a cost-benefit analysis of legal aid that looks at various jurisdictions.  Unfortunately, Ireland was not one of the jurisdictions that was examined but the central point made by the report could equally apply here.  It is argues that while the provision of legal aid involves an immediate cost, it can bring about significant savings for the State in other areas.  In thinking about legal aid, we should not see it simply as net expenditure.  There are savings to be made and this warrants investment in legal aid.  </p> <p>  I will say a few things about the statutory scheme of civil legal aid.  I preface my remarks by acknowledging the great work done by the Legal Aid Board in delivering legal aid to individuals over the years in particularly trying circumstances.  I will highlight three limitations of the current scheme.  Some of these have already been mentioned.  The first is that the current scheme does not extend to the provision of legal representation before tribunals.  As has already been mentioned, social welfare appeals tribunals, cases going before the Workplace Relations Commission or cases going before the RTB are key areas, particularly for disadvantaged individuals, yet the current scheme means that the Legal Aid Board is not in a position to provide representation for anyone appearing before those tribunals.</p><p>The second limitation I would like to highlight refers to the exclusion of disputes concerning rights or interests in or over land from the availability of legal aid certificates.  At best the position here is unclear and at worst this exclusion could prevent the Legal Aid Board providing legal aid in respect of housing cases.  I have heard anecdotally that the board sometimes provides such support but it is not clear that this comes within the terms of the legislation.  It is an area that requires clarification.</p><p> My final point regarding the Legal Aid Board is to highlight the delays involved in obtaining consultation with solicitors in various centres.  In my submission I give more detail on the delays in various centres, which in some cases are in excess of a year.  This highlights the point that the Legal Aid Board is significantly under-resourced.  There is, again, anecdotal evidence that the board is having difficulty recruiting staff because the payscales it offers are simply not competitive with the private market or other positions in the public sector.  It is a serious matter that must be addressed quickly.</p><p> The other matter before the committee is litigation and rules of procedures.  I will make two very quick points in this regard.  There is a need for an appropriate system of class actions.  I understand legislation is currently before the Oireachtas on the topic and this mechanism is important.  Looking at the sort of law handled by law centres, the areas often have a significant public impact.  For example, in the area of social welfare, one social welfare claimant bringing a case could stand in the place of hundreds or perhaps even thousands of similarly situated welfare claimants.  An effective mechanism for processing those sort of disputes is by way of class action but, unfortunately, the mechanisms we have in this jurisdiction are not fit for that purpose.  Some change is needed here as well.</p><p> I mention in my submission that an alternative to class actions in some types of cases is for Departments to be encouraged, where they have been sued, to actively review their files and see if there are similarly situated cases that have not yet been litigated.  I commend the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as when it was sued in respect of the implementation of the third equality directive in the 1980s with respect to equality for men and women in social welfare, it engaged in just such an exercise.  In the absence of a class action, it is certainly something to be commended.</p><p> I will mention the mechanism of a protective costs order, which is available to the courts and can be granted to somebody in advance of litigation taking place.  It offers a sort of assurance to the litigant that even if the litigation is unsuccessful, the liability for costs would be limited.  However, that mechanism has a major limitation in that it is not available to a litigant with a personal interest in the litigation.  It only applies to a case where somebody is acting altruistically in the public interest.  For example, it would not apply to a social welfare claimant challenging the policy of the Department, although the policy would have implications for many others.  In my submission I highlight the matter and suggest that perhaps rules or procedures could be drafted to broaden the availability of this mechanism.</p></speech>

At the end of this process, we will produce a report that will have recommendations.  The contents of the submissions and what is said today is very important for the purposes of us finalising our recommendations.</p> <p>  All the witnesses agree that the first immediate obstacle to a person accessing justice is awareness of the law.  In many respects, people only become aware of the law as a result of a traumatic event.  For example, people could be the victim of crime or be accused of a crime.  They could have a family law dispute and the break-up of a family or a row in employment or in a tenancy.  We just need to try to elaborate on what can be done to make people more aware of the law and the rights they have instead of waiting for people to have a traumatic event.</p> <p>  In these Houses, we spend all our time making laws but sometimes I wonder how many people are aware of the laws being made here.  What can be done in a practical sense to make members of the public aware of the law?  This does not apply simply to disadvantaged areas.  How can we make members of the public aware of the rights they have under the Constitution and, more specifically, under statute law?  How do the witnesses recommend we do it?  Should it come through a community law centre or through education?</p></speech>

As the Deputy correctly indicated, sometimes people become aware of how the law is relevant to their lives through a traumatic event but sometimes it is still not obvious after a traumatic event.  We have experience of people coming into our clinic to get advice on a slip and fall, which is a classic legal matter.  Talking to these people one might also realise they are homeless or have been refused social welfare; they might have a range of legal issues that they may not even have identified as being legal problems.  Sometimes a traumatic event is not enough for them to crystallise it as a legal issue.</p> <p>  A community education programme is critical and it should go to the community, as we do, to speak to people about law, rights and how the law can be used to enforce those rights.  One must also work with organisations that might be contacted by individuals, including those dealing with citizens' information and family resource centres.  These are organisations that link with the community on a regular basis.  People might go to them for help but perhaps they might not categorise it as legal help.  We often go to the community and provide education to individuals and training or capacity-building for organisations that provide information.  They might be the first port of call for individuals.</p></speech>

We do formal training on housing law, for which there is a great demand.  We get many community groups and NGOs that are exclusively working in the housing space attending that education process, which empowers them to support their clients without having to go the classic route of meeting a solicitor.  We often find they are not aware of the information we give, so there is a need to educate people on fair procedures in dealing with local authorities, for example.  That touches on the constitutional rights issue.</p> <p>  We are often asked to go to an organisation and do a housing rights session.  We like to be able to do it but often this comes back to resources for us.  We are a small law centre with three solicitors and three administrative staff.  We will do this insofar as we can as we see the real value in it.  Ultimately, advising on individual cases goes some way but we also need to do community education to disseminate information as broadly as possible to have the maximum impact.</p></speech>

Some of the law centres - I am thinking specifically of Ballymun Community Law Centre - have programmes where they go to local schools and involve children at second level.  Once they understand the legal world, this helps to break down the psychological barrier I mentioned.  The Law Society operates a street law programme as well that has a similar purpose.</p></speech>

When they are passed and promulgated by the President, we do not do much to inform the public about them.  There is no big announcement.  It is hard to understand complicated statutory laws.  Do the witnesses think that another way of making people aware of their rights is that the people with whom they are engaged, be they employers, landlords or financial institutions, should have a greater obligation to apprise individuals of their legal rights in their dealings with them?  It would be ideal if we had unlimited resources and a community law centre in every community in the same way as there is a post office or a bank but that probably is not feasible.  We need to think of different mechanisms for making people aware of their rights and legal entitlements.</p></speech>

We have had some of their website team attend our training.  They are very engaged to ensure the accuracy of information.  That is a valuable way of disseminating it.</p> <p>  We work to some degree with private tenants.  Putting an obligation on a landlord to inform people of their rights is difficult because the situation is already adversarial and there is a power imbalance.  We do not work much in the private rented sphere, as we are primarily focused on social housing, but in some instances we go to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  There is an inequality of arms there because often a landlord will have the resources to bring a solicitor, which is absolutely his or her entitlement, and it will ultimately assist the landlord.  We see the converse where the tenant perceives that he or she is disadvantaged, and in some respects he or she will be disadvantaged in being able to put his or her case forward properly because the legislation is vast and technical.</p> <p>  Professor Whyte raised the point about tribunals being excluded from the scope of civil legal aid, except for the International Protection Office.  There might be a consideration there because we are moving to a position where we are providing less social housing but more social housing support through the housing assistance payment, so the rights of private tenants are increasingly relevant, particularly to the marginalised groups and vulnerable people with whom we engage.</p></speech>

The reality, however, is that if one is representing a client of the law centre at the Workplace Relations Commission, the employer always brings what is often an extensive legal team so the inequality of arms is very apparent.  In those circumstances one is looking at a relationship that is unbalanced with regard to resources.  That is a difficulty in circumstances where the civil legal aid scheme does not cover that tribunal.  There is certainly a gap there in terms of information, advice and representation.</p></speech>

Is it in the area of housing or in consumer areas?  What other aspect of the law is most required to be conveyed to people at present?</p></speech>

We often see people at an early stage of their family law issue and they do not know where to go.  They know about our law centre because it is embedded in the community, but they have not heard of the Legal Aid Board.  Family law is an area of demand for us.  The other main areas are housing, employment and debt.  There is a growing need arising in the area of education.  We have been handling many cases recently for children with disabilities who are put on shortened school days or who have informal exclusion mechanisms applied to them.  We are providing them with advice.  Those are the main areas, but they can change.  Sometimes it changes in response to a new circular or a new practice that has developed in an office or body of the State which creates a new area of demand.  Apart from family law, employment, housing and debt are big areas and they are not catered for by the legal aid scheme.</p></speech>

In the WRC there is no prospect of a costs order being made against somebody.  Does Ms O'Sullivan think that makes things fairer?  She said there is still inequality there.  What does she think of the proposal that if one removes the possibility of costs orders being made against individuals, as is the case in the WRC, it would make access easier?</p></speech>

However, if somebody is faced with the termination of his or her employment for an unfair reason and is taking a case, he or she is still not entitled to any civil legal aid and representation at the outset of that case.  I find with people who come to our services through one of our outreach clinics that the costs and final outcome of the case are quite remote for them at that time.  As for accessing what can be a very difficult process to get through, for example, in an equal status case or an employment equality case, there is an obligation on the individual who is taking the case to make written submissions in advance of the case.  The case is front-loaded in that way.</p> <p>  Employment law is a massively technical area and often engages difficult concepts in European law.  That in itself is a barrier.  I accept that the WRC being a no-cost environment is one advantage but, for me, the intimidation begins at a much earlier stage and the advice or representation is required at that earlier stage.  Often in our advocacy work we might assist somebody in writing the initial letters and sometimes there is no need to progress with litigation and end up in the WRC.  Sometimes a letter to an employer setting out the infringements can resolve the situation at an earlier stage.</p></speech>

We believe there is a role for legal advice and representation for tenants in that forum.</p> <p>  With regard to the fear of a costs order, it is similar with the RTB.  As an adjunct to that in respect of the RTB, we deal with some matters where we appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  We are appealing a determination of the board and that is also a highly complex area.  We see lay litigants in that process who are struggling to articulate their case.  If one is seeking legal representation at the point where one is going to the High Court, that is another complicated scenario.  It points to the need for legal representation at the earlier stage.  As regards the fear of costs orders, we have had clients decide not to go to litigation because of the risk of a costs order.  They would have been public interest cases which would have affected many other clients, similar to the example Ms Wall gave.  The costs order consideration comes a little way down the line.  One is initially assessing whether people have a claim, what the remedy is and then one comes to the costs consideration.  It is not an isolated issue.  There has to be a holistic approach to all the aspects.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are available but, as he said, one cannot have a personal interest in the outcome of the case.  He also mentioned class actions.  When people hear about class actions one of their concerns is that they could be like the class actions in America in which lawyers end up taking a large percentage of the pot that is recovered.  How do we get around that and ensure it would not happen?</p></speech>

That is precluded in our system.</p><p>I do not see that as a particular problem.</p><p> The LRC in 2005 recommended the introduction of multiparty actions for the reasons I gave earlier.  I would support that for one additional reason, which I mentioned in my original statement but did not mention in my oral presentation.  Sometimes, when dealing with a Department and challenging some aspect of questionable policy, if one sets up a legal case, the case will be frustrated if the Department decides to settle it and then imposes a confidentiality agreement on the litigant.  There is evidence of this in the Travers report dealing with the nursing home fees in the 2000s.  A class action would counter that because if the Department is facing a class action taken by two or three people representing a larger class, then settlement of that action changes the policy and so, for that reason, there is a need to introduce class actions.  At the moment, questionable public policy can be protected by a Department simply settling cases and preventing the courts from having a chance to scrutinise what is going on.</p></speech>

Access to justice begins long before anyone steps into a courtroom.  I thank them for bringing that to my attention and making us reflect on it.</p> <p>  Page 3 of the CLM presentation, set outs the Pringle report from 1977, which has not been implemented, in bullet points referring to the intimidation of the legal world, inaccessibility of legal services and so on.  They could apply to any public body, given my experience as a councillor for many years.  When I think of that fear of retribution, I think of making complaints to the health services or I think of housing and local authorities.  Whether it is accurate, it is certainly the perception.  Those bullet points could apply to any public body, unfortunately.</p> <p>  We come back to the strategic model that is empowering and enabling, or a very specific model trying to sort out problems after they have arisen.  That is the kernel and it is where Governments baulk because, if we take the strategic model, they think it is going to open up the floodgates, when the reality is it will probably save money in the long run.  Is that not the challenge?  The World Bank has examined the report to which the witnesses have referred us.  It is not an easy read and I would recommend it be written in a different way because the message will be lost, other than us quoting two or three lines from it.  It is not an easy report to read.  It is certainly more effective to have a proper service.  Is it not the challenge to get Governments to realise-----</p></speech>

Time and again, we set up a case, institute a case and settle a case and there is a confidentiality clause, but then a new client comes in the following morning with the same issue.  That is not effective and is certainly not cost-effective from the State's point of view as well as our own.  That is why we advocate this community law centre model.  It is not just about trying to deal with the individual issue coming through the door and trying to look at it more broadly.  First, it is trying to educate people in regard to asserting their rights but then trying to look at it from a law reform perspective.  For example, what are the issues coming through our work and through our clinics?  What are the broader issues we can try to tackle through a law reform mechanism, through a lobbying mechanism or through strategic litigation, if we get that far?  That model is critical.</p></speech>

Lawyers and legal firms deliver legal aid to individual clients, complemented by a network of law centres doing the more strategic work.  We have that de facto here, when we combine the State sector with the private sector because, as I indicated earlier, the State sector and the Legal Aid Board are essentially service models.

If people are aware of the law and their rights at an early stage, and engage with the legal services at an earlier stage, an issue can often be resolved at an early stage. Whether it is through a simple letter or a simple phone call, the issue can be resolved before it becomes entrenched, more difficult and there is a need to go to court.  From an effectiveness and cost saving point of view, there is certainly an argument to be made.</p> <p>  Similarly, from a law reform point of view - and this is why we would advocate that the civil legal aid scheme should have a law reform function - if they are dealing with the same issue and pouring resources into the same issue time and again, rather than dealing with the root cause of the problem, there is certainly the cost saving exercise to be done.  As Professor Whyte highlighted on the issue of social return on investment, if we invest properly in these services, there is a social return because we are preventing homelessness, job losses and so on. </p></speech>

I am asking how we overcome those challenges to make the system change.  The witnesses made very specific recommendations in regard to the Legal Aid Board and the legislation underpinning it to broaden it out so it has a reform and education role.  Is Ms Wall saying the roll-out of more independent law centres is part of the answer?</p></speech>

It is because of the areas of law we work in and the type of work we do, but also because of how we do it.  We go out to communities and go where the people are.  It depends on how comprehensive civil legal aid can be.  It depends on whether there is going to be a need in the future.  In reality, would it not be great if there was no need for individual community law centres that have to fundraise for their activities and do not have any security around that?  Would it not be great if we had a proper comprehensive State scheme for that?  It depends on how comprehensive it can be going forward.</p></speech>

On the Deputy's broader point, I echo the comments made by Ms Wall and Professor Whyte.  We do not receive any State funding.

We were competing against a number of organisations in a range of spheres, so it was not necessarily a specific law fund, as it were.  Positioning our service in the homeless and housing space is, in some respects, challenging.  If one speaks to a lawyer, it is clear that we can lift a lot of barriers to people accessing adequate housing, so they do not need to access an emergency bed somewhere, or we lift the reason why they need a free meal in the evening.  We fulfil a function but articulating that can be more challenging.</p></speech>

There are 10,518 homeless people and it is becoming more difficult.  Even before that, when I was a councillor in a previous life, it was increasingly difficult and appeals were a nightmare.  There was a lack of openness and accountability.  Ms Keatinge is suggesting an alternative dispute resolution mechanism and I worry that will add another layer of difficulty, as opposed to looking at what is wrong with the system and improving it.</p></speech>

The proposal of an alternative to the courts is based on the notion that, ideally, people do not need a lawyer to be able to resolve a housing matter but oftentimes they do, and the courts are so remote.</p></speech>

Some councils, in their schemes of allocation, will include an appeals procedure and set a time limit for that.  As the people we meet in our clinics have not read the scheme of allocation for the relevant local authority, we, or a citizens information centre, need to tell them that.</p></speech>

I think the points that Ms Wall made about cost saving were well put.  We sometimes get referrals from local authorities because we can expedite the process of resolving a difficulty and advise somebody as to how the scheme operates, why they cannot get an entitlement or how they can go about that.  We can ease that process.</p></speech>

We were before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in June and gave recommendations on family homelessness.  It is through our accumulated experience of deficiencies in the current legal framework that we are able to bring recommendations that were included in the committee's report from November.  All the recommendations we made are now in that report.  There is real value in that in bringing about broader, more structural change in the specific practice areas in which we are involved.</p></speech>

The courts have been proactive in talking about the trinity of planning laws comprising the local authority, the developer and the engaged citizen.  There is a theoretical emphasis on the importance of the citizen, which this proposed Bill seems to curtail.</p></speech>

It certainly curtails oversight of planning decisions.  There is a question mark over whether it complies with our obligations under EU law and the Aarhus Convention.  To consider it more broadly, we are in the middle of a climate emergency, as declared by the D&aacute;il, and we need to have proper oversight of any development decisions that have an impact on the environment.  The mechanisms in place at the moment allow for that, for more relaxed standing rules and protection as to costs in these cases and they will be considerably restricted with this new Bill.</p></speech>

We had a presentation from Science Foundation Ireland some time in the past 12 months which put an emphasis on policy based on evidence.  It seems to me there is a mantra about serial objectors to planning permission without any evidence at all.

I do not think any Department involved in any litigation should insist on a confidentiality clause because there can be no learning in that case.

I came across that through work I did with FLAC.  In one particular case, FLAC was bringing a High Court challenge on a Monday morning and, on the Sunday night, a senior counsel from the other side rang our senior counsel to say they would give us what we were looking for but insisted on a confidentiality agreement.  In such a situation, the client has got what he or she is looking for.  One cannot go into the High Court and tell the judge to highlight the fact that there is a problem for dozens, maybe even hundreds, of other similarly situated welfare claimants.  The use of confidentiality clauses is a strategy to protect policies.</p></speech>

I would like to tease out a few things a little more.  Almost all the contributors have referred to class actions, multiparty actions and the impact they may have.  I recently raised with the Minister for Health the case of a woman who had a settlement in court.  She is one of probably 150 or 200 people in the country who have made the same complaint and each has been told by their solicitor that they would have to take a separate case and it would be fought separately by the State because it feels it has an obligation to defend taxpayers' money.  That was the reason put forward.  I am trying to be delicate.  The excuse, or the reason, that is being put forward is that each individual's illness is particular to themselves and each has his or her own bodily system, which will react differently.</p><p>I find, however, that there is a tendency in these situations for the State to block or push back for as long as it can and when it realises that will not work it settles with a confidentiality clause.  It will then set up a system to bring all those people together and say there will be redress.  The difficulty is that the redress is part of that system of holding on for as long as possible, giving and admitting as little as possible.</p><p> What are the problems that could come into play in the multiparty action?  There is a resistance to that.  My colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and &Oacute; Laoghaire, have brought forward legislation and gone some distance with it but there is considerable resistance to this becoming law from the system.  If there are valid reasons for that I would like to know what they are.</p></speech>

I know that is the barrier in that particular case.</p></speech>

The experience in the US indicates that there are issues to be addressed, for example, identifying a class.  Deputy Martin Kenny referred to 150 people with medical problems where the medical situation might vary from one to another.  It is a question of deciding whether there is sufficient similarity in the cases to be a class.  In the US the class action works on the basis of two or three people presenting with a common problem.  The action goes ahead in the name of those individuals but subsequently if anybody else has been similarly affected they can get the benefit of the ruling.  This sets the context for the second problem which is that there are several people driving the action, there is a class behind them but will they properly represent the interests of their fellow class members or could their particular issues be addressed to the detriment of issues that other members of the class might want to see highlighted?  This type of problem can present itself.  I am not sure that it is possible to come up with a model that will avoid those.  We have to just engage with them on a case by case basis.</p></speech>

Determining whether there is a particular class can be done only in the context of a particular problem and the possibility of litigation.  I cannot see how legislation could obviate that particular issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.879" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121100002#K00600"><p>One current example is the replacement hip joint used for hundreds or probably thousands of people in the country which was found to be defective.  It was used all over the world, yet in Ireland each person is fighting individually.  To me that would be a very typical multiparty class action and there would not be an issue because it is very clear there is a problem.  The reason Professor Whyte gives is valid but only to a certain extent.  When we get past that the multiparty or class action could bring huge benefit, not just from the point of view of the people taking it but from that of the State because the State is being put to huge cost defending each case.  Apart from legal costs there is the cost to society and the injustice to the individuals.</p> <p>  One of the big barriers for people is the cost of taking legal action.  They fear that if they lose the case they will lose a lot of money.  It can be a minor problem but they can feel very aggrieved.  Sometimes we, as elected representatives, meet individuals whose lives are dominated by some wrong that they felt happened to them and they could get no justice anywhere.  Sometimes they are on to us three and four times a week.  Their mental health is affected.  When we bore into it we might find that it started out as a minor issue but they found there was nowhere to go with it.  Is there scope to develop something like the small claims court?  I think at the moment the limit is &euro;2,000 and it has to be for the purchase of an item.  It is quite restricted.  Is there a possibility of opening that up for people to have access to justice that would not impose the big cost on them of having to employ a solicitor and get into a legal tangle?</p></speech>

The Deputy gives the example of someone going to the small claims court but the case snowballs which has an impact throughout their lives.  I recall one person who came to a clinic who was living in a family hub and was in difficulty with their mobile phone provider.  This was having a disproportionate impact on that person's situation and was affecting their child's access to education because the person was not able to focus on making sure that was fulfilled.  Those areas of law do disproportionately affect the communities we work with, people facing disadvantage.  The Deputy is absolutely right that representation and advice at that early stage is vital, no matter what the area of law.</p></speech>

They feel they cannot get anywhere.  On the other side, there are people in rented accommodation who do not pay the rent.  The landlord may put up with them for a year or two but cannot get anything out of them.  Eventually when the landlord gets them out they are left with a big bill which has been unpaid for a long time.  The tenant gets a house somewhere but the landlord wonders why they are letting houses to people who will not pay the rent.  They feel they have no come back because the first question a solicitor will ask is whether the person has any assets or money.  If the landlord says they do not seem to that causes a huge problem.  I am sure every public representative comes across this regularly.  If the individual does not have means the landlord has to put up with it.  There is an injustice there as well.  Is there a solution to that type of situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.884" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rebecca Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019121100002#K01100"><p>There are mechanisms by which the landlords can pursue their arrears at an earlier stage.</p><p>We all know about the RTB dispute resolution process.  It could serve its warnings and be in there pretty quick.  Our understanding is that the RTB will prioritise the more straightforward cases.  There is also an enforcement process and mechanism within the RTB where, in some instances, it will take that forward and seek an order from the court to enforce it.   I hear what the Deputy is saying on the mark in respect of recovering it but landlords may reduce their potential losses by pursuing what is a remedy that is available to them at an earlier stage.  </p><p> With respect to conditions, the Mercy Law Centre would have traditionally looked to some of those cases to provide advice.  Given the scale of the homeless crisis, we are prioritising our cases so we devote a considerable time to the real acute need of people who cannot even access a bed for the night.  That is where our resources go.  There are certainly very legitimate legal issues for people who are in very substandard housing and whose health is being compromised by that but there is very little recourse in terms of legal advice.  When we have people contacting our service it is very hard to know where we can direct them to get that support. </p><p> I shall comment briefly on costs as mentioned by the Deputy.  There is the chilling effect of, potentially, getting a cost order against one.  Even paying basic stamp duty costs is a barrier in itself.  Many of the cases we are dealing with concern fair procedures and, therefore, are in the High Court so then one is into having &euro;300 to get a case initiated and then the costs will grow.  That is just simple stamp duty.  Those costs are a challenge for us, as a law centre, to meet if we are bringing a lot of litigation and for an individual the costs would be substantial as well.</p><p> Deputy Connolly asked about appeals mechanisms.  From our perspective on the housing side, if there were some consistency around how appeals were dealt with by the local authority that may be a mechanism to avoid, perhaps, going to the High Court in the first instance.  That could happen if one knew that one had a meaningful, transparent and consistent procedure that one could engage with that may resolve things and not require one to take a leap.  There could be an equivalent to the small claims court in the local authority housing sphere. </p></speech>

If the cases were dealt with earlier and effectively these matters could be more efficiently dealt with in a lower tier court and at less cost.  That is something we could possibly consider but maybe there are reasons for that being otherwise.</p></speech>

CLM provides a mediation service.  Mediation is particularly important when what is at issue are relationships such as disputes between neighbours, family members or colleagues where an ongoing relationship is critical.  Sometimes the law is not the best avenue in such instances and mediation is much more appropriate.  We have the family mediation service, through the civil legal aid scheme.  The service can be a good mechanism for certain types of disputes.  It is probably a less suitable mechanism where a client is up against a State body.  A case can be more difficult in that situation.  When what is at issue is a relationship, a damaged relationship and a dispute between parties who do have a relationship, then mediation certainly has a role.</p></speech>

Our mediation service is free and our mediation service is provided by volunteer mediators so they are not paid.  The family mediation service is also free but it uses a panel of mediators who are paid by the service.  There are private mediators who work, for example, in the area of employment law and others.</p></speech>

If a review of the report was conducted over the next year or so would we point towards its recommendations that have been implemented?  Has the report stood the test of time?  If we implemented its recommendations now would it meet our current requirements?  </p></speech>

One must consider the sequence of events.  The Pringle Report appeared in 1977 but no progress was made on it and then we had the Airey case, which came before European Court of Human Rights in 1980.  It was the Airey case that pushed the State into agreeing to provide free legal aid.  The Airey case was a fantastic case to bring but it only highlighted one of the problems that we have identified, that of cost.  Mrs. Airey was certainly not intimidated by the legal profession and was well aware of her legal rights.  Her particular problem was she could not afford legal representation so that was the sole focus of her case.  In turn, it meant that the State, in order to comply with Airey, only had to focus in on the issue of costs and did not have to address the other problems that were identified in the Pringle Report as barriers to accessing justice such as people being unaware of their rights or being intimated by the legal world.  The Airey case took the wind out the Pringle Report in the sense that now there was a State scheme and the State could say it complied with the European Convention on Human Rights but that is not the model recommended in the Pringle Report.</p></speech>

Prior to setting it up we carried out a community consultation in the form of focus groups in the local community.  The initiative came up with pretty much the same conclusions as Pringle in deciding what were the barriers to accessing justice but also what is the shape of this service going forward, and how should it be provided to the community.  The issues were the same.  While cost is certainly an issue in terms of being a barrier to accessing justice, all of the other issues came up like an intimidating legal world, the inability to access legal services, a lack of legal education, and the lack of awareness of rights in the law.  What people were crying out for was an accessible legal service in the community where legal education and law reform would perform part of its functions.  It was interesting that 35 years later the same issues arose.</p></speech>

While people are eligible for legal aid, once they get legal aid there is, as the Deputy said, a minimum fee to be paid.  An important obstacle to legal aid at the moment is the means test.  We have a means test where one cannot earn over &euro;18,000 but after that one is allowed certain allowances.  However, those allowances have not been visited in some time and are totally out of touch with the reality of the cost of living.  For example, one is allowed an allowance of a maximum amount of &euro;8,000 for rent or mortgage payments.  If one rents in Dublin and is in receipt, for example, of a housing assistance payment, HAP, particularly a homeless HAP, one will be in excess of &euro;8,000.  HAP is treated as income under the means test.</p></speech>

There are a lot of anomalies with the means test, which mean that people who cannot afford the services of a lawyer are being denied legal aid.  Frankly, there are very few people who can afford the services of a lawyer.  The average person in Ireland, I would say, cannot afford to take a case to the High Court to vindicate his or her rights as it is just out of his or her reach.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Wall.  It was mentioned that legal aid was not allowable at the WRC.  For my own information, is it allowable where the WRC makes a judgment that is then challenged in the courts?  I know of instances where someone who got a favourable judgment at the WRC that was then challenged in the courts by the employer lost there because he or she had no legal representation.</p></speech>

The one tribunal where someone can get legal representation is the International Protection Appeals Tribunal.  That is the limit of the legal aid certificate.  Once a case moves from a tribunal to the courts, there is the possibility of getting legal representation from the Legal Aid Board.  At least, that is my understanding.</p></speech>

In a number of instances that I know of, people won their cases for genuine reasons but, when they went to court, they were ruled against because they had no legal representation.  That is-----</p></speech>

The WRC has an enforcement unit that can provide people in some circumstances with assistance in enforcing awards in the District Court.  Not everyone is aware of that.</p></speech>

The enforcement of judgments is a whole other problem that we could probably discuss for another day.  People get awards against their former employers or, in an equal status case, a service provider, but enforcing that award and getting the money is the start of a new journey, one that is difficult to navigate.  The manner in which companies are structured in Ireland can pose problems.  Piercing the corporate veil and accessing the money can be difficult.  If someone has already fought a long and often distressing employment law case, embarking on another fight is frequently too much.</p></speech>

I have two further questions.  It was mentioned in passing that the legal advice was funded by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government rather than the Department of Justice and Equality.  This may be an unfair question for the witnesses, but I believe that is the crux of the problem, in that the Department of Justice and Equality is not about justice and is not the right Department to deal with many of these matters.  Perhaps it needs to be broken up and the law, the Garda and so on need to be kept separate from the civil legal aid system.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has funded these advices and the Department of Justice and Equality has not.  How does that work?</p></speech>

As such, it was just a different Department.  Ballymun Regeneration Company Limited, which I believe was set up by Dublin City Council, convened a meeting of stakeholders to see what sorts of service could be delivered generally in the Ballymun area.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, highlighted the need for a legal aid service.  The company went with the strategic model that FLAC had advocated.</p></speech>

My point was that it was a State-funded strategic model.  It can be done if there is the political will.</p></speech>

I apologise for being delayed.</p> <p>  The Pringle report has been referenced a number of times.  Can the witnesses point to any radical or tangible improvement since the report?  Are we facing a legacy of people being left behind in this space?  Is there anything in the past 40 years about which we can be positive?  According to one of these documents, many of the core areas in 1977 were still problematic in 2012.  Did anyone take policy action?  Will someone else be here in 40 years time asking what the parliamentarians of today did not do?</p></speech>

However, there was a significant increase in resourcing in anticipation of the divorce referendum in 1995 or 1996.  Until that time, the board had operated through 12 law centres, four of which were in Dublin with the other eight distributed around the country.  Now, there are approximately 30 law centres.  Under the statutory scheme, there has been a greater involvement of private practitioners.  As far as I recall, there was no involvement of private practitioners under its predecessor.  Essentially, there were 30 or so solicitors trying to provide legal aid for the entire country.  That has changed.  There are now more Legal Aid Board solicitors.  For limited types of case, the board can get private practitioners involved in providing legal services.</p> <p>  That said, it remains the case that the board is significantly under-resourced.  A number of us have mentioned the board's difficulties in recruiting staff.  That is a serious problem and is manifesting in delays in getting an initial appointment in some centres.  I should clarify that the Legal Aid Board has a system of prioritising cases that are not subject to those delays.  If one is not a priority case, though, one can be waiting many months to get an initial consultation with a board solicitor.  That speaks to me of under-resourcing.</p></speech>

The community law centres are dealing with a large unmet need in other areas where there are no entitlements to legal aid.  The issue of community law centres has arisen in the interim period.  There are nearly ten of them now.  We operate in a network, co-ordinate our work - we share our legal expertise and experiences - and work on law reform to a degree.  There is a certain strength, but it is an under-resourced area with relatively low visibility.  I just wanted to raise those concerns.</p></speech>

Compared to where we were in the 1970s, we have made some progress.  For example, we have a civil legal aid scheme, Abhaile and the Citizens Information Board.  We have more than we had, but the point we are making today is that we could do much better.</p></speech>

We all deal at the coalface with constituents who, in their sense of the world, see no empowerment in positioning themselves and accessing justice.  The witnesses have outlined statutory limitations, resource issues and issues with the model of civil legal aid.  This area needs to be radically reformed.  Regarding statutory limitations, could the statutory framework be expanded to deal with the anomalies or should the whole thing be uprooted and changed?  Given the witnesses' critique of the model, will it ever be fit for purpose?</p></speech>

It could be done incrementally.  One could start with resourcing to try to reduce waiting times.  One could start with the areas of law that it covers.  One could start with the means test, which should be reviewed every year and expanded.  To be more realistic, there are more discrete things that could be done in following a path to examining the whole system.</p></speech>

I record our sincere thanks to all our witnesses.  This is the second of our series.  We are moving on next week, which is the final sitting of this year, and we will conclude our hearings on access to justice and legal costs.  Our final line-up will be Insurance Ireland, the State Claims Agency, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p> <p>  We will, hopefully early in the new year, publish our report with recommendations.  There will be a degree of jitteriness around here that we had better do it quickly or we might not do it at all because the whole place could collapse, so we will try to do it as early in 2020 as we can because do not want this work to be lost.  We will invite the witnesses back, if they are in a position to join us for that launch, to offer their opinions on the report and, very importantly, its recommendations.  I have no doubt that, in looking through their respective opening statements and the information they have shared with us today, they will see a lot of what they have reflected to us re-reflected in what we will be publishing ourselves.</p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses from Community Law and Mediation, who are also joined by a colleague in the Visitors Gallery, the Mercy Law Resource Centre and Trinity College Dublin school of law.  We would like to invite them to join us for a photograph for our book, and we do that as a matter of course.</p> <p>  We will launch our report on direct provision tomorrow in the audiovisual room at 11 a.m.  Robert Kennedy-Cochrane from the Oireachtas press office indicated he would like to do the group photograph, weather permitting, on the Plinth in advance of the launch of the report because it has proven very difficult to get people to stay on after an event.  If everyone agrees, I propose we meet at 10:45 a.m. tomorrow morning on the Plinth, for those who can do so. </p></speech>

They are accompanied by the following representatives from Hockey Ireland: Mr. Jerome Pels, Ms Lisa Jacob, Ms Sharon Hutchinson and Ms Fiona Hanaphy.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the team on its fantastic achievements.  Ireland was a finalist and silver medalist in the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup and recently qualified for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.  At a time when the committee is dealing with challenging times in Irish sport it is particularly refreshing and heartening to have a great news story to tell here today.  Hockey Ireland and, in particular, the women's hockey team should be very proud of their achievements nationally and on the world stage in recent years.  The recent qualification for the Tokyo Olympics in a heart-stopping penalty shoot out against Canada will go down as one of those famous &quot;the nation holds its breath&quot; moments for many years to come.  On behalf of the joint committee, I thank the team for bringing the country so much joy, happiness and pride once again.  Congratulations to you and we wish you every success, particularly at the Olympic Games in Tokyo.  Hopefully, you will be wearing gold medals when we will be welcoming you back here again.</p><p>We are holding hearings on the challenges facing minority sports and the participation of women in Irish sport.  We would like to hear from the athletes here today about the challenges they face each day participating in their sport.  We previously met with Rowing Ireland and it is our intention to meet with the governing bodies of other minority sports in the new year, particularly in the run up to the Olympic Games.</p><p>Before we begin I must inform you about privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We read that out to everybody.

That saves me reading the first paragraph of our presentation.  We thank the joint committee for inviting us to present on the challenges facing minority sports and to talk about women in sport in Ireland.  I will talk about the road we have travelled recently and highlight some of the opportunities and challenges facing us as a minority sport.</p> <p>  Hockey Ireland is the national governing body for the sport of hockey in Ireland, doing its work in all 32 counties of Ireland in leading and developing the sport.  Hockey Ireland in its current form was established in 2000 as a result of the merger of the two pre-existing unions which governed men's and women's hockey separately.  We are now joined as one organisation.  Both pre-existing unions originated in the 19th century, in 1893 for the men and 1894 for the women.  The men's Irish Senior Cup was first played for in the season of 1893&ndash;94, making it the oldest field hockey cup competition in the world and one of the oldest cups in sport in Ireland and perhaps in the world.  The sport's 150 clubs and 280 schools are affiliated to Hockey Ireland through its branch network.  The Irish Universities Hockey Association, which governs the sport in Ireland's university system, is also affiliated to Hockey Ireland.</p><p>We have a total of 26,351 registered players, 17,339 women and 9,012 men.  Masters hockey is growing fast and makes it a sport for life.  Hockey Ireland is funded through the following mechanisms: membership fees; grants from Sport Ireland, Sport Northern Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland; and partnerships with sponsors.  As is very particular to the minority sports we are not funded through TV revenues and receive only limited gate receipts.  From the point of view of women in sport, we currently boast a 65% female participation share.  However, there is much work to be done in other areas improving the female numbers.  We are focusing at present on the leaders in our sport; with programmes developing female coaches and umpires supported by the women in sport funding initiative.</p><p> In 2016, for the first time in over 100 years for Irish Hockey, the Irish men's team competed in an Olympic Games and finished tenth out of the 12 teams competing.  The year before, in 2015, the men stood on the podium with a bronze medal at the European Championships.  The Rio result was not what we had hoped for and we were disappointed, but the experience of the games was important, and it inspired hockey in Ireland.  In the evaluation after the games the lack of a proper high-performance structure in Hockey Ireland and uncertainty around funding were mentioned as factors affecting the result.  The men had to work or study and fundraise at the same time as preparing for the games.  Sport Ireland and Sport Northern Ireland funding improved significantly and has enabled Hockey Ireland to engage a full-time performance director, provide better support to the players and increase the number of times the national teams can train.  The new national sports policy is extremely encouraging for the athletes and will have a significant impact on sport in Ireland.  Sponsorship is growing but, compared with the funding we get from Government, still limited.</p><p> In August 2018, in London's Queen Elizabeth Park, the venue of the London games, the Irish women's hockey team won the silver medal at the International Hockey Federation, FIH, world cup.  It was the most successful result ever for a senior team sport in Ireland.  No doubt the team had risen to this level with far fewer resources and finances than most of the opposition, but it was proved that we can reach the highest level.  Although we are a minority sport, the sport became instantly mainstream in the media and the team was met with a hero's welcome in Dublin, where 10,000 fans came to see their heroes.  The viewing figures from RT&Eacute; showed an average of 381,500 people watching that game with a share of 41% of all TV viewers at that moment, which is a pretty good figure.</p><p> The success had an immediate result - clubs had an influx of new members, or now have waiting lists for new members, or people became interested in the sport but there was no club in their area or no room in the club.  To sustain the growth of the sport, Hockey Ireland has had to enhance its strategy to develop the sport at grassroots level with development officers, and more coaches and umpires.  Clubs need facilities to play the sport and investment in hockey pitches spread over Ireland is crucial.  The number of under-18s entering the sport has been growing steadily over the past eight years.  However, year on year, the number of adults playing the sport remains level or is declining slightly.  In our last session on future strategy we recognised changes in the way people spend their time and the influence lifestyle changes and new technology have.  Our competition structure may need to move with the times, to shorten the engagement with the sport, or find other ways to reduce the time commitment of playing hockey regularly.</p><p> To promote the game, our grassroots introduction to hockey programmes, the hockey skills challenge and tricks for sticks attracted more than 16,000 players this year, but, as has been said, the growth at club level is hampered by capacity problems, as well as instances of insufficient numbers of skilled volunteers and club leaders.  We are also proud of the development of para-hockey in Ireland, a format for hockey players with intellectual disabilities providing national and international competition in hockey.  The silver medal for the women's team was not the end goal, this was on the road to something bigger, namely the Olympic Games in Tokyo.  Last month, the Olympic qualification reached its climax in a two-game challenge, on goal aggregate, against Canada.  The men travelled to Vancouver and missed out due to a controversial video umpire decision in the last seconds of the second game, reducing their 6-5 lead to 6-6 on aggregate with Canada winning 5-4 in the penalty shoot-out.  The women played at home in Dublin.  Hockey Ireland knew the interest in the games would be big and we installed a hockey pitch over the existing rugby pitch in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook.  It was only the second time ever that this technology was used, and it worked even in the torrential rain during the first game.  After full time in the second match the score was 0-0 and it went to a penalty shoot-out.  Ireland made a poor start to the shoot-out and found itself trailing 3-1, with Canada just one goal away from snatching the Olympic dream.  Then the green army came back to win 4-3 when the shoot-out went to sudden death.  The match also saw a record number in attendance with 6,137 spectators going through the gates on Sunday and on Saturday there was a similar number, the biggest crowd ever for a women's international team event in Ireland.</p><p> Nicci Daly, one of the players, who is also with us today, told RT&Eacute; on the night: "It's everything.  The whole process, it's always for the Olympics.  We've come close in the past.  This is the dream.  This is everything to us. . . . and what a way to do it!"  Meanwhile, captain Katie Mullen said: "I'm just so incredibly proud of this bunch of players.  We have worked so hard, some of us have put in 10, 12 years, and it's also for all the players that have gone before us.  All those who committed so much of their lives to international hockey and never made it to an Olympics.  We are representing them.  I am so delighted!"</p><p> The challenge now, and one of the points we want to make here today is that we must do whatever we can to support our athletes to maintain the level that this group has now achieved.  We need to provide the athletes with world-class support and facilities and the ability for them to focus completely on their performance.  The inspiration that the hockey players are giving as role models for young girls to take up hockey, or any other sport, is significant.  It is a promotion for Ireland, it makes people feel national pride and it gets people moving and being healthier.  The Government's investment in the new hockey pitch at the Sport Ireland campus will help our preparations for the games significantly.  It is important to get fully conditioned to the surface the team will find in Tokyo.  As one of the few top teams we can now practise on a pitch built to the exact same Poligras Tokyo GT standards as the Olympic arena.  The facilities at the Sport Ireland Institute are world class and the envy of many nations.  The joint approach between the Olympic Federation of Ireland and Sport Ireland in preparing for the games is significant and professional.</p><p> For minority sports, the Olympic Games are hugely important and even more so for team sports.  We are guaranteed at least five games in the opening phase for the country to get behind the green army and based on the viewing figures of the Olympic qualification and 2018 FIH World Cup, the Irish public will be following the team on television in large numbers.  The particular challenge of minority sports is that the interest in the sport will be at its highest at the Olympic Games, but commercial opportunities are limited as no team advertising is allowed at the games.  However, the attention will be a huge driver for participation.</p><p> These are exciting times for Hockey Ireland but they are also challenging.  While we have the opportunity to speak, there are a few other points that we and probably all Irish sports NGBs want to bring to your attention.  First, NGBs are facing significantly increased costs in insurance, which unfortunately is money that we have to pay and cannot use for the development of the sport.  Second, there may be ways of supporting the governing bodies by looking at the VAT regime for sport.  Some of our expenses - and this, for instance, was highly relevant when hosting the Olympic qualifiers - are subject to VAT that we cannot recover.  Finally, we get increased support from the commercial sector in the form of sponsorship but there is also significant interest in supporting the game at all levels through charitable donations and it would be great if tax benefits around such schemes could support the charitable activities of the federations.</p><p> I would like to hand over to Ms Lisa Jacob, a member of the board, who will finish our presentation with the board's perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lisa Jacob" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121100002#F00200"><p>As a member of the Hockey Ireland board, I would like to take a little time to give the committee an insight into the current position in which the sport of hockey finds itself, the key challenges it faces and the broad strategic direction the board is proposing to take over the next three to five years.  I propose to speak to three key areas that together take up a significant part of the board&rsquo;s time and resources.  These areas broadly map to many of the key areas set out in the recent National Sports Policy 2018-2027.  The three areas I will focus on are governance; structures; and strategy, with particular reference to participation and development.</p> <p>  It is important to record that Hockey Ireland&rsquo;s approach to governance is led and informed by the principles of good governance as outlined in the governance code for the community, voluntary and charity, CVC, sector.  The board has a governance subcommittee which, on a "comply or explain" basis, monitors, reviews and updates or develops policies and other by-laws on an ongoing basis to meet the ever changing needs of the sport and its membership.  In fact, over the past 18 months the subcommittee has successfully completed a comprehensive update of the organisation's by-laws and policy documentation.  Governance is a regular item on board meeting agendas triggered by update reports from the subcommittee.  Our approach to governance also includes a new method for sourcing and recruiting members to the board.  We aspire to gender equality and look to provide a positive role model to our provinces and clubs in this regard.  This is evidenced by the fact that our 12-person board had until very recently a 50:50 gender split.  We believe we were one of the few sporting boards to achieve this level of equality.  However, due to the recent loss of one of our female board members, we currently have a 7:5 male to female split.  This still falls above the minimum best practice target of 40% which is set, for example, for State boards.  The presidency of Hockey Ireland, which rotates between the four provinces, also looks to ensure, where possible, that there is a gender rotation through each new presidential term.</p> <p>  On structures, Hockey Ireland has recently rolled out and implemented the first comprehensive database of its membership.  The introduction of this type of information system was a strategic priority in our last strategy and when fully operational will provide invaluable feedback that can be used for the benefit of the entire membership.  While there are a few outstanding gaps - namely umpires, schools, third level, and masters players to be added - the next big cohort of the hockey family to be accommodated is our volunteers, the lifeblood of the organisation on a day-to-day basis.  Members of Hockey Ireland are currently catered for through membership of their respective clubs which, in turn, are affiliated to their respective province.  The new database will help to link these members more closely to the national body and at the same time will provide the clubs and provinces with easy access to additional information such as lists of members with skill-sets such as coaching qualifications, umpire accreditation and administrative experience.</p> <p>  On strategy, Hockey Ireland caters for the hockey community on an all-island basis. This bring significant advantages but also adds a degree of complexity to the administrative process required to manage the sport across two different jurisdictions.  As with any sport there are areas of greater club and player density.  These are driven partly by an urban-rural divide but are also an artefact of the manner in which the sport was first introduced into the country over a hundred years ago.  From a board perspective this presents a significant opportunity as there are communities within both the urban and rural areas that are keenly interested in developing sport and in particular the sport of hockey.  The recent successes of the national senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s teams has served to create a positive impression of a sport that can be played throughout one&rsquo;s lifetime.  The men&rsquo;s participation at the Rio Olympics, the women&rsquo;s silver medal performance at the world cup and subsequent qualification for the Tokyo Olympic Games have provided exemplary roles models for the younger generations.  Hockey as a sport caters equally to both genders and all ages, from 4 years to 80 years plus, as evidenced at a recent masters hockey tournament.  As Mr. Pels said, it is also important to note that the sport of parahockey is continuing to grow and provides, through the club system, the opportunity for individuals with intellectual difficulties to participate and enjoy the camaraderie and health benefits of the sport.  The current public profile of the sport was brought to a crescendo at the Olympic qualifier tournament, held in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook at the start of November this year.  While the success of the women&rsquo;s team in such a nail biting finish was fantastic, the fact that over 12,200 people attended over the two nights of the weekend showed that interest in the sport was at an all-time high.</p> <p>  While perceived as expensive, hockey is at its most basic level a relatively inexpensive activity.  In essence, there are only three requirements to get a community up and running to get started in the sport; a playing surface, hockey sticks and balls and a coach with an understanding of the basic skills of the game.  The provision of the equipment has an easy solution that Hockey Ireland and the clubs and provinces can provide if appropriately supported.  The two challenges are the sourcing, training and certification of an adequate number of coaches and volunteers and also finding suitable areas for playing and practising.  It is interesting to note that currently a group of 60 girls practise and play regularly on a GAA pitch in Waterford.  We also have a number of examples of schools and community groups, sometimes in conjunction with their local sports partnerships, LSPs, and hockey clubs, taking up indoor hockey in local halls.  Ireland did in the recent past have quite a number of clubs and players playing indoor hockey.  This is an area that Hockey Ireland sees as a potential opportunity for developing the game and introducing it to new community groups of all ages.  Another creative initiative that started relatively recently is the concept of hockey for mums and hockey for dads.  Innovative clubs decided to provide the opportunity for parents to learn and play hockey, at their level, while waiting for their children to complete their training and practice sessions.  In some instances up to 60 adults availed of the chance to try the sport out and as a result started to get more embedded in the clubs and sport as a whole.  Most parishes across the country have access to an indoor hall that can be easily set up to accommodate hockey, thereby subverting the immediate need for expensive outdoor facilities to be developed.</p> <p>  The board of Hockey Ireland recently held a full-day session to finalise the strategic pillars for the sport over the next three to five years.  We were joined that day by representatives from Sport Ireland; the Olympic Federation of Ireland; members of the current senior men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s squads; a representative from our junior age group, JAG, teams; people representing the four provinces; Hockey Ireland staff; and, Hockey Ireland's European Hockey Federation representative.  Participation and development was one of the pillars that everyone agreed was key to our strategic development as a sport.  In fleshing out the pillar we called out the need to expand the geographic footprint of the sport, increase the number of players at all levels and all ages and broaden the number and skills of volunteers who are involved in hockey, be they coaches, umpires or administrators.  The consensus was that the main means that will help us to achieve this are collaboration with other sports organisations, local sports partnerships, schools and colleges and local communities, whereby they will provide the people resources be they players or volunteers and Hockey Ireland and the LSPs will work to provide the expertise and infrastructure to allow things to happen.  As an organisation and community, we believe we have much to contribute to a healthy and inspired Ireland.  We thank the Chairman and committee for their time and for affording us the opportunity to meet with them today.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have them here and we want, if the representatives feel happy enough, for everybody who wishes to contribute to do so at any stage.  Normally we invite the members to ask questions in rotation.  Everyone is welcome to participate and give us their views.  The presentations have been most enlightening and the clarity of the analysis of Hockey Ireland's future needs is welcome.  When this meeting is over, both the Minister, Deputy Ross, and Sport Ireland will get a copy of the whole discussion.  Hopefully it will be acted on and the points witnesses have highlighted will be noted.  I call Deputy Rock first, to be followed by Deputy O'Keeffe.</p></speech>

It is refreshing to be discussing positive matters on sport and sport being on the back page rather than the front page.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions as players and for their diligent administrative work as well.  Ms Jacob's contribution regarding governance was refreshing.  It is important there is good governance in all of our sporting organisations.</p> <p>  Mr. Pels spoke about needs.  It is clear that hockey is developing and growing and that new resources are being provided, including a new pitch recently opened on the Sport Ireland Campus, and all are very welcome.  As stated by the Chairman, the Minister will be provided with a transcript of this discussion.  What is the one overarching need that Mr. Pels believes, if delivered, would make the biggest difference to hockey going forward?  It is clear that this is a crucial time for the sport.</p></speech>

We have been assured that in light of the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo, those needs will be addressed.  We expect to be advised of our budget going forward very soon.  Deputy Rock mentioned that the successes have been great.  The follow-up on high performance has been pretty good as well but growth in the sport presents us with some challenges.  The success is inspiring many people to take up the sport but we have noted some barriers in this regard at grassroots level.  It will take some time to catch-up in terms of training sufficient numbers of our volunteers to provide the coaching to enable that growth.  We cannot say too much about what the Minister, Deputy Ross, is doing because we have not yet heard from Sport Ireland what our allocation will be for next year.  We cannot move on that work until we know the budget.</p></speech>

Mr. Pels highlighted a particular issue in his opening statement that Senator Richmond, who keeps me informed on all matters hockey related, raised with me in a private conversation a number of months ago, namely, the remarkable process of installing a hockey pitch over the existing rugby pitch in the Energia Stadium in Donnybrook and that being only the second time that it had been undertaken.  Will Mr. Pels elaborate on the nuts and bolts of that process, which I understand resulted in the saving of a considerable amount of money?</p></speech>

This means we cannot play in all stadia.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, we knew from the reaction within not only the hockey community but the community at large that many people were interested in watching the women's hockey team play on Irish soil.  As we currently do not have a hockey stadium with sufficient capacity to enable it, in co-operation with Leinster Rugby we were able to lay a temporary surface over the existing surface at the Energia Stadium, where the match was played in front of a very large crowd.  This technology was developed by a hockey pitch manufacturer and England Hockey working with people on the base layer and coming together to form the organisation Big Stadium Hockey.  They are trying to repeat the use of this technology everywhere in Europe.  We benefited from that technology in terms of being able to roll out a hockey carpet at the Energia Stadium.</p></speech>

It has already found another home in the UK.  The surface - the base-layer - which is a type of plastic carpet, can be used in construction and it is being reused as well.  We do not own the equipment.  The equipment was used by us and it will be reused, with the base-layer used in construction, and the pitch being used elsewhere as a hockey pitch.</p></speech>

In regard to the large attendance at the Energia Stadium, I presume Hockey Ireland would like to replicate that into the future.  Is it a long-term objective of the organisation to have its own stadium going forward?</p></speech>

We have to be aware that these were unique circumstances.  It is important to the development of the game that we have a place where we can host games.  We have some excellent hockey pitches in Ireland, one of the best being at the Sport Ireland Campus, but the campus does not have any permanent stands.  It is possible for people to watch a game, but only by standing around the pitch because there is no seating area.  To repeat that large attendance regularly, we would require a permanent seating facility.  We do not want to argue for a massive facility that would only be used every five years and so on.  We need to find a compromise in terms of the right size facility.</p></speech>

In recent years, in particular the past two years, there has been massive progress in the recognition of the sport in this country.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has no problem offering money to sports organisations following their successes abroad, as happened last year.  I wish the women's hockey team all the best in its endeavours to qualify for the Olympics next year.  The nearest hockey club to where I live is in Fermoy.  My sister was an avid player in the club in Fermoy in north Cork.  There are many other big clubs in Cork city.  I hope that the additional funding being provided to communities for all-weather surfaces under the sports capital grants programme will help to progress involvement in hockey in the communities.  I note the game is played on a particular surface but I am sure the players can adapt to the surfaces in the communities until such time as the required surfaces are put in place.</p> <p>  Reference was made to funding and the possibility of organisations with charitable status being able to obtain tax relief in respect of their donations to clubs.  I thought the issue of companies making donations to sporting organisations had been resolved.  Perhaps the Chairman would clarify if that is the case.</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier, the Olympics is always the end goal.  To qualify to compete at the Olympics, Irish teams compete against teams that are 100% funded and professional in some instances.  For us, it is always about trying to bridge that gap.</p><p>Over the past year and a half, the committee has seen that we are bridging the gap as players.  The funding coming in now since the world cup has been brilliant in allowing us to turn semi-professional in a sense, but challenges are still there for players every day.  They have to go to work or college and are trying to train in a professional environment.  The programme in place for 2020 has allowed us to come together a lot more, but we must sacrifice how we live on a day-to-day basis to do that.  Our need involves making that commitment a bit easier for the players and turning it into a more professional set-up.  The long term should be in sight.  Whatever we will achieve in the next couple of years, it is about the grassroots and the girls coming in behind us so that we do not just have a structure for the next year or the next two years but one that will allow the younger teams to carry on and achieve what we will have achieved.</p></speech>

It has been fantastic for the growth of the sport over the past couple of years.  A traditionally minority sport, hockey has been riding on the crest of a wave.  It is now about taking the opportunity with both hands and being able to develop those structures underneath it so that we can ensure the longevity of the sport and put those structures in place to allow the sport to grow.  The successes, including the number of people taking up the sport around the country, have been great.  As players, it is something in which we take a lot of pride.</p> <p>  Inspiring the next generation has been fantastic for us but in the short term, as Ms Daly said, the Olympics represent the pinnacle of our sport.  The world cup was a bonus - a fantastic bonus - but it was always about the Olympics.  Qualifying for the Olympics was another step in the process for us.  We do not want to just turn up for the Olympics to make up the numbers.  We are looking to medal at the Olympics, which is set to be the hottest Olympics on record, so planning and preparing in the next couple of months to play eight games in 14 days will be hugely demanding for us.  We are hoping for anything that can alleviate the external stress for us and allow us to concentrate on the training while we are competing against full-time programmes so that we can bring home another medal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121100002#H00400"><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I had some conversations with some of them in advance of the meeting.  It is to be hoped they will have continued success.  I do not think they put down that they won team of the year at the sports awards last year as well, which was another achievement.  I thank them for the opening statement.  There are things about the organisation that I had not realised, so it is very useful to get that context.  It would be very useful if the briefing document was included with the report that goes to Sport Ireland and the Minister because I found that very useful.  There would have been some questions that are answered in this so I thank the witnesses for pre-empting the questions in terms of how one breaks down the various provinces.  It is quite useful to benchmark that into the future regarding where the growth is.  It is nice to have that set as a base.</p> <p>  The all-Ireland aspect is very interesting.  It would be quite interesting to hear something about that such as how well that works.  Why would Hockey Ireland not get TV revenues if they are available?  Can something be done about this?  That is one of the dominant forms of income in some of the bigger sports where gate receipts are becoming a more diminished aspect of funding.  It would be interesting to see what is possible there and how that might work.</p> <p>  The success of the team has been a shop window for others to get involved.  I am not surprised that there was an upsurge after that.  That kind of mainstream coverage of the events is critically important.  It is quite amazing how women's sports tend to be the under-represented sports, but when they are put out there in a shop window, they are equally attractive.  There is a lesson there for people who are programming to make sure they are properly covered.</p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to ask about is VAT in sport.  Will the witnesses send us a note about the shortcomings and what could improve that?  Obviously, there is a differentiation between commercial sports played at professional level from which there is an income and the other side of it where people who are playing are trying to hold down jobs and fundraise at the same time.</p> <p>  I was really pleased to see attention paid to the governance - the boring governance aspect.  It will remain boring as long as it is done right.  When it is done properly, the focus ends up being on the sport itself and not on issues that are about failures in terms of administration.</p></speech>

I also asked about TV revenues.  That might relate to the administrative side of things in respect of potential for funding into the future.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be an all-Ireland team.  It does not matter what part of the country someone is from - Munster, Leinster or Ulster.  It is certainly not something we have spoken about as a team or something we think about too much.  Regarding the opportunities it could open up, again, it is not something that has occurred to us as players.  We usually concentrate on getting our training sessions in so, again, I do not really know how I can comment on that.</p></speech>

As a recent past player, I spent two of my years living with the "nordies", as we call them.  I must say that it was a fantastic experience.  I spent most of my childhood watching bits about the Troubles.  It is not until one lives with somebody that one gets to understand what one sees on television and somebody's real life.  Regarding coming together with people from all over the country, each region has a unique nature and something it brings to an all-Ireland team.  When the Deputy speaks about an all-Ireland team, for me, it is a huge strength and one I really enjoyed when I played.  There is representation from everywhere on our board.  We need different perspectives.  They make things stronger.  Mr. Pels might speak about TV rights.  As far as I am aware, the International Hockey Federation has TV rights so it would have done deals with RT&Eacute;.  We do not have access to anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.970" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerome Pels" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121100002#H01000"><p>The television rights for the games the national team plays are not held by the national governing body.  If it is a European championship, the rights would be held by the European governing body and if it is on world level, the rights are held to the world governing body.  In the case of the Olympic Games, the television revenues to go the International Olympic Committee.  Some of the money from the International Olympic Committee comes back.  We have benefited from a grant of about $100,000 over the past four years that came from Olympic Solidarity through the Olympic Federation of Ireland, so there is some benefit there.  To develop the sport, we should make our national competitions stronger.</p><p>Games take place almost every weekend in the Irish hockey league sponsored by EY.  Drawing from the lessons learned in other strong hockey nations, we need to grow the league and grow public interest in it.  Hockey Ireland would be able to sell television rights for the games if we can get the interest of viewers.  That would mean that the clubs involved would be able to get more sponsors and provide professional club hockey, which would strengthen the sport significantly.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-11a.973" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerome Pels" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019121100002#J00300"><p>Unfortunately, the fees the FIH or EHF get from television rights are not very high.  The first thing they need to pay out of the fees is the cost of production.  We are not party to the contract for our Olympic qualifier in Donnybrook.  It was run between the FIH and RT&Eacute; and we believe the revenue covered the cost of production, including camera crews and other technical aspects.  The FIH has been investing significantly in television production but it is not a profit-making situation, although it could be if the game becomes more popular.  For example, cricket generates significant television rights that then come back to the national federations.  The money generated at international level flows back to national level.  The fees for hockey are not yet at that level.</p></speech>

It is the first Irish team to reach a world cup final.  I watched the final, as most members probably did, or at least the highlights thereof.  It was a significant boost for women and women's sport as well as for hockey.  Women's participation in sport is the overarching theme of this meeting.  Some of the greatest figures in sport in Ireland currently are women.  I refer to Katie Taylor and Kelly Harrington who have reached the top of their sport, as well as Ellen Keane who competes in swimming in the Paralympics.  Without question, women who participate in sport can achieve at the highest level internationally.  The Irish women's cricket team has also performed very well.</p> <p>  The issue of television rights and coverage has been raised.  A survey carried out in the past year or two indicates that 12% of sports coverage comprises women's sport.  I was surprised the figure was that high.  Coverage online is between 3% and 4%.  The survey found that 58% of men and 64% thought there should be more coverage of women's sport.  Obviously, far more men than women think there is enough coverage of women's sport.  The standard argument is that if there is audience demand, the coverage will be offered.  It is a case of putting the cart before the horse.  The argument about audience and achievement is rendered meaningless by the US women's soccer team, which is more successful and draws bigger crowds than the US men's soccer team.  As members will be aware, chants demanding equal pay broke out throughout the stadium at the final of the women's soccer world cup.  They are pioneers on equal pay.  Usually, women in sport just look for something a bit better.  For example,the Irish women's soccer team was not looking for equal pay but, rather, for the players to be given tracksuits of their own.  The Irish women's hockey team has definitely added to the empowerment of women in sport.</p> <p>  I was interested in Ms Jacob's comment on hockey not being expensive.  I totally agree that one can play hockey without too much expense.  However, there is a class element to hockey relating to the schools in which it is played.  For example, I went to an all-girls school where one could play basketball but not hockey, whereas the boarding school next door offered hockey.  What is the reason for that class element?  Why does it persist?  It should be examined because the more people who play a sport, the better it will be.  I do not blame anyone involved in hockey for the class element but, rather, point out that we should examine it because there would be a higher participation rate if it was offered more widely.  Similarly, it is not expensive to study ballet.  It is less expensive to take ballet lessons than Irish dancing lessons but there is a certain elitism that persists in that regard.  </p> <p>  I again congratulate the team on its achievement.</p></speech>

I grew up in Tallaght and played hockey from the age of six.  Hockey has reached areas outside the private schools.  My club's pitch was funded through local partnerships and various sports capital grants.  The club has been there for 40 years, although it may have shifted locations.  Hockey is played outside private schools and is thriving in some areas where one may not expect it to be played.  I fully acknowledge the point made by the Deputy regarding the perception, but there is significant growth of hockey at grassroots level outside its traditional areas.</p> <p>  On women in sport, I was at the match in Donnybrook.  A young girl there wanted to get a player to sign the back of her jersey.  One of the men's high-performance team offered to sign it but the girl told him she did not have space as she only wanted the names of women players on her shirt.  That is how women in sport is developing.  There is fantastic growth at grassroots level. If one cannot see it, one cannot be it.  I thought that girl's attitude was fantastic.</p></speech>

That may be something at which Hockey Ireland must look.  We should market ourselves better to counter the perception that the sport is only played in boarding schools, as the Deputy stated.  As an organisation, we may need to show the other areas of the country where the sport is played.  It is not just played in girls boarding schools in Dublin.  It is not sufficiently widespread.  Hockey is not being played in every county, but people would be surprised by some of the areas in which it is being played.</p></speech>

Investing in grassroots development is of importance.  I was involved in certain programmes such as Tricks 4 Sticks and speaking to teachers in schools that are not predominantly hockey schools.  Many of them are physical education teachers who may come from a hurling or other background and are trying to do their best to show the students hockey.  Increasing that kind of grassroots level activity, with more volunteers and coaches, would allow schools that may be outside the Dublin area to grow the sport.  Several new clubs have opened in Munster in recent months, which is great to see.</p><p>As Ms Evans said, our going to Tokyo is huge but ten years into the future, I would like to see a stadium such as Donnybrook filled four, five or six times a year with women's international hockey matches.  It is about investing at grassroots level to build the sport so that in ten years we will be in a much better place than we are now.</p></speech>

We find teachers are keen to offer a varied programme of sports activities.  Particularly as there is greater diversity, the standard sports are not necessarily the most attractive to all.  They are looking at any kind of sport that is coming in.  There are great opportunities to do six-week blocks or the one week active camp.  Hockey seems to be quite popular because it can be played in halls, no matter the weather, with just a few balls.  It is very attractive and teachers can learn it quickly to make it interesting.  They do not need a great background in it to provide for an interesting 40-minute session in the school.  It is easy to deliver but we need the people to deliver it as we cannot get around all the schools.</p></speech>

One would think that surely if we are good at hurling, we would be good at hockey because it is about hand-eye co-ordination.  We were also good at cricket in the 1800s.  Hockey can only get better the more people who play it.  We could achieve even more.  Well done again to the team.</p></speech>

For all of us who are passionate about sport, these were two special moments with the team's qualification for the world cup when no one expected it, breaking the glass ceiling, and there was the Sunday night some months ago in the terrible weather during dramatic circumstances which were incredible.  Watching the team's sheer joy in its celebrations on the pitch afterwards brought a smile to the nation.  For many years, I have said that sport can do that and no other sector can - certainly politics cannot anyway.  The agonising defeat of the men the previous week showed how thin a line there is between victory and defeat.  It can be millimetres between agony and ecstasy.  Today's presentation has mentioned governance and so on.  The team is on a wonderful journey.  Ironically, it had to make its own success before the goodwill came, and the acknowledgement and the recognition, but that makes it all the sweeter.  The narrow dramatic victories in shoot-outs, after going 3-1 down, is heaven on earth.  Well done to the team on that.</p> <p>  I will not cover the question of TV rights again.  The reaction to the team's success and its uplift has been mentioned.  The figures are before me.  I am from Connacht where there are only nine clubs.  Was there an uplift or have any new clubs been formed in the provinces as a result?  The idea that there is a sustainable future with underage teams has been mentioned.  Are there international underage competitions for development squads?  </p> <p>  The increasing cost of insurance was mentioned.  That is a very topical issue in every aspect of life.  The solutions are not easy to find.  What has been Hockey Ireland's experience?  Has the cost increased dramatically in recent years and if so, how?  </p></speech>

We have identified Connacht as an area where we are particularly short of facilities.  Once we finish our strategic plan and go to implementation, Connacht will be the first place where we need to identify partnerships.  There is the same interest in Connacht following the girls' success as anywhere so we need to start there and help them identify partnerships such as identifying indoor facilities that those who are there already can use until we have the outdoor facilities that we need.  They are a passionate group with a new committee in place for the past couple of months.  It has been very proactive in linking in with Hockey Ireland.  Hopefully things will go well from there.</p> <p>  I have coached the junior age groups in recent years.  Hockey has under 16, under 18, under 21 and, depending on the year, under 23 competitions or development team action.  Across Europe, especially, every nation is at it.  They are all looking at the pipeline and being very intentional about how to attract the players of the future.  We must do what we can to keep up.  There are many volunteer coaches who give up 30 to 35 days of their year to prepare those teams.  People are travelling to train.  They have been so inspired by the girls and by the men over the past four years and they are excited to be in the pipeline.  It means that we know there is a good future ahead and we have some input into that.</p></speech>

It mainly relates to our liability insurance.  Organising the event at the Energia stadium was an experience.  We underestimated how much insurance would be in our budget, but one just learns.  As a condition of the use of the stadium, we needed to have certain levels of insurance, public liability, and the figures involved are significant.</p> <p>  Returning to Connacht, the other good news is that we have just appointed a development officer in association with the university.  Hopefully that will help the clubs and the development of sport in the area.  </p></speech>

Being an Olympian is an honour bestowed on very few, no matter what the result.  I am delighted to hear of a hockey team using a GAA pitch.  It is not something that is provided for in the rules of the association.  Kenmare had a hockey team for a while, which used a synthetic grass pitch, which was okay because it is only a training pitch so that is within the rules of the association.</p><p>We have bendable rules in the GAA at times in Kerry.  We actually had London Irish playing on the pitch at one stage in 2001.  The whole committee almost got hung, drawn and quartered for that particular outing.</p><p> I wanted to ask a question on pensions.  This is relevant for rowing too and I note Sanita Puspure, who is one of our Olympians as well, was before the committee previously.  She pointed out that her pension contribution, like that of many others, will not be at its maximum level.  Her pension is not being assisted by the State.  This is a really technical point.  Is there anything Hockey Ireland would like members to say on its behalf to the Minister on that point when he is before the committee next week?  While no one on the deputation is near pension age, it is something that affects many minority sports people and others playing sports, including rugby and soccer.  It affects them because they are unable to contribute.  Nothing is being put in on their behalf by the State.  That is something we should address.</p><p> Another point relates to passports.  This is a bugbear of mine.  We had this with Cricket Ireland as well.  I was trying to get clarification on this for Hockey Ireland.  There are approximately 64 all-Ireland sports teams and associations.  My view is that no one should be required to have a particular passport when playing in Ireland.  It is a requirement in cricket.  It is not a requirement of Cricket Ireland but of the European Cricket Council.  A player must have a passport of the country for whom he is playing.  Obviously, given our unique circumstances, I do not believe that should be a requirement in Ireland.  Again, that may be an argument this committee could make on behalf of hockey players.  Identity is a major issue and we do not want it to be an issue for someone playing for the team.</p><p> The Minister is coming before the committee next week.  Thankfully, it is not because of the hockey players or their association.  Is there something Hockey Ireland would like us to say to the Minister?  He made an announcement of &euro;1 million.  That was somewhat overstating the case.  What share of that has Hockey Ireland seen?  What share does the association require?  Having done quite a public relations job for himself on that occasion, the Minister deserves to have to deliver on his fine words and promise.  Is the cheque still in the post?  What cheque should we be asking him for next week?</p></speech>

That would be a good point to look into.</p> <p>  The question of passports is interesting.  I need to say this right.  The passport question is important because of the rules that govern international representative teams.  The rules are in place to protect us because otherwise many countries would basically shop for talent.  The passport rule in the world of sport is recognised as being a good rule.  Even internationally and at International Olympic Committee level there are rules and stipulations to the effect that a person cannot change passport at the drop of a hat.  There is a four-year waiting time.  That is to ensure people do not simply go to the country that pays the most or offers other benefits.  In that sense the rule helps.</p> <p>  I wish to be clear: to play hockey at national level - to play for a club - there is no requirement for passports, so there is no concern about that.  In fact, that is a regular occurrence in our sport.  We have Irish players who play in Europe at club level.  They are playing for different clubs in national competitions.  In theory, a person of any nationality could play for clubs in Ireland as well.  When a player represents a country, the passport becomes an issue or is subject to the rule.</p></speech>

I do not think it should be an issue.  This is a unique situation so I do not believe it should be required.  It would be a tragedy if someone decided not to take up the passport because of an issue.  I do not think players should be required to do so in this situation.</p></speech>

Cricket Ireland does not want the requirement.  It is something that perhaps the committee should consider for the other 64 bodies.  Parent bodies have different rules and regulations.  The requirement to have an Irish passport to play for the Irish hockey team should not apply because of the unique circumstances in Ireland.  We should make that point on behalf of the other associations.</p></speech>

Much has been said already and I do not intend to repeat any questions.  I want to pick up on some points made in the opening statement and flesh them out.</p> <p>  The first point arises from an infrastructural point of view.  How many employees does Hockey Ireland have?  What is the aspiration when it comes to development officers?  People have talked about broadening the sport in places like Connacht or in the wider society.  However, we have seen from other sports the importance of development officers and co-ordinating with physical education teachers who want to bring in the sport and work with local sports partnerships.  What is the strategy for rolling out, as Dublin GAA did for hurling and camogie ten or 20 years ago?  How can that be replicated?</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe touched on infrastructure and pitch access.  It is great to hear about the new clubs in Tipperary working with facilities in Waterford but hockey pitches are expensive.  I am not only talking about the national stadium, UCD or the temporary pitch that was so brilliantly used by the Irish hockey team in Energia Park.  I have in mind the standard pitch that will run through the day as well.  My constituency is something of a hotbed for hockey.  Two clubs have a waiting list for every girls team from junior infants up to under-16 level.  That is simply because there is insufficient pitch time.  I have spoken to people playing hockey in Australia.  They say they have training sessions at 11 p.m. or midnight.  That may be because it is 40oC during the day but it is a matter of being inventive, as well as being cognisant of planning conditions that only allow floodlights to be on until 10 p.m.</p> <p>  The final point has been brushed on briefly by everyone.  It relates specifically to the current players and concern about player welfare.  It is not a professional sport.  How does a player balance becoming an Olympian and playing at elite level with a day job or college?  What is involved in the average day?  What support do the players get from Hockey Ireland?  What if the employer is not sympathetic?  What about family members?  The Hockey Ireland representatives referred to the goal for the hockey league and television rights or aspirations to be online.  Many players have been playing abroad recently, including those on the Irish team.  They have played on the Continent or under collegiate system in the USA.  I assume the aspiration, like other sports, is to have every Irish international playing in Ireland around the clock.  How can that be achieved?  What is afoot to try to achieve that?</p></speech>

Out of that group we have 4.5 people working in development.  Senator Richmond referred to development officers or coach education and that area.</p></speech>

It has been mentioned that mainstream sports can make revenue from television and gate money.  GAA, football and rugby invest a great deal of money back into their sports.  The numbers of development officers in those sports are far beyond what we do.  In the context of smaller sports we are doing a relatively good job.  As an all-Ireland sport, we benefit from our Ulster branch, which is well supported as well.  That gives us an additional resource.</p> <p>  Senator Richmond commented on the high cost of hockey pitches.</p><p>We know that is just a fact.  There is an opportunity to play indoor hockey, which would mean we could use existing facilities.  We are definitely looking at that with our development strategy.  That could be an introduction into the sport because it is an aspect of our sport.</p><p> I will defer to the players on the question of the support level for the athletes.</p></speech>

I played abroad for one year and Ms Nicola Daly played abroad for two years.  In college, balancing life and hockey is okay but once players come into the real world it is certainly more difficult and they become more aware of how their peers are progressing at a different level in their career.  Following the success in the World Cup and with help from Park Developments, SoftCo and Sport Ireland, we have been able to become a bit more semi-professional since July.  That has been a major driver in getting players to return home.  Five of us were playing abroad last year and we are all back in Ireland now playing on a semi-professional basis.</p> <p>  Regarding balancing with work, I have recently started working in a job two days a week.  The coverage we have got over the past two years has made companies and employers buy into our story and they allow us a bit more flexibility.  Although we are incredibly grateful for all the support, we still need to work for a couple of days a week in order to get by.  There are challenges to it but we do not really think about it as a sacrifice as such; it is our choice.  We want to play for our country and we also want to progress in our career.</p> <p>  It is a little daunting.  While Ms Lisa Jacob is a little older than I am, we are all coming to the end of our careers in the next four-year cycle.  It can be a bit daunting to progress on if one does not have anything set up.  The main point is that we are all grateful that we have all been able to move home and really concentrate on playing here.  It is better for us all to be training here than abroad.</p></speech>

Players tend to go outside the country to play at a higher standard.  If we can keep the players in Ireland, it helps to grow the sport at grassroots and improve our club structure.  If we can make that sustainable, we can keep the players here.  When trying to balance college or a job with hockey playing, it is not really sustainable.  We have been doing it for the past ten years and it is not ideal.</p> <p>  We were asked about pensions.  I had not even thought about that.  I just thought after I finished playing hockey I would have to work for an extra ten years to make up for it.  However, it is something to think about.  Players are inclined to focus just on the sport.  Someone either becomes a sportsperson and that is one's job and one receives the benefit of it being one's job or one focuses on one's career.  At the moment we are in limbo between the two.  We are trying to be full-time athletes while also trying to build our careers.  It is probably not sustainable for the next generation coming through if we are to continue to be successful.</p></speech>

A sub-committee of the board works on the development of grassroots participation.   When we do things like going to schools or do Tricks 4 Sticks programmes, I come across an inability to break through some of these invisible walls that prevent us from availing of facilities.  I will give an example.  Considerable money was put into laying 4G and 5G pitches.  If a 3G pitch is put down, it is suddenly available to hockey.  An awful lot of money is put into these pitches that might cost &euro;180,000 or whatever when a little extra money might allow more sports to use these pitches.</p> <p>  I make this request of the committee.  In all conversations and meetings that take place, some thought should be given to leveraging off AstroTurf and other all-weather facilities to make some of them hockey pitches as well as pitches for other sports.  I do not know if that is ever addressed anywhere.  We can only do so much.  There are hockey pitches, 4G pitches and 5G pitches.  It is about opening up and accessing existing facilities. </p></speech>

One might say that soccer, hockey, rugby, Gaelic football and hurling are competing sports.  However, within each of those sports, women are being treated unequally for facilities, training time, pitch access etc. to the point where women often have to use inferior pitches.  Is that something the women's hockey players are coming across?  It is not just because an existing sporting organisation has facilities which seem to be empty.  Some organisations are not making them available to women, which shows the inequality women are facing in sports.  There is no requirement on organisations that are given money.  We got around the London Irish one by saying that because we got lottery funding we would have to allow them on the pitch as long as they did not bring a ball and suddenly a ball appeared.  However, there is discrimination against women within their own sports.  Does it happen in hockey where the men's association might have control over a pitch limiting women's access?</p></speech>

Time is normally allocated on Sundays for juniors.  There would want to be a really good reason to take off a junior match to play a senior match.  We are very good that way, but we really struggle with assets and opening up in general term, as happens in other countries.  If a municipal facility is provided, it should be made available to all sports.</p></speech>

I remember playing a cricket match in Ballyclare, where the facility catered for cricket, tennis, hockey, rugby and football.  It was unique because it was the only sports ground in the town.  Should we be looking at that across all sports and not just specific to hockey.</p></speech>

That was a welcome move at the time.  Has that been an incentive if a club is looking for a grant and can point to hockey and other sports using it?  I am conscious about what Senator Mark Daly said about the GAA.  Many barriers have been broken down in recent years, although not all of them.</p></speech>

Clubs tend to make the grant applications and they provide matching funding.  They are looking at it from their own sports' perspective.  I am not sure if they would all give consideration to the wider aspect.  For example, in many cases all-weather pitches provide the income that keep clubs going.  If they understood the change in the specification they may be very keen to embrace it.  How can the hockey association get that information to clubs making the application?</p><p>Does it come through guidance on the sports capital grants?  Does it arise from the various federations talking to each other?</p></speech>

I know from that club that our pitch is used by non-hockey sports for 60% to 65% of the time.  The demand is just from the area we are in.  It is very hard to get pitch time.  Many clubs are renting their pitches to anybody, which is fantastic.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could ask them to outline their proposals for the Government on Sport Ireland and pensions for high-performance athletes and Olympians.  I have heard about pensions from the rowers and everybody else.  Collectively, there are a lot of people involved.  We should have an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer and make a proposal for the Government.  All parties are producing their election manifestos and this is an Olympic year.  I am not telling anyone how to do their job but maybe the parties should be asked to include what I propose in their election manifestos.</p></speech>

The witnesses are very welcome.  We are very proud.  I do not want to repeat what everybody else has said.  I understand the witnesses spoke of an all-island hockey team.  A little over two years ago, we were very anxious to have an all-island hockey team &mdash; it was a men's team &mdash; competing in the Commonwealth Games.  We went a long way towards it.  We would have to agree to embrace Ireland&ndash;Britain relationships.  It would be opportune to have an all-island hockey team.  I wish those present every success in the Olympic Games.  An all-island team is an option.  There is no better sport than hockey with which to achieve this.  We should strive to have a hockey team in the Commonwealth Games in 2022.  Had I mentioned this 15 years ago, people would have got angry.  In the past two years, we have come of age.  I would like to hear the opinions of the sportswomen present and the administrators of the sport.  I do not want to get into politics as the Commonwealth Games should be above politics.

I previously dealt with senior management in the Coast Guard about the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island and a previous draft report, referred to as the Feron report, which contained scathing criticism of senior management in the Irish Coast Guard service was uncovered by the community group in Valentia.  That report went to senior management in the Coast Guard and all of the criticism of senior management was taken out of the report.  The final report that went to the relevant Minister at the time, Deputy Varadkar, contained no criticism of senior management.  It should be borne in mind that this was years ago.  That was a second attempt to close the stations at Malin Head and Valentia Island by giving false information to a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, in the first instance, and, subsequently, to a Fine Gael Minister.</p> <p>  There are issues relating to Rescue 116, including the faulty information that it had, rosters and so on in the information we have available to us.  I have information about life jackets and have asked for the correspondence without, and within, the Department.  My information is that the Coast Guard was aware those jackets were faulty when Coast Guard volunteer, Caitriona Lucas, died in Clare.  Senior management was aware that those life jackets were not deploying on impact with water.  While that may not have been the reason that lady passed away, the life jacket did not deploy.  There are allegations that jackets were changed and the life jacket Ms Lucas was supposed to be wearing was not the one she was wearing.  I take all of that with a pinch of salt but, on top of that, there were questions about the procurement of lifeboats of questionable origin and over the use of cars and jeeps.</p> <p>  The Feron report, although not an official report, said senior management was critically flawed.  Everything that has happened since should be considered in the light of that draft report stating how bad senior management in the Coast Guard was.  That report dates back to 2007.  Looking at everything that has happened since, the original report was correct and the senior management in the Coast Guard is costing lives, as we saw with the tragedy of Rescue 116 and the life jacket of Caitriona Lucas.  I have asked for the correspondence because my information is that there was a lot of stuff going on about the procurement of equipment by senior management who were also at the back end of the companies that were supplying that equipment.  That is secondary to the fact that people are losing their lives.</p> <p>  When the report into Rescue 116 is available, the whole senior management of the Coast Guard and the Secretary General or assistant secretary should be brought before the committee and asked about those life jackets.  We also want to know about the procurement process for the life jackets because concerns were raised prior to their purchase.  I want to put to those representatives that there was a reason they purchased those life jackets and we should be concerned about that, even though they are only allegations.  We should try and get to the bottom of that so I ask members of the committee that when the report on the tragedy of Rescue 116 is available - and please God it will be available before a general election - we bring the whole lot of them in on all of those issues, including Rescue 116, life jackets and-----</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts is also examining that matter but, given it concerns the RSA, it also falls under the remit of this committee.  I did not realise the RSA has &euro;25 million in the bank.  That is a serious amount.  It has &euro;25 million in the bank while charging &euro;72 million per year to people who are trying to export goods out of the country.  The authority does not need all that money.</p> <p>  Hauliers have stated that the RSA is looking to consolidate power.  This is why I asked for the regulatory impact assessment.  This also affects the Chairman's constituency.  The current testing system for hauliers means that if a haulier wants to bring a truck for testing, he or she can ring a local CVRT person with whom they have a relationship.  The tester is not going to pass the vehicle because he or she knows the haulier, but the haulier can drop the truck in at 11 o'clock at night when it is back from its journey.  That might shift to an amalgamated system because the RSA wants to put it out for tender and have one body to do it all, as is the case for car testing.  When the road hauliers asked senior management of the RSA if they would be allowed to take the trailer on the truck to a tester at 11 p.m. or 6 a.m., they were told they would not.  If there is a flaw with a truck, for example a brake pad is required on one wheel, hauliers are currently allowed by the operators of test centres to bring in their own mechanic and fix it on site.  That would no longer be the case.</p><p>They would have to go to the cost of bringing in a truck to haul it away, which is hundreds of euro.  That is why I asked that, before the RSA goes off and puts this out to public tender for one system, while we are all in pre-election mode and when we might put something in front of a Minister and say "sign that", we should ask it not to do any of that until it gives us a regulatory impact assessment on the impact on the average road haulier of its proposed system.</p><p> Another point, which is way more serious is that, based on information the RSA gave to Deputy Robert Troy, the level of testing it does on foreign registered trucks is minuscule - by its own admission, it is 5% to 8% - whereas the estimated proportion of foreign registered trucks, although the RSA does not know it exactly, is about 30%, or possibly higher.</p></speech>

It would be important that we have a full discussion on it and that the Road Safety Authority is in a position to reply to the points raised.  I disagree with the Senator on one point.  He said the RSA is out to consolidate power.  What I see it out to do is to consolidate saving lives.  If it is in order, given Senator Daly has had a fair run and nobody is fighting with him over this, I propose that we ask the RSA management not just to send on the regulatory impact statement but to come to the committee to discuss it.  The Senator will have the opportunity to make his points and they will have the opportunity to reply to him, which would be fair to Senator Daly and fair to them.</p></speech>
