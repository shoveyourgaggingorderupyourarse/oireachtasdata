As part of our work we support several Departments with our analysis and the committee's meetings with them have highlighted that.  The committee's work is both very timely and important.  One of the things we will show in our analysis is that the lack of political leadership is one of the reasons we are in the current position.  I do not mean just Government leadership.  If the committee can achieve cross-Oireachtas consensus on urgent climate action, that would be a key requirement for Ireland to move forward from a laggard position to a leadership position.</p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate an invitation to visit the centre given by Mark Ferguson from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, when he attended the committee.  I am delighted to invite members to visit us at the MaREI Centre, if timing allows, to see some of the work that we do and some of the opportunities associated with the energy transition.</p>  <p>  I will turn to my presentation, which highlights some of the research findings on climate action.  The key policy insights are the headline outcomes.  We have introduced some successful policy measures in this country, and I will touch on them, but they are not enough and they are not across the full gambit of the emissions spectrum.  We have a gap to our mandatory 2030 target that is quantified at 100 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  I will show where that comes from.  Early and sustained action in climate change mitigation is essential and requires political leadership.  The energy transition requires everything to be addressed.  We have a significant challenge and it requires efficiency, reduced consumption, bioenergy, renewable electricity and carbon capture and storage.  There are many elements to the energy transition and one of the challenges is that we tend to focus on a few individual things and that is partly the reason we are in the current situation.</p>  <p>  I ask the committee not to forget the 28% of households that experience energy poverty.  That is one of the reasons we do our analysis from a least-cost approach.  We see a lot of technical guidance being provided to communities for community development and community energy, which is great.  That is essential, but the societal capacity that needs to be built is critical and community development approaches are essential in that.</p>  <p>  The mission of MaREI is to advance energy and marine research in order to facilitate, underpin and provide evidence for the energy transition.  A key part of that is the policy context but also societal engagement.  Those are topics that we will come back to.</p>  <p>  We have seven different research areas.  As well as being the director of the centre, I lead the area on energy policy and modelling.  That is where we do the number crunching for climate action.  We also have significant research capacity and activity under way in marine renewable energy technologies, offshore wind energy, wave energy and tidal energy.  Bioenergy has significant untapped potential.  We also have a particular focus on energy management and efficiency in industry.</p>  <p>  Most of our work is nationally focused but we have done some work internationally.  We have been informing the delivery of the Paris Agreement, which was agreed in December 2015.  It was a political agreement and at the time there was not much analysis available as to what was required to deliver it, so we undertook some analysis on what would be required in an Irish context.  We fed that into a book that I edited which captured case studies from countries across the world and that was referred to recently in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on how we can achieve the transition to a 1.5&deg; Celsius world.</p>  <p>  Another area we have been working on is informing EU policy.  In 2014 the EU decided that a minimum target for 2030 for the EU would be to achieve 27% of its energy from renewable sources.  We did some analysis with the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, to see if that could be increased and one of the recent decisions that was made in the summer of this year was to increase that target for 2030 from 27% to 32%.  That is where we have contributed internationally in terms of policy development but most of our focus has been national.</p>  <p>  In 2013 we produced the first low carbon energy roadmap for Ireland.  That fed into the discussions.  I was at one of the Oireachtas committees around the time the climate legislation was being developed.  We subsequently did some work focusing on other aspects of energy policy, including energy poverty and energy security.  That fed into the White Paper on energy that was published in 2015.</p>  <p>  We did some work then to inform the national mitigation plan that was published last year.  We also did some work on informing the Government's negotiations with Brussels about what should be Ireland's ambition and targets for 2030.</p> <p>The two most recent analyses have been to inform the national energy and climate plan for the Department and to look at a higher ambition strategy for Ireland, associated with the forthcoming all-of-Government action plan.  That is some of the analysis and how it feeds into policy decisions.</p> <p> We have more than 61 million tonnes in annual greenhouse gas emissions.  Over a quarter of that is associated with the emissions trading scheme, ETS, which includes emissions associated with electricity generation and large industry.  The rest are non-ETS emissions, which are agriculture, transport, heating in our homes and in other buildings.  That is what we have the current mandatory target for emissions reduction for, for 2020 and 2030.  This shows where those emissions come from in detail.  Electricity production is a significant part of our emissions but does not form part of our non-ETS obligatory target under the 2020 and 2030 EU directives.  We can see that the non-ETS emissions relate to cars, trucks, homes and cows.  Those are the bigger elements of our non-ETS emissions.</p> <p> We have done very well in some areas in the last years.  The carbon intensity of our electricity has halved since 1990.  Every kilowatt hour of electricity we use results in approximately half the emissions it did in 1990.  Some 30% of our electricity now comes from wind, up from 7% in 2005.  We talk about leadership sometimes.  We are world-leading with wind energy integration.  In transport, the carbon intensity of new cars is one third lower than it was in 2008 due to the change in the car tax regime.  Our biofuel obligation is not talked about much but it is probably our biggest result in the last number of years in contributing to our non-ETS emissions reduction target, with 300,000 tonnes a year.  We have approximately 4,000 electric vehicles and 26,000 hybrid cars on the road.  With regard to heating, we have introduced significant building regulations and our new homes now have 70% better energy performance than in 2005.  We also have grant schemes available for people to retrofit their homes and 390,000 homes have availed of these.  It is not that we have done nothing.  We have done a number of things.</p> <p> On where that leaves our numbers, a graph in my presentation shows EPA projections and historical analysis of our non-ETS emissions.  We can see that, broadly, it was flat for the first years after 2005.  It dropped in the recession.  Since the recovery, we have been in an expansion with regard to emissions.  It is estimated that by 2020, we will be close to where we were in 2005.  The way in which compliance with that target is achieved is not specifically through achieving the 20% reduction but by staying within the carbon budget of 338 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  During the recession years, our emissions were lower than what was in our targets so we were able to bank them.  Since the recovery, our emissions have grown so our current gap to the target is 17 million tonnes.  When we talk about fines, what is generally meant is purchasing compliance and we are purchasing 17 million tonnes of credit.  These numbers that have come about, whether &euro;150 million or &euro;600 million, relate to the purchase of those emissions.  That is the current estimate of the gap to target.</p> <p> Why are we so far off target if we have these policies and measures in place?  The first area is growth and politics.  There has been a 16% growth in the population of Ireland and a 30% growth in the economy since 2005.  This is the new revised measure of economic growth, not GDP, which would be much higher.  Unfortunately, political leadership on climate action has been lacking.  We have had significant changes in electricity but they do not contribute to this target so they do not appear.  Moneypoint, peat plants, wind and solar are important to talk about but they do not contribute to that mandatory target.  Despite what we have done on transport, there has been a 24% increase in the annual distance driven since 2005 so we are driving much more and we have no policy measures relating to freight.  Freight is like a sleeping giant.  With regard to heating, we had great building regulations but we have not been building many houses so those have not kicked in.  The retrofits that have taken place have largely been shallow, including people putting insulation into their attics, which is important, but there is still significant energy wastage in our buildings.  We have not had any support for renewable heat until recently.  If we look forward to 2030, we can see that the target is more ambitious.  It is 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.  We have a set of annual targets, which effectively sets a carbon budget over the period 2021 to 2030.  One can see the difference on display between that line and the EPA projections.  The gap is in the order of 100 million tonnes.  That is our current gap to target in the latest official national projections from the EPA.</p> <p> I will address our key findings.  Since this is a carbon budget, rather than just what we achieve in 2030, anything we do in 2021 is sustained across the period.  If we get 1 million tonnes in a saving in 2021 which is maintained over that period, it contributes 10 million tonnes to our gap to our target.  Early action is important.  We need a more urgent focus on renewable heat and transport.  Most of our discussions on renewable energy have centred on renewable electricity, including wind and solar photovoltaics.  We have not had the same level of discussion on biogas, biofuels, biomass and heat pumps, which are other areas that can contribute to renewable heat and transport.  Our heat and transport account for 80% of our energy use.  Electricity accounts for 20% of our energy use.  While we get 30% of our electricity from renewable sources, that is only 6% of our overall energy.  If we really want to expand our renewable energy, which we need to, and to meet our emissions reduction targets, we need to focus on renewable heat and transport.</p> <p> Another finding from our work on 2030 relates to a number of measures in the national development plan focusing on electric vehicles, heat pumps and people upgrading and retrofitting their homes.  These are essential.  It is hard to see how they can deliver a significant amount to our target for 2030 because these things take time and there is a cumulative effect of somebody making an individual decision which then transfers outwards.  Those things will take time.  They are essential but they are likely to contribute more to the period post-2030 than to our target for 2030.  That is not to say we should not be doing them, since they are important.</p> <p> With regard to 2030, there has been much discussion in this committee about carbon tax, which currently raises approximately &euro;400 million per annum for the economy.  We did some analysis for the Citizens' Assembly.  If that was doubled, there would be approximately &euro;400 million more per annum.  Using &euro;35 million of that to offset energy poverty would be important.  Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;4 per tonne for the approximately 400,000 households in receipt of fuel allowance would mean that the carbon tax would be offset by that increase in payment.  It would only knock &euro;35 million off the &euro;400 million and is an important point to raise about energy poverty.</p> <p> With regard to 2050, we did an analysis that I mentioned earlier which fed into some of the global discussions.  When we look at 2050, one can see that the steepness of what we need to do is phenomenally challenging.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that we have 12 years to go, which is the kind of thing that comes through in this analysis.  We are on the brink of missing the opportunity to stay within 1.5&deg; C.</p> <p>Some of our analysis on 2050 suggests that the time to act is now.  When we look at 2050, there is a danger that the measures needed to achieve those targets are not put in place now.  Electric vehicles, EVs, are a good example and we had a target in 2007 to have 10% of our fleet electric by 2020.  That means that in two years we should have 230,000 EVs on the road but we have 4,000 at the minute.  It is important that when long-term plans or ambitions are put in place that the activity is started now.</p> <p> Some of the other findings from our 2050 analysis tell us that there are no silver bullets.  This goes back to what I mentioned earlier about how we tend to focus on specific issues.  Homes and EVs are one initiative and wind and solar energy are another.  These are all important but we need other initiatives.  We need to sort out freight.  Our analysis shows that if efficiency and electricity are sorted in terms of renewable electricity and the electrification of heat and transport, that will get us about halfway there.  There is still another 50% that needs something else.  There is much less discussion on biofuels, biogas and carbon capture and storage and it is important that these discussions happen now in the context of timing.</p> <p> Near zero carbon, zero carbon or even negative carbon electricity are needed to achieve the ambition of mitigation by 2050.  Significant reductions in carbon dioxide from electricity and other sectors are needed but we need to have some discussion on carbon capture and storage in that context.  If we only rely on wind and solar photovoltaics, PV, there is an energy security consideration and there are cost considerations so we need to have those discussions and develop approaches where we can move towards near zero, zero or negative emissions in electricity and these will not be easy discussions.  This transition will be difficult.  Sometimes simplistic solutions are mooted and put forward but pretending it is simple only makes it harder.</p> <p> I reiterate that 2050 is not just about electricity.  Parts of the energy system are discussed less such as aviation, maritime shipping, freight and the heavy goods industry where much of our energy use takes place so we need to find solutions for same.  Within the MaREI Centre, we have an active biogas research group focusing on energy from waste, grass and algae and there is also a need to look at energy from wood.  In the short term, this would not be wood for electricity but it would be biomass for heat and transport, using liquid and gaseous biofuels.</p> <p> I refer to community energy.  Energy citizenship is becoming more accepted but energy communities are struggling, according to our experience and our research and we have conducted transdisciplinary research with communities to try to understand how they are grappling with the challenges they face.  Intermediaries such as the Tidy Towns and the GAA would not traditionally be associated with the energy transition, which could be tapped into.  Even there, supports are needed to help them to do that.  Infrastructural supports are emerging but they need more coherence.  Much of the focus is on technical support but community development approaches to build societal capacity are also needed.  This is particularly challenging when we think of the timing and that notion of 12 years and we have to build capacity in society in that time to enable a response.  This is a difficult circle to square.</p> <p> We expect a lot from volunteers and we give them grants to commission consultants to do work for them but the volunteers are struggling to meet their day-to-day needs.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptability and that is another important point.  There are examples of projects that have been developed with a community energy approach and have struggled to get that acceptability.  It is unhelpful to talk up community energy while these barriers exist.</p> <p> I will finish by summarising the key policy insights.  We have introduced some measures but not enough and not throughout the energy system.  I have not talked about agriculture and that is an important aspect that I intended to mention at the start.  Our focus is on energy but agriculture comprises two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions or half of the non-ETS emissions.  It has come up a number of times in the deliberations so our gap to target is 94 million tonnes and I showed where that comes from.  Early and sustained action and political leadership are essential and the energy transition is about a full range of measures, not just a few.  The people who are experiencing energy poverty should not be forgotten.  We do not want to introduce measures that will exacerbate energy poverty and we need more community development approaches in our community energy efforts.</p></speech>

I will begin with some of the questions that came to me as he was working through his presentation.</p>  <p>  What are the obstacles to the development of a successful offshore renewable industry in Ireland, according to the MaREI Centre, and what can be done to overcome these obstacles?  We will all have to work together to make that happen and I accept Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's point at the outset that the greatest result we could get from this committee is to move towards political consensus and take some of the politics out of this issue because we all have skin in the game as to how this will play out in the coming years for the country.</p>  <p>  Are there best practice examples of offshore energy regulatory systems in other countries that Ireland can seek to emulate aspects of?  With regard to offshore energy, wind and tidal energy offshore seem to be attractive issues to raise in public meetings in comparison with onshore wind developments that have not had community acceptance.  How does the Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's find that they compare?  We are told that costs are coming down but what are the challenges to the further development of that?  I accept the his point that at times there is probably too much focus on this element.</p>  <p>  On tidal energy, countries such as Portugal are probably ahead of us in terms of best practice but we have a lot of coastline so does the MaREI Centre believe there is potential in this regard?</p>  <p>  Does the MaREI Centre have an approximate price or trajectory for a carbon tax out to 2030 to drive the necessary behavioural change for Ireland to work us towards our 2030 targets?</p>  <p>  Does the organisation have a view on the potential approaches to the tax such fee and dividend or hypothecation models?</p>  <p>  Teagasc are up next and I acknowledge that Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir did not touch on agriculture much as it is not necessarily its main area of focus.  Teagasc had a report on emissions abatement in agriculture that the MaREI Centre is probably familiar with.  How far could these measures bring us towards the 2030 targets and how can the sector move towards this?  It would be interesting to get the MaREI Centre's views on that before Teagasc come in.</p>  <p>  On carbon capture and storage, how sound is the technology around that?  Is it well proven at this stage and is it a realistic option for Ireland as part of its low-carbon energy solution?</p>  <p>  There was a throwaway comment in the middle about sorting out freight and Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir made it sound easy.  How does he envisage that we sort out freight?  Did his comment mean that it should just be banned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200005#D00400"><p>I will take the final question first.  I apologise if I made it sound easy to sort out freight.  My point in that was that there are areas that we have focused on and there are areas that are blind spots to us.  For example, from our analysis on electrifying car transport by 2050, we see a challenge on the freight side.  Because of the efficiency gains in moving to EVs, the proportion of energy drops.  Energy use in cars is probably twice that of freight and that will flip around in 2050 in this analysis and, therefore, it is an issue that we need to sort out.  Some of the solutions are emerging with EVs for larger fleets but some of the more proven measures are in the use of biofuels and biogas such as compressed natural gas vehicles.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is currently building out what is effectively a refuelling infrastructure for compressed natural gas to target freight vehicles.</p> <p>If we can get biogas into the gas network in the way we do wind and solar electricity into the electricity network, we can have a renewable gas system powering our freight requirements.  Hydrogen is another possibility, which is sometimes discussed in the context of freight.  These are some of the options.  However, my point was that it is a blind spot.  It is not something we are talking about.</p> <p> On obstacles to offshore renewable energy, it is an area where political leadership is essential.  The biggest challenge is that of policy.  It is not precisely my area, but from what I hear from colleagues, the maritime spatial planning framework is in disarray.  There is none of the clarity offshore that exists with the onshore planning system.  The political and policy challenges are the greatest ones there.</p> <p> The costs in offshore wind energy have come down significantly.  There are headlines associated with some of the numbers from auctions and so on.  In this country, we have experience of auctions associated with onshore wind energy but not all of those projects were delivered.  We must be careful to see what comes through to delivery and then assess the costs.  However, the costs are coming down and, according to our analysis, will continue to come down.  The only question is the pace.  It has been faster than had been anticipated.</p> <p> I would be inclined to look to Denmark as one example of best practice.  They were one of the forerunners of developing offshore wind energy.  Making offshore attractive is another challenge.  It can be seen as a panacea if there are challenges with developing wind energy onshore.  Sometimes it is as though the faraway hills are greener.  There are other interests where one will find competition such as fisheries or the movement of ships.  It is important to be careful about things that might be seen as an easier option until we try to get out there.</p> <p> We are doing some research on tidal energy within the MaREI centre.  There are some interesting companies emerging.  There was a disappointing situation relating to OpenHydro which had looked promising, but there are other countries out there, such as GKinetic and others, that we are supporting to develop the technology.  This is an area where there is an opportunity.</p> <p> On the carbon tax trajectory, our national mitigation plan analysis, published in July 2017, suggested that we needed to go up to about &euro;99 a tonne by 2030.  This price has been adopted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which was using shadow prices of carbon.  We have done some more recent analysis.  A tricky aspect of this is that the cost of doing something different depends on the future price of alternatives, in this case oil and gas, and there is uncertainty around those.  Some of our more recent analysis, with the drop in oil prices, suggests it might be more expensive.  The figure of &euro;100 might be a lower estimate.  It is not necessarily that that will be the carbon tax price, but that is the price of mitigation.  If we do other things, it should reduce that need.  If we have grand schemes, regulations and obligations, they could all chip away at what might have to be the carbon tax itself.</p> <p> I have not looked into the detail of what might be the best way to frame a carbon tax.  The early analyses suggested simply using it to reduce labour tax, so that the thing that is bad is taxed, not the thing that is good.  If carbon tax is increased, then the labour tax is also reduced.  Different ideas are emerging now such as using it for dedicated climate action activities or, indeed, just handing it back to people.  Therefore, for instance, one could take &euro;400 million, divide it across the population of Ireland and hand it back.  That would help offset energy poverty, and those emitting higher levels would pay a greater amount.  However, we have not looked at this in detail and they are just some reflections on things I have seen.</p> <p> On agriculture, given our Grain and Agriculture Free Trade Association, GAFTA, target of 100 million tonnes, the analysis suggests it would be 18 million tonnes.  That would knock off about a fifth of the GAFTA target in terms of the 2030 target, but Teagasc would be the best organisation to speak to on that.  If it is 18 million tonnes and our GAFTA target is 100 million tonnes, that gives a sense of where things sit.  There is a provision within the directive to use flexibility measures, so we could reduce the amount of emissions trading scheme, ETS, credits that we auction and could also use some offsetting, effectively sequestering carbon.  Those flexibility measures would knock about 50 million tonnes off that 100 million tonnes in addition to the Teagasc element which would knock off a further 18 million tonnes.</p> <p> On the soundness  of carbon capture and storage, CCS, a colleague who is not at this meeting visited some of the plants in the US where CCS is not so much associated with power generation than enhanced oil recovery.  The technology for that is well developed.  Plans were put in place about ten years ago.  Like many plans put in place, and this is something I have touched on about our own situation, none of the plants has been built.  We need to demonstrate and become familiar with the technology.  It is available and is used for enhanced oil recovery but it is not as developed.  My colleague, Dr. Glynn, has done some work on this and I will ask him to come in on this in a moment.  There is an area that is very difficult to mitigate.  We do not have systems that are 100% renewable electricity either, so when we look at decarbonising electricity, there is the element that can be delivered from the variable renewable electricity - hydro, natural gas with CCS, biomass, nuclear, biomass with CCS - and in each of those latter sources there are elements that are liked and disliked.  The latest analysis from the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, IEA, shows that achieving the 1.5&deg;C target cannot be done without carbon capture and storage.</p></speech>

I will give some high-level figures.  There are 17 large carbon capture and storage plants globally, capturing about 13 million tonnes, that is, about half the annual Irish annual CO2 emissions.  As Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said, the IPCC scenarios for the recent special report, SR1.5 are capturing about 200 to 800 billion tonnes of CO2 cumulatively over the whole horizon, so it is almost doubling the remaining carbon budget, giving us space.  CCS in power generation costs about $50 to $100 per tonne of CO2.  Therefore in the IPCC scenarios it is relatively cheap.  However, we see from those models that less and less CCS is coming through in the power sector scenarios.  It is largely renewables.  Where CCS is being used is in industry.  It is about $400 per tonne for steel furnaces and cement process emissions.  How do we protect industry which does not have other options to decarbonise or get down to zero CO2 emissions?  The Sleipner oil field in Norway is the oldest CCS plant in the world.  It has been running since 1996 and captures about 1 million tonnes of CO2 annually.  Ireland's chance of CCS is in the Kinsale field, an old gas field which could store 250 million tonnes of CO2 at about a rate of 2 million tonnes per year relatively cheaply.  It is probably cheaper than CCS in other countries.</p></speech>

We have done some analysis on the electric vehicle, EV, measure in the national development plan, NDP, which is getting 500,000 EVs by 2030.  That would give us about two million tonnes, which would be the same amount as if 2% of gas going through the pipeline came from biogas.  If we start that in 2021 and have it as a fixed amount from 2021 to 2030, it would give us an amount similar to the target of 500,000 EVs.  It is because of this thing.  It is a carbon budget so the EVs will contribute far more in 2030 but over the period, it is a reduced amount.</p></speech>

Our car fleet is growing by 55,000 vehicles every year, and unless there is an economic downturn or something changes in our transport system, there is no reason to think that it would change.  The way we are going over a long trajectory and with a population increase, even if we got half a million EVs, we would still probably have half a million more cars, so we might have no net decrease in the transport sector.</p></speech>

The figure of 2.3 million tonnes is just associated with the EVs in terms of what it would be without them.  Our analysis would show that some of the other reductions in transport are associated with efficiency gains and using the biofuel obligation.</p></speech>

Our analysis contains what is called elastic demand, so as the price goes up for the different fuels and different forms of energy, part of addressing or responding to that price increase can be to reduce demand.  We have not looked at how that could be achieved in terms of lifestyles or consumption patterns.  I am not aware of analysis that points directly to that.  Our work for the mitigation plan shows what meeting that emissions reduction target will cost.  Our analysis came up with a figure of the order of &euro;100 per tonne by 2030.  The Teagasc analysis was not available to us at that stage so energy took the full hit.  The full 50 million tonnes were taken by the energy system so it involved measures in homes, freight, transport and the services sector.</p></speech>

I believe there is an overemphasis on the role of biomass, biogas, biomethane and biofuels in this projection of where we are going.  Modelling what is going to happen next is always uncertain.  A very good report was produced by a series of environmental NGOs such as Climate Action Network Europe, Greenpeace, Oxfam, Transport and Environment, the European Environmental Bureau, worldwide federations and wetlands associations concerning the pitfalls and potential of the role of bioenergy in EU climate and energy policy post 2020.  I cite that report because there is a real concern in seeing biofuels as a solution in the transport area because we know that the effect of biofuels on land use is really acute.  I remember someone high up in a UN agency being asked at a conference I attended how much biomass would be required worldwide if we were to replace our oil energy use with biomass.  His answer was that we would need to use every single piece of biomass on the entire planet, with no food being produced because we would be using all of it and it would produce 20% of the energy we currently use from the oil sector.  Looking at it from a global perspective, the reliance on biomass is not the silver bullet.  We must be very careful.  We should be looking at models such as those used by the Danes and others who agree that anything we do in biomass should possibly involve setting a global cap per country, because they say this problem will be tackled globally, and not going above that cap.</p>  <p>  I have real concerns about some of the solutions here.  I have real concerns about the possible use of biomethane and anaerobic digestion.  If this is coupled with what I see from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, a massive continuing increase in pig and poultry production involving animals fed on imported grain and thinking that is sustainable, we will have water problems and all sorts of other problems such as ammonia down the line.  If we keep going with an agricultural model, which is all about global trade and plcs making money, which is trashing the environment, and call it green because we have some biogas at the end of it to run our transport system, it will be a flawed solution.  Bord na M&oacute;na appeared before the committee.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a significant future, but if we import three million or four million pellets or wood biomass from native forests somewhere else, which involves chopping down trees, and using half a million tonnes of our own biomass here, it will quadruple the price of biomass in the area where we need it most, which is combined heat and power in the food industry.  There is all this talk about grass to gas when we face the risk of not being able to feed our cattle this winter if it is a long winter.</p>  <p>  Does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir not agree that there needs to be a national land use study that would work out the land use implications of all this reliance on biomass that he seems to be promoting and that we should also check in on the international community, including the environmental NGOs, as to the likely long-term strategy with regard to the use of biomass on a global level?  What is being proposed, which involves buying it all, shipping it in and burning it here, with two thirds of the energy ending up as heat going up a chimney, or a massive increase in pig and poultry production to give us anaerobic digestion as biogas, is just not sustainable.</p></speech>

If we want to remove carbon from our economies, there are very significant challenges.  There are challenges associated with any of the technology options.  We do not promote one over the other.  There might be a misconception of what our analysis does.  What we try to do is feed in agnostically the costs associated with different technologies, how they are projected to develop or evolve over time and see how we can meet the climate ambition at least cost.</p> <p> As mentioned, we have also carried out an analysis where we rule out certain things given that many things can be ruled out.  We do not promote certain things but, instead, we do experiments.  The question of CCS came up earlier.  We have run scenarios where we assume CCS will not be developed and others where we assume we cannot import any bioenergy.  Two things happen when we do that.  First, the solutions become more difficult because we have fewer options to choose from and, second, they become more costly.  It is not just an energy poverty issue and there is a range of social and economic inequalities.  However, we do not want solutions that veer away from least-cost unless there is a very good reason to do that.</p></speech>

As an engineer, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir would agree there is no economic case for losing two thirds of waste heat up a chimney and that it is purely a social case.  I would love to see us drive Bord na Mona towards the retrofit business.  The economic cost to the State of Bord na Mona continuing to run peat-fired power stations to 2025, to give that as an example, must be some 5 million tonnes a year.  If we stop that earlier, let us say in 2020, in that five years we are taking about saving 25 million tonnes.  It is in the ETS but, as has just been stated, we will have to pay hundreds of millions of euro to buy credits or give up credits in the ETS.  This would be an economic decision that would return hundreds of millions of euro to this State, which we could invest in Bord na Mona directly to employ people to develop energy efficient housing.  That is the clever economic development we should take.</p>  <p>  I come back to my key question.  As well as doing the energy modelling, does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir not think there is a case for preparing a national land use plan?  For example, if we are going to ramp up to 20,000 hectares of new forestry as a good form of carbon storage, what type of forestry do we need and where will it be?  How much grass is going to feed our animals and how much are we going to send into the transport system, if that is the plan?  Where is that going to grow and who is going to grow it?  In addition to all of those questions is that relating to where we stand globally.  Do we just get as much biomass as we can in a winner takes all, "grab the biomass from wherever we can get it" approach, or are we going to be part of a global, responsible management system for biomass?  Does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir agree in regard to the national land use plan and being part of an international co-operative mechanism in terms of what we do on biomass?</p></speech>

We have a lot of bioenergy coming through in our analysis but, in the short term, that bioenergy is used for heat and for transport.  In the long term, there may be a need for biomass with CCS in order to get negative emissions in electricity, depending on what can be done in the other sectors.  It is important to clarify that on the record.</p></speech>

Different Departments brought up the issue of relying on our analysis.  It is the same message that is on the record all the time.  The comment is always, "We do not agree with this analysis on the use of biomass in power-gen", even though that is not in our analysis.  We have bioenergy in our analysis.  I cannot see how we can have a climate mitigation solution with bioenergy.  I see potential economic, agricultural and social opportunities associated with bioenergy and I believe it is not being discussed in the way it should be.  It is a difficult thing to discuss and there are environmental consequences, but there are consequences with everything we do.  We could look at the EVs that are promoted and that are excellent, but if one talked to the people in the Congo where cobalt mining is being used to generate that, they would give a very different picture of how green EVs are.  For every one of these technological solutions, we can find benefits and challenges associated with them.  Our analysis is technology-agnostic.  We do not pick winners; we look for least-cost solutions.  It is a question of what an energy system of the future will look like if we want to meet this ambitious target at least cost.</p></speech>

On all the other uses, all I am asking for is detailed analysis on the environmental effects and the sustainability, social and international aspects.  I am not disagreeing with what Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said but we need that analysis.</p></speech>

In a broader context, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said in his presentation that the MaREI Centre has introduced some successful policy measures.  If he had to pick one area to advance to get the policies behind the MaREI Centre, which on has been the most progressive and successful to date?  I take into consideration that we are all conscious of the fact we are playing catch-up and we are coming to the table way too late on this, which is unfortunate but cannot be denied.  With that in mind, there is also the danger of not getting the maximum from our inputs and efforts in that there may be a knee-jerk reaction whereby we start spending money foolishly.  From his research, what technological advancements does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir foresee?  Would we be well advised, without sounding like we are shirking the issue, to take a step back and look at where technology will be in two, five or ten years time and plan towards that target, rather than everybody losing the run of themselves, if the professor knows where I am coming from?  What technological advances does he foresee?</p>  <p>  I was at a meeting this morning at which we discussed heavy haulage, air transport and so on.  This is going to take a long time and our best way of making progress will be the mixing of biofuels with fossil fuels.  We can achieve fantastic results but the bottom line is that, for the foreseeable future, there will not be a day when we are not burning fossil fuels in heavy vehicles.  Our best approach is that there is a mixture with biofuels.  With that in mind, what is Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's view on proposals with regard to exploration in Irish seas for gas and oil?  We are going to need a combination and there is also the potential benefit of CCS, which was mentioned earlier, so it is not all negative when it comes to taking fuel from the ground.</p>  <p>  We get many different opinions on tax versus incentivisation and we have talked about carbon tax.  In the broader spectrum of the Irish public, what one incentivisation scheme would Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir think is the most advantageous?  If he had a pot of money to try to progress this project, what way of spending it would give the best value in terms of incentivising communities to buy in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200008#G01300"><p>Those are very good questions; there was a lot in that.  In terms of coherence and political leadership, the Senator is right that these are the two things that are necessary but missing.  We have had some successful measures but they have been bitty, so having a coherent targeted approach is essential.  Political leadership has been lacking so we have not actually delivered on some of the ambitions we set ourselves.</p>  <p>  In terms of what is the most important, it is probably the least discussed.  The one that is discussed most in terms of meeting our targets has been the biofuel obligation but when one goes into a petrol station, there is no signage up and no mention of it, and it does not get the same discussion.  Transport is seen as the most difficult sector to decarbonise, after agriculture, and there is good reason for that.  However, the biofuel obligation scheme has been probably the most successful measure in terms of delivering on our emissions reductions targets.</p> <p>I was asked about the technology and advances.  I will bring Dr. Rogan in momentarily because we have just finished a project on the opportunities associated with the energy transition.  It is about the opportunities associated with the technologies and it ties into the question on timing and whether we should wait.  We do not have the luxury of time in which to wait because of the urgency-----</p></speech>

We have to keep doing what we are doing and perhaps a bit more on a target we can afford.</p></speech>

If we come in later, we will avail of technologies others have paid for.  While there is a logic to the argument, that ship has sailed now, in particular if we are talking about leadership.  We must be careful, of course, about what we invest in, which is another point the Senator made regarding tax versus incentives.  If there is one measures I suggest considering - and it is only because it has not been on the radar - it is an obligation or incentivisation scheme to introduce biogas into our gas system.  If we do not decarbonise our gas pipeline and if it does not become renewable, it will be come obsolete.  The opportunity exists to make it renewable.  There are six gas utilities around Europe which have committed to decarbonising gas by 2050.  I refer to our 2030 targets.  Gas Networks Ireland has a target of 20% of the gas in the pipeline being renewable by 2030.  If we started at 2% in 2021 and ratcheted up to 20%, it would save us 16 million tonnes on a crude, back of the envelope calculation.  It would knock 16 million tonnes off our 100 million tonnes gap to target.  It would be the one thing I suggest looking at because it is not in any of the documents anywhere but is nevertheless a significant proposition.  The key advantage of it is that people are using gas in their homes already.  If one changes that gas to renewable gas, the customer does not have to make a decision around anything.  It happens on the supply side and is therefore something that can be implemented quickly.  It would not require end-user choices to inject biogas into the gas grid.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to a ban on oil and gas exploration.  I watched with interest the discussions at the other committee in that regard.  I again found that our analysis was used by different parties on both sides of the argument.  Some argued with each other using different parts of our analysis.  It is a very complex question.  The reality is that whatever our trajectory is, 75% of our energy currently comes from oil and gas.  Apart from Corrib, it is all imported.  We are relying currently on imports of oil and gas.  Oil should certainly disappear from our system whereas gas can be converted over to biogas.  On the timing of a ban, it would send a symbolic message.  It would not deliver any specific emissions reductions but would be symbolic.  There is a choice which needs to be made as to whether the message outweighs the fact that we could use the product of a find rather than to continue to import fuels in the timeframe during which we are still using oil and gas.  That is a short answer to a complex issue.</p>  <p>  Senator Paul Daly mentioned heavy oil use in aviation and he is right that those are areas in which there are blind spots.  We see biogas as having potential in that regard.  We see hydrogen as having a role also albeit more in freight than aviation.  Aviation is likely to require a liquid fuel.  This is where it gets tricky and it touches on the discussion of electricity versus bioenergy.  We see half of the energy system requiring something like a solid or liquid form of energy.  That can be renewable but there are challenges associated with it.  Dr. Rogan wants to come in on the question of advances in technology.  I think I got the others.</p></speech>

There are a few technology areas we explored in greater detail to understand the opportunity and potential.  To pick up on some of what Br&iacute;an said, there is a potential resource regarding biogas and freight.  There is also an existing gas network which could be ungraded to use with renewable energy.  With the right mix of incentives, whether that is the right level of carbon tax or a grant, a lot of progress could be made.  There is a great deal of potential also from energy efficiency in industry and we have also developed some smart digital tools to sustain energy savings in industry settings in Ireland.  Wave energy innovation is another area we have looked at as to the policy and technology needs.  We have done some initial analysis on the risks and returns of different technology.  There is uncertainty about how technologies will development and how the cost and mix of technologies will develop over time.  One of the risks we considered in our risk-return matrix was political risk and how uncertainty in carbon prices or around political decisions can negatively affect investment.  Political leadership and cross-party agreement on climate change can mitigate that risk, strengthen the investment case and ease the pathways to a low-carbon economy.  They are all challenging but that is an area where the risk can be mitigated.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the biofuel obligation delivered more than anything else as a single measure.  An obligation around renewable gas could be significant.  While carbon tax is very important, it is only one measure.  We are missing out on that big piece.  If the committee is having a discussion on carbon tax, I implore it to consider whether the fuel allowance could be increased by &euro;4 a week for the heating period to avoid a negative impact on energy poverty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1439" speakername="Ian Marshall" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200009#H00800"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  A number of things spring to mind.  At the outset, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned the collective responsibility we have.  We have the legacy of a silo mentality on this problem.  We have not worked across Departments and different areas of industry and business to adopt a holistic approach.  Targets are ambitious.  The fact that the target has been increased highlights the imminent crisis and the necessity for us to crack this discussion up.  When we look at the growth of industry, agriculture and business on the island of Ireland, we are sometimes caught up in the headline figures while missing some of the improvements and gains in efficiency that have been made in how we conduct our business.  That does not get away from the headline of increasing emissions which we must address.  However, we must be cognisant of the fact within this environment of growth.</p>  <p>  Taxes versus incentives have been mentioned.  Dr. Rogan made the important point about getting the mix of incentives and taxation right.  We must take a leaf out of the book of our neighbours in France where President Macron got carbon taxation wrong.  That society was under immense pressure, whether in respect of agriculture, rural life or freight.  When one takes a group of individuals who are under financial pressure, stress and duress and applies further taxes to them, it might not be an appropriate strategy as the French case indicates.</p>  <p>  Regarding the electrification of our fleet of vehicles, we were told there were only 4,000 EVs on our roads.  The majority of consumers would be keen to go to EVs if the cost were not so prohibitive.  Electric cars are ridiculously expensive compared to their diesel and petrol counterparts.  In the context of the need for a holistic approach, we must consider whether the grid and generation capacity will exist in the next few years to charge vehicles if a large proportion of cars in Dublin become EVs.  I am led to believe we would need to install gas turbines atop buildings to provide charging points for some of those vehicles if that were the case.  It is important to bear that in mind.</p>  <p>  Mention was made of energy communities and the intermediaries and support they need.</p> <p>We may have missed a trick in historically not embedding district and community solutions in our planning strategy.  We have failed there, but we could deal with that in future.  Should district initiatives and district heating infrastructure be incorporated into the planning process now that it is mandatory for development?</p> <p> There have been a number of references to an holistic approach.  It is an issue of not cherry-picking and not trying to get quick wins because we need to be mindful of the unintended consequences of some of our actions now.  This discussion is about the next 20, 30 and 50 years.  We have focused very much on generation.  Deputy Eamon Ryan said we probably have not focused enough on encouraging people to consume less energy, thereby reducing our impact on the environment.</p> <p> There is a reference to biomass and a reference to a land-use plan.  Sometimes biomass can be misrepresented in this discussion.  While it is not a silver bullet, it is certainly part of the solution.  What is the view of the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy on the production of biomass?  I am not referring to agroforestry because agroforestry tends to be a turn-off for farming and agribusiness people.  It is like suggesting changing the shapes of all the windows and doors in our houses.  While we can all do that, it is a slow process to convert it back to what it was originally.  For those in agriculture, agroforestry does not always float their boat.</p> <p> What is the view of the MaREI Centre on the production of hemp as a sustainable crop?  In light of the shift in the business model in the midlands from peat extraction especially, could hemp as an alternative crop along with a decortication plant in the region create jobs and at least go part of the way to addressing some of the issues?</p> <p> Deputy Ryan spoke about conventional farming practice.  We cannot oversimplify this discussion.  In the past two weeks I visited a large pig facility which will be carbon neutral.  There will be no slurry and it has air scrubbers.  There are no emissions and no pollution.  It is a circular economy producing its own heat and electricity.  We need to be careful in our discussion on agriculture.</p> <p> Members of this committee are lobbied from many areas of society and we have the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  At the moment there is major pressure to deliver policy that is popular.  What is the view of the MaREI Centre on the importance of focusing on evidence-based policy?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200010#J00300"><p>I will ask Ms Watson to respond on the community question.</p>  <p>  The Senator is correct about the legacy of silos.  I have seen it in Departments.  In recent years I have seen Departments working together.  However, I now see silos in the political system and that is why this committee is so important in trying to build consensus and coherence.</p>  <p>  Headline efficiencies have improved.  Efficiency is a tricky one.  While it is the low-hanging fruit in terms of cost, it generally requires getting people to change practice which is where it gets tricky.  It is a no-brainer on the cost side, but difficult to achieve in practice.  It is important that we do that; otherwise we are wasting energy and money.</p>  <p>  Regarding tax under duress, it is important to learn from what is happening in Paris and the experience here with water charges.  We need to learn from such experiences in how we implement policies and how we engage.  Dialogue is very important in that.  It creates this challenge where we have both this urgency to act and the need to bring people in a full societal movement.  That is a very difficult one to square.</p>  <p>  On electric vehicles, EVs, being cost prohibitive, it is not just costs.  We recently did analysis that I am happy to share with the committee.  One of the issues was not having enough models available.  When people thinking of getting a new car go to forecourts, they do not see an EV and are not even told about an EV.  That is changing, but while cost is a factor, there are other ones.  Do we have the grid capacity to accommodate charging?  In many cases people would get a grant for a home charging kit.  That raises challenges not just with electrification of transport, but also with heat pumps.  The analysis can, and should, be done.  I do not necessarily see a need for it to be gas turbines on the top of apartment blocks.  We can mitigate that.  It is important to consider the unintended consequences in all these.</p>  <p>  The Senator asked about biomass and hemp production in the midlands.  That brings together the climate justice element with the renewable energy solution.  On the specifics of hemp, I believe witnesses from Teagasc will address the committee in the next session.  The Senator is correct that biomass is not a silver bullet, but the difficulty is that we need everything.  In defending biomass, it is not that I think that it is the best or that it will do it.  However, it is not getting the discussion it needs.  From our analysis it is hard to see it being achieved without biomass.  Biomass incorporates biogas, liquid and solid waste, wood and so on.</p>  <p>  The Senator asked about popular policies and how we make decisions.  It is a tricky one.  Members all know the political game better than I do.  They are trying to navigate around having the correct evidence base so that it is a well-informed policy decision.  Society needs to be behind it; ideally it should lead it.  I ask Ms Watson to talk about that and the issue of planning and community involvement.</p></speech>

Without people collaborating and participating in a decision it becomes top-down quickly leading to what we have seen in France.  The plastic bag tax a positive example of a tax that worked.  People were prepared over a period of two years for that.  We need to feed that into our thinking.  My research shows the importance of the resources put in at the grass roots.  While leadership is key, grass-roots involvement is also key.  At the moment we have many community energy groups and sustainable energy communities.  We are working with people in Dingle on an interesting project.  However, they cannot access money to employ somebody, for instance, to co-ordinate the work, or someone with community development experience who knows how to work with people.  There is a significant gap and I urge the committee to bear that in mind and to put some time aside to look at how to engage with people.</p>  <p>  The issue of getting the message out has come up previously.  It is key to get the right message goes out.  At the moment what we hear on the radio is conflicting.  We are being advised to get a condensing boiler, a heat pump or an electric car.  There is a debate over whether we should burn turf briquettes.  Somehow we need to overcome that as part of the package.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of spending a Friday afternoon at the MaREI Centre a few months ago.  It was engaging and helpful.  The witnesses bring a bit of clarity to major issues.  I will just ask two short questions because the Chairman has put me under such time constraint.</p>  <p>  Where are we going with the carbon-storage model?  I will be parochial.  There is an energy hub in Cork Harbour.  The Kinsale gas field is going through a decommissioning phase at the moment.  Both of those stars are shining at the moment.  What is the timeline for a national policy on carbon storage, taking into consideration the decommissioning of the Kinsale gas field in the next three to five years?  The witnesses referred to the Norway model.</p> <p>Can I hear the view of the MaREI centre representatives on the Kinsale gas field and the energy hub we have in Cork harbour?  How will they all tie together?  What do they believe we need to do at a policy level to ensure that it can be part of it?</p> <p> Another parochial or minor issue concerns anaerobic digestion.  Where does that fit in?  There are more dairy cows in County Cork than in the entire area of Northern Ireland.  Where can we tie that in with the co-operative industry across the southern and eastern base of the country?  Can those involved play a role at an environmental level by improving water quality, as well as addressing the carbon issue and producing the gas that is required?</p></speech>

We enjoyed the visit from the Senator.  Senator Lombard referred to the Kinsale gas field.  I know Ervia has developed plans for it.  Since the gas field is largely depleted a policy decision is urgent, because there is potentially a lost opportunity.  We need analysis around that, what it would deliver and we need to try to anticipate unintended consequences.  It would be important to have a serious look now at some of the things that have come up rather than in a few years' time, when it is too late.  I will ask Dr. Glynn to come in on that point.</p>  <p>  Senator Lombard asked about anaerobic digestion.  We have done some analysis.  It was undertaken by my colleagues who work in biogas.  They have mapped out the country and looked at where we could put digesters based on the different types of farming activity, the different potential for grass and the different feedstocks.  I would be happy to share that with the committee.</p></speech>

The timeline for the Kinsale gas field will be dictated largely by the flooding of the field.  It is kept pressurised for strategic storage.  Once those responsible stop doing that, the field will flood.  That is the lost opportunity Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned.  That is a key issue.  The Norway field is for enhanced oil recovery.  The Kinsale field would only be for CO2 sequestration.  It would not be a matter of producing more oil but getting rid of CO2.</p></speech>

It has not been mentioned.  Has the MaREI Centre done any analysis on that area in the context of the mix we have discussed?</p>  <p>  Is the MaREI analysis of transport only an analysis of the vehicles used?  Does the analysis cover the travel options and choices available to people?  I am referring to public transport, cycling and walking.  What does the MaREI analysis tell us about the public health benefits of the various options for meeting the energy scenarios, in particular with regard to air pollution and physical activity?  Can the MaREI representatives add these issues to the results generated by the models?</p>  <p>  The question of freight is relevant.  One of the big technological developments in recent years has been the automation of transport systems in ports.  Has the model looked at the potential to increase the use of rail for freight as this technology becomes more widespread?</p>  <p>  Can the deputation supply a marginal abatement cost curve for energy emissions similar to that supplied in the Teagasc presentation for agriculture?</p></speech>

I am happy to send that to the committee.</p>  <p>  We do not have specific research activity within MaREI on solar power.  It is not one of the technologies we focus on.  We see it emerging in our results, especially on the electricity side as one of the options as the price of solar power comes down.</p>  <p>  I mentioned wind and solar several times.  Part of our goal in presenting to the committee today is to show that wind and solar are important, but some of the other elements do not get the same level of discussion.  That was where the emphasis lay.</p>  <p>  I was asked about the public health benefits.  We are working with colleagues in China, where air pollution is a major issue.  In China, a total of 1 million deaths per year are associated with air pollution.  We are working with colleagues who do similar modelling to bring air pollution into our scenarios.  This will enable us to assess not only the implications for climate action but for air pollution as well.</p>  <p>  As for public transport and cycling, essentially our model finds least-cost solutions.  We have done some analysis but it is rather difficult to find a least-cost solution between public and private transport.  If we simply put the data into the model, it would immediately go to public transport because that involves moving a larger number of people.  However, it does not take into account the value that people place on their time if they are waiting at, or walking to, bus stops etc.  We have done some analysis on this previously, and I can share it with the committee.  We have not done anything precisely on cycling and walking and the other benefits.</p></speech>

I am keen to go back to the issue of carbon capture and storage.  A spokesperson for Science Foundation Ireland, which funds the MaREI project, said recently at another committee meeting that we should not be too panicky about climate change.  The view was that developments in science like carbon capture and storage will save us at the end of the day and that we are making great developments.</p>  <p>  Dr. Glynn said that when he visited the US it was all about enhanced oil recovery.  Do the MaREI representatives acknowledge that carbon capture and storage is not as developed as it sounds?  It will not capture carbon from agriculture or transport, although it can do it from the production of fossil fuels.  We should therefore be looking at afforestation, open bogs and other natural ways of carbon capture, rather than taking the view that science is going to save the planet.</p>  <p>  Will the witnesses comment on investment in tidal and wave energy?  Reference was made to some companies investing in research and development in these areas.  Most people who look at Ireland would maintain we are the wealthiest country in tidal and wave energy if we could capture and exploit it.  We are way ahead of anywhere else.  Sweden tops the agenda in doing the best that it can do to tackle climate change.  As we are on the Atlantic, we could be really wealthy in resources if we could capture those energy sources.  Will the deputation comment on the amount of investment needed for the exploration of tidal and wave energy?  Reference was made to how our policy on planning is an obstruction.  I understand why it is an obstruction to wind energy and putting wind farms in place.  As politicians we really need to address that.  Can the deputation explain why the policy also is an obstruction to the development of tidal and wave energy technology?</p>  <p>  We have 13 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly.  I imagine the MaREI representatives have seen them.  If they were to pick three, which three would they pick?</p></speech>

I have said that previously.  Carbon capture and storage, CCS, is not a silver bullet from our perspective.  There have been arguments that we should delay things and that CCS will deliver.  There have also been arguments that we should not rely on CCS at all and that we should do other things.  What comes through in our analysis is that CCS is an important part of the solution but it is a small part of the solution.  We need everything else as well.</p>  <p>  I will ask Dr. Glynn to address the comment on enhanced oil recovery.</p>  <p>  On the question about tidal and wave energy, one of our colleagues in the audience is from Maynooth University.  We have teams throughout the country working on wave and tidal energy.  We have done some analysis recently on what is required and by how much the costs would have to come down to make it competitive.  We are trying to explore what kind of actions and polices we would need to put in place to deliver it.  I will bring in Dr. Rogan on that point in a moment.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to say that we are wealthy as a country in terms of our wave and tidal energy resources.  It is a very difficult environment.</p> <p>I did my PhD in wave energy.  Some of the early prototypes put out in the ocean were ripped apart.  It is a difficult and challenging environment.  We do have some interesting developments, including a company called Ocean Energy building a device in Portland, Oregon.  That is going to be shipped to Hawaii for testing.  We have companies working with us in Ireland, such as GKinetic on tidal energy.  Regarding policy, it is clear, as the Deputy noted, how that affects offshore wind energy.  Turning to policy on wave and tidal energy, we put devices in the water to test then and that is where policy has an effect.  We can put the test devices in our own tanks but we need permission from somebody to go to the open sea.  Where is the process and planning for that?  There is some leniency and we have been able to do some testing.  Moving to the next level is where we need that planning policy.  </p></speech>

A reduction of about 80% was required from where technology costs are now for wave energy to be competitive.  That sounds like a dramatic decrease.  We looked at historic precedents for cost reduction as well, however, in respect of wind and solar PV.  An 80% cost reduction is very big but there are historical precedents for that.  We did additional analysis on the innovation needed to achieve that 80% reduction.  We can share some of the results with the committee.  We put together a policy brief on those recently.  In summary, we looked at infrastructural needs, such as building up the knowledge and industrial base in Ireland.  There are also technology challenges that some of our engineering colleagues are working on in the MarEI centre in Cork as well as the regulatory and consistency needs Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned.  A number of things have to come together and we can share our analysis with the committee.</p></speech>

That is as clear as we can put it.  Sequestration of CO2 through afforestation, CCS, direct air capture and enhanced weathering is critical.  We definitely need afforestation as well as any other way to prevent the emission of CO2.  The IPCC is highlighting direct air capture, enhanced weathering and CCS in its analysis.  Bioenergy carbon capture and storage is the big question.  What is the global resource?  It is about 50 EJ now.  In some scenarios, there is talk of trebling that or even an increase of up to 15 times that amount.  That is the big question on CCS.</p>  <p>  In the plants we visited in the United States, the most mature plants are capturing about 1 million tonnes to 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.  Those plants are in place because of tax regimes in Texas and Canada, where carbon taxes are about $50 per tonne.  Some are in the form of rebates and some are investment charges on the cost of electricity.  In the scenarios coming from the IPCC, in all of the integrated assessment models produced, bioenergy CCS, or CCS in general, is not for power generation.  It produces small amounts of electricity to stabilise the grid but it is mainly to produce liquid and gaseous zero emission fuels for transport and industry.  Those are sectors where it is otherwise really difficult to bring CO2 emissions to zero.  In the long-term then, CCS will be concerned with zero emissions and liquid and gaseous fuels.  Developing the technology is the main aspect of CCS in the short term but whether that technology is then used for fossil fuel or bioenergy in the long term is up for debate.  </p></speech>

There is an attempt to address that with insulation and other sustainable measures in housing.  Most people cannot afford that and cannot match grants.  Those supports are too difficult for people to access.  That is, however, one of the ways we can get community involvement and get communities talking to one another.  The need to insulate is inextricably linked with a realisation of the nature of climate change.  Do the witnesses have ideas on how progress can be made on a community basis by talking to people and taking direct action at the same time?</p>  <p>  Regarding the difficult area of heavy goods haulage, which is a significant emitter of CO2, have we examined the capacity of the rail network to take over some of that transport in a more environmentally-friendly way?  On community ownership and the research that needs to be done on groups that have not survived, can the witnesses, off the top of their heads, give the main reason why those groups might have collapsed?  </p></speech>

My own thoughts are that the Senator is exactly right regarding energy poverty and addressing that through community energy schemes.  That is a very positive way to go.  It is not just the money, it is also the aspect of people coming into each other's homes.  In a community setting people are known to each other.  That is an important dimension because there are many barriers to making community energy schemes work.  The question of the rail network came up earlier as well.  I apologise for not addressing it and I thank Senator Devine for reminding me of it.</p>  <p>  We have not looked at this closely.  The dispersion of the population of Ireland around the country makes this a difficult area.  What we have noticed is a decline in the use of rail for freight transport.  The ports are used to a slightly greater extent for freight transport but the roads are much used.  There has been some analysis of electrifying rail and where that might make most sense regarding investment versus return in emissions reductions.  My understanding is that it is more in the greater Dublin area than some of the intercity lines.  I will try to find the information and send it to the Senator.  </p></speech>

They could not access funding, they could not access the electricity grid and they also had trouble with planning.  They got no infrastructural or leadership support.  There were others, later on, that tried to be community-oriented by accepting shares locally.  Those involved will admit now, however, that they did not have the information on how to do it properly.  There does seem to be a problem as well in that, even if there is an attempt to get community involvement, some people do not like wind generators.  Much of the research will show that people have something called place attachment.  People are very attached to the place where they live, to the view as it is now and maintaining that view in the future.  Some big development coming in, or even a community development, threatens to wreck that.  That is part of where long-term and in-depth engagement is needed.  This cannot be rushed into, even as a community project.</p></speech>

The first recommendation was that climate change should be at the centre of policy-making.  This has come up during the deliberations, but I do not think a new body is required.  We need, instead, to strengthen what already exists, such as putting this committee on a permanent footing, as well as the advisory council.  The fourth recommendation was on the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.  The issue of adaptation does get not much discussion but it is an important recommendation.  The sixth recommendation concerned trying to increase levels of community ownership in all future renewable energy projects by encouraging communities to develop their own projects.  There are some moves on that with the recent renewable electricity support scheme.  It does focus on electricity and community ownership and better community engagement could be extended to renewable heat and transport,</p></speech>

We started hearing about this 20 years ago.  I heard the reply to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith but are there examples from around the world where wind and wave have been utilised effectively?  Is the issue in Ireland due to lack of investment in research and development or is it because those technologies do not seem to be a viable alternative in respect of cost benefit or consistent output?  Regarding Moneypoint power station, what is the most effective way of powering that in the future?  That is a major issue and it gets bounced around.  Is it natural gas?  If it is, do we have the natural gas potential to supply it?</p> <p>What are the greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas compared with those from oil and coal?  If something is powered by oil and coal and there was a switch-over to natural gas, what would be the percentage reduction in greenhouse gas emissions?</p> <p> I listened carefully to the earlier discussion about HGVs.  It is a big issue because some solutions can be found in the public transport sector, including electrification of the fleet and so on, but for the haulage industry, in providing torque, or pulling power, we do not yet have them.  What we are really looking at as adding biogas to the grid.  What percentage of the fleet could be powered by biogas?</p> <p> My last two questions are very brief.  What is the optimal way to develop and implement a carbon tax, not only to achieve a reduction in emissions but also public acceptance, particularly in view of what has happened in France?</p> <p> I refer to the potential to use hydro power.  I do not want everyone to answer my last question, but perhaps one of the panel might answer it.  We have had a dry year, weather wise, but there is still a lot of water on the island.  There have been other years when there has been a hell of a lot of it.  Plans have been brought forward in the past release water and flood valleys to generate electricity.  Some very innovative methods used in other countries have been considered.  The power plant at Ardnacrusha supplied all of the electricity needs of the State in the 1920s; my understanding is that it now supplies less than 4%.  Considering that we have heavy rainfall and mountainous terrain, is there an opportunity, perhaps through using a number of hydro plants, to provide for our power needs?  Obviously, hydro is a clean source of energy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200013#M00500"><p>They are great questions and I hope I can do them justice in responding to them.</p>  <p>  I was asked for examples of places where the use of wind and wave energy was successful.  Ireland is very successful in the use of wind energy.  We are a world leader in the amount of wind energy the power system can take.  Denmark is one of the few countries that obtains a higher share of its electricity supply from wind energy, but it is heavily interconnected to two large power systems which act as a cushion.  The work we have done in Ireland is world-leading.  Some 30% of our electricity supply now comes from wind energy.  In any instant wind energy can account for a figure of 65% in our power system, which is higher than in any other power system in the world, of which I am aware.  </p>  <p>  As for examples of good practice in the use of wave energy, there is still that opportunity and no one has taken the lead over anyone else.  At different times different countries have moved forward and then pulled back.  They include some of the same countries mentioned, including Denmark, Portugal and Scotland.  There is significant potential here, notwithstanding the challenges faced in bringing down the cost and the ocean environment, but it is an opportunity.</p>  <p>  The future of the plant at Moneypoint is a very interesting question because it is presented as a topic in itself.  If we were to close the plant at Moneypoint, what would we do?  Our work looks at the whole system and it is a much bigger challenge than the one associated with the plant at Moneypoint.  The fact that there is great infrastructure at Moneypoint suggests one could consider having a large power plant in the vicinity.  One of my colleagues has presented the idea of having wave energy feed into that grid connection point.  I saw some analysis, although it was from a couple of years ago, that in knocking the plant at Moneypoint out of the picture the overall cost of electricity would increase by &euro;200 million a year.  The reason it is being used is that coal is cheap, but, obviously, does have climate change implications.  It does not help us in meeting our targets because it is in the ETS, not the non-ETS, sector.  </p>  <p>  We probably have five options to have a central station.  They are natural gas, natural gas with carbon capture and storage, biomass, biomass with carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy .  There will not be a fan club for any one of them, but they would all result in reduced emissions compared with the plant at Moneypoint.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about gas versus coal.  Gas has lower emissions intensity than coal, but producing electricity from gas in the plants typically used throughout the country would be 55% efficient.  The plant at Moneypoint is 38% efficient.  It is a question of reduced emissions content and also efficiency.  Therefore, we are talking about approximately half of the emissions.  That is a crude estimate and I could come back with a more accurate one.  If one was to switch to biomass, there would be zero emissions.  If one was to switch to biomass with carbon capture and storage, one would have negative emissions.  If one was to switch to gas with carbon capture and storage, one would be close to negative emissions.  I made a presentation to the Department on this question and it did not like my answer.  I said it was almost the wrong question because the challenge was what we were doing across the entire system and all elements.  The discussions tend to focus on narrow silo topics that move us away from the bigger picture.  Of course, it is a significant emitter, accounting for approximately 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year, but they are the options.</p>  <p>  Regarding HGVs and on what we see as the role for biogas, gas feeds homes in many of the cities.  Therefore, if one had biogas entering into the gas network, one would have a seamless way of decarbonising heat because biogas would deliver home heating and homeowners would not have to make a decision if they were already connected to the gas network.  In the short term that would be an option while the infrastructure was being developed.  It is already happening in respect of refuelling, with the focus on freight; therefore, one could then transition from home heating to freight transport because that is where biogas would be most valuably used in the future.  The options in the case of freight transport are more limited.  I can come back to Deputy Stanley with a number.  He asked about the percentage reduction.  The target of Gas Networks Ireland for the use of biogas on the gas grid is 20% by 2030.  I suspect that that would meet all of our needs in the area of freight transport, but I can come back to the Deputy with a firmer answer.</p>  <p>  I have addressed the question of a carbon tax.  There are a number of ways by which the money could be given back, used to reduce labour costs or for climate action measures.  It is important that the issue be discussed but, generally, the issue that is discussed less and receives less airtime is ensuring it does not impact negatively on the level of energy poverty.  Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;4 a week during the heating season would be offset by a carbon tax of &euro;20 per tonne; therefore, there would be a doubling of the carbon tax.  I think that also addresses the question of the use of biomass in the plant at Moneypoint.</p></speech>

In a short presentation I will take it through some of the work Teagasc has done in the area of greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector.  It looks at what the emissions could be in the future and sets out a range of mitigation actions which, if employed, could reduce the emissions produced by the sector.  I will skip through my first background slide which sets out the state of affairs with respect to agriculture's share of greenhouse gas emissions and with which I am sure the committee is familiar.</p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise when looking to the future - I am referring to the years to 2030 - that the position in agriculture is quite uncertain.  It is a sector heavily influenced by policy.  When I refer to policy, to a large extent, I am referring to the Common Agricultural Policy.  The sector is also heavily influenced by international demand.  That is a particularly important issue for agriculture.  On the key agricultural outputs, we export very large shares of dairy produce, beef, sheep and pigmeat.  Exports account for a very high share of total production, which is unusual in a EU context.  The level of activity in the sector is heavily driven by international considerations.  </p>  <p>  Acknowledging that uncertainty, we decided to look at six future scenarios for the level of agricultural activity and the associated emissions that will be produced by the sector.  Given that most of the greenhouse gas emissions in Irish agriculture are generated by cattle, that is, in beef and dairy production, we centred our scenarios on different views of how the total cattle population could evolve and knowing what the total cattle population would be in different scenarios.  In assessing them and the level of activity in other sectors of agriculture and the amount of nitrogen used, an important source of emissions, we can come up with a suite of projections for what the emissions from the sector will look like in the future before we take mitigation actions into consideration.  </p>  <p>  Reflecting on what I have said, I draw the committee's attention to the graph for the cattle population.  I draw its attention to the relatively narrow vertical axis.  There are a little over 7 million cattle in the country.  We have produced projections for six scenarios which we have labelled Nos. 1 to 6.  The key point to note is that we have projected a range of about 1 million head of cattle by the time we reach 2030.  It is important to emphasise the current population is a little over 7 million.  The most important scenario, the one about which I will talk most, is scenario 1.  It is the central scenario in which the cattle population will increase to about 7.4 million in the period to 2030.  </p>  <p>  Why do we have these scenarios?  We have them because we have based them on different possible evolutions of the dairy cow and suckler cow populations.  They give us a spread of six potential outcomes.  The reason we have done it is to emphasise that we cannot know with certainty what the total cattle population will be or what total emissions will be in agriculture.  The same is true of any other sector of the economy and the associated level of emissions.  It is an important point to note.  If we take the six scenarios and factor in the emissions from other sectors of the economy, we can come up with six scenarios for the emissions that will be produced in the agriculture sector.  There are some important figures to note on the graph.  The figure for 2005 is the reference level of emissions relative to which we are trying to achieve by way of a reduction in emissions by 2030.  All six scenarios show emissions increasing relative to where they are.  In all six emissions are higher than they were in 2005.  The key point that needs to be made is that the six scenarios and the levels of emissions exclude mitigation actions.  It is before we take into consideration actions that could be taken in the agriculture sector to address the emissions.  We have identified about 25 actions that could be taken to address them.</p>  <p>  That is not the final outcome.  Other key figures to note are the 10% and 20% reductions in emissions relative to the figure for 2005.  If we take the figures and put them in tabular format, we can see the associated percentage changes in emissions.</p> <p>The most relevant is probably the one in the second last column for 2030 versus 2005.  As members can see, under all of the scenarios shown, the level of emissions would be higher than it would have been in 2005.  Again, the caveat here is that this is before we take into consideration the mitigation actions.</p> <p> I will home in on scenario one, which is the central scenario across the six scenarios we have looked at.  In that context, we are talking about a 9% increase in emissions relative to 2005 by 2030.  This is without mitigation being taken into consideration.  We then identified three mitigation pathways, three ways in which we can address the emissions being produced by the agriculture sector.  The first of those was to reduce the methane and nitrous oxide emissions produced by the agriculture sector.  This would involve lowering the emissions produced by animals, animal waste and the application of synthetic fertilisers.  The second mitigation pathway is sequestering carbon, which, in large part, involves increased afforestation.  The third mitigation pathway is energy efficiency, biofuels and bioenergy.  It mainly involves biofuels and bioenergy production.  In other words, we want to reduce the overall energy usage on farms.  I caution that energy usage on farms is a relatively small share of the total emissions produced by agriculture.  The focus in this area is on biofuel and bioenergy production and what farmers could do that would result in the displacement of fossil fuel emissions.</p> <p> We produced three associated marginal abatement cost curves, MACCs.  It is easier to focus on the figures on the right, rather than dwelling on the detail on the left.  The key point about these three marginal abatement cost curves is that very few of the individual measures are large in size.  We have identified those that are large in size in yellow for the benefit of members.  In the three marginal abatement cost curves we can see that many of the measures are small in size.  This reflects the fact that there is no silver bullet to address emissions being produced by the agriculture sector.  We will need to continue to attack this issue from a whole range of angles.  The first of the two key figures shown is the dairy economic breeding index, EBI, which is geared to producing dairy cows that have superior performance.  That is one of the ways we can address methane emissions produced by dairy cows.  The second key figure is on changing the fertiliser type that is used.  We can change to fertilisers that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p> When we take into account the mitigation I just outlined in terms of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, we can see what this does to the curve in the future.  Members can see a projection out to 2030 in the absence of any mitigation, which would see the emission level for the agriculture sector to 20.5 million tonnes.  We also have the mitigation that we identified which brings the figure to 7% below the 2005 level, as opposed to 9% above that level, by 2030.  I should emphasise a point of which members are probably aware.  While the focus of my submission is 2030, progress towards the 2030 target has to be achieved on an annual basis.  We cannot continue as we are until 2029 and achieve all the mitigation in 2030.  The way the system works is that countries are basically assessed in terms of emission reductions from 2021 through to 2030.  This also highlights that early action on mitigation is particularly useful because it is important to get onto a good pathway towards achieving the 2030 target.  This is the mitigation associated with methane and nitrous oxide emissions produced by the agriculture sector.</p> <p> Figure 2 is the MACC associated with land use sequestration.  The main source of emission reductions within this category is forestry.  I should have emphasised in my previous point that we are looking at the mean level of mitigation, that is, the average level of mitigation achieved between 2021 and 2030.  This will ultimately be what our success will be measured against in respect of addressing greenhouse gas emission reductions.  A key point is that forestry is, by a long distance, the most significant sequestration source.  This is based on planting rates for forestry of about 7,000 ha per year.  Ireland's planting or afforestation rate is only about 4,000 ha per year at the moment.  We are, therefore, below target and even below the assumption we are making for the purposes of this exercise.  Forestry is a long-term game.  While we are thinking about targets for 2020 and 2030, we should probably also have in our minds targets that will exist beyond that point, out to 2040 and 2050.  Having trees in place in the short term would have significant benefits in the longer term beyond 2030.  That is an important point.</p> <p> Figure 3 is the MACC for energy efficiency, bioenergy and biofuels.  The energy efficiency component is relatively small.  I mentioned already that energy emissions by the agriculture sector are not particularly significant as a share of the total emissions produced by the sector.  The largest single contributor here is wood biomass for energy.  This covers thinnings from forestry and some residues used to produce electricity and fuel for heat.</p> <p> When we accumulate all of these mitigation actions together, the summary figure shows the mean level of mitigation and the level of mitigation by the time we reach 2030.  We can also see the figures on the level of emissions before mitigation is considered.  That is the first significant row of figures on the slide.  Taking all of these into consideration, the agriculture sector could be producing a total level of mitigation of some 7.7 million tonnes by 2030.  It is important to emphasise, however, that the final category on energy mitigation would not be credited to agriculture on the basis of the way the accounting system works for the greenhouse gas inventory.</p> <p> On the costs associated with mitigation, most of the mitigation actions we have identified cost less than &euro;50 per tonne to achieve.  That is just our assumption for the purposes of this exercise as to what the cost of carbon would be.  We could also say that the agriculture mitigation, which is the first of the three categories of mitigation I referred to, is generally cheaper to achieve than the mitigation associated with land use and bioenergy production.  On the figures for costs, there is considerable uncertainty around bioenergy in particular.  It is very difficult to determine the extent to which farmers will be interested in moving into bioenergy.  For this reason, we are less confident in respect of the figure we have produced for bioenergy production than we are in respect of the other figures in the presentation.</p> <p> This submissions is the product of contributions by about 20 individuals.  I am just a spokesperson and I will endeavour to answer questions to the best of my ability but I am sure there will be some on which I will have respond in writing. </p></speech>

Mr. Donnellan is here to give members a briefing in advance of meeting the farming organisations.  I ask that members limit questions to points of clarification around the Teagasc report.  That would be very useful.  We will try to limit the time for lead questioners to five minutes and other questioners to three minutes.</p> <p>This report will be very important in drawing up our report in the end of January.  Based on Teagasc's interactions with the farming community, what are the challenges and barriers to rolling out the findings of the Teagasc report to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions?  What incentives or supports should the Government provide to help implement the report and reduce greenhouse gas emissions?</p></speech>

We need to address the level of understanding of what farmers need to do to mitigate emissions.  There is some understanding of this but it can always be improved.  Teagasc is active in that area.  We have an aid called a carbon navigator which is designed to assist farmers in identifying ways in which they could address their emissions.  Communications would certainly be one of the issues we have identified.  Without farmers understanding what they need to do, it will be difficult for some mitigation actions to take hold.</p>  <p>  Some of the mitigation actions are much easier to explain and implement than others.  Some are more complex and require farmers to develop skills that they may not yet have.  Some of them, as I also identified, are probably more significant in terms of the emission reductions that they produce.  It may be relevant to focus in the short term on some of the bigger emission reduction actions we have identified.</p>  <p>  On policy, the upcoming reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, creates an opportunity in the sense that there is some national level scope now to design aspects of the CAP, with the agreement of Brussels, that can address specific concerns that member states have.  Some of the environmental concerns would  be to the fore for Ireland.</p></speech>

That is above my pay grade, as they say.  Resources are always welcome in this regard.  If we delay in achieving some emission reductions, that will make it all the more difficult to achieve the 2030 target, or get anywhere near it.  The sooner we begin on a pathway towards emission reduction, the better.</p></speech>

We did a MACC in 2012 as well.  Having said that, what has happened in recent years with respect to the development of Irish agriculture following quota elimination is that with the increase in agricultural activity is even greater than many of the most optimistic people would have suggested.  The associated level of emissions is higher than we would have anticipated as well.  This is not a finished product.  We will have to come back and do this again.</p></speech>

The number of cattle in the country could stabilise rather than increase in the future.  Mr. Donnellan's presentation refers to achieving more efficiency and refers to "better before bigger" coming into tune more than in the past.  Prior to the abolition of milk quotas, there may have been a serious push to increase cattle numbers.  Mr. Donnellan also spoke about the economic breeding index, EBI, which is crucial.  We will see more production from smaller numbers.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

My expectation is that we will see more produced by each dairy cow, but we will probably also see more dairy cows in the future.  That is baked into all of the scenarios we are looking at here.  The level of profitability that is in the dairy sector is so high, relative to other sectors, that expansion of the sector is inevitable and arguably desirable from an economic point of view.  The question ultimately becomes one of what happens to the other part of the cattle population, the breeding and suckler herd.  Whether that stays the same size in the future or decreases in size is the question.  I cannot see it growing in size in future.  That will be a key factor in terms of what will be the total level of cattle population in the future and what will be the total level of emissions.</p></speech>

I agree with his statement that there is no silver bullet.  At the same time, some of the measures are common sense and would not take an awful lot to push forward.  Is more incentivisation required to achieve those targets?  Should we show more carrot than stick in our approach to this?</p></speech>

Returning to the answer I gave to the previous question, awareness of what farmers need to do in the first instance is critically important.  Measures that do not cost farmers money, in some sense, are the ones that farmers should look to adopt in any event.</p> <p>Some of the measures we have identified potentially save farmers money by increasing their profitability.  Farmers should be looking at these measures, apart from the fact that they help to mitigate emissions.  </p> <p> Some of the measures we have looked at are quite expensive.  I had not mentioned that earlier but some also have the dual benefit of addressing ammonia emissions, which is another important environmental target that agriculture faces as well.  That is almost as an aside but it is important in the context of the emissions mitigation actions we have identified. </p></speech>

In my opinion there has been a general lack of communications about what has been achieved to date.  A great deal has been achieved and we must consider what can be achieved by following some of the strategies Mr. Donnellan has outlined today.  Has Teagasc a strategy in place to try to inform, enlighten and encourage farmers on how to achieve some of these targets?</p></speech>

How can we marry CAP reform to Food Wise 2025 targets to increase agricultural exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025 and create an extra 20,000 odd jobs, which the economy needs and the exports are very important as well?

The serious deliberations in terms of what the next CAP reform will actually look like in a broad sense, not just from an environmental sense, have not started in Ireland in a meaningful way at this point in time.  We will be active in that space and we will be open to informing all stakeholders in terms of scenario analysis of different possibilities.  Our position is that we do not prescribe policies, we look for people to come to us with suggestions of policy because we do not want to be put into the position of being policy advocates.</p></speech>

I will watch a replay of the full presentation and I read Mr. Donnellan's slides with real interest.</p>  <p>  Our job is to help the State in this major herculean task of meeting its climate change ambitions.  The more we can come up with concept block ideas on which we can get agreement, the more we can help the State.  I recognise the good work that Teagasc has done in agriculture, for example Dr. Rogier Schulte's study in 2012, which recognises that environmental care and farming community interests are going to go hand in hand into the future and that profits will increase the more we look after the environment.  Should we take that concept to the national scale and think that we need a national land-use plan that thinks in detail in the next 20 to 40 years as to what type of farming we do and where we should do it, what type of forestry and where we should do that, how do we protect biodiversity, how do we restore wetlands and, to revert to research by UCC on grass to gas, how much do we need and how that affect the land-use plans?  Has Teagasc a land-use plan in mind?  Is work being done on a land-use plan?  Would that be a useful contribution and a really strong detailed one to the task we have ahead of us?</p></speech>

What the Deputy is suggesting is quite prescriptive.  I may be taking a wrong interpretation, but it sounds to me as though the Deputy is suggesting that we effectively determine what happens in different parts of the county.  I think what would be more effective and more realistic is to work with the circumstances as they exist.  We have a situation where agriculture is driven by market forces to some degree and by policy forces to some degree.  When I say policy, I mean agriculture supports provided for by Brussels.  That is the framework from which we must begin in terms of looking at what can be achieved in the future.  I cannot think of any instance in a western country where people are going down to the level of detail of prescribing what type of activity should happen in a particular hectare of land.  I do not know if that is a realistic objective.  We need to bear in mind that there are 140,000 farmers in the country.  It is a different process from looking at what six factories might be doing.  The heterogeneity that exists in terms of agriculture is critically important as well.  I think we would be much better off to focus on measures that farmers would be more willing to buy into, that is, things that farmers understood as opposed to being very highly prescriptive in terms of telling farmers that they are doing X and they should now be doing Y.</p></speech>

I have no intention of telling farmers because they know the land better than anyone and they are business people and have to make business decisions, taking into account everything that is happening.  I think we need a land-use strategy plan to shape the policies that give farmers the payments and the signals for what we want done.  For example, the need for this would be influenced by what seems to me to be one of the best ways we can get beyond 2030.  While much of the forestry we have done already will account for the mitigation we do between now and 2030, we need to be thinking in terms of post 2030.  The best analysis I have read from Teagasc in the recent report on showing the 27 emissions, was toward the end of the report where it states we need in the region of 20,000 ha per annum of afforestation to meet our future targets.  That matches the analysis that I would have done in terms of the scale of ambition in forestry.  We know that in counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon and elsewhere, we are not going to be able to tell people to set 20,000 ha of Sitka Spruce monoculture, which would have implications for the soil and so on.  My sense of a national land-use plan is that we would know how much might we get in agriforestry in a land-use plan to help people to decide.  Similarly, I recognise that the country is very different.  Having talked to people such as Dr. Rogier Schulte for many years, I am aware that what is happening in the north and west of the county regarding soil, climate, the nature of farming and the nature of farms is totally different from what is happening in the Golden Vale.  A land-use plan would assist in laying the policy determination of how we would pay the farmers in the north west, instead of leaving the farmers in the west and north to compete with the farmer in the Golden Vale, as if all the land was the same and the market will sort it out.  The benefit of a national land-use plan is that it can pay farmers for protecting biodiversity, managing water, for training young farmers, for storing carbon and so on.  One leaves it up to the farmer how to do it but to give them the signal, one needs a land-use plan to know what the signals are.</p></speech>

The concern I have - again this reflects the remit of this committee - is that the pressure is most acute in respect of greenhouse gas emissions but we know we have other objectives to which we want agriculture to be able to contribute and deliver.  Having a more holistic view of what agriculture should be delivering for Ireland from an environmental perspective is critically important in the context of assessing what it can do in respect of greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p> We are in a difficult place at present in regard to intensive agricultural activity.  I do not think we have significantly intensive agriculture in this country, certainly nothing by comparison with what would be found in the US.  We have aspects of agriculture which are more intensive and more focused on delivering profit from the marketplace and agriculture which is more focused on the delivery of environmental goods.  We are telling both groups of farmers that they are doing one thing correctly and the other thing wrong.  We are telling farmers who are not making very much money but are farming at low intensity that they need to intensify their production and become more profitable and similarly we are telling farmers who are quite profitable that they are not doing enough in terms of consideration for the environment.  Perhaps we should consider that both groups are delivering on two different objectives, both of which are important from the perspective of Irish agriculture.  If that is something that policymakers decide is important, then perhaps it should be reflected in a policy that evolves in the future.  Beating everybody over the head and telling them that they are doing something wrong and telling others they are also doing it wrong, that one farmer needs to be more like the other person in one respect and his counterpart needs to be more like the other farmer in a different respect, could be counterproductive.  I do not know if we can deliver a situation where every single farm is delivering on the objective of producing a significant level of income from the marketplace and simultaneously doing 100% of what it could from the environmental perspective.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions on the report.  My colleague, Deputy Deering alluded to the cattle numbers.  Since we started on this committee, everybody has been trying to predict the future and to say what we should be doing, and we are all trying to look forward, which is nigh on impossible.  What can we learn from looking back at what we have done?  Based on the cattle figures, it is a fact that the agriculture sector decreased the greenhouse emissions from 1990 to 2016 by 3.5%.  In the middle of that period, 1998, cattle figures were in excess of 7.5 million.  What did we stop doing?  What can we learn from looking back?  What were we doing right at that point?  Was it due to the production process?  Was it the result of farming style, farming habits or a change in farming philosophy, in that there was much more mixed farming at that time and we now seem to have moved away from tillage?</p>  <p>  I see from the report that tillage is in the mitigating sector.  What are the proposals for tillage going forward?  Where would the beet crop come into that?  Would beet be grown with a view to biofuel production or whatever?  At this stage I get nervous analysing reports because we have to wonder if we are wasting our time because so many of them seem to end up on shelves.  At what stage are the Teagasc reports, what is Teagasc working on at present and at what stage are its communications with the Department?  Teagasc is the research wing of the Department.  What communications has it had since it published its report?  It is a fabulous report but what is the Department's position on it at this stage?  Has it started to buy in?  What is the next level the Department intends taking it to?  I assume the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has already looked at the Teagasc report.  I wonder about its position on it.</p>  <p>  Will Mr. Donnellan give a brief summation of where the report stands in comparison with similar reports that would have been done in other countries?  I am coming from the angle of carbon leakage.  Mr. Donnellan has made the point that we have to take a global holistic approach.  If  we tick all the boxes, plant the entire country in forest, we will still not solve the global problem.  We will make it worse in cases because the food we produce so efficiently will be produced elsewhere with a far greater carbon footprint.  How does the report that Teagasc did on Ireland compare with a report that it would do on South America, eastern Europe or wherever?</p></speech>

The simple answer as to why emissions have increased in recent years is because we have had an increase in activity in the dairy sector and an increase in the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which are also an emission source.  Historically, one of the things we achieved was a very significant reduction in the amount of nitrogen-based fertiliser that is used.  That is forgotten to some degree, but over the period of ten or 15 years, we reduced the amount of nitrogen fertiliser we used in agriculture in Ireland by between 25% to 30%.  That was one of the contributors to the stabilisation in greenhouse gas emission reductions and even a reduction in some years in the level of greenhouse gas emissions that were achieved historically.</p>  <p>  On the question of what Teagasc is doing in terms of communication, it is too much from my perspective.  During the summer when we launched the report, I travelled around the country in the height of the heatwave, with a broken air conditioning system in my car, presenting this report in a range of different forms.  We had a very large stakeholder event which was organised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Kilkenny with probably about 200 people at it, some of whom are in the Gallery today, where we discussed in detail what was in the report.  We also had briefings for smaller fora, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other interested stakeholders from different sections of the agrifood sector.  We have done a great deal in terms of communications.</p>  <p>  The use of sugar beet for ethanol production was raised.  Different groups have expressed some interest in doing that in recent years.  I think it would depend on the yield.  It would depend on where the sugar beet plant was located as well as where the sugar beet was grown because one would want to economise on transportation costs.  It depends ultimately on the level of oil prices.  If oil prices were very high, the price of ethanol would be high and that would make for a product that is probably more likely to be profitable.  It depends on sets of circumstances, only some of which we have control over.</p>  <p>  I was asked to contextualise the report in terms of what is happening internationally in terms of transparency.  From our work, the agriculture sector nationally is very transparent on where emissions could get to in the future and the potential solutions that will address these emissions.  While agriculture gets unfavourable mention in commentary about climate change, there is a very high level of understanding on greenhouse gas emissions.  I guess that greenhouse gas emissions are of interest in other countries.  A key point is that agricultural emissions as a share of total emissions in other EU member states in general is much lower.  The average in terms of greenhouse gas emissions produced by agriculture in other EU member states is only about 10%, whereas in Ireland, as members are aware, it is 33%.</p> <p>That results in a different level of political emphasis on reducing agricultural emissions in Ireland by comparison with those in many other countries.  Obviously, in countries such as New Zealand agricultural emissions also comprise a very high share of the total.  Countries concerned about addressing agricultural emissions will be engaged in this type of MAC analysis.  It requires a good scientific understanding and capacity which not every country has.  The reality is that for our type of agriculture which is bovine based, we are in the premier league in terms of emissions efficiency.  At the same time, bovine agriculture generates more emissions than other forms of agriculture.  This is related to a point I made previously.  It would not be very sensible to try to engineer a situation where every country in the world had the same type of agricultural output.  There are natural reasons Ireland in largely involved in bovine agriculture.  They include climate and topography.  Ireland is never going to be like the Paris basin where the tillage sector is dominant.  In Ireland we just do not have the type of land, climate or farm size to switch dramatically to other types of agriculture.  Therefore, we will continue to have a bovine-based agriculture sector.  Therefore, it is inevitable in some sense that agricultural emissions will comprise a higher share of total emissions than in other European countries.</p></speech>

As we all know, agriculture and transport are very often portrayed as the villains, but it is important to state at the outset of the discussion that agriculture and farming reacted to demand.  Food demand stimulated growth in agriculture, to which farmers were only reacting.</p>  <p>  Senator Daly has alluded to the period in which there was no growth and no opportunity for it in dairy production.  Therefore, we have a set of figures and information that probably do not reflect the true position on the expansion of dairy production, which was explosive.  The sector has been portrayed in a poor light, which is unfair.</p>  <p>  Mr. Donnellan has mentioned what could really make a difference by way of mitigation in agriculture.  On estimated breeding value, EBV, we all know that better performing and more efficient animals help our case.</p>  <p>  An interesting concept associated with forestry has been raised a number of times at this committee.  I made the point at an earlier meeting today that when forestry was mentioned to farmers, it was a little like saying to the those in attendance that if they made the windows of their houses smaller, they would be more efficient and conserve more heat.  That is radical and represents a long-term, significant change.  In a similar vein, planting a forest represents as radical a shift to farmers and I understand why they have difficulties with it.</p>  <p>  Let me refer to something we sometimes miss in this debate.  Reference has been made to our ability to grow grass.  This is arguably the second best grass growing region in the world.  Actively growing productive grass would sequester a lot of carbon.  I am led to believe 15 cm of topsoil sequesters as much carbon as a tropical rainforest.  In other parts of the world forest plantation can present a challenge owing to arid conditions.  This is the result of carbon loading and the risk of fire.  As much as planting forestry is an option, has there been enough emphasis placed on actively managing productive farmland and pasture?  That, in itself, would sequester a lot of carbon.  Mr. Donnellan has mentioned the impact of fertiliser and referred to making the shift from calcium ammonium nitrate to urea.  I am led to believe this is subject to the pH value being right.  It is not a simple switch, as sometimes portrayed.  If we are to make a shift to using urea, especially urea with inhibitors, we have to manage pH values.  Therefore, more lime would have to be spread on land.  Is there a risk in some of these discussions that we will oversimplify solutions?  Is the matter not more complex than very often portrayed?</p></speech>

There is an issue in Ireland with fertiliser use in the sense that farmers probably do not place as much emphasis as they should on soil testing from an economic point of view.  It will identify issues such as pH level and the requirement to use lime.  There is a general issue in Ireland owing to not enough lime being applied to agricultural land.  The consequence is that fertiliser is less effective than it could be.  Lime is not particularly expensive and having the right pH level can actually reduce the amount of fertiliser required.  I do not believe it is particularly challenging for farmers to understand, but at the same time we would like many more farmers to engage in soil testing.  It is an area in which progress certainly needs to be made.</p>  <p>  The question on the sequestration levels associated with grass and forestry is more scientific and beyond my personal remit.  As I am coming from an economic background, I cannot answer it for the Senator, but we may be able to follow up on it in written correspondence.</p></speech>

Having said that, we were quite active in the period before the milk quota was eliminated in emphasising to policymakers elsewhere in Europe that agricultural emissions in Ireland were going to increase in the short term because we knew that the dairy sector was going to expand considerably after the milk quota was removed.  The difficulty was that policymakers elsewhere in Europe were a little circumspect about it.  They did not believe expansion to the extent that it occurred was feasible.  They had a very poor picture of the dairy sector in Ireland from a competitiveness point of view, but we did as much as we could to put them right on the issue.</p> <p> There was a question about carbon sequestration.  The main mechanism we have identified is forestry or afforestation.  It dwarfs all other carbon sequestration measures we have identified.</p> <p> Carbon budgeting is a difficult issue.  I mentioned that there were 140,000 farms in Ireland.  How could we ever measure with certainty, by which I mean with 100% certainty, to the level of a breathalyser test or a blood test to measure alcohol levels, the level of emissions a farm was producing?  We can approximate the level of emissions it is producing based on the number of animals, fertiliser usage and so on.  We do this as part of the national farm survey.  However, we can never tell with 100% certainty what the level of emissions will be.  When we are talking about trying to reduce emissions, being 100% certain about the level of emissions being produced on a farm and in determining whether they have gone down is challenging and rather expensive.  It would have to be done for every farm in the country.  I suggest that, as a mechanism to address emissions, it could be prohibitively expensive.</p> <p> It could also be difficult, given that the science is evolving all the time.  I could claim today that the emissions from farm X in 2015 were X amount.  However, if the science evolves, we might get a more accurate picture of what we believe the emissions were.  When that happens, it leads to a complete revision of all of the estimates made historically and we could have a revision of the calculations for a farm.  A revision could suggest the emissions from a farm in year X were actually higher than estimated.  That would be rather contentious for farmers.  We may have to say to them we figured the emissions were X amount but the science is telling us that they are X amount plus 5% and that they will have to work even harder to reduce them in the future.  That could be counterproductive from the perspective of creating trust and a buy-in if we want to reduce emissions.  It could be counterproductive to try to assess the level of emissions produced on each individual farm to that level of detail.  Expense and controversy are relevant in that respect.</p> <p> Some people like organic farming.  It can deliver environmental benefits, but I contest the view that it actually reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  Ultimately, it means that there are lower emissions from a farm, but there is also lower output from it.  It is producing lower emissions, but it is also producing less food.  When we factor that in, ultimately, we may find that it is actually producing higher emissions per unit of output.  An organic farm potentially has a bigger carbon footprint &ndash; I trust committee members understand what I am saying &ndash; than a conventional farm.  Organic farming is not a silver bullet, but certainly it has a place.  That brings me back to my earlier comment that we need to think in an holistic way, not only on the single issue of climate change but also about what we want agriculture to deliver for the economy as a whole.  Organic farming is relevant, but seeing it as something we should pursue uniquely to address greenhouse gas emissions could be misplaced.</p></speech>

I said we were a little concerned about one area with respect to the report we had produced.  Persuading farmers to become involved in producing a new crop is challenging.  Like anyone who engages in an activity from a business perspective, farmers want to be confident that if they are to produce something, someone will buy it from them at a price they consider to be attractive or one they envisage is possible.  Who is going to buy it?  Where is the market for this produce?  That is a concern farmers would have.</p>  <p>  Another concern farmers would have is acquiring the skill set required to grow the particular crop.  There is a misconception is some quarters than an individual farmer knows how to engage in any type of farming.  That is not the case.  A plumber cannot fix my car and a carpenter cannot plumb my house.  There are different types of farming and some skill sets are common to all forms, while others are far more specific.  There is also a skill set to be acquired.  That is another aspect.  Farmers would need to be confident that they could grow the crop and achieve the yield they would expect to achieve in order that the crop could be sold and have commercial value.  The supply chain is important in that respect.</p></speech>

Some have asked why in 1995 we were able to have 7 million cattle and now all of a sudden it is a problem.  Let us consider the reports, especially the most recent report from the Environmental Protection Agency.  We can see that the emissions from the herd are actually growing.  If I have it right, the EPA projects that by 2020 agriculture will account for 33% of emissions.  That figure is projected to rise to 34.5% by 2030.  If we combine Teagasc's presentation with the previous one and think about the graph in terms of where our problem is in not reaching our targets, agriculture is a major part of the picture and, in turn, the size of the herd.  This is something we have to tackle.  </p><p>Mr. Donnellan has said there is a desirable economic outcome from increasing the size of t he herd and the output from each bovine creature.  I accept that there is a desirable economic outcome for some farmers, but I do not believe that is the case for all of them.  In its last presentation Teagasc illustrated clearly to us that a significant tranche of farmers lived in poverty and struggled on low incomes.  Many of them find it difficult to cope with the pressure to increase their herd.  They have told me personally - I have also witnessed it - that it is coming from all quarters, including the Department, the IFA and the journals they read, including the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.  The view is increasing one's herd is the way to go, but that is not of great economic benefit to those who operate on a smaller scale and have the least income.  It is especially the case in the context of climate change and when we move from drought to flood and the fodder crisis when farmers have to watch the catastrophic deaths of animals on their farms.  That must be so awful for them because it is a major financial loss, as well as a major tragedy for them.  That cohort has to be thought about.</p><p>I am not convinced that it would be that difficult to convince farmers to shift to more sustainable methods of farming.  That is why I am keen to ask Mr. Donnellan about this matter further.  We are to hear a presentation later by the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  Has Teagasc held discussions with it?  Is it on its radar in the context of how farmers should move forward and how it should communicate and convince them to make changes in how they farm?</p><p>There is also the idea that we can grow the herd and at the same time reduce emissions.  That is a glaring contradiction, which I do not accept.  I know that Teagasc's representatives do not accept it either, but some think that because we are increasing the herd, we are simultaneously more efficient in reducing emissions.  There is a glaring contradiction.</p><p>Mr. Donnellan has said a lot about afforestation being a major part of the solution.  Let us suppose that is the case, but it is only a proposal, on which I am keen to hear a comment on from him.  Perhaps this is above his pay grade, but would it be sensible for the Government to pay farmers to engage in afforestation, rather than buying carbon offsets or engaging in carbon trading?</p></speech>

I said, specifically, that dairy farming was highly profitable.  That is not the only form of farming in Ireland that involves cattle and it is actually the minority.  There are about 17,000 farmers in Ireland who would describe themselves as dairy farmers.  Most cattle in Ireland are on what we call cattle farms, either suckler farms or farms that specialise in bringing cattle to a finishing age for slaughter.  In a broad sense, those cattle farms are not particularly profitable.  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on that.  Cattle farms tend to be smaller than dairy farms and some of them, historically, were dairy farms.  The change from dairy production came about because it was found that the work involved was too arduous or the farm was too small to provide an income.  Many of those cattle farmers also have off-farm employment as well.  Some of them certainly are limited in their income sources while for others the agricultural income is only one source of income and their spouse may be working or they may be working off-farm themselves.  There are also some farms where the income from agriculture is the only income source and it is not very large.  I agree those are the farms in acute difficulty from an income perspective.</p>  <p>  Having said that, we have many cattle farms in this country.  It is difficult to see how we can address the issue of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions without involving all of the farmers in this country who have cattle on their farms, whether those are dairy cows or beef animals.  While cattle farms do not generate as many emissions as dairy farms, there are many more of them than dairy farms.  If it is left to the dairy sector alone to resolve the issue of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, then there is not going to be a very satisfactory outcome.</p>  <p>  I am open to correction on this, but I believe we met the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association only about three or four weeks ago in our offices in Athenry in County Galway.  The question on afforestation is interesting.  In the ordinary run of things with the Common Agricultural Policy, if we are going to spend money on any new or different scheme, such as the one suggested involving an annual payment just to have trees existing indefinitely on farms, then the money for that has to come from somewhere.  The same applies in respect of increasing the level of money spent on such a scheme.  In that context, the money probably has to come from somewhere else within the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy envelope available to Ireland.  There are options available where the State can co-fund schemes to some degree.</p>  <p>  That is one of the first difficulties.  If farmers were asked tomorrow whether they would like money for planting trees they would say "yes".  If they were told, however, that it was just going to be a reallocation of money they are already receiving for doing other things, then there might not be the same interest.</p></speech>

Without actually saying anything, perhaps Mr. Donnellan can give us the answers.  I see the Department as being very limited in what it is doing.  It seems to be completely hung up on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The next opportunity for anything to happen will be the new CAP in 2020.  We should be making sure now we get the right environmental aspects into that CAP, and all aspects of the CAP, to ensure it responds to the problems we have discussed.  If we do not do it then, it is going to be lost and we have to be realistic.  The only time farmers are going to respond is within the CAP.  Will Mr. Donnellan comment, insofar as he can, on how the Department deals with the research information it gets from Teagasc and how accepting it is of the role of Teagasc, because what Mr. Donnellan is saying is very useful and interesting?</p>  <p>  On the graph Mr. Donnellan referred to earlier, in scenario one or two of those Mr. Donnellan said we should be examining, what would be the impact of a model where the herd was reduced by 500,000 along with that?  What difference would that make and what would the impact be on farmers?  That is a key consideration.  In the context of my own work as a Deputy in Donegal, cattle farmers do not make money and they depend on social welfare to make an income.  Farmers who keep sheep, however, do much better and there seems to be more money to be made from sheep, somewhat bizarrely.  Could farmers change over from cattle to sheep?  It seems that would have a positive impact on emissions and it is also a traditional type of farming that people are still involved in and know as well.  How feasible is that?</p></speech>

Just last week, we produced our income estimates for 2018 in agriculture and our forecasts for next year.  One of the things we highlighted at our conference last week was this progressive improvement over time in the profitability of sheep production.  The better sheep farmers, in particular, are returning fairly significant margins at this stage.  The difficulty in thinking about farmers transitioning into sheep production is that, compared with keeping beef animals, it is a labour-intensive activity.  I had discussions with staff in our own organisation in recent days, especially those who meet farmers and collect economic data from them.  One of the points they made was that sheep farmers are increasingly an ageing population.  Regarding those farmers, despite sheep production becoming more profitable relative to beef production, we might still continue to see them leaving sheep production.  That is purely because it is a labour-intensive sector and, as farmers get older, that aspect of the business makes it unattractive, especially if there is no successor to take over the farm.</p></speech>

Being a beef farmer is more compatible with having a full-time off-farm job than being a sheep farmer.  Sheep farming is particularly demanding in respect of labour at particular times of the year, especially at lambing time, and that is a consideration.</p>  <p>  On reducing the herd by 500,000, Deputy Pringle did not clarify which herd he was talking about.  If it is the breeding herd, looking at scenario six from the chart, that involves a significant reduction in the size of the suckler herd, which is the less profitable part of cattle production in Ireland.</p> <p>It would involve the lowest future level of cattle.  I will display on the screen the corresponding data with respect to emissions before the mitigation option is factored in.  As the dairy sector continues to expand, the smaller the suckler herd, the fewer total emissions from agriculture in general.  This is a contentious issue because although beef production is not particularly profitable, there has not been a significant exodus from suckler production.  The number of suckler cows has fallen by approximately 8% over the past three or four years but the figure is higher than we expected five or ten years ago.</p> <p> On engagement, when I started working for Teagasc more than 20 years ago, evidence-based policymaking did not have the same foothold it currently does.  That probably holds true across Government.  Much of my background and training in terms of my work is derived from the US and the way economists engage with policymakers there.  It has been relatively successful in the sense that we have significant engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on issues it is unable to answer from an analytical perspective.  We provide that input to the Department.</p></speech>

Member states are being given greater discretion with respect to how they shape the Common Agricultural Policy to meet the specific needs of a member state.  At a European level in Brussels, the environmental dimension is centre stage with respect to agriculture.  The deliberations of this committee on agriculture are not unique in that regard.  The interaction of agriculture with the environment will be very prominent in the next CAP.</p></speech>

The station in Edenderry is currently co-fired.  What is the potential for Irish producers to supply that biomass?  What would be involved in developing a supply chain in the midlands, namely, counties such as Longford, Laois, Offaly and Westmeath?  I ask Mr. Donnellan to keep his answers brief because other witnesses are waiting to give evidence.</p>  <p>  The willow scheme was not a success.  I do not know the detail of the matter and have been trying to gain an understanding of what happened.  Was the failure due to the type of land that was being used?  What crop should we use for biomass?</p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, today stated on a radio programme that emissions from agriculture could be halved if we did the right things.  Does Mr. Donnellan agree with that statement?</p></speech>

It is not an area on which I claim to have any expertise.  We may be able to revert to the committee with a response on that issue.  The earlier forays into the use of miscanthus were not especially successful for several reasons.  I would prefer to be able to provide the committee with a more comprehensive answer on that issue.</p>  <p>  I do not know the timescale for halving agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.  As stated in the previous session, it is very difficult for us to know with any certainty what scientific breakthroughs will emerge in the coming ten, 15 or 20 years.  Based on current knowledge and technology, it is very hard to see how we could halve agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland without doing something very differently in terms of the type of agriculture we have.  The only way to achieve that reduction by 2030 or 2040 in the absence of any dramatic scientific breakthrough would be for the agriculture sector to be far less focused on the bovine sector in favour of crop-based agriculture, for example.  It is difficult to see how that would materialise.</p></speech>

How realistic is it for sugar beet to be used a covering crop for up to four or five months of the year?  Typically, there was a covering crop from late June until December.</p></speech>

The specific example offered in the report addresses the use of mustard as the cover crop.  Some farmers in Ireland still grow sugar beet or fodder beet as an animal feed.  If the Deputy is asking about sugar beet as a crop that will not be used for animal feed, the issue might come back to the supply chain.  It depends on what the crop will ultimately be used for.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions.  I have read the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, FAPRI, model outlined by Teagasc and questioned members of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who appeared before the committee on it.  A representative of Teagasc may have been present.  The model is quite bleak in terms of what we are trying to achieve across all of the scenarios that have been mentioned and the mitigation measures.  Where is Ireland on the graph referred to by Mr. Donnellan?  Towards the conclusion of his statement he outlined that there is mitigation potential but it is only on paper.  What substantive action is being taken in that regard?  Are any mitigation measures being taken in an attempt to reduce the curve that he outlined?  The FAPRI model is quite bleak when one takes the entire sector into account.</p></speech>

This is an unfortunate reality in terms of some of the projections we have produced from an economic perspective.</p> <p>The issue at present is that the dairy sector has expanded quite rapidly over recent years and the extent of that expansion over a five or six-year period is never going to be repeated.  We are never going to have the percentage increase in the size of the dairy sector ever again, in my view.  That was the handbrake coming off and the engine running at full revs.  The situation we have seen in recent years is that emissions are going up in aggregate, and emissions efficiency is improving.  The carbon footprint per unit of product is actually improving, but at a lower rate than the growth in the total amount of what is being produced.  That is why the emissions continue to go up, and not because nobody cares or nobody is doing anything.  It is more on the basis that we are producing more.  There is a global requirement to produce more food.  The issue ultimately that we have to understand in some sense the extent to which Ireland is going to contribute to meeting the increase in global food demand.  Global food demand in terms of growth is very high.  My expectation is that the percentage increase in production in a developed country like Ireland is not going to match the level of growth internationally.  Developed countries themselves will probably have to service some of that growth.</p> <p> We are somewhat unique in Europe in the sense of our agriculture sector producing more output, and significantly more so in the case of dairy production over recent years.  No other country in Europe has done something like that.  We are different.  Whether it is a good different or a bad different is a question for policymakers to decide because the development that has happened in the dairy sector has been quite valuable from an economic perspective.  It is not desirable from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, but as politicians know very well, there are multiple objectives that we are trying to achieve across the economy.  It is not all about greenhouse gas mitigation or economic growth in the agriculture sector.  There has to be a medium found that balances those different objectives.</p></speech>

The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society is the umbrella body for the co-operative movement in Ireland.  We represent a range of co-operative enterprises operating across many aspects of the rural economy, including dairy processing and milk purchasing societies, livestock marts, breed societies, animal health and artificial insemination, AI, horticulture, forestry, financial services and other rural-based societies.</p>  <p>  In a few short months, ICOS will mark its 125th anniversary.  I make reference to this milestone merely to illustrate that the co-operative business model is a sustainable one that has served the interests of Irish farmers, their families and rural communities very well across many generations and through some very difficult times.  There is no doubt that Brexit is at the forefront of all our minds at present, and in the most recent developments over recent days, the uncertainties are there as strong as they were two years ago.</p>  <p>  It is no exaggeration to state, however, that environmental sustainability, be it climate change, ammonia emissions, water quality and biodiversity, are of equal if not greater importance to the agrifood sector.</p> <p>The recent special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change related to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is extremely stark.  It calls for rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.  At ICOS, we strongly believe that the co-operative model will be an important vehicle to assist the rural economy with future challenges in this area, for example, through the development of community-based renewable energy projects.</p> <p> The ancillary recommendations by the Citizens' Assembly rightly recognises the importance of agriculture to the economy, especially to the rural economy.  The agrifood sector provided 174,000 jobs or almost 8% of total employment in 2017.  Total agrifood exports were worth &euro;13.5 billion in 2017, with exports of dairy and dairy ingredients valued at &euro;4.02 billion.  An analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young has indicated that additional milk production equates to 90 cent of additional economic benefit for every additional litre of milk produced.  This multiplier effect is due to spending by co-operatives and on farms, spending by service providers to the dairy industry, and spending by those employed in the dairy sector.  The analysis concludes that additional milk production from 2016 to 2020 will result in a &euro;2.7 billion benefit to the economy or &euro;540 million annually.  There is simply no other industry generating wealth, investment and jobs to this significant scale in rural Ireland.</p> <p> Dairy farming provides a sustainable livelihood, despite extreme volatility in income from one year to the next.  It is a legitimate aspiration by farmers to develop the potential of their farm enterprises fully to secure better incomes and to provide better futures for their families.  That said, the dairy industry acknowledges the importance of climate change and our responsibility to develop in a sustainable manner following decades of stagnation due to the imposition of quotas that severely impeded the sector and disadvantaged thousands of farm families.  The Irish dairy industry exports to a multiple of Ireland&rsquo;s national population a highly nutritious food product recognised as the most carbon efficient in Europe.  This is because Ireland&rsquo;s temperate climate is perfect for growing grass, with a long grazing season.  This also enables superior animal welfare conditions on Irish farms.  Globally, 80% of milk is produced in confinement-based production systems, in contrast to Ireland where cows are at grass for up to 300 days a year.</p> <p> Furthermore, 95% of dairy farmers are participating in the sustainable dairy assurance scheme under Origin Green, which requires the completion of a carbon footprint every 18 months.  The sustainable dairy assurance scheme has enabled Ireland to position itself as a partner of choice globally for sustainably produced and quality assured dairy products.  The inclusion of the carbon navigator tool makes the Origin Green programme unique from a global perspective.  It provides the average carbon figure for production on the farm and also indicates where the greatest potential saving can be made in both carbon emissions and, importantly, in financial savings.  In doing so, it has mainstreamed the message that carbon efficiency goes hand in hand with economic efficiency.</p> <p> As an industry, we fully adhere to the principle of sustainable intensification, as set out in the European Council conclusions from October 2014.  These conclusions also recognise the lower mitigation potential of agriculture.  The European Council further acknowledges the need to ensure coherence in policy between the EU&rsquo;s food security and climate change objectives.</p></speech>

Climate smart agriculture has three main objectives: to increase agricultural productivity and incomes sustainably, in view of the responsibility of the agrifood sector to provide more food for a growing population; to adapt and build resilience to climate change, which is particularly pertinent considering the weather extremes of 2018; and to reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions, or both, where possible.  In line with recommendations 5 and 6 by the Citizens' Assembly, we agree that sensible financial tools are required to stimulate widespread uptake of on-farm renewable energy projects, including biogas from anaerobic digestion and the installation of solar panels on farm buildings.  ICOS also urges the Government to prioritise the establishment of community-led and co-operative projects in the area of renewable energy and microgeneration.  The reality is that mitigation in agriculture is limited.  There are no quick fixes.  That is why we must work collectively to ensure that mitigation in agriculture is maximised.  This will require a sustained and concerted effort by industry, farmers and the Government.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Bridget Murphy, who will answer some of the members' questions.  My other colleague in the Public Gallery is Mary Rooney from Leitrim, who is chair of Cavan west.</p>  <p>  The simple truth about climate change is that we have ignored it for too long.  Our beef, dairy, sheep and timber plantations have made a significant contribution to the modern Irish economy but, unfortunately, this contribution has come at a very high cost of loss of biodiversity, loss of soil fertility, considerable air and water pollution from chemical fertiliser, and a significant contribution to greenhouse gas in our atmosphere.  In fact, if climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution costs were included in the true cost of producing beef, dairy and sheepmeat, much of Ireland's agrifood sector would instantly lose its economic viability and green image.  We talk about having to farm this way to feed the world's growing population, but at the same time we are struggling to find markets for our beef and dairy and the farmer is no better off for all his work.  We must rethink how we feed the world.  It is no use doing so at the expense of our land, water, air and the other non-human species with whom we share the planet.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, farmers are responsible for many things, not least feeding ourselves and the world's growing population and being the country's first line of defence against climate change.  We will do this at the same time as restoring biodiversity and soil fertility, eliminating our pollution, and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  This is a huge task, and to meet it, the role of farmers will undergo massive change.  The INHFA's approach in tackling this task is led by common sense more than other more sophisticated agriculture models.  This is not to say that science and technology are not important in our approach, but making the right choices about what we are facing requires wisdom, a vision for the future, values and the fact that we choose to care about the farmers, our environment, health, culture and identity, and our future.  We support the approach that understands farmers are not just producing commodities but are taking care of the health of society by providing natural food.  They are taking care of the health of the ecosystem by preserving biodiversity and environmental services.  They are also taking care of the health of rural communities by generating an adequate income for their families while preserving the cultural heritage of society in terms of tradition and historical landscapes.</p>  <p>  We will need new tools, skills and resources.  We must have upskilled Departments that work much more closely together.  Bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, will have to be far better funded and resourced.  Others such as Coillte will require a new remit and a board with environmental and change management expertise.  Schools, agriculture colleges and universities will require new curricula.  The INHFA would like to see a great deal more research undertaken on land use and management in the uplands and designated lands.  More importantly, we want those who are deciding what to do to speak to us, especially farmers who farm mountain commonage and Natura-designated land and valuable carbon-rich soils.  Let our inherited knowledge and direct experience of these high nature value areas help to design the programme of schemes that will deliver on the task we have as well as provide a livelihood for farm families into the future.</p></speech>

Mr. Lorcan McCabe sends his apologies that he is unable to attend.</p> <p>I am pleased to get the opportunity to respond to the Citizens' Assembly climate action and mitigation strategy.  The recommendations that are of relevance to us are Nos. 11 and 13, which have a significant effect on the dairy and livestock sectors.  Recommendation 11 suggests that a carbon tax would be applied to farmers based on carbon output.  That would have a disastrous effect not alone on the dairy and livestock sectors but also on the rural economy, given the impact of agriculture on rural areas.</p> <p> We must establish a few facts.  The first is that global demand for food is increasing as the population is increasing.  Dairy and meat remain main constituents of our diet.  Ireland has been proven scientifically to be the most carbon-efficient producer of milk in the world and the fourth or fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef.  They are facts.  Mr. Donnellan spoke earlier about Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  Irish agriculture is on course to deliver the aspirations in that regard.  When those ambitions and goals were set out, a commitment was given to the primary producer in order that they would drive forward for the betterment of the rural economy and the industry.  We cannot envisage an unfair levy being applied.  To apply a tax on the producer would completely undermine our ability to export.  We are unique in that we export 85% to 90% of our agricultural produce.  People need food and it would be unacceptable to be paying a liability and for the food to be produced in a less efficient country.  Given that our climatic aspirations and liabilities are a global issue and not just a geographic one - it is not a case of Ulster against Munster or Connacht against Leinster - we need to be in a position to produce food in the most efficient countries.  That would have a significant impact on the viability of family farms.</p> <p> Recommendation 13 concerns afforestation and organic farming.  I was interested to hear the experts from Teagasc say that organic farming can have a high carbon footprint for each unit of food produced.  We must remember that.  Another drawback with organic farming is that it is very much a niche market and is easily oversupplied.  Not alone would it be environmentally unsustainable, it would be economically unsustainable if there were a surge towards organic production.  The Government must incentivise and encourage more positive land use to mitigate climate change.  At the same time, however, we must be mindful of the social as well as the economic issues associated with forestry.  Previously forestry was stigmatised due to poor felling practices where eyesores were created in rural areas.</p> <p> Methane and nitrous oxide are the main greenhouse gas contributors from the agriculture sector.  For a farm to remain environmentally sustainable, there needs to be economic sustainability.  Unfortunately, in the debate thus far this afternoon there has been very little discussion about economic sustainability.  For that to happen, there needs to be an education process for food consumers around the globe.  They must know what they are getting and where they are getting it.  People get high-quality, environmentally sustainable produce from an Irish and European perspective but the bridge must be crossed in terms of the education curve.</p> <p> We have heard about measures that can be introduced to improve efficiency from the point of production per food unit.  The economic breeding index, EBI, and the use of slurry and fertiliser are important in that regard.  Farmers have been active in that regard with the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, resulting in a significant level of applications for low-emissions slurry spreading.  There are many opportunities to use slurry and to develop solar and wind energy that are underutilised.  It is unfortunate that they were overlooked in the recent budget.  Our European counterparts can make as much from the roof of the barn as they can from the basement, and a third of their profit comes from the middle.  There is an opportunity.</p> <p> I will reiterate the four critical points.  We are carbon efficient from a dairy and beef perspective.  The carbon stored in grasslands needs to be fully incorporated into the greenhouse gas emissions abatement strategy.  Fertiliser and slurry management needs to be incentivised through schemes such as the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, to bring our lime pH up to the optimum level.  Energy generation from renewable sources must be promoted.  There is an opportunity to do that annually as well as through CAP reform.  We will be pleased to take questions.</p></speech>

The European Commission's science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre, has confirmed that Ireland's dairy farmers have the lowest carbon footprint for milk in the EU and our beef farmers are among the top five most carbon-efficient.  That is important at a time of increasing demand for these types of proteins, produced sustainably by farmers in Ireland.  It did not just happen.  It is underpinned by our grass-based model of food production.</p>  <p>  Ireland is to the fore in targeting CAP funding to address the climate challenge.  For example, 87% of the measures in the rural development programme are focused on environmental protection and addressing climate change.  The IFA's smart farming programme is run in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  That has highlighted a climate impact reduction in emissions of 9% and a reduction in costs of &euro;7,000.</p>  <p>  The measures included in GLAS and its predecessor, the rural environmental protection scheme, also highlight the work farmers are doing.  The schemes promote the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, green cover establishment and low-emission manure spreading techniques.  Almost 50,000 farmers are in the GLAS programme, but it is oversubscribed.  I strongly encourage the Government to reopen the scheme to allow maximum participation.</p>  <p>  In addition, every one of the 130,000 farmers in receipt of a basic payment under CAP has to meet stringent EU requirements to keep their farms in good condition, including compliance obligations regarding the management of soils, hedgerows, water courses and fertiliser management.  Farmers are subject to onerous inspections to ensure adherence to these obligations.</p>  <p>  CAP also delivers for consumers, ensuring that the sector provides a secure supply of top-quality safe food, produced to the highest standards at affordable prices.  A fully funded CAP budget is critically important for Ireland in respect of its farmers, economy, jobs and consumers, as well as contributing to environmental protection and combating climate change.  The IFA has called on the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to insist that the CAP budget for Ireland is increased to cover the extra costs and to cover inflation.  As part of Bord Bia's Origin Green programme, more than 200,000 carbon assessments have been completed.  Uniquely, Ireland is the only country in the world that measures, monitors and manages carbon from farm to fork at a national level.</p>  <p>  Extra carbon taxes are not the answer.  Almost &euro;3 billion has been collected in this country in carbon taxes since 2010.  Despite that, national climate emissions have increased.  Therefore, the carbon tax has failed to make any environmental difference.  Indeed, research work conducted by the ESRI indicates that increasing the annual carbon tax take to more than &euro;1 billion may reduce emissions by just 4.7%.  While the Citizens' Assembly suggests ring-fencing carbon taxes, I note the significant reluctance of Departments and agencies such as the ESRI when they addressed the committee on this proposed hypothecation.  Regardless, the IFA will continue to oppose the imposition of further carbon taxes on farming.  Environmental taxes such as the plastic bag levy worked because there were alternatives.</p> <p>Carbon taxes on farming represent an additional cost on production with little or no extra benefits.  The IFA supports the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on carbon taxes which states that in place of a carbon tax that penalises farmers for failing to meet emissions targets, the application of additional incentives for farmers who sequester carbon may be a more effective approach in delivering change.</p> <p> This year, Teagasc published 27 measures as part of its analysis.  Those measures have the potential to reduce climate emissions by 9 megatonnes.  The delivery of this requires intergovernmental and inter-State agency co-operation.  It is a solid piece of work that can be a roadmap for the future.  The IFA is also seeking a fairer share of the value food chain so we can reinvest in the climate proofing of our farm businesses.  After all, it is hard for farmers to be green when they are in the red.  In Ireland, this requires the Government to appoint an independent retail regulator and to support fully the European Commissioner's initiative to eliminate unfair trading practices.  We are also calling on the Government to back French proposals that aim to eliminate food imports from unsustainable sources such as the Mercosur countries where beef is produced in the Amazon.  Greater support for community and farm-scale renewables, including anaerobic digestion, must be put in place.  This requires the Government to introduce a guaranteed feed-in tariff model, increased grid access and the development of a regional biomass trade and logistics centre.  We will continue to work with the EPA to maximise cost savings and climate improvements in our smart farming programme.</p> <p> I ask members of the committee to consider carefully the recommendations included in its report and not simply default to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  This is particularly important in light of Ms Justice Laffoy's comments to the committee in September when she stated: "In truth, if we had time we could have had more information on the agricultural sphere and, in particular, on how various parts of the sector are and would be affected."  The committee has taken the time and afforded a range of stakeholders, including the IFA, the opportunity to outline the complexity of addressing the climate challenge and to ensure Ireland's carbon-efficient model of food production is not compromised.</p> <p> As president of the IFA I am proud to stand up for the agrisector, which is Ireland's indigenous sector exporting food, drink and forest products worth in excess of &euro;13.5 billion in 2017 and providing direct or indirect employment to 300,000 people and 130,000 farmers.  It has been a key driver in Ireland's economic recovery and it is the backbone of the economic activity throughout rural Ireland.  From a carbon efficiency perspective, we are best in class.  We seek a more complete and nuanced set of solutions for agriculture that safeguard Ireland's climate-efficient model of food production while providing innovative opportunities for farm families and rural Ireland to climate-proof their futures.  We recognise there are challenges for all of us and agriculture is up to that challenge.  We ask of the committee that its climate proposals be based on logic and take full account of the potential economic and social impact on farm families and the wider rural community.</p></speech>

Perhaps they feel their voices have not been heard on these matters.  We welcome their presence at the committee meeting.</p>  <p>  Before I go to members for questions, I propose that members direct their questions to a specific organisation rather than to all four organisations.  Everybody will have a number of questions.  Members should put their questions to the representative of a specific organisation.</p>  <p>  I have a number of brief questions.  My question for ICOS is about the co-operative potential.  I was very interested in what was said about the potential for co-ops and biogas.  Do the witnesses see it as a real alternative?  Is there a lot of potential in terms of second and third incomes for farmers?  It is not just the premium from beef and milk but perhaps also from energy.  Has ICOS looked at models in any other countries that could be held up as an example?  Will the witnesses keep their answers brief?</p></speech>

One of the positive things that came out of the address in Poland this week was a recognition of the co-operatives getting involved in this.  We know there is ring-fencing of 10% with regard to access to the auction for the electricity input that will be generated from the solar development in particular.  We believe there is scope for co-operatives to be set up where the community would benefit from it.  There is huge potential for that.</p>  <p>  The Acting Chairman asked if we know something else that happened.  There are small towns and villages in Germany that have maximised the co-operative model and have delivered very high levels of generation capacity.  In Freiburg, which is near the Black Forest area of Germany, they are 130% self-sufficient in energy generation meaning they export 30% over and above what they require.  It is something that could operate in Ireland just as well as it operates there.  The dairy industry in Holland was able to support farmers there in microgeneration of roof-based solar power.  Without a doubt there are opportunities.</p></speech>

One is about GLAS.  Mr. Healy mentioned it in his presentation.  There are 50,000 farmers involved in it.  Mr. Healy said the scheme should be reopened.  There are two parts to my question.  From an IFA point of view, does it have a significant positive environmental impact?  Would it be possible to bring another 50,000 of the 130,000 farmers in the State into it?</p>  <p>  I have a question on hedgerows, which are a bugbear of mine.  I heard what the IFA and farming organisations have said.  They put forward a very strong and coherent argument on the production of beef and milk.  It is the most sustainable in Europe.  There are some things that could be done a little bit better on farms to try to improve things such as the sequestering value of farms.  One thing is hedgerows.  There is a programme of reinstatement.  One has to reinstate what one takes out.  We all know that when one takes out a hedgerow, it is not something that can be recreated in one, two, three or four years.  I am especially concerned about the practice of cutting them down to about a foot high.  Why can we not go back to the practice of what used to be referred to as breasting ditches, in other words, cutting the outsides?  I asked one of the IFA's members about this recently.  The person will remain nameless.  I asked him why people were doing it.  I was curious about it.  I noticed a lot of it happening around Ballymena and places like that.  He said it was a Protestant thing.  He will remain nameless.  I am curious about it.  For the life of me, I cannot understand it.  Apart from being able to see someone's farm or show off how tidy and neat my farm is, I fail to see, as a rural Deputy, the benefits of cutting them down to one or two feet high.  I will keep the name of the IFA member secret.</p></speech>

The first question was about the impact of GLAS.  Perhaps I left it out so my presentation would stay within the time allowed but nine out of ten measures in the rural development schemes have climate mitigating actions within them.  I will read out some numbers.  In the GLAS scheme there are 357 km of arable grass margins.</p> <p>There are more than 238,000 ha in low-input permanent pasture, almost 6,500 ha of minimum tillage, just shy of 13,000 km of water courses protected from bovine animals, 62 km of riparian margins, and 46,000 ha of traditional hay meadow.</p> <p> The Acting Chairman mentioned the hedgerows.  Mr. Cooney might be better on this.  I think there are 1.4 million m of hedgerows.</p></speech>

Hedgerows have also been a protected feature, as part of CAP, since 2018.  It is now against the law to remove a hedgerow unless one has an equal amount of hedgerow planted somewhere else on the farm.  If one looks at the rest of Europe, we have a far higher percentage of hedgerows than most other European countries.  There was talk about the Paris Basin earlier on.  There are not too many hedgerows there.</p>  <p>  There are a couple of measures in GLAS for maintenance of hedgerow.  One is laying of hedgerows which rejuvenates a hedge that has been only grown up recently, in the past 20 years.  It thickens it up.  There is also a measure called "coppicing of hedgerow" where a hedgerow grows up into trees and there are large gaping holes in the bottom of it where livestock can walk.  That is one of the measures where it is cut at approximately 6 in. high and it grows up into a nice thick hedge again.</p>  <p>  I understand the Acting Chairman refers to where a hedgerow is trimmed every year.  There would be a very small percentage of those around the country.  It is predominately roadside hedges that are done like that and it is done on a road safety basis.  That is the logic for doing them.</p></speech>

This is an important meeting.  I concur with the comments that the farming organisations and agriculture in general did not get a fair hearing in the Citizens' Assembly.  I was one who asked Ms Justice Laffoy here last September the question Mr. Healy mentioned earlier, that is, if she had more time, would she have taken on board some of the comments the agriculture sector may have had.  It is important that everybody is here today.</p>  <p>  It is also important to point out the contribution the agriculture sector makes to the economy in Ireland.  We saw this during the ten difficult years in this country.  The value of agriculture exports have increased from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;13 billion in the past year.  It could be argued that had it not been for agriculture building the foundation at that time, the economy might not be as good as it is today.</p>  <p>  Reference was made in two of the reports, those of the ICMSA and the IFA, to the carbon tax issue.

From a dairy farmer's perspective, we are the most efficient in Europe.  Our concern is that if a carbon tax is imposed on our sector, the consequences will be that it will make us less competitive on the global market and shift production from a carbon-efficient region such as Ireland to a less carbon-efficient region in some other part of the world and make the climate situation worse rather than better.  The point we would make strongly is that a carbon tax does not work from the point of view of climate change because there will be different carbon taxes in different countries and our dairy sector could be targeted unfairly.</p></speech>

In that regard, what could we be doing to make sure that will not be a difficulty for the future?</p></speech>

That will give Deputy Deering an idea of it.</p>  <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, Irish farm incomes are always a problem.  We have fought for many years to ensure that the deal with Mercosur is not done.  We have listened to European politicians tell Irish farmers to get real about climate change and at the same time they are trying to push through deals between Europe and countries such as Brazil, the efficiency of whose farmers is four times less than ours.  The figures show that it takes 18 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef across Europe and it takes 80 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef in Brazil.  That shows what we need to do.</p>  <p>  We have stated clearly that climate change is not only an Irish issue.  Listening to some commentators in this country, one would imagine that it is only an Irish issue.  We heard Mr. Donnellan talk about the increase in demand for food and the increase in the population in the future.  There will be increased demand for protein products and dairy and beef are strong protein products.  If we are not producing the dairy and beef here in Ireland, which is recognised as the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy product and in the top five in Europe, to satisfy the extra demand, it will be produced in a less efficient country.  From where I stand, that goes against improving climate change and carbon emissions.  The point needs to be put across strongly that food should be produced in the countries where it is most efficient to do so, particularly if there is demand there for it.</p></speech>

An article in yesterday's <i>Farming Independent</i>regarding the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, began: &quot;Suckler herds can reduce their Greenhouse Gas emissions by 10pc over the next 20 years if they use genetics to produce profitable and carbon efficient cows.&quot;  I welcome that statement.  The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, has been one of the most efficient and best programmes introduced.  It is the only one of its kind in Europe whereby there is the collection of data developing the maternal trait, getting the information about the suckler cow and feeding it back.  It can be most advantageous for the future.</p><p>On my last count, 25,000 suckler farmers are in the BDGP.  In the recent budget, there was another scheme introduced, the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, which will be most beneficial in that regard as well.  There are many more than 25,000 farmers in the country.  What can the IFA do to encourage more farmers to join this scheme in the event that the pilot is opened up in the future and so that it will form a significant part of the next Common Agricultural Policy?</p></speech>

It was fully subscribed.  Deputy Deering correctly stated that just shy of 25,000 farmers participate in it.  There are 550,000 cows involved in it.  It was a good scheme that was probably sold and explained badly to farmers at the start, and despite that, farmers showed their willingness to get involved in it.  It is important that they are for a number of reasons.</p> <p>Many of the measures help the environment.  As direct payments account for more than 100% of the average farm income on those farms, obviously it is important.  Even going back to the emissions per calorie of food, that has been reduced on Irish farms by 14% since 2013.  The target is that it will be reduced by 25% by 2030.</p></speech>

The only way that can be done is by a communications and education process about the role played by agriculture in rural Ireland and the whole economy.  We need to educate those who may not be as aware of what has been achieved in efficiencies in the beef industry and other areas which have assisted with climate change.  How do the three farming organisations believe they might be able to improve communications and education?</p>  <p>  Had it not been for Brexit, there would be much more discussion about CAP reform.  There will be a great deal of talk about it, however, over the next two years.  It plays a significant part in the sustainability of the agricultural economy.  Looking at the different income streams, 75% of farmers&rsquo; incomes are from Europe.  I like Mr. Healy using my line, &ldquo;You cannot go green if you are in the red&rdquo;.  It is important that the agriculture budget is maintained.  What do the farming organisations see as the main elements that will be required in the new CAP to ensure we are not just efficient and sustainable but can contribute to tackling climate change?</p></speech>

We sought an increase to 1.3% of gross national income, GNI, from member states.  It was increased to 1.1% but we saw the new initiatives, for example, migration, defence and security, eat up more than that 10% budget increase.  We talk about a 5% decrease.  Taking the European Commission&rsquo;s proxy figure of 2% for inflation, we came up with a decrease of 17% to 18% in CAP for farmers.  It is imperative that CAP is fully funded.</p>  <p>  In 1984, CAP was over 60% of the EU budget.  Now, it is at around 30%.  By the end of the next CAP round, it will be at 28% of total funding.  It has been a successful policy.  While people might look at it as only a benefit for farmers, when it was introduced, over 30% of the average household income was spent on food.  Today, that is somewhere between 10% and 12%.  It has probably had more benefits for the non-farmer than for the farmer.</p>  <p>  The one original aim for farmers in which it has failed, however, is ensuring a viable income for the farming sector.  Borrowing Deputy Deering&rsquo;s line again, it is hard to expect us to be green if we are in the red.  The average farm income across Europe is only 40% of the average income in other sectors.  Farm incomes are indexed for inflation and there is a significant amount of extra costs to get that CAP payment.</p></speech>

There are targets put on farmers in different schemes and they have to achieve various thresholds to get their payments.</p>  <p>  Deputy Deering referred to imports from Brazil.

There is slippage in itself given the cost of inflation over the past 30 years.  We would like to see the Pillar 2 rural environmental schemes practicable for commercial farms.  There is a pH issue with our lime levels in soil where only 10% of soils are at an optimum pH level.  That has an effect on water quality and fertiliser usage.  That needs to be got right.  There needs to be a funding mechanism, be it through the Exchequer or CAP reform, for our renewables policy where we can see Ireland come back into the equation from a renewable energy point of view.</p>  <p>  There needs to be education for the consumer.  Origin Green has educated farmers and made them environmentally aware as well as compliant with animal records and so forth.  We need to bridge that gap.  There is probably a place for Ornua and Bord Bia with some of the larger multinational companies to educate the consumer.  If they want top-quality and environmentally friendly food products, they need to pay an economically sustainable price to ensure a farm family can have a viable living.</p></speech>

The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society identified the need for additional support to knowledge share.  Will the representatives expand on that?  Would it be an advisory type programme or a form of sectoral training?  Are they aware of a similar model in another country that could highlight best practice?</p>  <p>  I do not want farmers to be the fall guys.  We are here in a sense of co-operation.  On hedgerows, GLAS was discontinued because the nurseries were unable to meet demand.  Importing hedge saplings was not an option as it ran the risk of bringing in plant diseases.  There was a failure to guarantee the supply before the scheme was put in place.  What needs to be put in place to ensure supply before a scheme of funding is in place and farmers sign up to it?</p>  <p>  The demand for protein, be it beef or dairy products, is increasing.  If it increases and we stand still, other countries will come in with their imports.  We cannot expand any further, however.  Teagasc stated the emissions from the cattle population are up and the population is due to increase.</p> <p>This probably goes against Mr. Healy's product, but what does he think about diversifying and suggesting that we decrease some of our protein intake for our health?  In terms of dietary intake, it was popular until the 1950s and 1960s to have meat on the dinner table only twice or three times per week.  </p> <p> I love the quote from Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, which states, "We need to rethink how we feed the world, for it is no use doing so at the expense of our land, water, air and biodiversity."  What Government supports do those witnesses believe are available to re-skill us to rethink how we feed ourselves and other people?  That is in the same vein of diversification.  Is there any data on the available Government supports of which the witnesses spoke that reflect positive outcomes?</p></speech>

We hit our targets for the planting of hedgerows very early and we hit the targets in the GLAS programme as well.  The funding was used up.</p>  <p>  Demand is there for dairy and beef protein products.  That is what farmers are doing.  We are supplying a market that is there and looks likely to grow.  As I said, we are the most carbon efficient producers of dairy products in the EU and in the top five in beef.

We are producing 40% more from farms at the moment than we were in 1990 but the amount of carbon being produced has flatlined.  We are at the same level as 1990.  We are down in carbon emissions from agriculture since 1998.  Figures came out the other day.  Emissions were 22.4 million tonnes in 1998 and that figure was 20.2 million tonnes last year.  There is a lot of very efficient work being done and that is a result of science, research and genetics and we can build further on that, particularly in light of the Teagasc report that was launched in June.</p></speech>

We have a roadmap but it is about communicating these steps clearly to farmers.</p>  <p>  One thing that should be pursued is milk recording.  Less than half the farmers in the country are milk recording.  It is a logical thing to do because it improves their efficiencies in so many ways but we need to work a little better to spread the message that this technology should be adopted and farmers can increase their productivity while reducing their emissions.</p></speech>

We said, in our longer document, that the INHFA approach will be led by common sense, as opposed to more sophisticated agricultural models because neither the support nor the research are there.  That is not to say the science and technology are not important to our approach, however making the right choices about what we are facing requires wisdom and vision for future values and the fact that we choose to care more about the farm and the environment etc.  Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research into the complex socioecological systems underpinning agriculture in Ireland and we need to proceed on that basis with common sense.</p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan made a suggestion earlier, when Mr. Donnellan was speaking, about land use and in some senses a lot of research needs to be done in that area because it is quite critical to start understanding exactly what we are working with within ecosystems, rather than firing ahead with what we have.  Traditionally the practice has been to get the pH up and throw a bunch of fertiliser at it and make something out of that land.  That might work very well on lower land where there are more established grass systems, but for us, up in the high nature value areas, throwing a whole bunch of lime at a mountain is not going to make much difference and we certainly do not throw a huge amount of fertiliser up there.</p>  <p>  Essentially, we need much more research.  We called for that as well, saying that we would like to see a lot more research undertaken on land use and management in the upland and designated areas.  It is an area that needs more exploring.  Traditionally, we have got where we are because the research has been focused on a different angle.  Perhaps we need that spotlight to shift and it really starts with understanding what land we have, what can be produced from it, where is the best place to locate certain things and move on from there.</p></speech>

I had to go up to the Chamber for a contribution on the European Council debate but, as it happened, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin approached me and informed me that he had made some sort of deal to extend this D&aacute;il by another year.  I asked, in my contribution, what are we going to use that year for?  We should use it for consensus on certain key issues and I hope we can get consensus on the key elements of the new national energy climate action plan that has to be delivered by next year.</p>  <p>  For the farming sector, the timing could not be better in the sense that, in getting ready for it, we have to have a vision of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Extending that vision of new politics, I hope the environmental movement can sit down and talk with the various farming bodies to see how we can achieve both better pay for farmers and a restoration of nature in our land.  Mr. Healy was talking about 1990.  Since then, we have lost pristine water.  Could we pay farmers to help restore that?</p>  <p>  The World Wildlife Fund report came out last month saying we have lost 60% of invertebrate wildlife in the world and that has happened in Ireland the same as elsewhere.  Could we pay farmers to help restore that in this consensus that we seek?</p>  <p>  Mr. Healy said that things have not changed since 1990.  One thing that has not changed since 1990 is that most farmers, I understand, are getting the same price for the produce that their mother or father got in 1990.  Could we change the power structures in Irish retailing and the power of the PLCs to start changing that as a precondition?</p>  <p>  If we were to do all that, we should also pay farmers, under CAP, for turning the current situation.  No matter what is said, the physical reality is that our emissions went up 3% last year and roughly the same the year before.  It is a hell of a challenge to turn that around, but we must collectively turn it around.</p>  <p>  The Green Party is in a really interesting place.  Our colleagues in Germany, Belgium and Holland, the people who are going to be paying this budget, are on the rise.  I would love to bring over my colleagues to sit down with the witnesses here.  My colleagues have their objectives and interests and the witnesses have theirs.  Those interests may be different because, as the national land use system recognises, we may have different needs for different types of farmers.  Would the witnesses be willing to sit down with my colleagues under new politics and in a just transition way?  We need a just transition with Irish farmers in the same way we need a just transition with Bord na M&oacute;na workers and perhaps do a just transition with each different category of farmer in terms of how it works for the witnesses, us and everyone.</p> <p>We must do this in the next year.  In respect of a willingness or not to do that, do the witnesses think the current system serves their members?  If we are talking about changing it, are we talking about tweaking it or radical change going into that process for the next year?  </p></speech>

Everybody thinks CAP can solve every problem.  First, there is a proposal to cut the CAP budget.  Second, if we are to solve all these problems, what other issues are we going to drop because there is only a certain amount of money in the budget?  More and more objectives are being set out and more and more demands are being placed on CAP, and in my honest opinion, I do not believe it can achieve what everybody thinks it can achieve.  We have no issue with power and the supply chain but that has been an issue for 20, 30 or 40 years.  To be fair, the current Commissioner is making an effort in that regard but the reality is that the primary producer is getting a smaller share of the final consumer price.  In my opinion, food is probably too cheap.  Its price does not take account of the cost of producing that food.  I would agree with the Deputy on those points but the problem is how we solve them.  The idea that we will solve all these problems with a reduced CAP budget is not correct.</p></speech>

We would like to change the supply chain.  There are issues around that.  We would like to see CAP simplified.  There is a range of issues that need to changed with the key one being the price of food.  The farmer is not getting true value in respect of what he produces on his farm, taking account of all the costs involved such as animal welfare or environmental concerns.  The farmer is not being adequately rewarded for that.</p></speech>

We have always agreed to sit down and have sat down to discuss issues relating to Irish farming and its sustainability.  The Deputy is right about prices.  We would love to see more being done about prices.  It is important to build on Commissioner Hogan's agri-markets task force with regard to unfair trading practices and give a bigger share of the margin to farmers.  We have seen this margin being continually eroded to the point where the farmer gets 21 cent out of every euro paid by the consumer while the retailer gets 51 cent with the processor taking 28 cent in the middle.  When this report is rolled out and when there is legislation around it, we have called for an independent regulator to be there to enforce it.  Where it is found that retailers are not acting fairly with their suppliers, a regulator needs to be there to levy penalties in the same fashion as Christine Tacon, the groceries code regulator in the UK, can.  Mr. Enright has covered most of the rest of it.  Many of the aims of the original CAP are being met.  What is probably not being met is an adequate income going to farmers.  CAP has definitely ensured the production of safe, top-quality food that is traceable from farm to fork and that the European citizens get a good deal from it.</p></speech>

How right he is.  When we hear that, we must ask whether people are prepared to pay more for the food they eat.  That is a serious question.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that now might be a good time to have a national conversation or forum that would look at all aspects of the future of farming in Ireland.  ICOS understands that we face major challenges on issues like generational renewal and getting people to represent the industry at board level.  Many things will change dramatically in the coming years.  For example, on average terms across the EU, 46% of farmers' income comes from CAP.  If CAP is not properly funded and if the funding is not enhanced in the short to medium term, there will be a further decline in farming activity in rural areas.  We talk about continuing expansion.  There are areas in this country where we will not be able to engage in any great form of expansion and if there is no support for the sort of measures and programmes that are working very well on farms at the minute - I referred to GLAS, TAMS and other programmes that are supported - we will see a further decline in our industry and we will all suffer, particularly when we must face the enormous challenges posed by climate change.  If we are not there to do that at individual farm level up and down the country, the citizens of Ireland will be the greatest losers.</p></speech>

It feeds in from one thing to another.  To be honest, our starting point on all of this should be whether we are prepared to realise where we are.  We saw a report the other day that measured 56 countries where we were ranked 48th.  We are the lowest in the EU when it comes to making progress.  Emissions rose by 3.5% in 2016, 3.7% in 2017 and 2.9% this year, which is 10.1% increase in total.  If we do not realise that this must be our starting point and stop the rise in carbon emissions, we are all wasting our time.  We can produce all the research and waffle we need and want.  We were told by the summit in Poland a week ago that we were going to lose huge parts of the world to climate change through flooding.  Depending on how high sea levels rise, it could affect parts of this country such as Dublin, Cork and Waterford.  Is our Government looking at things like this?  While we invest all this money in cities and towns, are we listening to the scientists and the advice we are getting because we have not been listening for the past 20 years?  Our starting point must be to stop the rise in emissions.  With regard to pristine water, it involves flow and pollution from agriculture.  There is no point denying it is happening because it is happening.  It is as simple as that.  Farmers are spreading slurry four times a year because we did not make adequate provision for this in digesters and correct our systems.  There are no fish left in rivers in our part of the country and in several other parts of the country.  In many of these cases, it is because of run off from forestry - Sitka spruce plantations and aerial fertilisation.  Farmers cannot spread fertiliser into rivers or streams but forestry companies can do so.  That is not a problem at all.  We had gorgeous spawning rivers of salmon and trout but the salmon and trout have now gone and nobody says a word about it.  It all seems to be fine.  When I was sitting in the Public Gallery, I heard an earlier speaker from Teagasc make the point that 20,000 ha of Sitka spruce plantations are required to combat greenhouse gas emissions.  There are about 740,000 ha of Sitka spruce plantations in this country.</p> <p>Their carbon sequestration is less than 4%, and between 20% to 25% of that is planted on the most valuable soil in the world, peatland.  Some 3% of the world's surface is peatland.  That 3% sequesters more carbon than every tree on every plantation on the globe, yet here we are discussing planting more trees.  If trees were doing such a good job on this, why are our emissions at the rate they are?  The rhetoric we must listen to is unbelievable.  We have been doing the same thing with thicket spruce plantations for 100 years, since the Brits were here, and we continue to do it.  It is just crazy.  Are we or are we not serious about this?</p></speech>

Our hill sheep farmers are high nature value farmers.  We expect them to do both environmental work and production while being paid for production, which is limited, as our stock are management tools on mountains.  We do not have the luxury of putting very heavy, bigger animals up on a mountain.  They must be light and lean to work on a mountain.  We earn off production but we are providing a management service instead.  The CAP document, however, does not get to grips with that.  In fact, one of the new good agricultural practices, the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, refers to peatlands having to be kept in a good condition before we can even receive a Pillar 1 payment.  Keeping wetlands, peatlands and boglands in good condition takes a lot of resources, information and skill.  It cannot be a precondition for getting a first payment.  It must be further down in the ecoschemes.  It would be possible to say something along the lines that the bogs should not be degraded, but it certainly should not be that we must maintain them in good condition to receive the Pillar 1 payment.</p></speech>

More than &euro;2.5 billion has been invested in Irish farms, in slurry storage, effluent management and so on.  The code of good agricultural practice is improving.  By European standards, we are in the top ten.  There is more to do but we are confident that the new measures in the latest river basin management plan will deliver the agricultural sustainability and support advisory programme, ASSAP, which is being rolled out.  We are confident it will give us further improvements where the 30 sustainability advisers will help further improve water quality.  There has been a decline in some of our pristine waters, but we should remember that not all was in intensive agricultural areas.  It will probably be discovered when the local authority water support and advisory teams go out there and there will probably be improvements.</p>  <p>  On emissions, it is important that 27 measures that Teagasc has recommended are implemented and that every effort is made to ensure this.  As the previous speaker from Teagasc noted, to take out 7 million tonnes is over one third of agriculture emissions.  There is potential to do that with the current stock numbers.  There is no point in rehashing it, but that is our line.</p></speech>

The farmers of Ireland are the custodians of the environment.  That is our starting point.  The people present at this meeting represent them.  This is a major issue, no matter where one goes, in every sector of society.  What kinds of ideas are coming from the meetings?  Are the farmers - I am one, so I cannot be criticised for saying this - simply saying that they are farmers, they will keep farming, and how can they do anything when they are not making money?  Alternatively, are they making any suggestions as to how they can turn it to an advantage?  We sell our food and agricultural products all over the world as being green.  Were we to add carbon efficient approved to that, could we turn that to our advantage?  What feedback have the organisations present received from their members on this?</p>  <p>  At the first meeting of this committee there was agreement across the board that whatever decision we made would have to encompass all parties from a political perspective, and whatever suggestions would be made would transfer from Government to Government.  We are in agreement on that.  How well are the different sectors communicating about what everyone can do collectively into the future to improve the situation?  This is a global issue.  The majority of the grain feed coming into this country comes in on boats from Russia, which is a massive global footprint, yet according to our own report, although it is obvious to anyone, our tillage farmers are on their knees.  As people in the sector, will the witnesses give us an idea of how we can overcome that type of issue, where we would cut out the carbon footprint of the imports, which are transported across the world and help the tillage sector by using home-grown feed?  In a product for which we are world famous, Guinness, over 50% of the grain in Guinness is not Irish.  The farmers would love that it was, naturally, but how can we overcome these things and turn them to our advantage so that we turn the red into the black and at the same time turn green?</p>  <p>  What relationships do the organisations present have with other organisations outside farming in the community?  It comes back to the co-operatives and where they were started by the farmers.  There was a whole community buy-in and effort.  If farmers were providing slurry, grass or whatever to an anaerobic digestion plant that was providing district heating into communities, the us and them aspect suddenly goes, everyone is united and happy, and it is much easier to get a buy-in to the problem.  What initiatives can the groups present come up with rather than waiting to see what the committee arrives at?</p></speech>

For instance, in relation to the economic breeding index, EBI, when farmers breed their cows every spring-summer, they use more climate-efficient animals. It is an ongoing issue.</p>  <p>  The area of renewables is something in which farmers would be significantly interested, whether solar, wind, anaerobic digestion, or biomass.  Farmers need to see the policy framework around that which would allow them to get into that area, whether rooftop solar panels on farms or anaerobic digestion.  They need to be convinced that there will be an economic return from it.  There has been bad experiences of this in the past, for instance, in relation to miscanthus, and these are issues that need to be resolved.  The Government must come forward with initiatives in the area.</p>  <p>  The matter of grains in Ireland comes down to economics.  The key issue is the price of food and whether the farmer can make an economic return from the product.  Unfortunately, tillage farmers have been struggling in recent years, but it comes down to the way we are pricing food.</p>  <p>  On working with other sectors, our members work with dairy co-operatives, local LEADER groups and so on in different initiatives.  Renewables are an area in which farmers have a great deal of interest but they need to see the policy framework.</p></speech>

I wholly agree with his remark that farmers are the custodians of the land, and so it should be, but with the amount of bureaucracy, legislation and so on, one would sometimes wonder who are the custodians.</p> <p>We talked earlier about 1995 and the number of animals, cattle, cows and so on we had in the country.  At that time the cattle numbers might have been similar, but there were considerably fewer cows.  As we all know there is much less spreading of fertiliser slurry.</p> <p> The industrialised business-led model we have adopted in this country has failed miserably.  Let us consider the distribution of CAP.  Of 120,000 farmers, some 53,000 are on a basic payment of &euro;5,000 or less and some 27,000 are on &euro;10,000 or less.  Things have changed from years ago where everybody had everything on a farm and we were self-sufficient.  Last winter at the time of the snow, if it lasted for another week many would have died of hunger.  If we look at where the money is at the end of the year, is it in the farmers' pockets?  It is not in mine and I do not know if it is for many.  Because of this golden circle running Irish agriculture with corporatisation creaming the profits from the top, farmers have little or nothing.</p> <p> We have heavily promoted the dairy sector.  Much of this relates back to Teagasc which came up with the idea because of global warming and the increasing carbon in the atmosphere we were going to have much more grass, as we do.  That has now resulted in major increases in our emissions, a dairy sector that is &euro;1.5 billion in debt, and mothers and fathers who cannot sleep at night because they have signed up to loans for their sons and daughters to get into this racket promoted by many people, including politicians, dairy co-ops and farming organisations.</p> <p> In fairness, Commissioner Hogan has given a serious hint to farmers over the past year in outlining where we were going with our emission targets and farmers were not biting the bullet.  Most recently he talked about a cull and so on.  We cannot continue to sacrifice our taxpayers at the rate of &euro;600 million per year from 2020 to 2030.  Why should they be sacrificed when people in responsible positions who should have directed us on a different road up to now did not do so?</p> <p> The way out all of this is, unfortunately, going back a bit in time, decreasing production and putting in place proper schemes for all farmers.  I am not saying that cows cannot be milked; of course they have to be.  I am not saying beef cannot be produced; of course it can.  However, we must look at diversification.  Farmers could be doing many other things than producing excessive amounts of milk, beef or whatever.  We need to look at it in a general context.  We import far too much material, food and so on.  For example, we imported 40,000 tonnes of potatoes last year, 20,000 tonnes of chip potatoes, 16 million tonnes of junk meal from South America that I would not give to anything.  I would not feed it to my animals although some people are prepared to feed it and promote it.  Then we sell this idea of Origin Green.  Ornua, the company behind Kerrygold, is involved in a major court case over false advertising.</p> <p> We are also seeing enormous rises in the incidence of diseases in people and I am not sure why.  However, I am saying we should be producing top-quality food for the people of this country and we should also export whatever top-quality milk, beef, lamb etc. we can.  First and foremost should be 100% healthy food.</p></speech>

Two specific things are coming up.  One is that people want to explore growing hemp.  The problem is with test-running it.  There is a long process to get licences etc.  If we are on timeframes, it would be great if those timeframes could be shifted down to allow some trials to happen.</p>  <p>  The second thing is to have bees designated as a livestock unit.  The managed honey hive would have a very large margin of forage around it which would include the wild pollinators.  It would kill two birds with one stone; I accept that analogy is not very environmentally friendly.  We could sort out forage and habitat of the wild pollinators which is a critical issue for the environmentalists.  It would also give farmers another source of income from a different livestock unit.</p></speech>

As I outlined earlier, we could see an expansion of the energy on a co-operative level.  For example, the group water schemes have been well served by their involvement in ICOS and the co-operative structure.  We need Government support for energy projects and they should be community-led to get a better buy-in as far as the community is concerned.  The difficulty with many of those energy projects for many years has been the opposition and the difficulty in procuring planning permission.  If the local community benefits from the existence of such a project in the area, that would be a way of avoiding that difficulty.  To talk about killing two birds with the one stone, if we generate more of our electricity from a renewable source here on a co-operative or community basis, we would need to import less of what is required to generate our energy today.  It is a win-win situation for everybody.  It would take care of the issue raised by my friend here regarding diversification.  It would be a way for the farmer to diversify from what he has been doing well for generations.  He can see this as another opportunity.</p>  <p>  As it is being done right across Europe, why not give support to put panels on the roofs of the big buildings that exist in every farmyard?  We will be able to add an additional dimension to that very shortly because the technology for battery storage is improving which would allow us to make better use of the energy generated from the roof.  There are enormous opportunities and they can all be done on a co-operative community-led basis.</p></speech>

The farmers I meet are very engaged.  Some 200,000 carbon assessments have been done on farms, which means someone must be doing them.  There is at least one done per farm household if we think about 135,000 farm households.  Some 50,000 farmers are involved in GLAS.  The IFA president, Mr. Joe Healy, has said we need to get that reopened because there is a pent-up demand to participate.</p>  <p>  Every farmer who gets a basic payment and is part of CAP has to complete an inspection and to comply with 20 key measures, 13 of which are called SRMs and a further seven good agricultural environmental conditions.  Any farmer who does not is subject to a penalty.  Some 24,000 farmers in the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, are genotyping their stock in order to try to reduce their emissions by 10%.</p>  <p>  We can also consider what farmers are doing voluntarily.  In conjunction with the EPA we run a voluntary scheme, called Smart Farming, which is oversubscribed.  We are heading into 2019 with more farmers interested in participating than the capacity of the scheme.</p> <p>That is because it focuses on the win-win that Deputy Ryan referred to earlier of improving farm returns while also enhancing the environment by focusing on climate.  The committee's report earlier this year stated that it should look at expansion.  That is before renewables are considered.  This is the great value of the Teagasc abatement climate roadmap in trying to pull all this together.  All the ideas for generating, whether about renewables or efficiency, seem to be included in the 27 measures.  To give direction and guidance to the sector, IFA president Joe Healy has written directly to the Taoiseach, stating that we should look at what delivery of the climate roadmap looks like.  For the first time ever, we have some sort of vision regarding what 9 million tonnes of emission reductions from the sector could look like.  The farmers I meet are very engaged.  They have to be because their future depends on getting sustainability right.</p></speech>

With regard to Northern Ireland and Protestants cutting hedges, I would like to make it clear that one's religion is probably not a sign of one's predisposition towards being environmentally responsible or irresponsible.  It may be a reference to the fact that Protestants have a tendency to cut their hedges around the 12th fortnight.  I hope that is what he was implying.</p>  <p>  I echo Senator Paul Daly's comments about the Citizens' Assembly.  I have concerns that agriculture was underrepresented in that and that we need to revisit it.  It is good to hear the contributions here today and the fact that a strong lobbying exercise is being done to say that agriculture is a critical industry for Ireland and it will have a role to play in this.  I do not want to repeat everything but obviously agriculture has delivered on efficiencies, which has been well-proven and documented.  There was a reference in an earlier meeting today about a successful venture, the taxation of plastic bags.  It changed behaviour and delivered.  My concern when one looks at taxation of farmers and primary production can be seen in the analogy drawn with the plastic bags tax, which was applied at supermarkets and was paid for by consumers.  My problem with the carbon tax on agriculture is that the farmer cannot pass that on or recover it from the marketplace.  It resides with the farmer as a cost he or she will bear.</p>  <p>  Before he left, Mr. Pat McCormack from the ICMSA referred to sustainability.  We have all discussed environmental sustainability at length today.  We all know what is economic sustainability.  If it is not profitable, there will not be an industry.  I do not think we pay enough attention to social sustainability, which is about the creation and vibrancy of rural villages, towns, schools, shops, post offices and Gaelic football clubs, all of which are dependent on strong, profitable agricultural structures.  A number of references have been made in the committee to the importance of agriculture in the Irish economy, but it is disadvantaged by this headline figure of its percentage impact or contribution to the emissions discussion.  New Zealand was referred to as an economy that is similarly heavily dependent on agriculture and is disadvantaged.  I do not think we have recognised the contribution we have made with regard to ammonia.  Every 1% by which we have reduced protein in our animal feeds reduces ammonia by 10%.  The intensive sector reduced ammonia output by 30%.  If we consider these things and the reference made earlier by Deputy Ryan to the possibility of paying farmers for a positive contribution, in the opinion of the different representatives, what is the possibility of farmers being paid for carbon credits for delivering benefits to society?  Mr. Thomas Ryan referred to there being 200,000 farm audits.  Are enough data and information emerging that we could be in a position to pay farmers carbon credits for positive delivery?</p></speech>

We do not feel, as a sector, that there is a fair picture of farming where climate is concerned.  That is because methane and nitrous oxide are counted and accounted for but the carbon sink from our forestry, hedgerows, grasslands and permanent pastures are largely ignored, with forestry beginning to be involved.  Ireland has the largest permanent pastures in Europe, yet there is no carbon credit or recognition for that.  This all relates to keeping farmers engaged.  If we look at forestry alone since 1990, some 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide are stored that could be accounted for from 2021 to 2030.  That will probably come into play in 2025.  The EPA has done work on between 0.5 and 2 tonnes of carbon on our soils.  Where is the value of that coming back into the sector when the magic 20 or 21 million tonnes are compared to agriculture?  We contend that it is absolutely not a fair reflection on the sector that methane and nitrous oxide are counted.</p>  <p>  Let us go a step further and look at the landscape.  Deputy Ryan referred to a land use strategy.  Whatever the committee's view might be, more than 200 wind farms are offsetting approximately 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.  That is happening on our landscape.  If we look at the landscape and landscape contribution, since we are all tied up in the methodology, we are blocking a really positive discussion that could take place about carbon stores.  We are all concerned about 2020, when in reality, if we do not make progress on the carbon sink discussion, we will be here in the run-in to 2030, having an identical discussion.  It is a barrier to positivity in the discussion.  The value is there and the more quickly it is recognised, the more positive it is for engagement.</p></speech>

There is a serious concern relating to the loss of services in rural communities, whether Garda stations, doctors' surgeries, banks or other services.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young indicated an increase in milk production from 2016 to 2020 was putting an additional &euro;540 million annually into those rural communities.  They were supporting jobs, including the farmer producing the milk, who supported the store, local grocery or supermarket, the butcher, garage and whatever else.  That sort of sustainability is critical too and there is a place for all levels of sustainability to be nurtured here.  Sustainability in the production of our food is critical, as is sustainability of the communities that live in rural areas.  It is worthwhile to keep in mind that a little change can make a big difference.</p></speech>

It is a helpful engagement.  One very strong message is that the witnesses all accept that climate action has to be taken.  It may surprise some people who might have had different views about those in the agriculture sector, and it is great that the witnesses are being proactive in their messages this evening and about actions they want to see taken.</p> <p> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine compiled a report on climate change and sustainability in the agrifood sector.  Have the farming organisations had a chance to examine the report?  It has some good ideas, which were referenced earlier, particularly for agroforestry.  Earlier we heard that agroforestry would be a quick win for mitigation measures.  We do not expect dairy farms to completely plant mixed plantations.  There are 130,000 farmers in this country.  Have the organisations considered the possibility of asking each farmer to set aside an acre of land for agroforestry?</p> <p> Do the organisations think Food Wise 2025 should be reviewed in terms of the pressures the policy puts on farmers to deliver reduced emissions?</p> <p> Have the organisations considered the carbon taxation models that have been discussed?  The British Colombia's fee and dividend model is being considered at present.   The model proposes that money would be returned to the rural economy or poorer communities when money is circulated.  Do the organisations have a view on that model? </p> <p> ICOS is in existence for 125 years and I congratulate it on reaching such a milestone.  Recently I attended the 50th celebrations for the Arrabawn Co-Operative Society that took place in Birr, County Offaly.  Two of the founding members attended the event and it was a great afternoon.  Has ICOS put in place a model?  Let us say there is a policy that recommends farming co-operatives should get involved in anaerobic digesters or the biofuel industry and models have been designed.  If a group of farmers approached the organisation, said they wanted to undertake such projects and have a plan, does the organisation have a funding model available? </p></speech>

Of course, yes.  We provide rulebooks for every society and we have model rules for every sector.  We have already developed model rules for energy co-ops, farm machinery co-ops and every type of co-operative one can imagine.  We are working with a number of groups and we have model rules ready to go.  If a group has a proposition we will have no problem providing a structure for them and certainly the legal basis for their existence.  We do not have the money to fund them but we have legal and democratic structures in place.<br/><br/>I shall comment on the carbon taxation models.  I echo what Mr. Donnellan said this morning that carbon taxation models are the bluntest of instruments.  A carbon tax on agriculture <i>per se</i>would be the bluntest of instruments.  If one would put a tax on every animal then the good, bad, efficient and inefficient animals would be taken out.  Such a policy would not deliver.  It would simply reduce our competitiveness, reduce production and increase inefficiency.  We cannot assess the carbon efficiency of every cow in the country.  That would be possible only if one could do so with the press of a button, but that is not possible.  My colleague, Mr. Spellman, will comment in terms of the committee.  </p></speech>

In the first instance, we recommended the removal of the replanting obligation in standard afforestation as it acts as a significant barrier and prevents farmers from converting agricultural land into forestry.  In addition, we recommended, in order to assist with afforestation targets, that livestock farmers would welcome a worthwhile agroforestry initiative using native broadleaf trees to increase forestry cover, provide shelter belts, offset emissions and increase biodiversity.  Certainly, it is something that would get a positive response.  I understand what was said about dairy farmers not putting large areas of their farms into forestry and how a couple of acres on every farm might be preferable.  Some of our co-ops have reached out in a small way to their members by supplying them with trees to plant in small coppices on their farms.  We could extend that, thus partially addressing what is needed in terms of afforestation.</p></speech>

I am not sure it would suit every farm but we believe the scheme should be promoted.</p>  <p>  In terms of a review of Food Wise 2025, we would need to know what a review would entail.  I have certain concerns about the matter.  ICMSA members have invested in their farms and taken on long-term debt on the basis of Food Wise 2025 and a review could have major implications for those individuals.  We must be cognisant of those people who have taken the brave decision to invest in their businesses and contribute to the whole area.  We need to be careful about what is meant by a review of Food Wise 2025, in my opinion.</p>  <p>  The ICMSA has stated its views on carbon tax in our submission.  We believe a carbon tax is not a good idea for the agricultural sector.  </p></speech>

There is an urgent need within Government to review the existing forestry regulations as they limit planting on unenclosed land. More than 180,000 hectares of unenclosed land are not designated.  If the same rules that apply in Scotland were applied here that land could be planted.  The measure would go a long way towards addressing our shortcomings in forestry because the forestry rate for this year was a little more than 4,000 hectares but the target was 10,000 hectares.  If the restriction was lifted there is a potential to plant 180,000 hectares.</p>  <p>  In terms of Food Wise 2025, it does not address farm level profitability.  Farmers all around the country have raised that issue with the IFA. </p>  <p>  Carbon tax makes sense only if there is an alternative.  Most farmers use jeeps and tractors on their farms.  There is no such thing as an electricity powered jeep or tractor.  Until there is an alternative it does not make sense to impose more carbon taxes.  As was said earlier, every &euro;5 a tonne increase in carbon tax takes another &euro;8 million out of agriculture and the current carbon tax takes &euro;30 million.  There is no alternative at the moment.</p></speech>

What Mr. Spellman has said is close enough to the right idea.  The INHFA totally disagrees with short-term payments.  The agroforestry scheme lasts five years and is a bit like the afforestation programme overall.  We have told here today that 4,000 hectares were planted last year, which surprises me.  The scheme is just a land grab because one gets paid for 15 years but ends up with nothing, which is what happens when one plants Sitka spruce.  At the end of that scheme, if one wants a felling licence to fell one's timber, one must agree to replant the land and pay for it oneself.  That is how good the Government is at conning people in this country, and that has gone on for quite a long time.</p>  <p>  The agroforestry scheme is a five-year payment.  One can fence off the land but ten years must elapse before one can allow an animal to graze on that land.  The conditions of the scheme insist that trees are planted about six metres apart and one cannot graze the land for ten years.  One is paid for only five years so what payment does that land produce for the next five years?  It produces nothing and from there on the land is taken up with trees.  The INHFA suggests that if we are serious about tackling climate change and truly want farmers to participate in these schemes, they must be paid indefinitely, and whoever is their successors must be paid indefinitely.  Fewer than 4,000 hectares will be planted in forestry next year because the people of the west of Ireland are sick of the scheme.  A beautiful county like Leitrim has been wiped out, communities have been wiped out and rivers are being polluted.  For what?  So we can milk cows?   </p></speech>

I asked whether an acre of land on each farm should be planted with small amounts of mixed species of trees.  I am not going down the line of making previous mistakes again.  I based my question on findings and recommendations in a report compiled by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

In our CAP proposals we have proposed that the eco scheme, which replaces greening, be mandatory for all farmers to measure their carbon footprint in order to determine their carbon levels.  If we do not do this as a starting point, there is no point in talking about carbon credits because no one will know where they stand.</p></speech>

There are a very limited number of farmers in the beef genomics scheme.  It is not resulting in accurate measurements.  We need this to be done right across the board, mandatory for every farmer, if we are to make a start on this.  A voluntary scheme was mentioned in the CAP proposals.  Commissioner Hogan's wording is now that farmers will have to "partake" in this.  He has not said it is mandatory.  If it is not mandatory, however, it is just a waste of time.  It is a starting point to determine carbon credits.  Of course carbon credits should be traded.  They are being traded right now.</p></speech>

That component is missing.  It is especially critical for our sector, which is providing a massive sink through peat soils and some other measures.</p>  <p>  Should Food Wise 2025 be reviewed?  We would say yes.  We would want to look at an industrial-led model of continued growth.  We are talking about &euro;19 billion by 2025.  When we get to 2025, are we going to flatline that growth and maintain it or set another, much higher target and keep moving along on a growth model when we know at this stage it is causing many problems?  I can understand the contention that there is resistance due to sunken costs, but perhaps in some senses it is time to look at repositioning the plug sooner rather than later rather than allowing people to get in way too deep.  We saw this happen in Paraguay, where farmers were all encouraged to expand and then the price of milk dropped and the loans were called in and every single farmer lost his or her farm.  We really would not want to see this, especially for the young farmers who have been encouraged to expand into dairying.  Yes, it is critical we look at Food Wise 2025 and perhaps change the metric from &euro;19 billion to a different set of metrics that looks at whether we are feeding people in a good, healthy way and keeping a stable economy and environment.</p></speech>

I wish to start by fully agreeing with the IFA that this is not just an Irish issue.  Greenhouse gases do not go up over a country and keep within its border; they go into the atmosphere.  It is a global issue, and I fully acknowledge that the IFA acknowledges this.  It was therefore really unhelpful for the Minister to say the other day that there is no contradiction between growing a herd and reducing emissions.  Clearly, this is not in line with the reports that continually come before us, whether from Europe or the EPA or our own reports.  They show us that agricultural emissions are increasing year on year and have increased for four out of the past five years, and the main contributor to that is the growing of the herd.  I understand that the IFA is here to defend its members and their position but I also appreciate that people will find it difficult to be green when they are in the red.  This is why the notion of a carbon tax that should be imposed on everyone, regardless of their circumstances, is not on, as proven by the people of France - the farmers and the workers and the people from villages, towns and cities.  One does not impose a carbon tax on ordinary people who cannot afford it without providing an alternative.  If people in this country had a great alternative in terms of public transport but refused to use it because they wanted to go in and out in their Ferraris, I would say, "Tax them to hell."  They do not have an alternative, because we do not have good public transport.  We have people living in satellite towns outside of the big cities who must drive in and out to work because they have no choice.  If we were given the alternative, the carbon tax would be absolutely sound, but in this situation it is not.  Neither is it sound for farmers, except, of course, in the case of big ranchers who make vast profits.  I am an urban dweller and not familiar with who is who in rural Ireland in terms of agricultural production but I do know that there are certain types of farmer who are vastly wealthy, grow huge numbers of cattle and dairy herd and make a lot of their profits from exporting.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a small point about the discussion about Food Wise and food production because this is also not just an Irish issue but a global issue.  I was quite shocked to see Bord Bia recently spend an awful lot of its time, money and energy on promoting Irish beef and dairy in countries whose populations have never eaten beef or dairy, such as China and the Middle East, countries where there is no tradition of eating these types of food and no health barometer in this regard.  Bord Bia is really pushing farmers to grow more cattle here for more exports.  This just does not make sense because it is leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>  I have a couple of questions.  On the question of global food production, this conversation is really useful and interesting.  I think it was the witness from ICOS, Mr. Spellman, who proposed that we should have a national forum on the future of farming.  That is a brilliant idea.  I am not as critical of the Citizen's Assembly as some of the witnesses are but I do not think the recommendations on agriculture are sufficient.  I would like to know what they think of the idea of a national forum on farming and food production and how it might contribute to this overall plan to help us reduce our national CO2 emissions.</p>  <p>  Lastly, I noticed in the submission from the hill farmers that there is a lot of talk of a national forestry policy.  Do they believe that the policy as structured and implemented through and by Coillte is sufficient?  If not, what must change to make our forestry policy more realistic, more long-term and more sustainable?</p></speech>

I agreed with him as I think it would be helpful because we will find it difficult to confront some of the changes that are taking place and the issues we must confront in the medium to long term.  For this reason it might be a good time to have a national conversation or a national forum on the future of agriculture, remembering that we are an agricultural country, no matter how we look at it.  I think it would be worthwhile exploring that initiative.</p></speech>

A well-run forum can achieve a lot, as opposed to a forum that becomes a political tick-box exercise.</p>  <p>  Regarding the comment to which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred about there being no contradiction, we have shown that we have increased output by 40% and actually kept a flatline on the emissions going back to 1990.  People might think that the dairy and beef sector is not paying its way back in respect of debt and emissions.  Lest anyone get the wrong idea, I again highlight that farming is one of the best performers in the country when it comes to repaying debt.  The farmers will just do it.  They will pay back their debt no matter what.  What is crucial, though, and we can never move away from it, is that there is a growing global demand for dairy and beef protein.  I keep repeating this.</p> <p>It is not the Irish Farmers' Association that is saying it.  It is the European Commission Joint Research Centre that says Ireland is the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy products. That is the simple truth.  Those are the facts.  We can deal with facts or we can deal with emotion.  We like to deal in facts. </p></speech>

The planet will need 70% more food to feed those people.  Every country is going to have to play its part in that.  It is not Bord Bia that is driving the demand for dairy and beef products all over the planet.  It is not even being driven by the western world.  It is being driven by newly developing countries that are acquiring new tastes and have a demand for these products.  There will be global demand.  It is the case that if we do not produce a kilogram of beef in Ireland it will be produced somewhere else.  It may well be produced in Brazil through a reduction in rainforest cover.  That is the reality.  Ireland will not control, decide or stop the march of the global demand for these products.  To be fair to the Deputy, we have to realise what has happened in the dairy sector.  The context here is that we had a milk quota in this country from 1984 to 2015.  There was huge pent-up demand for expansion.  Naturally when that was lifted we saw an increase in the number of dairy cows, as was predicted, in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  There probably will be further increases in the next few years.  It is impossible to predict for how long it will go on.</p></speech>

There has been a huge focus on the fact that there has been an increase in emissions and it is all negative.  The Senator mentioned it earlier.  We have to recognise the huge positive the ability to expand into a profitable sector like dairy has been for Irish farm families and the rural economy.  Balance is the key issue.  The point the president is making is that we have managed to expand from 1990 to now and flat-line our emissions.  What Teagasc is proposing today is a clear pathway by which we can grow our agricultural businesses while reducing emissions through adopting the 27 measures it has put forward.  The Deputy acknowledges that she is not from rural Ireland.  If agriculture is removed there is not much going on outside the M50.  We have to recognise that.  We must realise that for many families and spin-off businesses there, agriculture is where it is at.  We need to find a balanced approach to what we do.  In our presentation we did not get to mention the comments made by Professor John Fitzgerald.  He stated:</p><blockquote>When I was appointed as chairman of the [Climate Change Advisory Council] it was my understanding of the science that I was going to have to tell farmers they would have to get rid of their cows.  It turns out, however, that the scientific evidence on this issue is more complicated.  </blockquote><p>Agriculture needs a more nuanced solution.  What the committee heard today from Mr. Trevor Donnellan is the outcome of years and years of scientific research aimed at producing a marginal abatement cost curve.  Unfortunately, what we saw in the Citizens' Assembly was four days of fairly superficial argument without any economic or social balance.  I wish to point out to the committee members that this committee's recommendations will be massively important for the livelihoods of all of our members and for many more people in agriculture and in rural Ireland.  Balance is key.  We have a State agency which has set out a very credible pathway.  We talk about fora.  We have clearly put on the record that we need political leadership to pull together all the Departments.  Let us get cracking on achieving this.  That will not be easy either.  </p></speech>

That is my point.  Saying that this is not the problem, that this activity could be carried out in the Amazon forest or New Zealand, is a bit like the Minister opposing my bill which would prevent the issuance of any more exploration licences for fossil fuels by saying that if we do not do it they will do it in Iraq or Saudi Arabia.  It is saying the same thing.  It is a bit of climate change denial.</p>  <p>  The last point I will make is that all of this means the science has settled on climate change.  It was not settled previously.  Reference was made to the size of the herd in 1990.  Most countries did not actually accept the science then.  It is accepted now, except by a few oddballs like President Donald Trump.  It is mostly accepted.  Now that we have acceptance let us look reality in the face.  We are emitting too much carbon into the atmosphere.  I repeat, the atmosphere, not just Ireland.  Therefore we have to deal with it.  Dealing with it in the agricultural sector is hugely important.  We need a balanced, nuanced and diverse approach to agriculture, but overgrowing the national herd is not balanced, nuanced or diverse.  I would welcome a national dialogue on this. </p></speech>

I am looking at the CSO figures from June 216 to June 2018.  Total cattle decreased by 0.2%.  I will share this with the Deputy at the end of the meeting if it is helpful.  There is a narrative, which I understand and which Deputy Smith has articulated several times, that there is a huge glut of extra stock.  I am sharing CSO data with the committee here.  Since the quotas were lifted, total cattle numbers have decreased by 0.2% from June 2016 to June 2018.  The number of dairy cows grew by 3.4%; the number of other cows fell by 3.1%  That is what the facts say.  I am happy to share that CSO data with the committee.</p></speech>

Yes, perhaps men might see this as more emotional, although there is often a very big difference between getting something done and sitting down and looking at how to get something done.  Women generally tend to realise that it is not just a question of feeding the world.  We actually have to look at how we do so.  The IFA says that we will need 70% more food to feed the world's population.  That 70% will escalate over time .  We do not have enough land at the moment to provide that extra 70% in the form of beef and milk.  That is a reality.  There is not enough land on this planet to feed the population we have at the moment with beef and milk.  To look to fill 70% more demand with beef and milk-----</p></speech>

Speaking from a woman's point of view, feeding countries flavoured and condensed milk and telling women to switch from breastfeeding to powdered milk and infant formula does make us emotional. </p> <p>We are talking about the fact that we are feeding the world.  We recently started back sending live exports to Libya.  Two women bravely stood up in Dunnes Stores years ago and refused to sell oranges that came from South Africa because they had principles.  We are seeing a Bill that is going through to prevent the import of products from the occupied West Bank.  Personally, I find it really offensive that we are selling beef to a country that is selling human beings as slaves - that is happening in Libya.  I have a problem with how we sell our beef and to where we sell it, especially as we have 75,000 children dying of starvation in Yemen at the moment, but we are not sending any food to them.  That is from a woman's point of view. I am sorry if that sounds emotional but I want to challenge the claim that we are feeding the world.</p> <p> I will go back to answer Deputy Smith's question.  She asked whether the Coillte policy was realistic and sustainable.  We would like to see Coillte with a new remit.  In 1988 when Coillte was set up the remit was to make as much money as possible from the forest estate in any way the company found profitable.  We would prefer to see the company being less about making money - there has not been a great deal of money made from the forest estate - and more about providing a national sequestration service and a major biodiversity service.  As the Sitka spruce forests come up to felling and get felled I would rather see them replaced with natural forest that is predominately native and broad-leaf.  We want to have a look at replacing the Sitka spruce.  We want to look at restoring the biodiversity and clean water from it.</p> <p> Another suggestion is that the Coillte board needs to be reviewed.  The board is sitting with a good deal of experience from Glanbia, Kerrygold and so on, but there are no environmental people on the board and no one with change management skills.  With all due respect, we are in for something of a bumpy ride and we are going to need as many skills as possible to get through it.  One such skill is some experience in change management.  We need to get that expertise on the board of Coillte.  As a matter of fact, we need it on many boards.</p></speech>

I am a little depressed by the IFA attitude today.  It is amazing, to tell the truth.  Let us expand on what the IFA representatives have said.  The view is that we should do nothing because we are producing the most valuable food in the world.  The view is that the Brazilians have to sort out the rain forests. If they do that, our farmers will be grand and we can produce even more and send it on.  That is simply not feasible.</p>  <p>  I have listened to the IFA representatives saying this for the past couple of years. They are fighting a rear-guard action on behalf of their members. They would be far better to embrace the decisions and go forward positively.  That is my personal opinion.  It is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  The IFA representatives have endorsed the Teagasc figures.  That is interesting because it is the first time I have heard them do so, and it is positive.  Would the IFA endorse the Teagasc figures if they included a reduction in the beef herd stock by 500,000?  If that were achieved, we would be coming near the benchmark and making real change in terms of society.</p>  <p>  The IFA representatives made other claims in the presentation to the committee today.  I have challenged the Department on this.  The IFA website has set out five steps to support climate action.  We heard this in the presentation today.  Step 4 states that the role of methane should be re-examined and alternative measures created.  Can the IFA confirm its views on climate science and the damaging role played by methane?  Although the gas has a shorter lifespan than carbon dioxide, it is actually 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  How can the IFA square that circle?  That is set out on the IFA website. I have brought up this matter with the Department as well.  I do not blame the IFA necessarily because the Department has said exactly the same thing about methane.  That is interesting in itself.  The Department has said that methane does not have this effect.  That is absolute craziness - it is mental stuff.  There is no other way of explaining it.  I simply do not know how the IFA can square that.  I am sorry for getting annoyed, Chairman, but it is madness.</p>  <p>  The only way any of the farm organisations, apart from the Natura farmers, probably, will agree to any changes in terms of how farmers are paid will be through CAP renegotiation.  We will have to wait until 2020 before we see any change.  Does the IFA support changes that would make farming more environmentally friendly?  Does the IFA support changes that would lead to the positions that Teagasc has recommended?  Will the IFA take down that rubbish off its website?</p></speech>

Under the rural development programme, nine out of every ten measures have climate mitigating actions.  This comprises the rural development fund and schemes for which the IFA has lobbied.  We encouraged farmers to participate.  It is important that we acknowledge that work has to be done.  We have constantly said that.  The IFA and other organisations have encouraged farmers to partake in that.  This has meant that the figure we have mentioned several times today has been achieved with regard to the increase in the production at no increase over 28 years in emissions.  I read out those figures, but if Deputy Pringle did not listen to them earlier he will not listen to them now either, so there is no point in repeating them.  It is crucial &ndash; this goes back to the last point &ndash; that we produce food that is in demand where it is efficiently produced from a carbon point of view.  Anyone who is in denial of that is in denial of positive action in climate change.</p></speech>

We were in the Gallery at the time.  He said that methodologies change.  We have been having a discussion on carbon sinks and our frustration at the fact that there is 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 from forestry that is sitting there but not being counted when it comes to landscape, land and agriculture.  In the same tone, the lifespan of methane in the atmosphere is being actively discussed right now.  When the Department representatives came before the committee they referred to it.  The scientific community is referring to it and we are rightly going to refer to it as well.  If methane lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years, then, unlike CO2, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 200 years, of course we are going to bring it to the attention of the committee.</p></speech>

Of course we are going to ask whether it is right that methane, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 12 years, is benchmarked like-for-like against carbon dioxide, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 200 years.</p> <p>One should not be surprised, as Mr. Trevor Donnellan said, that methodologies change; things evolve and with that evolution we will bring to the fore changes around the methodology calculations.  I do not know why Members are surprised because in the event of things changing we will continue to highlight them, just as we continue to highlight our frustration at the carbon sinks not being included.  We have the largest permanent pastures in Europe and yet we are getting zero carbon credit for the grasslands.  All the permanent pasture and the grassland that we are renowned for and despite the fact that there is between 0.5 and 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide being locked into the pastures, we are not getting credit for that.  </p> <p> This is all part of that discussion.

What we are saying is that we should wait and see what comes from that review.  There may be no change or they may be a change.  We have to see what will come from that review of the methodology.  That is the point on methane from our perspective.</p>  <p>  It is unfair to say we are not looking at measures in respect of climate change.  We made our pre budget submission in August and September and I can send the Deputy a copy of it.  We proposed a number of measures in our pre budget submission on climate change issues.  We are very conscious of climate change and we are putting forward measures to support climate change.  I do not want members to go away with the impression that we are not addressing the issue, because we are very conscious of it.</p></speech>

It is not as if we are comparing methane to carbon dioxide.  It is counted that it is 33 times more polluting, so it is not disappearing anywhere.  In the sums, it does disappear after 12 years.</p>  <p>  The term rancher was used pejoratively and this is not a point against the Deputy but we should put on the record that the average dairy herd is small by global standards.  It is 83 or 84 cows and the average beef herd is of the order of 50 animals.  It can be corrected by the secretariat.  I just want to ensure that members do not have notions that there are enormous herds out there.  The average herd is very small by international standards.</p></speech>

The idea that it is not being taken into account is that it counteracts all land that is heavily fertilised.  One has to counteract that with something; that is not in the statistics we are being told today.</p>  <p>  Let us face facts when it comes to cows.  One does not need 800 cows to live.  Let us get real.  We are pushing out one of the most valuable enterprises this country has ever had, that made the name of Irish agriculture, and that is the suckler cow.  To come up with figures for the base year on which to make comparisons, the reality is that the suckler cow herd has dropped by about 250,000 cows in the past two and a half years, to make place for dairy cows.  That is not acceptable to the farmers throughout rural Ireland who have reared families and want to continue to see the family, sons and daughters take over the small family farms.  That is why we cannot buy into this nonsense that we should all pack up and sit down and do nothing and let the dairy sector take over the country.</p>  <p>  The idea that we are promoting the beef genomic scheme is another farce.  We are producing the most rubbish cattle at present because of the scheme that is going through our livestock marts.  If we talk to any shipper who wants to transport animals, they cannot get suitable cattle to put on a ship because of the idea we have come up with which is to produce a smaller type poor quality cattle.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, we have to get away from the business-led industrial model of farming we have in this country and the fact that 18,000 or 20,000 farmers think they can run the show and forget about the rest of us.

The reality is that some suckler farmers have decided to transfer to dairy farming.  They have switched their enterprise.  That was their personal choice.  It is wrong to say that 18,000 to 20,000 farmers are trying to run the whole country for farmers.  That is incorrect.</p></speech>

We will conclude this short presentation with our key requests, which align with the Home Care Coalition, a grouping of 22 national organisations which advocate and engage with the Department of Health on this critical area of health and social care policy.  We know that the deficits and challenges facing the Irish health system are complex and multifaceted, but from our experience and our direct work with older people and their families across Ireland, we are aware that older people do not receive the quality home support services they need to maintain their health and well-being and to allow them to continue to live independently within their homes and communities, and to avoid or even delay hospital and residential care stays.  Home supports are critical for older people.  It is clear from our work that families are not getting adequate quality, affordable home care supports.  The Citizens' Assembly has dealt with this issue and the findings were clear.  Some 99% of members wanted the Government to expedite the current commitment to place home care on a statutory footing.  We now have the beginning of that emerging and are working closely with the Department to develop that.  A further 87% of people want an increase in public resourcing to ensure this is delivered appropriately.</p>  <p>  We all know the demographic challenges.  Life expectancy is rising and people aged over 65 now can expect to live well into their 80s, with two thirds of these years being lived disability-free.  However, as they age, the risk of disability increases.  Some 72.3% of the population aged 85 and over will have a disability by 2038.  I am not here to labour this.  We all know the statistics and they are stark.  The cohort of people over 85 is projected to double in the next 20 years.  By 2030, the cohort of people over 65 will increase by 59% and the cohort of those over 85 will increase by more than 95%.  This creates capacity challenges and has been well-signalled.  We have had two key reports.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report on healthcare projections noted that the demand for home care packages will increase by between 44% and 66% by 2030, and the demand for home help hours will increase by between 38% and 54%.  The health service capacity review also flags this.  Various numbers are included in it and are in our presentation.  Looking at just home care packages, which the committee understands are a critical component of wraparound care for people, these will have to increase by 70% from 15,600 a month to 26,600.  There will be a need for an additional 7.2 million home help hours by 2031.</p>  <p>  Unmet need is the crux of this.  Due to the dramatic demographic challenge, the projections for unmet need in home care supports are a cause of deep concern.  Various research puts the level of unmet need at varying levels but it is at least between 26% and 50%.  This will cost between &euro;120 million and &euro;205 million over the first five years of Sl&aacute;intecare, which we will come back to because it is the blueprint for how we should reform healthcare systems in the country.  A report by our colleagues in Care Alliance Ireland published just a few weeks ago gives very important information on the length of waiting times for home care and the gap between assessed need and the service that the person ends up getting.  This report is sobering reading as, despite sending a freedom of information request to all nine community health organisations, only three responded fully to the questions asked, two gave partial information and one refused outright after an initial acknowledgement.  The report found that the average time spent on a waiting list for home care supports for non-priority cases was at least 3.3 months, with the gap between assessed need and actual service provided being 15%.  More worryingly, the report found an inconsistency in the approach to measuring and documenting unmet need.  We in the Home Care Coalition believe that it is a cause for grave concern when the statutory health provider does not have a uniform approach to measuring, prioritising and allocating need.  The figures on unmet need vary from month to month.  Various reports give various statistics but we know that at least 6,100 people are assessed as in need of home care, waiting for an initial service.  As I said, these figures vary.</p>  <p>  Age Action Ireland is aware that the numbers receiving home supports in the community do not accurately reflect current and future need.  Some older people opt not to reply, as they know that service provision is not sufficient and will not meet their needs.  We are also concerned at the lack of data on private home care provision in the country.  We know that the variety of negative consequences can badly affect the health and well-being of older people and their families.  These range from minor consequences such as feeling unhappy because housework is not done, to major consequences, such as being unable to eat when hungry.  Older frail people often sustain an independent lifestyle at home if they can receive appropriate, timely, quality physical and psychosocial supports.  The absence of available home supports impacts fundamentally on the range of choices available to old people.  Without access to home care supports, some older people are forced to move to a residential care setting, which is often not their first choice.  This undermines their human right to live with dignity and independence.</p>  <p>  On funding, as part of the Home Care Coalition, we know we need a large injection of funding into home supports to enable the service to at least meet its yearly growth in service users and to return to 2008 levels of service provision from before the austerity cuts.  I have provided a graphic to the committee on research and will not go into it in detail.  Members can see a significant disparity between the nursing home support scheme, which received &euro;962 million in funding in 2018, catering for 23,500 older people in nursing homes, 4% of the cohort, while the home support element of care, including the winter initiative, receives &euro;430 million, which covers more than 50,000 people.</p> <p>That encompasses home care, home help hours, home care packages and intensive home care packages.  One can see there is a big disparity.</p> <p> The committee will be aware that there are serious challenges facing the planning and provision of home supports.  The deficits have a serious impact on the quality of choices people make, if indeed they are able to make any choice, about where they will receive the care they need.</p> <p> In summary, we know the following.  The average home care package is now six hours a week and not, as we all thought previously, ten hours.  It is now more difficult for over 60s to access home support than it was in 2008.  The waiting lists still persist.  There are now fewer hours being spread more thinly per client every week, with an increase in the provision of short 30 minute slots.  There is not much one can achieve in 30 minutes.</p> <p> There is an absence of legislative entitlement to home supports.  There is a postcode lottery, which quite frankly is shocking, in service provision, and there is a lack of transparency and accountability.  There is limited access to packages due to chronic underfunding and the eligibility criteria for supports remain unclear.  Sl&aacute;intecare is working hard on that issue with Ms Laura Magahy.</p> <p> Overall lack of provision of supports is the key issue.  At Age Action, our helpline constantly get calls from people needing to remain in hospital or who need to go to a nursing home because there are no supports at home, to where they want to return.  This is a serious deficit.  We face a steep increase in demand due to our population growth.</p> <p> There are two clear messages I need to leave with the committee today.  All of us here are asking for an increase of at least 10% in the home supports budget in each year until the statutory scheme comes on stream.  We are working closely and innovatively with the Department on how we should design and deliver this service but it is not here yet.  According to the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, it will take three years to get this scheme in place.  To maintain access and to meet the demands of the expanding demographics, funding has to increase by at least 4% to 5% per year.</p> <p> Age Action Ireland's last really critical issue for the committee, as elected members, to take away is that the new statutory home care scheme must be underpinned with robust eligibility legislation and it must have the quality standards monitoring framework.  Eligibility without capacity will not work and needs will not be met.  The development of a robust equitable funding model will necessitate an honest conversation where collective societal values must be articulated and an agreed approach to the generation of funds to support the scheme must be reached.  Age Action Ireland looks forward to working with the committee to make sure older people's needs for home supports are adequately addressed.</p></speech>

I will share my time with my colleagues from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p>  <p>  Care Alliance's focus is on family carers and on supporting our member organisations and others to better support such carers.  For many families, State funded home care provision can be a key support in keeping people well at home.  I refer the committee to our recent report on home care, published in October, copies of which I have here.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say there is much consensus on home care - the importance of it, the good value it represents and the likely future demand for it.  On the latter point, the 2017 ESRI report speaks of the need for what we estimate to be a 70% increase in home care support by 2030, from a current provision of 17 million hours to an estimated 30 million hours.  That figure is reinforced by recent correspondence I understand Deputy Donnelly received from the HSE in its projections on future demand.</p>  <p>  We welcome the Department of Health review of home care but we are concerned about its slow progress to date.  We, alongside a group of more than 20 other NGOs, are engaging actively with the relevant Department officials in articulating a vision for the future of home care and we, in Care Alliance, appreciate that it will take political courage to grapple with the challenging issues of funding.  The committee last week discussed the HSE budgetary overruns.  To put it in context, the likely acute hospital overrun of &euro;225 million represents more than 50% of the entire home care budget for 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, I echo the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, at this committee last week about the unhelpful dominant narrative of hospital trolleys and that the focus needs to be more on how long people are waiting for a service, specifically, a home care service.  In that regard, we have asked the HSE to include this as a key metric in its 2019 service plan.</p></speech>

The first is the De-Stress study into 200 plus spousal carers. The following is a summary of the study's findings.  In 2010, family carers and friends provided 81 million hours.  That is approximately 50 % of the total amount of investment in dementia.  Fifteen per cent of carers had given up their jobs to care for their spouses.  Seventy-nine per cent of them stated they provided 81% to 100% of the care.  On average, each of them had cared for his or her spouse for five years at the time of assessment.  Only 50% of them had received any home help in the previous 30 days and the 50% who had, received an average of 34 hours in total in the previous 30 days - a little more than one hour a day to look after somebody with dementia.  Only one-in-four had received family carer training.  Seventy-one per cent of the carers had two or more health conditions at once, including arthritis, hypertension and diabetes, one third had fairly bad sleep quality and a further 9% reported very bad sleep quality.  Approximately 37% of carers reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 20% of carers themselves possibly had problems with cognitive functioning.</p>  <p>  We would argue that if one wraps around services in the community, they can be a tremendous support to carers.  This was mapped by the HSE and ourselves in 2018.  One can see a very different range of services available, from 23 in CHO 3 to 44 in CHO 1.  Looking at day centres nationally, only 41% of day centres operated on a five-day week basis.  One might assume that means that people attend those day centres on five days, but they do not.  Eighty per cent of people from our services attend one or two days a week.  That is all they receive.  Twenty per cent of those day centres operate only one day a week.</p>  <p>  Wexford, Laois and Leitrim have no day care centre for persons with dementia.  That denies nearly 2,000 people access to a service.  In fact, taking three counties which are quite close, Leitrim has three services, Longford has six and Roscommon has ten.  The point being made about the lottery certainly is true.  Based on costings to the satisfaction of the HSE on the evidence of the number of services in an area and the minimum services there should be, &euro;12 million would transform dementia services in this country.  It would triple the services and provide a basic minimum level of service in each county in the country.</p>  <p>  The challenge is significant.  It is estimated that by 2046, the number of persons living with dementia in Ireland will rise threefold.  That needs to be considered in the context that the number of people over 65 will increase twofold in that period of time.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Mr. Ed Crotty, managing director of Heritage Homecare and a board director of HCCI.</p>  <p>  HCCI represents more than 70 member companies which provide care to 20,000 clients and employ 12,000 carers.  I was appointed chief executive of HCCI on Monday, 17 September of this year.</p>  <p>  There are a range of things we can do to improve home care in Ireland.  From HCCI's perspective, we need a non-exhaustive list to ensure operational changes, to increase the supply of carers, to professionalise the caring workforce, to improve trust and dialogue between the key stakeholders, and to work together to ensure Sl&aacute;intecare's success.</p>  <p>  One of the most pressing issues facing the service is waiting times.  While any increased funding to expand capacity would be welcome, there are crucial operational changes that need to be made.  At present, none of the IT systems talks to one another &ndash; those in the acute system do not talk to the public health nurses and the allocation of home care packages is poorly commissioned.</p> <p>This negatively impacts the ability to forward plan and to build capacity. </p> <p> The current allocation of packages, which is done by fastest finger first as per the HSE&rsquo;s 2018 tender, is sub-optimal.  HCCI would prefer to see a different model that would be uniform across all CHOs, allow providers to participate in holistic care planning and thus end the widespread practice of inefficient rostering.  This would provide more meaningful work for carers.  The current home care package is designed to fit all situations, but the type of support needed in rural Ireland differs from that of urban Ireland.  We need to look at a new funding model for home care.  Lessons can be learned from the fair deal scheme for nursing home care. </p> <p> As our population ages - we are all familiar with the statistics - we will need to expand the home care workforce.  To do so sustainably, and to attract and retain the talent of people that we would all wish to care for our loved ones should the circumstance arise, we need to stop a race to the bottom on pay and increase the pool of available labour.  HCCI submitted a case to the economic migration policy unit to allow non-EEA workers into Ireland to become home carers.  We think it is vital that we broaden the base of available workers.  In addition, HCCI is currently working on a submission to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the hopes we can end the current system that punishes a worker for providing home care while in receipt of State benefits. </p> <p> We need to change the HSE procurement rules so that the tendering process is a tool to improve the conditions of the workforce as well as to deliver value for money.  The reality is that the HSE sets the conditions of the market.  That carers do not receive travel allowances, except in rare circumstances, is as a result of the procurement practices of the HSE.  Caring needs to become more culturally embedded, and turned into a profession with a defined and rewarding career pathway.  Innovations are limited only by our imaginations.  Why not provide a mandatory caring module in transition year, for instance?  Professionalisation should also spell the end of a single hourly rate for carers.  Specialist skills should be rewarded, as they are in every other industry.  HCCI is pleased the HSE have conducted a review into the career of health care assistants, and we eagerly await the results.  </p> <p> HCCI welcomes this hearing today, but we are disappointed the attitude of this committee does not seem to be replicated elsewhere. One month after my appointment, I wrote to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, to request a meeting with him or his officials to talk about the range of issues facing the sector.  That letter has not received a response from the Minister of State.  The HSE last held a home care providers forum in April 2018.  This meeting of the HSE, HCCI and the non-profits should be a regular occurrence, and it is deeply regrettable the meeting scheduled for 5 December was postponed by the HSE.  My hope is that in addition to the forum becoming a regular place to discuss operational issues, a high-level working group will be formed, convened by the Department, between the principal stakeholders so that we can work together and form long-term policy proposals.  We also need more transparency in the operation of the service.  Recent work by members of this committee shed light on the current waiting lists, and work by my colleagues at the Care Alliance similarly enlightened us.  However, it would be better if the HSE regularly reported a standardised set of figures on the operation of home care across all nine CHOs.  HCCI would welcome this extra scrutiny and transparency, for only in understanding the true picture can we all act on an informed basis. </p> <p> Two developments that will shape the future of home care &ndash; namely, the statutory entitlement to home care and Sl&aacute;intecare &ndash; provide a rare opportunity for us to rethink some of our assumptions and design a robust and sustainable home care service.  Laura Magahy and her team are, by all accounts, doing great work at this early stage and I hope for a formal meeting with her soon.  HCCI would like to see a framework that draws on the expertise of the relevant stakeholders and meets regularly to ensure Sl&aacute;intecare is a success.  We need to clarify how we will fund the expansion in community services needed to support the reforms, as well as start preparing the entire sector so that it is ready to provide this care.  The regulation of home care is vital, and therefore we should be teasing out now what model of regulation will deliver the best outcome in the future. </p></speech>

We say this because traditionally there has been a sense that family carers look after old people. but we have a much bigger agenda than that.  We engage with more than 20,000 families each year.  We also deliver 350,000 hours of home care every year, which gives us an insight into the operational aspects of caring.  I would like to formally say that we are a member of the Home Care Coalition and support its goals.  We also support many of the points put forward by HCCI.<br/><br/>Our position engenders a slight degree of confusion.  When Mr. Musgrave spoke about labour and manpower shortages he was speaking about carers.  Under Government policy, carers are unpaid.  Care workers and care assistants are people who work in the home.  There is a lot of confusion when people talk about caring, and it is very important that this committee is clear about it.  Our agenda concerns the co-production of care, because we would maintain that the State has no remote prospect of being able to afford home care without co-production with unpaid family carers.  Taking the CSO's estimate and charging it up very conservatively, families provide &euro;10 billion worth of unpaid care in the home.  The irony is that the way policy is going threatens to strangle that care and reduce it instead of helping it.  <br/><br/>We are encouraged by the emerging themes which the Department of Health has abstracted from the first phase of its consultation.  However, there are a number of issues which are causing real concern, mainly because they are not being discussed as opposed to there being a lack of consensus on them or that they are going in the wrong direction.  The nature and purpose of home care will have to be defined in the legislation.  We believe the legislation will seek to place primary responsibility on the family, with the State in a supporting role.  We agree that is the right way to go and would command widespread support.  Unfortunately, the HSE recently seems to have set its face firmly against this approach.  I do not have time to develop this point in my opening statement, but I would suggest that there is a real prospect that the State will end up spending several hundred million euro extra because of the direction this is taking, with no increase in home care services.<br/><br/>There has been much talk about a funding model.  In the initial stages, when the legislation was being proposed, there was almost a rush in the direction of co-funding.  Our position is that we recognise that co-funding will be required in some shape or form.  We are not willing to talk about co-funding the current system; it is completely unacceptable.  The debate must focus on what we are trying to fund.  Standards for home care must be defined and a model for home care found before we discuss how it is to be funded.  A lot of current discussion centres on wonderful models from overseas.  There has been quite a lot of discussion about the German system, for example.  It is excellent, and is based on a very sophisticated insurance model.  For example, if one does not have children one's insurance premium is higher, on the not unreasonable assumption that when a person is older there will be nobody to look after him or her, whereas if a person does have children they are required to under the German system.  An insurance based system was first floated in Ireland decades ago.  There has never been evidence of a political appetite to address it.  We believe it is an interesting model to explore, but the reality is that good systems cannot be delivered without a proper funding model.  Trying to fund this by way of means testing via taxation is never going to work.  <br/><br/><i></i>As HCCI has said, there is a crisis in the staffing of home care.  That crisis is going to get worse.  We absolutely do not accept the ESRI and Department of Health-HSE projections because they are based on a steady-state situation.  Over the next ten years, as part of the demographic shift, unless the ratio of family carers is increased from one in ten to one in five, we will have to provide massive numbers of extra paid care.  That has to be built into a policy and thought about carefully, but it is not being mentioned or discussed.<br/><br/>The other elephant in the room is that the HSE itself is massively conflicted in terms of the delivery of home care.  I do not say that as a cheap shot at the HSE.  Many of the problems are not of its making, but rather are failures of policy.  We should consider that.  The HSE is a major direct provider of home care services throughout the country.  It delivers services on the basis of historical funding patterns, meaning that consistent service planning and delivery is problematic.  The current CHO system, where each CHO has an independent accounting officer and therefore a degree of operational autonomy - which the new regional integrated care organisations, RICOs, will also have - means that it is still practically impossible to achieve a consistent framework across the system.  <br/><br/>The HSE places an emphasis on home care, yet I would argue that when it comes to service delivery the priority is secondary to the priority it accords to its own internal industrial relations.  That must be named, acknowledged and discussed.  I am happy to be proved wrong, but I do not believe I will be.  <br/><br/>An effective system for dealing with grievances and complaints is essential to ensure quality home care services.  We are dealing with individuals who are at the front line, with enormous independence and autonomy who usually work unsupervised in someone's home.  HSE systems in this regard are unfit for purpose, which is a direct result of arrangements set by the Government, not by the HSE. </p> <p>As I understand it, the HSE wrote to the Government two years ago asking for those policies to be changed.  That does not relate just to home care; it relates across the system.  There has been no movement on that but there needs to be movement in that regard.  In our case, if we have a complaint it is signed and sealed within 30 days.  That can include either the rejection of the complaint, the person is dismissed or anything in between.  We have seen cases in the HSE where a similar situation has dragged on for years.  There is no reason for that to happen.  Furthermore, because of differential arrangements mandated by the HSE regarding working conditions for its own directly employed staff and for the staff of commission services, the hourly cost of direct provision is up to twice the cost of commissioned services at current rates.  That is a major discrepancy and potentially, if we want to look at it that way, a total waste of money.  That is worth discussing as well but I do not have time to develop it now.</p> <p> In terms of commissioning, Family Carers Ireland would contend that since commissioning was introduced in 2010 there has been a steady reduction in baseline quality indicators.  When the shift to a lowest common denominator home support specification is put beside the increasingly complex cases now being assigned to the home care system, it looks to us like a serious accident waiting to happen.</p> <p> Far from saving money, we believe this year&rsquo;s tender for home support services has resulted in avoidably higher costs of service because of the extent of gaming of the scoring system that was allowed in that tender.  To be clear, I am not suggesting anything that happened was unlawful.  I am just saying it was very bad policy.</p> <p> On regulation, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was originally scheduled to have assumed responsibility for regulating home care by 2016.  There is not even an alternative date in place.  The implications of failing to adhere to this timetable are not even being discussed or addressed, possibly because a HIQA survey in 2017 showed that 76% of people responding to the survey thought there was independent regulation in place.  I am sure the HSE would rather not be the regulator but if one is the regulator, the commissioner and the direct provider, one has a massive conflict of interest.</p> <p> This is, inevitably, a very high level review of issues, with five minutes to do it, relating to improving home care.  I will be happy to discuss any of the points later.</p></speech>

They are very useful.  This question is to whoever would like to respond.  In terms of the quality of the service, several witnesses suggested that the service is under more pressure than it was previously.  Reference was made earlier to 2008 and, just a minute ago, to a degrading of the service.  I have two questions.  First, how is the service doing over time?  Is it getting better or worse and If it is getting better or worse, in what ways?  There is time per person; consistency, for example, having the same carer available to the same person; waiting time and access to getting what one needs; the quality of the care provided; equipment that is sometimes needed and so forth.  The witnesses know that much better than I do.  How are we doing and, specifically, in what areas are services getting better or worse?</p>  <p>  In terms of the second opening question, several witnesses stated that access is getting more difficult.  I presume that means that waiting times are increasing and that the amount of care available per person or per home is decreasing.  On the basis that the spending on healthcare per person has increased every year for the past six years and is significantly higher than it was in 2008, what do the witnesses believe is happening if we are spending more money per person if the services are indeed getting worse?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00500"><p>I might speak to the issue of access.  It is quite simply demographics.  We have 20,000 people entering the 65 and older cohort each year.  A proportion of them, particularly those in their 80s, are likely to need home care if they want to stay out of hospitals and nursing homes.  It is a demographics issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of labour costs, it is labour-intensive work and there is no getting away from that.  Unit cost early rates are increasing, therefore, incrementally, that will continue. </p>  <p>  I cannot speak to the issue of quality equipment but to reiterate, there were 10% cuts overnight in home care provision in the tough years of 2011, 2012 and 2013.  They have begun to be restored but we are still playing catch-up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Crotty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00600"><p>I run a home care company in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dundrum areas of Dublin South.  To answer the Deputy's questions, the labour shortage is the biggest problem we face.  We are at full employment.  We are paying more per hour than we were a few years ago but it is becoming more difficult to recruit carers as they have a choice of other employment.  The number of hours per client is reducing over time.  Where someone might have got two or three hours a day from the HSE, they might get an hourly visit now or maybe half an hour, as someone said earlier, later in the day.  That is less attractive work for carers, regardless of the hourly rate.  The hourly rate is not as important as the conditions of employment.  Mr. Musgrave spoke about professionalisation of the industry and said we need to do all those things, and get more carers into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McLoughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00700"><p>We certainly have not caused any of the HSE's deficits.  In 2013, we received &euro;11 million from it and in 2018, we received &euro;11.2 million.  In terms of what has happened, with 4,000 new people being diagnosed with dementia each year, in effect the services have ended up being rationed.  People who might have been receiving two or three days a week in a day centre have been rationed.  We are paying our staff at 2010 rates of pay.  The differential between someone who commenced in the HSE in 2010 versus 2017 is now &euro;5,500 per annum.  That is for a care assistant providing direct care.</p>  <p>  We evaluate satisfaction with our services.  It is consistently high because we have the same staff.  They have empathy, they are trained and they are not into clock watching or pressure to go to another client.  People with dementia and their carers tell us that even if the State can give them only seven hours a week, they want the flexibility as to how that seven hours is used rather than giving one hour a day to get somebody up in the morning.  By the time the carer arrives, the person may be already up.  They may be living in a rural area.  They cannot get the time even to go into a shop.  Even if the HSE can give only a certain number of hours, it should give families and carers some role in determining how that is provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00800"><p>To give some examples of reductions in care, when tendering was introduced in 2010, organisations were allowed 48 hours to match a care worker to a particular case.  In some parts of the country, one is now given four hours.  Often one is not given details of the case to which one is being asked to match.  There is not even a pretence of trying to get suitable matching.  That is one example.</p>  <p>  We have gone from requiring staff to have a full QQI level 5 qualification by 2012 to the current competency assessment approach, which costs deliverers.  In our case it costs almost &euro;100,000 a year to administer this monster, which is really a way for the HSE to say it has checked thoroughly that these people are competent in that it made them certify themselves rather than simply requiring them to have a qualification.</p>  <p>  A major example is the 30-minute calls.  They are poor anyhow but in respect of 30-minute double assists, where one has to do something with somebody using a hoist, which involves two staff working together, we refuse to take those cases on the basis that it is a serious risk and we will not deal with it.  However, it is becoming commonplace to be asked to do it.</p>  <p>  There is another example that is less tangible.  I would argue that in the past ten years there has been a stripping out of social care into purely personal care.  Personal care is starting to be neglected in favour of clinical care.  However, the social care is very important.  When we talk about home care, it is meant to be an integrated, wraparound service.  It is not just a case of getting in there and stopping a person from dying today.</p>  <p>  In terms of where the money is going, I agree with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, it is not going to us.  If the members could get an answer to that question, I would be very interested to hear it.  I am taking a crude figure as an example.  There was an office within the HSE, and I am taking into account the costs of the leader, the support team and all the rest, which had a budget of approximately &euro;500,000 a year to manage home care.  There are now two.  I do not understand the reason for that.  The members might get to the bottom of it but in terms of this issue, there is &euro;0.5 million on the spot.</p>  <p>  The second question was about access getting more difficult.  It has become routine in the past year for the HSE to arrive into a house and tell the person that because he or she gets the carer's allowance he or she will not get the home care package.</p> <p>This will cost the State money in two ways.  The State defended an action from the European Commission in the European courts on the exportability of carer's allowance.  It defended that action on the basis that this was an income support, not a payment for the delivery of home care services.  The HSE is now saying that is exactly what it is.  Income support for carers comes to &euro;1 billion per year.  Exportability will be a significant slice of that.  That is reckless.  Quite frankly, it is lunacy.  I do not believe it is being done intentionally but it does reflect a style of policy making that involves saying "this is what we are doing" with no consultation or discussion, instead of bringing people into a room and saying "this is what we intend to do, tell us if there is anything wrong with it and we will see if we can fix it."  The HSE seems to like to learn not just by bumping into things but by jumping off cliffs and then discovering what is going wrong.  </p> <p> Regarding the second problem, we have met people who have been told that in order to get services they needed as part of a home care package they could not undertake themselves, they had to give up their carer's allowance.  We had a case where somebody did that and then went back and said they had given back their carer's allowance to be told there was no budget to give them support.  Another case involved an able-bodied young adult son being required to move out of the house before they would consider that home care was needed.  That is how difficult it is becoming to get home care.  </p></speech>

If we are going to deny someone home care on the basis that someone is receiving carer's allowance, it is important that we remember that only a quarter of all carers receive carer's allowance in the first instance because it is means tested.  Those who are lucky enough to receive carer's allowance receive &euro;16 more than the basic social welfare rate.  By rationing, withdrawing or denying home support to such persons, we are telling them that they would be better off on jobseeker's allowance instead of carer's allowance.  Complicating this is the fact that carer's allowance for carers over 70 is assessed in the means test for the medical card.  It is not assessed if the person is under 60.  There is a litany of ways in which we are penalising and punishing family carers rather than recognising and rewarding them.  The pension is another example but I will leave that one.</p></speech>

In response to very clear frustrations the witnesses are obviously all managing on a daily basis, is anything working in the system?  What is going well?  In terms of the different types of support available, one of the presentations listed home care, home help hours, care packages and intensive home care packages.  We know there has been a shift from discretionary home care or home help hours to these care packages which, in some cases, make sense.  However, they do not always make sense, for example, in respect of cases in Wicklow with which I deal.  What is working?  What are the successes in the system on which we should build?  How is the mix working out between the different types of package available as in package versus home care versus home help hours and so forth?  Is there an opportunity to adjust the mix to bring in additional ones, stop doing particular ones and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Musgrave" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00400"><p>I will take Deputy Donnelly's first question.  HCCI welcomed the development of clinical governance in the HSE's 2018 tender, which many of my members have taken to mean having a qualified nurse or somebody similar.  Codifying that is a good development.  It is a baby step towards what regulation might look like and we think that is important, so that is one tick.  The effort by carers remains immense.  I attended the HCCI carers conference a couple of weeks ago and spoke to removed carers, some of whom were angry.  They got a much-needed pat on the back by a lot of people for the work they do.  My colleagues here would testify to that.  There is also a lot of expertise in the system.  Now that we have been operating for more than a decade, we have built up and have learned a lot of lessons.  The frustration, particularly in this room, arises out of the fact that this expertise does not seem to be capitalised on.  Again, while I would call that out as a positive development and a good thing, it is a shame that not much advantage seems to be taken of it.  I will let others address Deputy Donnelly's second question in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McLoughlin" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00500"><p>What works for us is fund raising.  We have been consistently successful in growing our fund raising to &euro;3.2 million, which is shoring up State services.  On a positive note, the National Dementia Office is including persons with dementia and carers in all its working groups looking at diagnosis, post diagnosis, support and care pathways.  However, when we come to negotiating the service-level agreement with the CHO areas or the HSE, that is just set at nought and there is no further funding.  We also would be very supportive of the Understand Together campaign, which is raising awareness of dementia services.  It raises awareness but those people ring a national help line provided by our volunteers six days a week who have to tell them that even though they have come forward, there is nothing for them if they are in a county with no services.  We support Government policy in respect of the national dementia strategy.  It is not mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare.  We support all of the initiatives that Government and the National Dementia Office are undertaking.  We have been included in it but we are simply not seeing any dedicated resource for dementia and no realisation of just what it is like to be a family carer or indeed a person with dementia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00600"><p>When one comes in here, and particularly when one is asked to boil down our statements to five minutes, it is inevitable that one will throw out the negativity.  It is worth acknowledging that millions of hours are being delivered.  It is a valuable service and a life saver for people.  There are individual care workers - not carers - within the system who provide an heroic service.  We were not unique in this, but during the storms last year I had a difficulty because when a Status Red weather warning is issued, the rule is that services are cancelled.  People were going out delivering meals and making unscheduled and unpaid calls to ensure the people they were looking after were catered for.  That is the positive energy in the system and it is worth celebrating and acknowledging.  Having said that, the system is not fostering or feeding that.  I know where the Deputy is coming from in terms of looking at the positives as well.  What I am looking at is the trajectory, which is going the wrong way.  Dublin is broken.  The Deputy mentioned the difficulties in terms of Dublin.  We did not even bid to deliver home care services in the Dublin area this year because it is a zoo.  This relates to the policies and systems that are in place.  It certainly does not relate to the care workers and the clients.</p></speech>

We still do not have that.  I do not envy Laura Magahy and her small staff untangling that one because it is the legacy of the extremely bizarre hybrid system we have inherited and managed to devolve incrementally over the decades.  We do not have a strong and robust eligibility and entitlement framework.  Therefore, the HSE has a myriad of ways of looking at this.  The nine CHO areas have different ways of measuring, allocating and prioritising need.  This, quite frankly, is shocking - that a small territory of a few million people is unable to know what is happening and project adequately.  Our colleagues have told the committee what is coming down the track.  This has to stop.  It needs to be addressed very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00800"><p>I apologise for not being here at the beginning of the meeting but I was watching on the monitor.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before us this morning.  My questions are pretty much directed at all of the witnesses.  My first question concerns rates of pay.</p> <p>We know the rates of pay that are paid to home help carers directly employed by the HSE.  I am curious to know the average rate of pay for home carers.  I think pay and conditions are central to the recruitment issue to which the witnesses have alluded.</p> <p> The average number of hours per person is going down but the number of hours allocated is going up.  The Minister for Health often loudly proclaims the percentage increase in the number of home help hours but, in real life, people come into my clinics saying they cannot get home help hours.  There is a disconnect there.</p> <p> Ms Dean mentioned calls that last only 30 minutes.  Have the witnesses encountered a 15-minute call?  I have heard of that happening and it shocks me.  Collectively, those agents who provide home care should be telling the HSE, with one voice, that there is a minimum standard and number of minutes that should apply.  The minimum should be an hour.  Half an hour is not right but 15 minutes is beyond even that.  I have heard of that, so perhaps the witnesses could comment.</p> <p> Mr. Dunne mentioned that it is possible to game the numbers in the tender process.  I would like him to elaborate on that because we need more information about that. </p> <p> I ask the witnesses individually if they would subscribe to a national minimum standard in terms and conditions.  To put my cards on the table, some of the witnesses may be aware of the fact that I used to represent home helps in the HSE and voluntary sectors, though regrettably not so much in the private sector.  There may have been improvements in that since I moved on.  One issue that was raised by our members was about stability.  I could never get my head around the fact that the work was there and there was a demand for the service and yet the contract could not reflect that.  I believe that, if there was standardisation in terms and conditions, a standard minimum rate of pay and standardised contract, we would not have the issue with recruitment because very often when people leave the home care sector it is not to go to jobs with a dissimilar rate of pay.  The rates are often very similar but the difference is stability.  In the new job, one might work on a changing shift pattern but would work for only eight hours a day.  They are some of the most flexible workers in the workforce, as both I and the witnesses know.  They are looking only for stability of income and the capacity to plan in a small way.  Oftentimes carers leave for shift work so the awkward times are not the problem, it is more being able to know how much work they will have.  I could never understand why the HSE would not commit to that contract in the context of rising demand.  I would be interested to know the witnesses' views on a standardised contract and guaranteed minimum numbers of hours, given we know there will be an increase in the demand for home care.</p> <p> Mr. McLoughlin mentioned that funding for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, ASI, over a long number of years, had gone from &euro;11 million to &euro;11.2 million.  Perhaps the other organisations might be in a position to comment on their funding, or their contracts with the HSE and what direction that is going in because it does not seem to be moving very fast.  I would be interested to know that.</p> <p> Finally, is there a role for HIQA, or a similar agency, in providing the regulation?  We know that regulation is very tricky for any lone worker who deals with the public.  Do the witnesses see a role for HIQA in bringing in that regulation?  Do they see a role for another agency?  I see the difficulty with the HSE being the regulator and the commissioner and provider of services.  That would cause some issues.  HIQA is already in place, so do the witnesses see its remit expanding, or do they think that there might be a role for another body?</p></speech>

I have already outlined the fact that, in the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland service level agreement with the HSE, it has not been able to pay its staff an increment.  We took our cuts in 2010 and no member of staff has taken an increment since then in ASI.</p>  <p>  Our allocation of hours is going down because we do not provide generic home care services so we did not get the tender.  Our home care footprint is reducing by anywhere between about 8% and 12% each year.</p>  <p>  I would absolutely support national minimum standards.  The number of intensive home care packages at the moment for persons with dementia in the community is 178.  That is not allowed to grow, as far as I understand, unless somebody dies or goes into residential care.</p>  <p>  I totally support the idea of a separate regulator.  What is going on at the moment is dreadful.  If a respite centre provides one week of respite for somebody with dementia, a nurse is in charge right throughout the evening.  Nobody else will be allowed to give a drug to the individual.  There has to be a care pathway for it.  There is nothing like that for the other 51 weeks of the year but, for that one week, the State gets very self-defensive about how it provides care.  We absolutely support a separate regulator.</p>  <p>  Over the five-year period that Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, we have moved our fundraising from about &euro;2 million to more than &euro;3 million and that is propping up the system.</p></speech>

HCCI, supports an independent regulator.  The more pertinent question is the model of regulation.  Would it be a compliance model, where inspectors are sent into people's homes, which would be quite invasive?  Would it be a licence to operate a model from existing providers?  The more interesting and complicated question is how to regulate the sector, rather than who would do it, although I agree the HSE should not do it because of the conflicts of interest.</p>  <p>  HCCI does not receive any funding other than from members but, similar to what Mr. McLoughlin was saying, most of our members are operating on legacy rates.  The HSE has not updated its hourly rates of pay dating back to 2008.  For instance, some carers are going into one home at one rate and into another home at another rate, which is unusual.  The tender ties members in for two years and the HSE refused to touch or to reopen it.</p>  <p>  I will return to the Deputy's point about national minimum standards because I think that is the largest topic.</p>  <p>  No member has reported to me about a 15-minute call.</p>  <p>  The rate of pay averages around &euro;14 by the time the higher rate for weekend work is included, as well as holidays and other entitlements.  The national minimum standards point ties back to the rate of pay.  HCCI has a set of national standards to which every member subscribes.  I came to this job only in September and one thing I want to do is to update those standards to perhaps include some of the points about which the Deputy is talking.  Other than the HSE tender, the standards of my organisation are the only ones of which I know that apply nationally and against which members are independently audited.  </p>  <p>  We need to look at professionalising care workers because, at the moment, we commission services based on one hourly rate of pay, regardless of whether it is a legacy rate.  We do not ask if someone is high, medium or low dependency, or requires a care worker with a separate set of skills.  People in my family are frontline care workers so I know this well.  What is the career pathway to develop and incentivise people to get more skills?  We want to look at that.  The current commissioning system is locked into a cycle of fastest-finger-first bidding to provide the care, rather than taking a holistic approach, which I am hoping this committee is getting to the bottom of, because the Department and HSE do not seem to want to engage with me about this.  We are locked into a stalemate whereby there are some good ideas at the table about national minimum standards but the pathway to implementation and further development seems obscure.</p></speech>

The number of service providers is also an issue.  In a small catchment area services are spread between different service providers which brings me back to the point of employing enough staff to be able to take up an hour's work here and an hour's work there.  If the number of carers could be spread over a smaller number of service providers that might give an opportunity to employ people on fixed contracts of, for example, 20 hours.  That is where the stability piece would come in and raise the bar a little.</p></speech>

On a practical level, if one takes for example a home care package in Arklow and there is a carer who wants to go there, one wants to add two or three more home care packages so one has a cluster of them in the area.  Each home care package is commissioned independently of all the others so there is no opportunity to cluster them.  I do not mean to focus on Arklow but if one takes a home care package there, assuming one's rates are competitive, one should be able to get the next three or four that come along so there would be one carer who goes there and has a whole morning's work.  Is that what Ms Carthy is saying?</p></speech>

In the context of stability, we had a case recently where we could tell they were HSE packages because there was a four-hour block in the middle of the day.  That is gold to any commercial provider.  I am putting ourselves in that category for the purposes of a tender.  We recruited 12 staff.  A block of cases came to us very suddenly out of the blue and we put in place the packages.  Three months later we got a call basically saying, "thanks very much, you can fire all your staff now as our people are ready to take over again".  The stability for the HSE staff is coming at the cost of the rest the sector.  I am not saying that is necessarily what should happen but that is the way it is being operated at the moment.</p></speech>

If the HSE was adequately fulfilling the demand, there would not be a need for outside recruitment.  There would be a sufficient pool of staff.</p></speech>

It is not an ideological issue: it just would not work because the flexibility is not there.  I attended this committee some years ago talking about a man who was being put to bed at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for the only reason that his HSE worker did not want to work any later.  I was told three weeks later that the case had been sorted, but that is the system.</p>  <p>  As Mr. Musgrave said, HIQA is the one that has most often been cited to do this but it would probably have to stop at the front door.  The problem with that is there is a limit to how much one is regulating the quality of care.  On the other hand, to get into a different sort of model, one must first look outside the health system.  I have a mental image of a reasonably elderly lady carrying her adult son up a very narrow stairs because the only toilet in the house was upstairs and the son was profoundly disabled.  That is an issue of housing adaptation.  That is clearly a major health and safety issue, but are we going to mandate an initiative which states a house is unsuitable and a person must go into care.  We are moving somewhat in that direction with Children First because once one starts to put in place safeguarding measures an inspector will deem a house to be unsafe and that will be the end of it.  There is no debate and no regard to what the family wants.  I do not know what the answer is but introducing HIQA into the process seems to be a reasonable step along the way.</p>  <p>  For us, the direction of funding has to do with consolidation.  We used to have 50 separate funding agreements with the HSE, and that has now been consolidated down to ten, which is very good.  However, like the other organisations, last year there was a big debate and we were told there could be no increase in costs and no reduction in services.  The HSE was doing both itself but that did not really matter; that was it.  We went in and we kicked the stuffing and we got some increases here and we got some reduction in services there, but that is the mindset.  As somebody said, that goes back to the legacy costs.  We were awarded a contract in 2008 or 2010 and I got a contract modification recently to say the HSE would continue to pay us the same rate as was set then to deliver healthcare.  The rate is &euro;14 an hour and if one maps that onto the pay of a home care worker, one is ignoring the fact that, first, there are specifications in the contract around management.  I mentioned already the competency assessment process, which costs approximately &euro;100,000 a year.  That has to be paid for out of the &euro;14 an hour.  There are three pages of policies.  I do not mean a three page policy, I mean a three page list of policies with which we have to comply.  That all costs.  When people ask where the money is going, it is going on bureaucracy, which is required although it is not all necessary, but it is there and we are contracted to deliver it.</p>  <p>  I was asked to comment on the tender process and gaming.  The way the tender process is constructed, one is asked to quote for hours during different periods &ndash; day time hours, night time hours, weekend day time, weekend night time and bank holidays.  It is strange to be asked to tender for bank holidays because there is a statutory definition of what they cost and it does not vary.  In providing the scoring for each of the rates, there was a notional number of hours that would be provided.  One of the frustrations of bidding in this competition is that one can be certain the statistics one is being given are wrong.  In fact, it says in the tender that one cannot rely on any of the figures outlined.  People look at the figures and they look at their own experience.  Clearly, some people looked at it and said, sure there are very few night time calls so the lowest bid on the night time rate was lower than the lowest bid on the day time rate, which from her background Deputy O'Reilly might say is suggestive of gaming.  The advantage of that is that one gets a very significant score by having that ridiculously low rate.  That is the gaming element.  Because one got a high score for the low price on night time rates, one was able to charge a higher rate for the day time rates, which is from where most of the billing comes, and one did not get penalised because one had off-set the penalty with the low score.  People got through with the higher hourly rate in the day time than would have been optimal from the point of view of the HSE's budget.</p>  <p>  A secondary issue is that we would argue that the low rate is borderline if not below the minimum wage.  It is not below the formal minimum wage.  People talk about travel expenses.  The key cost with travel is time.  It is a requirement under European law to recognise travel time, but it is not a requirement under Irish law, which is interesting, but European law takes precedence until such time as it is triggered in Ireland.  Up to now it would have required a court case to trigger it, but interestingly there was a development in the European Court of Justice in the past fortnight which opened another avenue for that.  The travel time is the major expense.  When the HSE is paying its own staff, it pays them a slightly higher rate, but I would not begrudge that.  There are all sorts of flexibility that organisations such as ours can give in terms of a little Christmas bonus or whatever else that allows us to even it up, but the big difference is travel time.  I am a very innocent little man, and the thing that mystifies me most is that if we are contracted to deliver a package from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., we deliver a package from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., yet when I talk to people, especially in Dublin, they ask: what does 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. mean?  I say it means 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., but apparently it does not.  People take their travel time out of that hour.  Even if the HSE wanted to give out a 15 minute package, it would have to pay us for 30 minutes under the rules of the tender.  I wonder if people are experiencing a 15 minute care package because a chunk of time is being used for travel.</p></speech>

About 50 to 100 carers came together.  At every one of those forums, carers mentioned at least once 15 minute calls and half-hour calls.  Yesterday in Donegal I had a girl whose mother who has dementia is getting a 20-minute call to get her out of bed and washed.  I reiterate what Mr. McLoughlin said.  Families are grateful to get anything.  The issue is quality.  Quality sometimes does not come into it because families are so grateful to get anything that they just take it.  They do not complain.  They are terrified to complain when the quality is questionable.  It is worth repeating what Mr. McLoughlin said earlier.  We have an expression in Family Carers Ireland that sometimes home support hours are inflicted on families.  Families take whatever hours they get when they are given them.  It might not suit the family at all because someone is there between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. for example.  People will take them because that is all that is available.  It is important to restate that.  People will not complain, even about the shorter calls, because of the fear of the consequences and repercussions.</p></speech>

I thank them for all the work they are doing in this very important and growing area.  I will return to the cost issue in tendering for contracts.  I was given figures some time ago that showed private home care providers are quoting something like &euro;22 or &euro;24 an hour.  They referred to deducting what they pay to the staff, which is the hourly rate, and adding in the costs of administration, insurance and all the other costs associated with providing a service.  Has anyone asked the HSE for a breakdown of what it costs it to provide homecare per hour when the cost of its administration service and insurance is taken into account?  I was told it was costing the HSE around &euro;32 per hour to provide home care.  Can anyone give information on that?  Mr. Dunne spoke earlier about-----</p></speech>

I am concerned about the people who are being required to provide the service and being asked to tender.  The tender has to meet the HSE's requirements but what is being paid out is way under what it costs the HSE to run it.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years the HSE has taken on an additional 13,000 people in all areas, including nursing, administration and caring staff.  I have heard complaints about companies that were providing home care and a lot of their staff have been recruited by the HSE and have been given contracts.  There are more than 2,000.  Will the witnesses give some clarification on that?  I understand Nursing Homes Ireland is having a problem retaining staff as are the private home care providers.  I am looking for some clarification on that.</p>  <p>  The third issue I want to raise is our growing elderly population.  The figures have been referred to at this meeting and numerous other times.  We now have full employment.  How can we get more people to provide homecare if such competitiveness is a feature?  I understand there are difficulties involved in bringing people in from abroad.  It is a challenge.  The people who are providing homecare privately have the challenge of recruiting workers.  The HSE has difficulties in getting carers for people despite the fact it is paying people a reasonable rate.  We are now facing a major challenge in that area.  How do we deal with that challenge?  </p>  <p>  Where the HSE is providing homecare, I have come across a number of cases where there is a major difficulty at both weekends and public holidays.  How do we deal with that issue?  On the one hand, the HSE is providing a very good service between 8 a.m. or 9.a.m and 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. five days a week but at weekends and on public holidays there is a major problem.  There is no company available to provide care over the weekends.  I am talking in particular about people who live alone and there is no immediate family around them.  How do we face that challenge?</p></speech>

In our research over the years, we have made assumptions because the HSE could not or would not give us the data.  We looked at &euro;20 per hour; more recently &euro;25 per hour is the assumption we are going on.  I am not convinced.  I think it is probably closer to &euro;32 per hour.  Pension and travel costs are not reflected properly in the costing.  When the Minister announces an extra 100 homecare packages, the cost base is a little naive.  Perhaps the committee would seek that information directly from the HSE.  We would love to hear it.</p>  <p>  The Senator was spot on about the increase in staff numbers.  The reality in spite of the reference to primary care being crucial is that hospitals continue to recruit more staff and overrun their budgets massively, five or ten times compared with homecare and community care.  I will give an example.  The committee discussed it last week.  An extra 47 public health nurses have been taken on in the past three to four years, which is a 3% increase.  If one contrasts that with the 27% increase in staff at grade 8 and above, one questions the priorities.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of foreign care workers, the reality is they will provide a future supply of care.  Valuing that and giving people the legitimacy to be employed legally here is really important.  A number of the not-for-profit organisations have made representations on reviewing the criteria and deeming care workers to be in short supply to make it easier for people from abroad to come here and work legitimately.  It will be part of the solution.</p></speech>

We get about &euro;2.4 million from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for our community employment, CE, schemes.  About one in five of our staff is on one of those schemes.  We have situations where we find those CE workers difficult to replace.  What happens in that situation is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection shows a saving and the Department of Health has to fight for the additional resource, perhaps 19 hours, being used by that CE employee.  I have raised the issue with two Ministers of State.  I have said it does not make sense.  There is a pot of money, about &euro;2.4 million, and we could put it towards a proper training programme and a career structure so people can work in areas such as dementia or Alzheimer care and be available in the marketplace.  Some private providers have come together on that issue.  It needs to be made attractive.  We are losing staff to the HSE.  I do not want to over-egg that issue but we have noticed a trend that staff who are working part time with us have advised us they are working part time with a private operator and doing private hours for individuals.  That puts individual staff members in a very difficult position.  They are dealing with three sets of rules and policies and procedures.  They are dealing with Garda vetting for providers.  Safeguarding issues may be also dealt with differently in different organisations.  The situation of part-time carers is very difficult.  It would be much better if there was a proper career structure and training pathway in place and that the money from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was put towards a proper training programme in health.  That is the view of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.</p></speech>

That is not a cheap shot.  My last job, when I worked in the public sector, was to approve a budget for an organisation like the one with which I am now involved.  I went through it with a fine tooth comb, put lots of red lines through it, and ironically, three months later, I found myself running that organisation, trying to deliver the project on the budget.  I learned how sheltered the public sector is in terms of costing a service.  It is something the committee could usefully investigate.  Furthermore, if the committee does get an answer, I would be very happy to come back to the committee and give it the benefit of our insight on the cost structure that is being presented to it because we do it every day.  The HSE and its managers, to be fair, do not see most of the costs associated with the service; they see the direct pay cost but they do not see the rest.  </p> <p> The number of people we are losing to the HSE is not something I would over-egg but it is certainly true.  In 2011, in the good old days, when a FETAC qualification was specified, we trained all our staff up to that level.  It cost us tens of thousands of euro.  People said they could not afford it but we said that was the standard, we said we would meet it and we will.  We have now lost those staff.  We do not spend money achieving a standard that is not required because if we do, the people will be taken away from us.  There is a dysfunction there with a shortage of staff and the staff are getting cannibalised.  We keep an eye on the staff turnover metrics and we are pretty happy with our retention rate but we definitely do lose people, not only to the HSE but also to the nursing home sector.  When people get to a point where they need a block of work on which they can rely, we cannot provide that, and they go to work in the HSE or a nursing home.  People will work in our sector only if casual flexible hours suit them..  Whether that is good or bad, that is the reality. </p> <p>Deputy O'Reilly's argument for a set of national conditions are relevant.  I do not have any difficulty with that but the same conditions would have to apply everywhere.  I would say we are demanding of our staff in a way that I am not convinced, procedurally, the HSE is.  That is an issue that needs to be sorted out.</p> <p> On weekends and public holidays, we just got a request from a part of the country where the HSE asked if we would help at Christmas and the new year and we said we certainly would.  Our own packages are required to keep working over Christmas, we are a 365 day organisation.  If we are due to do something on Christmas day, we do it.  </p></speech>

I deeply welcome the degree of technical expertise by all the stakeholders here, as no doubt do Deputies and Senators.  However, we should remind ourselves that the culture and values of the HSE are care, compassion, trust and learning.  I am a member of the National Patient Forum.  We have marvellous, creative and very inspiring discussions about coproduction and codesign of services but I am not hearing any of this today.  Therefore, I want to bring the person back into the room.  As we speak about the back end technical part of this, which is obviously failing and not fit for purpose, every day and hour there are people in wholly unacceptable conditions.  Age Action is not at the technical end of this which we are leaving to our esteemed colleagues but the calls to our organisation are frankly heartbreaking.  The people out there do not know their entitlements and do not care about the back office technical end because they are suffering.  As Yeats would say, we are in the rag and bone shop of the heart.  The elected members here have a responsibility to be part of the robust discussion, which must happen in our society, about how we will arrive at a statutory home care system which is adequately funded and which meets need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.414" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Musgrave" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200011#N00300"><p>I agree with Ms Deane's comments.  That is why we must grapple with the technicalities.  On the Senator's point about HSE's cost, I would reiterate that other than FOI requests, I do not see how we can get the information.  They have not met with my organisation or non-profits since April which for an operational forum design to get to the heart of a range of issues is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I also would not over-egg the agency recruitment of staff but it does go to the heart of the conflict of interest in the commission of care and hiring staff.  I have been told by members that packages seem to be launched almost on a pilot basis in some areas and once the HSE establishes that the packages can be run regularly, they then hire staff which leaves my members and others in a difficult situation, perhaps having to let go carers if they cannot find other work for them.  While the specific issue of the recruitment of staff may not be the most burning issue, the conflict of interest is one to which we must return.</p>  <p>  As Mr. Dunne noted, weekends and bank holiday work is something my members are required to do, and do provide.  They provide 24 hour care.  I am aware from my own family circumstances of people who are on call having to leave at all hours from family functions to provide care.  I have seen this in action.</p>  <p>  To get people into home care in the workforce will take a combination of capacity building and improving conditions.  HCCI submitted to the Economic Migration Policy Unit a proposal to allow non-EEA workers into the country.  We could do this and be innovative in how we do so.  We could take an approach where we look at where capacity is low in each CHO and establish how many more staff we need and their availability.  The mechanism to do that does not exist and, even if we did have it, we do not have the tools to increase the workforce.  That is what we are seeking.  Following Mr. McLoughlin's point, we need a step change in how we view the workforce, and career path and professionalisation is key to this.  </p>  <p>  On capacity, HCCI is working on a submission to the forum for social protection.  The social protection system is not currently designed for careworkers.  Instead of a tapering system where it is possible to work a certain number of hours and keep entitlements, it is calculated by day.  If someone provides a block of hours of much-needed care, and wants to do this, they will be penalised by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which will tell them they cannot have their entitlement for that day.  I am encouraged by the early signs that the Department is wiling to listen but I must work with others on a submission that puts the case, and I hope to get the committee members' support on that.  That would release more capacity and more people who want to provide care, but are currently penalised.  </p>  <p>  Commissioning is very important in this.  It is difficult to provide meaningful work for carers.  Part of this is rostering where, as Mr. Crotty noted, one can provide care in what would be a sensible way.  One would not send a delivery man half way around an area, he would be sent on a route.  I am not suggesting we send people on routes but if we had a more holistic system and planned more effectively we could give carers a better quality of life and improve the quality of their work.</p></speech>

We have met representatives of the Department in recent years.  We met them when unemployment was at 10% because we could not encourage people to come off the live register and take up caring roles and we wanted to be creative and see what we could do.  The Department pointed to four pre-existing schemes, such as the part-time jobs incentive scheme, that they felt should address the issue but they simply did not.  The Department, which now has the employment portfolio, should be thinking in this space and need to get much more creative.  For example, carers in receipt of carer's allowance are allowed 15 hours a week. Seven or eight years ago income earned during the 15 hours as a home care worker was exempt from the means test for carer's allowance as an incentive to encourage people to work as home care workers.  I am not advocating that specifically but it was a sign of an eagerness of support.  We have 80,000 carers who receive carer's allowance.</p> <p>They are allowed to work 15 hours.  Most of them would like to work in a paid capacity, in paid care work, and we should be looking at how we can incentivise them.  This would address the likes of the pension issue and the financial issues they face.  It would also help them to stay engaged with the labour market while they are caring.  I therefore agree completely that we must look towards the Department of social protection, which now has that employment element of the portfolio as well.</p></speech>

From a practical point of view, what triggers a request for home care?  It depends upon the availability of families to supply support themselves.  Many families make extraordinary efforts in supporting their family members, even their neighbours, in remaining in their homes.  I am aware of cases in which people have been kept out of hospital and out of nursing homes by the extraordinary efforts made by family members who either are living with the person who needs care or come home to look after them, taking time off work.  There is the intervention of the public health nurse, the community intervention teams and, eventually, palliative care teams that come in to look after patients.  An extraordinary amount of care is provided in the home by family members.  There is never a request for home care because they want to do it themselves.  There are other families who cannot do this.  I refer to patients living on their own and their families.  Either they do not have a family or their family is scattered around the world so they do not have that capacity.  An extraordinary amount of work is done by family members in looking after their sick and disabled relatives at home.  Eventually, though, there is a trigger in that there is a requirement for home help or a home care package.  It might come from the patient himself or herself, the public health nurse or the doctor, or, if the patient is in a hospital, when they are being discharged there is a requirement.  There are many triggers for the requests for home help and home care packages.  When this trigger is pulled, a request is put in to the HSE, usually by the public health nurse, but it could be by the hospital, and this is then assessed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Here I see a problem because now it goes out to tender.  What are the criteria for the tendering process?  How does one decide what someone needs and how it will be delivered?  Quite often home care is delivered in a very fixed and strict manner.  It might not fit the working arrangements of the people who live at home with the patient.  They may have to go to work.  There can therefore be a lack of flexibility when the home care is actually provided.  As someone here mentioned, it may come when there is help at home and they need the help when they are not at home to look after their relative or friend.  Is there sufficient flexibility in the system to do this?  I am really interested in the criteria used to decide how much home help one gets and who gives it.  I am aware of supported housing for elderly people where there might be four different organisations coming in to the same group of 15 or 16 houses when one person could deliver the home care for the people in that very concentrated area.  There might be four different suppliers coming in to give the care, which does not make any sense.  Is there joined-up thinking in how the tendering process is used effectively and cost-effectively?  Furthermore, carers who provide care at home also require respite care.  Is there sufficient support for carers who need a rest themselves from looking after their relatives?  Perhaps the witnesses would like to discuss this point.</p></speech>

The tender is a way for the HSE to pull in supplementary flexible support for a service that is mainly delivering itself.  That is how I would describe it.  There are huge variations geographically around the country.  In some parts of the country the HSE employs thousands of home care workers itself and provides most of the service and only fills in the edges.  In other parts of the country the history is one of outsourcing, so there is flexibility.  To respond to the questions the Chairman asked, an application process has been just put in place, and the interesting thing is that the application must be made by the person needing the home care.  It is not made by a family member, the public health nurse or the hospital.  I do not know how this will work.  It is in its very early stages.</p>  <p>  As for the assessment, again, the Chairman is probably better equipped to probe this, but my understanding is that the care needs assessment is carried out in two phases.  There is a clinical and social care assessment.</p></speech>

What I mean is that there are people who sit down and say, "This is what this person needs."  That then gets passed to a budget office, which says, "This is what this person is getting."  This is an interesting approach, but my understanding is that is how it works.</p>  <p>  Regarding the flexibility of hours, a pilot programme was trialled in Clare last year.  I refer to client-directed home care, which is a model used internationally.  The one thing I will tell the committee about this is that client-directed home care in Ireland has nothing to do with any of the international models but it does allow one improvement, that is, some flexibility around timing and how one phases one's hours.  Given the industrial relations element of core hours and work outside certain hours, I was curious as to how client-directed home care was compatible with the current agreements in respect of HSE staff.  I asked, what are the limits of this?  The answer is that client-directed home care would be offered to people for whom the HSE feels it would be suitable.  I do not know what this means but it covers a multitude and does not suggest a real openness to flexibility and so on.  It is moving slowly in that direction, however.  There are huge problems with client-directed home care.  The way it happened in Clare is that people were handed a list of 20 providers when they were at a peak crisis and looking for home help and were told, "Off you go now.  Sort it out."  One of our worries and suspicions is that in areas where the HSE is struggling to deliver, even with the assistance of the contracted providers to deliver home care, by handing over that piece of paper, the responsibility suddenly passes to the family rather than to the HSE as the service provider.  There are a lot of issues to consider, but if the committee hears talk of client-directed home care, and it probably will, it should be aware that it is highly problematic but may contain the seeds of something that will lead to flexibility down the road.</p></speech>

It is a bit of a joke because at the end of the day one may or may not get this.  Then one must go out and fix it.  The HSE retains oversight to ensure that one's care needs are being met, so one goes off and negotiates with all the providers and then one must go back to the HSE and get it to sign off that what has been negotiated is acceptable to it.  Now, there is good reason for this.  One does not want the &euro;200 to be spent on ice cream.  At the same time, though, all it is doing is creating a huge amount of extra work and pressure for the family.</p></speech>

The client gets an approved list of providers.  Until recently he or she listed three providers that he or she preferred and, in turn, the local health office offered the case to the first, second and third choice until one provider accepted the case.  That situation was changed in the 2018 tender and now there is a system which some of us call a case of the fastest finger.  I mean an offer is made to all of the providers and whoever answers the email first is awarded the case.  That is not a good situation because there is no time to think about whether one has an appropriate carer or service for the entire hours, for the week, etc.  At the moment, our experience in CHO 6 and CHO 7 is that cases are being accepted by providers within one or two minutes of an email being issued.</p></speech>

That is partly due to the way services are commissioned and incentivised by the HSE.  In terms of my group, about 60% of a total membership of 70 provide care in Dublin.  The way services are designed to be commissioned means the HSE does not take on a lot of the Dublin work.  Also, there is no time for my members to cherrypick as they are given only a few minutes notification about a package.  Each case is relatively anonymous because one gets only a brief profile.  I would push back on the accusation of cherrypicking mainly because providers do not have the time.</p>  <p>  In terms of the deeper point, when these interventions happen or when a package is awarded, it is usually as a result of a failure in the primary care system.</p></speech>

We reckon that 360,000 people provide such care and they continue to do so.  Even when there is a good homecare package there usually is a family member who steps up to the plate in terms of the relationship with the care providers and the public health nurse.  Ideally, if we had a more well developed primary care system more of that work would fall to professionals.</p>  <p>  The Chairman made a point about respite care.  The evidence is clear and the figures do not lie.  There has been almost a 40% reduction in the provision overnight respite care.  I cannot fully understand what that is about.  Is it about regulation?  Is it about the HSE getting out of that work because it is difficult to do well?  </p>  <p>  The Chairman asked how needs are assessed.  We would like that information.  We know from our research that assessments are done in different ways.  We asked the HSE to tell us how long people must wait but their people in many of the regions could not tell us.  We asked for a figure on the length of gap between the assessed clinical need and provision.  Unfortunately, many units were unwilling or unable to give the information, which is beyond belief.  The HSE's service plans from 2010 to 2018 have referenced the idea of developing a single assessment tool.  It remains unclear to us why this has not been rolled out to date. </p></speech>

There is absolutely none.  There is a requirement for a person lucky enough to get a carer's allowance that he or she provides at least 35 hours of care each week.  Many carers provide 168 hours.  I am entitled to 26 days off a year but they have no entitlement.  We believe that carers should receive a minimum of 21 days of respite a year as part of the statutory homecare scheme where a full-time family carer is present.  This provision is increasingly important because, which has been mentioned, increasingly the family member is included in the homecare package of support.  Where one gets a homecare package that requires two people to use a house or whatever, it is the family carer who is the second person.  Therefore, they are being professionalised and subsumed into the system but for no reward.  A carer in this case is not entitled to a single day's respite in a year.</p></speech>

Is that what Ms Duffy is speaking about?  Does she mean negotiating with the family member on how best to give flexible homecare support?</p></speech>

First, the Scandinavian system ensures the lead responsibility lies with the State so the State takes responsibility.  The problem there is that if one rocks up to the hospital, care home or local health agency and says "I am worried about my mother", the staff there can say, "Go away.  We are looking after her".</p>  <p>  Second, in former Eastern European countries it is the responsibility of the family.  Therefore, the State says it will do nothing for a person as he or she has family and it is their job to provide care.  We are saying both of those systems would be unacceptable in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Third, we cite the Portuguese model, not because it is perfect but because it has a pretty clear constitutional kind of text.  In that instance, the primary responsibility lies with the family but the State recognises a duty to support the family in fulfilling its primary responsibility in regard to care.  We think that model strikes the appropriate medium.  </p>  <p>  In terms of some work on hospital satisfaction, roughly about 18% of people in hospital do not have a family member visiting them or keeping in touch.  We interpret that as 80% of people having family carers while 20% do not.  </p>  <p>  I echo what Mr. O'Sullivan said and appreciate the comments the Chairman made about carers.  On the subject of respite care, our sense of what is happening is that there are stepdown beds.  Many respite facilities have been taken over to deal with hospital discharges.  Good, bad or indifferent, that is a dilemma.</p>  <p>  Let me outline the biggest issue with respite.  There has been no serious discussion about respite.  Last year, there was a programme broadcast called "Prime Time - Carers in Crisis".  A week later the Minister for Health announced that ten new facilities would be opened to provide respite and I thought to myself, Mother of God, the speed of reaction is wonderful.  Later I realised he was responding to the previous year's "Prime Time" special that highlighted buildings around the country that had been bought for respite but were not being staffed and so they came through.  He announced, with some satisfaction, that there was &euro;10 million in extra spending, all of these new beds and that there would be a great increase in respite this year, although mainly for people with disabilities.  So far this year the level of respite provided is down and I do not know where it has disappeared to.  Stepdown beds and hospital discharges have absorbed or taken over a lot of capacity.</p></speech>

He is right that there are serious delays and technical issues, and the HSE is burdened with many competing demands.  This is a tool which could make one part of it work much more easily.  It is not being prioritised and we are deeply concerned.</p></speech>

Our study paints a picture of three quarters of family carers having no training.  Some 48% look after the spouse for their total waking time.  Most carers were on medication, with 57% on medication for blood pressure.  This is often the time when their own care breaks down.  One in four were frail or on the road to frailty after just one year of caring.  Going back to the point I made to Deputy O'Reilly, because of the difference in regulation of respite in the home or in a facility registered by HIQA, we were not able to recruit the staff because of pay rates or HIQA happened to require a continuity.  We had to exit that service.  We have a respite centre with 11 beds which has been lying idle for two years and we now hope to contract with a private provider to provide it.  Some 1,100 people were denied one week's respite which would have been superb for those with dementia and for carers.  We have a dichotomy with the registration and regulation of home care as opposed to residential care.  There is a very elaborate system and I am not denying that it needs to be, but when one holds a mirror to what is available in respite in the community, it shows the lack of provision to support family carers.</p></speech>

I have known nearly everybody who has come in as a witness for many years.  We use the term &quot;service providers&quot; for these organisations.  That is true but I think we should underline the service they are providing to us today, which is about their reflection, intelligence, insight, problem-solving and analysis.  We have a conundrum as a committee.  How will we pull that into different streams?  I apologise that I was not here at the start of the meeting.  I think what I have heard is a proxy for many of the ills and challenges in our health provision.  I am deliberately not saying &quot;health system&quot; because I hear over and over about all the things that clash with each other in that enterprise.</p><p>It would be useful for the committee to reflect on what it has heard this morning aside from each of the particular things that witnesses have said to us.  I can list things such as hospitals versus the rest of the health system, statutory underpinning versus schemes that are ad hoc or on an administrative basis where the rope can be pulled out from under a body, and whether it is person-centred or system-centred.  There are social aspects to consider.  Other Departments are involved, such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has useful involvement in employment.  There is the housing issue.  This committee was involved in work earlier this year when it collaborated with a couple of other committees.  We can talk about this over and over with regard to health but some of the solutions are with other Departments.  The institutional care clashes with community and home care.  I have said it before.  I see young people going into nursing homes and institutions and cannot but think that some or all of that relates to the rationing of supports on the other side.  There are issues with respite to address.  Those are my opening remarks which I wanted to make public.  There was much directed at us as a committee.</p><p>Ms Deane from Age Action talked about eligibility and entitlement going back many years.  That brings us back to the statutory underpinning versus administrative schemes.  Do people have any comment on it?  If I am not mistaken, there is a commitment to introduce legislation that opens up a fair pitch to play on.  That would have the objective of redressing the pull away from where we want people to be.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin from the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland made striking comments.  Am I right in what I am saying?  Since the recession ended at the end of 2013, the witnesses gave a scenario that &euro;11.2 million of State funding was provided with voluntary funding going from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million.  That is the opposite to the end of a recession.  Is that more or less what the witnesses are all experiencing?  If it is, we have a mammoth issue with where our health system is going.  It has been a year and a half since Sl&aacute;intecare, our ten year plan, was made.  We are still not on the road with it.  We have a microcosm here of the large ills in the system.  I think Mr. John Dunne talked about social care <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>home care.  Will he address that?  Where does care reach people beyond their home, if it does?</p><p>This is maybe a provocative question.  We all hear about the hospital crisis, the trolley crisis and the winter issue.  What is the &quot;trolley crisis&quot; for the witnesses?  Is there something that can be expressed that captures the witnesses' side of trying to provide for and support people in the community?  We all have the vision of the trolleys backed up.  Nobody sees what is going on here.  One can go around the edges of a hospital or photograph the ambulances backed up but one cannot do so here.  What is the image here that captures starkly the essence of the problem for people and families?</p></speech>

It is scary for us to provide 68% of all community dementia services.  I do not think there is another sector where the Government and State are reliant to that extent on one organisation to provide services.</p> <p>That organisation is paying its staff at 2010 rates.  It has increased its fundraising by &euro;1 million.  We have ten minibuses which need to be replaced.  We authorised one last week which had travelled 437,000 km and was 12 years old.  These minibuses are to gather people in the community and bring them into centres.  Approximately 80% of those get a maximum of one or two days' service.  We have relied on the goodness of fundraising, especially corporate fundraisers, with companies giving us money.  We have not been able to pay our staff what we should be paying.  We are competing with the HSE.  Our fleet is in difficulty.  None of the &euro;3 million that we earn will have been achieved by six months because one cannot go out after Christmas to start fundraising again.  All of our fundraising is late in the year, from Tea Day to Memory Ribbon Day.  It means money is being spent without us knowing whether it will actually come in.  We have depleted our reserves to keep going for the State.  We cannot do that any more.</p> <p> That does not address what it is like for an Alzheimer's patient to be in an emergency department in the country at the minute, given what is going on.  They are in a crowded, noisy environment with poor signposting etc.  People with Alzheimer's on waiting lists for hip operations and cataracts cannot access our day services because there is no point in having somebody with difficulties of that nature trying to attend a day service.  It has become extremely difficult to paint that picture in the public arena with the system of funding we have.  We are seriously underfunded as a sector.  We do not want to provide any more services.  At this stage, we would prefer to say that we should de-risk the situation.  We cannot provide.  We would welcome the HSE providing in the counties in which we have no service.  We have no wish to be the top provider.  We are advocating on behalf of all people with dementia.  Who provides the care is a separate issue.</p></speech>

That reminds me of the UN convention's reference to the will and preference of people.  There is a question of how people are brought into it.  Mr. McLoughlin said that fundraising was increased by &euro;1 million.  Am I correct in saying that is 50%, from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million?</p></speech>

We are also heavily reliant on volunteers in our service.  That is the reality of what we face.  We rely on 19 branches in 15 counties.  That means our cost of fundraising is much lower than for many other organisations.  We had 1,000 people collecting for us on Memory Ribbon Day last week.  They were all providing voluntary services for us.  Many of those are staff of different companies, school kids etc., who came out on a winter day and fundraised for us.  We get huge support from the public and corporate Ireland but there does not seem to be an appreciation of the seriousness of dementia in the country and that carers are under serious pressure.  Some 10% of persons with dementia are under 65 and 11 more people will be diagnosed today.  At least one of those will be under 65 and there is no service for that person.  It is an extremely difficult situation.  The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland would welcome discussions with the committee on dementia and Alzheimer's because we are not mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Our submissions are mentioned but dementia is not.  We are concerned that if we are not mentioned and that bus is leaving the station, we may have missed ten years in getting it to be a priority on the political agenda.</p></speech>

Home care is not sexy.  It is difficult to do well.  It is messy.  It is provided in private by family members and increasingly by paid care workers.  I would put it back to representatives and to the media to reflect on how they respond to those trolley crises that dominate the narrative and consider more nuanced responses that can shift attention towards home care, primary care and keeping people well at home, out of nursing homes as much as possible.</p></speech>

The crisis is all year round.  It is not as visible as the trolley crisis the hospitals have.  Ours is invisible because these people are at home, denied a service.  It is convenient for the Government that they are so invisible but not so convenient for us.  Visualising that, one of the lows of this year for me was when I had to help a family to complete an application for the fair deal scheme for their daughter who has schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, who is the same age as me.  It was seen as a significant success for her to get a nursing home place within 20 miles of home.  One can walk into a nursing home and see people who are my age there because there is no other option.</p></speech>

Ms Duffy is right that it is totally invisible, with pain and suffering behind closed doors.  I am privileged to work with people who have such empathy and caring in their daily job, with the respect and dignity they give to every call they take.  The quiet desperation spills over to become overwhelming and people cannot cope any more, and that is a stark indictment of our health services.</p></speech>

It has the potential to.  My concern, which I raised in my opening statement, is that there is a lack of a dialogue and of a roadmap.  If the statutory entitlement will do certain things in three years, how will we get to a point where we are prepared for it when it lands?  My members are not being invited in to figure out how the statutory entitlement will work.  I have a set of national standards.  How do I use that as a tool to make sure my members are prepared for the statutory entitlement?  I do not have high confidence in how it is being done.  It seems completely opaque.  I echo what others have said about how difficult it is to give a voice or evocative image to isolation when one has disenfranchised people, people with disabilities or people with chronic and acute conditions.  In the modern world, we react through Twitter with 140 characters and such.  It is difficult to give an image.  It would be a disservice to give a flippant response about how it is because the real world is complicated and we cannot give a simple snapshot, given that we provide home care to such a wide range of people, whether through families or care workers.</p></speech>

Over the years I have made numerous references to the way the care has to be distributed and the competition between community-based care, institutional care, private hospital nursing home care and public hospital nursing home care.  There seems to be a great deal of competition between all those sources.  The demand is getting bigger.  The demographics mean more caring is required.  There are competing demands.  For example, 20 years ago a house probably cost &pound;60,000 or &pound;70,000, which would have a relatively small mortgage.  Family members were able to meet mortgage repayments and provide care at the same time, very often with carer's allowance, a supplement or part carer's allowance.  That day is gone.  The demand from mortgages is much bigger and the repayments are the equivalent of one wage.  We have a number of demands and added to them are the family circumstances.  I find in my area that if a person is returned from hospital to be cared for at home very often the family will opt for a local nursing home if it is nearby.  The critical issue is whether it is nearby, both for respite and support.  </p> <p> Questions have been raised about carer's allowance.  The idea in the assessment of carer's allowance is to refuse almost everyone at the start.  An interesting factor in respect of young people, teenagers and those in their 20s is the idea that their carers are doing no more than is required to care for a normal child or teenager.  It is rubbish.  It is crazy stuff.  It meets the financial requirements but it does not deal with the requirements of the child or family concerned.  I have seen instances where it was outrageous to suggest the child required no more attention than a normal child of the same age.  It creates a serious issue for the family if that idea is relied upon.  </p> <p> There are people from other countries outside the European Union who may be here illegally and who work as carers.  We need to talk to the Department responsible for dealing with them to enable them to remain in the country and provide a service because there is a demand for it.  There is not much sense telling them they do not comply with regulations so they must leave.  It is fine from an immigration point of view but it does not solve the other issue we have.  There is a necessity to do it.  They are very good caring people from a number of countries.  </p> <p> We also need to recognise that caring in the community requires a huge input.  It is not simple.  In years gone by it was portrayed as simple, inexpensive and readily available but it is not.  It requires huge input.  I heard what the various speakers said about costs.  There is a requirement for greater budgetary investment in the area.  It has to be balanced.  I am saying it as a member of the Government party.  I cannot say we will do it straight away.  It is not possible.  If we compare it with the situation in 2007 or 2008, we see the experience from then on was not great.  Somebody mentioned austerity.  The real reason there were cuts is because there were not sufficient resources to meet the demand and the payments.  The Government could not pay.  There was nothing there.  There is a danger we might separate that in our minds and say it was austerity that caused it.  It was not.  Austerity was a result of circumstances that arose and it was not possible to pay the public or private sector or both depending on the extent to which they were affected.  We also need to look at the extent to which we have competing groups in the same business.  It would be much better to have a single authority or body seamlessly delivering the service and having responsibility rather than a multiplicity of people trying to provide the same service and competing with each other for resources and staff.  They provide the best they can in difficult circumstances.  We need to look at the area again in a different light, taking into account the increasing demands, demographics and costs involved and find out how best to provide a good quality service without putting patients at risk or creating an impossible situation for family carers and at the same time make it possible to bring people into the service.  </p> <p> I have also noticed that when families apply for care support in the home, they usually get a package or part of a package and they might have to wait some time for it.  There is no time to wait.  Time may be a very serious issue at that stage.  A week can be a very long time and sometimes it takes two or three weeks to put it into place.  The next issue is that some of the carers are not as experienced as others.  It puts pressure on their colleagues.  In some cases lifting equipment, for example, is not being used because there are not the people to operate it.  There have been instances of an older person caring for another older person.  It creates huge problems for both.  If there is any lifting involved, an older person will not last too long at it.  It cannot work.  It cannot happen.  In those circumstances there is a need for more systemic intervention in terms of respite care for a week or two weeks in order to give the carer a breather if he or she is a family member.  It would also give the caring system a bit of space to allow it to do its work.  </p> <p> What I have said comes from my experience of dealing with cases, some of which I am dealing with at present.  They are all reflected in the issues that are being raised.  They are reflective of the increasing demand.  The issue is how to meet those issues while at the same time providing people with good quality care and the services to which they are entitled.  They will all say they never looked for anything before in their lives.  That is the opening statement of people, some of whom are 80 years of age.  They have never looked for anything previously in their lives.  They rightly feel there is an opportunity for the system to which they contributed all their lives to come to their rescue and they deserve it.  </p></speech>

There are technical answers.  There are activities of daily living and instrumental activities.  There are lists of the kind of things one would do.  The pattern is drifting.  In general there is less of a focus on well-being, mental health and social needs.  It is all about getting in, getting the person up, dressed, washed and possibly fed and then getting out again.  There are complications around medication.  One of the real shocks to me arose because we had been providing in-home and respite care where there was a family carer present and then we started going into homes were they were not present.  If a family carer and the care worker pass each other when one is coming in and the other is going out, one of them can say the person being cared for did not take his or her tablets or would not do something else and the information passes seamlessly into the family that is managing it.  Where there is nobody else there, the caseworker cannot administer the medication.  There is a struggle.  It is recorded that the person did not take his or her medication.  It is not a very effective form of care.  That is what I mean.  Let us be fair to the HSE.  It is operating on a shoestring budget in this area.  It is trying to make &euro;10 million go as far as &euro;100 million.  It is being distilled to the bare minimum.  I am not saying there is an easy answer other than resources.  It is not about people wilfully setting out to do this.</p> <p>This is a function of the way the system is going.</p> <p> I will move on to Deputy Durkan's points and I will start with the question on resources.  I accept the point that it is not austerity, but I am getting a bit resistant to the resources line because my experience and observation is that when the system wants it, resources are available.  I will give two examples.  When there was a problem with the Waterford Crystal pension scheme the State came out very strongly and effectively said it had messed up because it did not translate something into law, and that is the reason the scheme crashed, but it could not afford to bail out the scheme to the tune of &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  Within three months the State had bailed out the pension schemes of a series of quangos to the tune of &euro;1 billion.  That did not get any headlines, but there is the contrast.  The State could not afford &euro;40 million to help out one group but it could help out another group no matter what the cost.  My main challenge in terms of resources is that the increase to the health system this year is &euro;2 billion but more or less half of that will go on pay and a large chunk of it is for pay restoration.  We are not ready for pay restoration.  The resources are not there.  Our sector is not doing pay restoration and we are not being funded to do it either.  The State is getting very precious about that and saying it cannot afford it, but that is where a lot of the money is going.</p></speech>

They are central providers to the system.  There are competing demands and everybody must be cognisant of that and the situation is not a simple one, but we must also be alert to the fact that we could tip over the edge again very quickly.  We saw it happen once.  I have a feeling that the boom was one of the worst things that ever happened in this country.  It made us more avaricious in terms of what we deserve, as opposed to what we can afford.  Occasionally it comes to our attention that there are people at the bottom of the system that get squeezed.  They do not have the clout or the lobbying power to change anything.  The people we are talking about now are the vulnerable, the ill, those with disabilities and the elderly.  They are not in such a great place and they say that on a regular basis because that is how they feel.</p>  <p>  We are also told on a regular basis that our spending on health is on par with the highest spenders among OECD countries.  That leaves us in an awkward position as well.  The question is what we can do.</p></speech>

It is about priorities.  It is very difficult for someone on a very low income to hear about a proposal on tax cuts when the proposal for a modest increase for those on low pay is not entertained.  It comes down to priorities.  What we hear at the committee time and time again is people, not with extravagant pay demands, who never look for tax cuts, talking about a crisis in recruitment, exactly as has been outlined for us today.  The issue is one of priorities.  We know how high the health spend is.  Often, it is very tough for those who are on the lowest pay to advocate, in particular home care workers, who are very much isolated although they are a big part of the health service.</p>  <p>  It is also a fact that home care providers who work for private agencies are competing with the need for the private agency to make a profit.  However, I do not think it is fair to say we have people coming in endlessly looking for money.  They are not looking for large amounts of money.  There is an element of having to prioritise.  I would like to see the case for increased home care prioritised because it is a really good value for money service.</p></speech>

The public sector provides for itself.  It does not provide for the rest.  I did an exercise in the context of pay restoration.  Mr. McLoughlin sounds like he is in the same position as the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland.  Let us take the case of somebody on our staff who after the cuts in 2011 was on a salary of &euro;25,000.  We abolished incremental scales.  Let us also take somebody in the HSE who was on the same salary of &euro;25,000 in 2011.  If neither of them got promoted, the person working for us would be still getting &euro;25,000.  The situation will be changed next year for the first time.  The person in the HSE, through normal incremental and pay grants, is on &euro;31,000 now.  I am not saying that is right or wrong.  I am saying that is a fact.</p></speech>

That is equivalent to &euro;600 million in additional pay per annum.  There are 135,000 people working in the HSE, including people working on a part-time basis, but when one boils it down there are 116,000 whole-time equivalents.  In December 2014 the number was 103,000.  The cost of the 13,000 additional staff is approximately &euro;600 million.</p></speech>

HCCI came in with a submission today that was not all about funding.  While we said we would welcome funding, even if funding increased dramatically what we are saying is that the system is not designed to cope with increased capacity.  There are changes that can and should be made right now, around how we commission the supply of carers and professionalising the workforce.  I hope the committee can influence those changes.  I would welcome more funding but my submission is largely not about funding.</p>  <p>  I would hesitate to support a single provider of care.  One can take my view with a pinch of salt given who I represent, but at the same time a monopoly provider of care would not take advantage of the expertise in the system and probably not deliver value for money and would put the committee in a position where one is overseeing a mammoth body with very little accountability, which I suggest would be even less than is now the case.  I do not see how that would provide the answer.</p></speech>

That is true up to a point.  On a regular basis the committee is faced with the private sector and the public sector, very often competing with each other.  Sometimes they overlap and at other times they do not overlap and there are gaps in the system.  As one can see from looking at the colour of my hair, I come from an earlier generation and I remember when there was only one provider and everything went through that system.  It may have had its restrictions and disadvantages, but there are multiples of providers for almost everything in the health services nowadays.  They all have good intentions, are well structured and they all compete in the marketplace and very often they almost bump into each other in the provision of services.  That is my observation from dealing with constituents on a daily basis.</p></speech>

There is a point which goes beyond this discussion.  When we hear that the HSE is making more money available, very often a certain amount that money does not add an extra iota of service.  It would serve every interest to say that if an extra &euro;2 billion is invested, X amount of that will increase the cost of delivering the service.</p> <p>People know what will enhance a service and Deputy Durkan made the point that we could tip over the edge again.  All that I am hearing about this morning is people with disabilities and elderly people in need of care and the organisation has gone over the edge.  That is a tricky situation and we need to be clear and forensic in our language when we talk about these things.  Staff have legitimate and valid expectations that conditions would start to improve but that is not just some staff.  People do not care or know who is providing the service, it is simply that the service is there for them.</p></speech>

Are they doing this HSE style competency or is it a QQI level 5?</p>  <p>  I refer to under 65s.  I have heard there is an issue with getting home care in the case of a degenerative neurological disorder for people under 65.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their experiences of that.  I am being told in the community that with rapidly progressing conditions, which are a surprise to many families who have never had to engage with family caring services or the HSE's services before, it can often take six to eight weeks of a family dealing with a devastating diagnosis combined with the patient having to deal with a diagnosis and having no experience in the provision of any sort of care because they have had no hassle up to this point before a home care package is approved.  When someone has one of the really progressive neurological disorders, there is no coming out of it, the end is nigh, it is complex and it is terminal.  I am hearing that this is causing undue annoyance and stress to families at a very difficult time and by the time the package is approved, the person could be 70% of the way through their condition and it leaves for a very difficult experience.  Is that common?  What sort of impact does this have on families in these cases?</p></speech>

We have been rowing back on that requirement.</p>  <p>  I refer to home care packages for under 65s.  The reason for the problem is that home care packages are effectively part of the older persons part of the HSE.  They can be awarded outside of that but it is an awkward case.  When the Deputy said it can take six to eight weeks I was thinking that was fast as opposed to slow but then she mentioned the magic word of "approval."  It is not unusual for someone to get a letter saying he or she has been approved for a home care package and that he or she will get further correspondence when it is possible to provide such a package.</p></speech>

If and when we introduce a statutory system, will that bring consistency to the provision of home care?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.502" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200018#U02200"><p>Not automatically.  The statutory framework will presumably define a set of entitlements.  There is no statutory basis for any sort of carer's support or home care.  We would have to go out on a limb with bits of the Health Act, 2004, to come up with a statutory basis.  The new legislation will be clearer around that but it always will be subject to resources.  There will be this consistent legal framework and it will then feed out.  By the time the legislation is enacted, presumably we will be RICOs and we will have forgotten about CHOs and hospital groups.  Presumably there will be about six RICOs around the country, each of which will have a chief officer whose job is to balance the budget against the demands and resources and all that will have changed is that there will be a more standardised set of requirements but the decision will still have to be made.</p>  <p>  I refer to the legacy issue.  If there are 1,000 home care workers employed, by definition there will be more home care work done than an organisation that also has 1,000 physiotherapists because they will help with the work.  Therefore, the legacy spending patterns will also help to shape this.  This is about system and policy and not about picking out an individual and saying that person is trying to cause trouble.  It is about understanding the system does not work and then how it might be changed but there will be a limit to how consistent it will be as long as there are regional bodies.</p></speech>

Conversations such as that will happen within those organisations which will hopefully limit the extremes of budgetary cutting.</p></speech>

There will not be two budget silos with two different gatekeepers, there will be a single budget silo with a single decision maker and that is going back to the decision we had before the CHOs where there were integrated care systems, and that is a progressive move.  There are all sorts of other issues and a major issue is the legacy of staffing structures which determine how the majority of the money is spent.  These numbers are like telephone numbers but we are only tinkering at the margins because most of it is fixed in pay and buildings etc.  That is a truism.</p></speech>

I understand Care Alliance Ireland has done some work on the priority given by the different CHOs per condition, which varies wildly.  For example, we have anecdotal evidence that a person entering palliative care will be prioritised by some CHOs but not by others.  For a family member living in Dublin whose relative lives in Cork, trying to rationalise the system does not make sense.  Home and Community Care Ireland gets a lot of inquiries from people about the system and how it works, as I am sure do all of the other organisations.  The impact is huge on families.  Home and Community Care Ireland is a representative organisation for providers but I still get calls from people from abroad seeking help about the system and how it operates.</p></speech>

It appears the word "palliative" strikes a chord in the HSE.  However, a person who is terminally ill and has a 12 week window does not necessarily tick the palliative box, such that families have to jump through a lot of hoops to get services.  As stated, sometimes by the time all of this has been done the patient has died.  To my mind, this affects not only the family's experience of that illness but that of the carers and doctors involved.  It is frustrating for GPs and community pharmacists to see people without services.</p></speech>

What the Deputy describes varies across the CHOs.  In many cases, the mention of "palliative" care does speed up provision but in other cases it does not, which is frustrating.  This goes to the heart of the Chairman's question as to whether Sl&aacute;intecare will bring uniformity.  Currently, some CHOs are on a paper based reporting system for home care but others operate an electronic system for home care.  CHO1 has a new finance system and CHO7 has an entirely different finance system.  We hope Sl&aacute;intecare will bring some cohesion but we are trying to deal with the system as it is now but it is difficult to get any consistency.  Therefore, when designing national guidelines and spreading information one has to constantly add the caveat that the situation may be different in a particular local area.</p></speech>

The society and the HSE would encourage people to remain involved, to develop coping skills, to obtain cognitive training, to seek peer supports and to join social clubs.  There are things people can do to live well with dementia but there comes a point when needs are more complex and services need to kick-in quickly for them and carers.</p></speech>

I say that not convinced it will work, but in principle.</p>  <p>  On the subject of palliative, I would like to give an example of a case that came to mind when it was mentioned earlier.  An elderly woman was discharged from hospital on a clear death trajectory having been told by the hospital that there was nothing more that could be done for her.  When the family responded that they could not cope, they were told to find a nursing home place for her.  When they did so, hospital staff contacted the nursing home and instructed staff there not to give the woman the bed because they said they needed it.  The woman went home and died.  As Ms Duffy said, people are afraid to complain no matter what happens to them for fear of losing whatever services they have.  However, when someone dies a complaint can be made.  Family Carers Ireland received a complaint.  We facilitate people in making complaints.  In fairness, the director of nursing and the consultant in the hospital were distressed and apologised profusely.  I have an image of this woman sitting on her suitcase in the snow in a car park waiting to be picked up to be brought home to die.  The response from the two other people who were in the room, who were responsible for bed management, was that they were just doing their job.  The family did not want to take the matter any further.  I would have been happy to but the family decided to walk away from it.  It was mentioned earlier that "palliative" is a magic word.  That is not always the case.</p></speech>

Meanwhile in another area there were more than 600 people on a waiting list but it was estimated that the majority of the assessed need was provided for.  This highlights the disparity in assessments which leads to the reference of postcode lottery.  This level of discrepancy and disparity cannot be good and fair.  There will be always a level of disparity within clinical assessment protocols and guidelines but the current level of disparity is of concern to us.</p></speech>

All of the organisations working in this area, private, community and voluntary, are providing an excellent level of service to people.  Are there services that are perceived to be offering a service but are not doing so?  In other words, have any of the organisations here had to take over the care of people because other services being paid to care for them were not providing an adequate service?

This is not a question of private sector good and voluntary and public sector bad or vice versa.  There is good and bad practice in the private sector and good and bad practice in the voluntary sector.  We have to be vigilant.  We are required to report such situations but there is never any follow up as to what happened.  I am mindful of one issue in respect of which we reported an organisation.  To my mind, it was a relatively serious issue, but these incidents can be also one-off.  There are thousands of carers going into houses every day.  I would not like to be held personally accountable for what every one of them does tomorrow at 11 a.m.  In regard to the organisation we reported, when the HSE was drawing up a list of people who would be charged with the most intensive, difficult, challenging cases, that company was on the list.  I did wonder about that.  I do not have any further insight but what I am saying is factually correct.  I am not saying the system is broken.  It is a rare situation but it does happen, definitely.</p></speech>

I have heard people speak of it being a free service but it cannot be a free service.  What is the estimated ratio in terms of cost-sharing?</p> <p>Obviously, the client will have to make a contribution and the State will make a contribution.  When it does come in, what do the witnesses believe the ratio will be?  Will it depend on the amount of service required?  Will it be a specific percentage.</p></speech>

Researching and then collectively as a society deciding on the funding model will be absolutely critical, which is why it nests under Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need to take a good hard adult look at how we fund the provision of care in this country.  Will it be from general taxation or a blend of social insurance?  Not dodging the point, but it is early days.  Our colleagues at Sage Advocacy are doing sterling work on the deep technical aspects of this and we are feeding it into the Department.  I do not think we can answer the question today.  Age Action is the largest body representing ageing people in the country and we ask that all elected members of both Houses who are here in front of us do their part to ensure the dialogue and societal conversation that must be held in this country on how we will fund this - it will not be easy - is adult, respectful and sustainable.</p></speech>

We have stated on the record for a long time that we are willing to talk about co-payment.  I mentioned earlier the insurance model because it seems to deserve serious consideration but the great chance to do this in the context of the universal social charge has been possibly lost.  With regard to the fair deal model and integrating the two funds, the problem is the fair deal model is made up of three contributions and if people are caring for someone at home it really does not make a whole lot of sense to take most of their income or savings, and if the house is being used as a care facility it seems a bit rich to take that.  It would need to be a different model.  I agree with Ms Deane that it is early days in the discussion.  To be fair, nobody is suggesting it will be for free.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to see that no night cover was sought.  People who came out of hospitals were able to attend existing day care centres.  Our experience is that carers will not abuse intensive homecare.  People do not want other people in their houses unless they absolutely need them.  It would be a game changer in terms of delaying people going into residential care, which would be a significant saving to the State if we look at the trajectory of the number of the beds that will be needed.  It will be a major change.  We have no information on what the funding model should be or could be.</p></speech>

There is often a discussion on wanting Scandinavian-type services but there is not always the wider societal sense that this takes a level of taxation.  One of the risks if people do have to pay for part of the care, and I do not have strong evidence for this, may be self-neglect.  People may decide they will not pay for it so they will not get it and it may lead to unintended consequences.  We must balance to what extent the State makes a decision on this.</p>  <p>  There are various models throughout Europe and Mr. Dunne alluded to the insurance model, which probably would be preferable.  There is a percentage of direct payment with the rest coming later.  It will require cross-party political leadership to state this will cost us collectively but it will be worth it because we want high quality care, to value family carers and, increasingly, paid care workers because this is the type of society in which we want to live.</p></speech>

As I informed the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, I intend to bring forward a number of further amendments to the Bill.  I am introducing a number of those today, including some new provisions that provide for the first time for an expressed jurisdiction for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern.  There is another provision for a coroner to direct a hospital or health institution where the deceased was treated immediately before death, or a doctor holding medical records of the deceased, to produce the records the coroner considers relevant and necessary for the conduct of an effective post mortem examination.</p> <p>  I also flag to the committee my intention, subject to Government approval, to introduce on Report Stage a number of further amendments upon which extensive work is already proceeding.  I will come back to various further amendments during our discussion today as we proceed through the sections.  I expect them to include, subject again to the advice of the Attorney General, a power for a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law regarding the exercise of the coroner's functions.  There would be a section setting out governing principles for regulations to be made by me, with the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Health, on proper and respectful storage and disposal of human organs or tissue retained for the purpose of an inquest or post mortem examination.  There will be a number of amendments providing that in the small number of cases where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is investigating possible Garda involvement in a death under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, a designated officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission may provide assistance to the coroner's inquiry or inquest.</p></speech>

Both terms are used in the World Health Organization, WHO, definition of indirect maternal death but the latter appears to be more grammatically correct.  It also appears clearer.  With this amendment the Bill will define an indirect maternal death as &quot;the death of a woman resulting from a pre-existing disease or a disease that developed during pregnancy and which was not the result of direct obstetric causes but which was aggravated by the physiological effects of pregnancy&quot;.</p><p>The definitions of &quot;maternal death&quot;, &quot;direct maternal death&quot; and &quot;indirect maternal death&quot; set out in the Bill are important new definitions in line with the internationally recognised World Health Organization international classification of diseases, ICD, definitions.  They reflect the initiative on the part of Deputy Clare Daly to ensure the proper investigation of such deaths.  The World Health Organization definitions are also those used by Irish doctors.</p></speech>

There was the possibility of one amendment to be flagged for Report Stage in yesterday's discussions.  The committee already scheduled a meeting for Committee Stage a number of weeks ago to try to conclude this Bill but that was postponed because the Minister indicated a wish to include a load of other amendments.  We assumed those would be dealt with today but now we have references beginning to creep in for amendments we have not yet heard about.  Given that the order for Second Stage of the Coroners Bill 2015 was moved by me exactly three years and one day ago, what is going on?  It is grand if they are only minor amendments.</p></speech>

To provide further information which may help to alleviate the anxiety of Deputy Clare Daly, on publication of the Bill in August, I flagged that it was my intention to introduce amendments for consideration to increase the jurisdiction of coroners to inquire into stillbirths and give them the power to direct hospitals and health institutions to produce medical records of deceased persons for a post mortem.  I am tabling the amendments today.  I also flagged at the time of publication of the Bill for discussion on Report Stage the issue of a case stated and the power of a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law, with governing principles for making regulations for the treatment and disposal of human organs and tissue that might be retained for an inquest, something to which I referred in my opening comments.  I intend to bring forward the amendment on Report Stage.  I have also mentioned the issue of an amendment in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p></speech>

The Bill defines a stillborn child in section 2 as &quot;a child of not less than 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, or of birth weight of not less than 500 grammes, who is delivered without signs of life&quot;.  This is the accepted medical definition in Ireland.  It is also the definition used in the Civil Registration Act 2004, section 30 of which requires a stillbirth to be reported in the register of deaths as soon as is practicable.  This is a mandatory reporting requirement applied to the doctor, the midwife and the head of the hospital concerned.  The Civil Registration Act 2004 also provides in section 28 for the optional reporting of the stillbirth by the family and the issue of a special stillbirth certificate, if they so request.  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018 now also requires mandatory reporting of stillbirths to a coroner.  Point 18 in the new schedule of reportable deaths specifies that any stillbirth must be reported to the coroner.  Section 6 of the Bill inserts a new section 16B(4) into the principal Act and provides for mandatory reporting of a stillbirth by the doctor, nurse or midwife who is responsible for the care of the mother.  The Coroner Service website lists certain stillbirths as reportable to the coroner as a matter of good practice and stillbirths are regularly reported to coroners by the doctors involved.  Coroners indicate that the large majority of stillbirths reported to them are natural and expected spontaneous stillbirths and are certified as such to the coroner's satisfaction by the mother's doctor.</p><p>In a very small number of cases there are circumstances surrounding the stillbirth such as concerns about possible medical errors, for example, which give rise to concern.  Coroners are very conscious of the sensitivity of such cases in practice and further inquiry is rare.  It is typically where the bereaved parents request it.  However, the mandatory reporting requirement introduced in the Bill will address the public concerns I have mentioned and support independent oversight and transparent investigation in the small number of cases where concerns arise.</p><p>The amendment I have brought forward complements the reporting requirements in the Bill by providing a discretionary power for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth and, if the cause of death remains unclear, to direct a post mortem examination and, as appropriate, the holding of an inquest.  There are two special features.  While reporting a stillbirth to the coroner is mandatory, the coroner's inquiry and any post mortem and inquest into a stillbirth will be at the discretion of the coroner, subject to the criteria set out in the new section 2A, sections 17, 33A and 40 of the Bill which provide, respectively, for a mandatory inquest in certain cases, a mandatory post mortem in certain cases and mandatory juries in some cases, which are expressly disapplied to stillbirths.  In exercising his or her discretion the coroner must consult a family member of the stillborn child if it is practical to do so.  He or she must have regard to their views in deciding whether to hold an inquest.  The provisions recognise the particular sensitivity of these cases and the very diverse circumstances that can arise.</p><p>The amendment is also a response to the advice from the Office of the Attorney General that a coroner's powers to inquire into a stillbirth should be clarified.  This arises because the Coroners Act 1962 refers to a coroner inquiry into the death of a person.  This phrase is interpreted in Ireland and similar coronial legislation in England and Wales as referring to a person who was born alive, took independent breath and subsequently died but excluding a stillborn child who never drew what can be described as independent breath.  In practice, however, media reports indicate a small number of cases in recent years in which coroners have held a full inquest into a stillbirth, typically at the request of bereaved parents.</p><p>The question of extending the coroner's jurisdiction to stillbirths is also being examined across the water in England and Wales, as well as in Australia, but remains in early stages in both jurisdictions.  The proposal was welcomed in the UK by the Royal College of Pathologists and by UK organisations that advocate for patient safety and transparency in the context of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.<br/><br/>Conversely, coroners in Northern Ireland can inquire into a stillbirth since a judgment of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in 2013 held that the coroners have jurisdiction under a Northern Ireland statute of 1959 to hold an inquest into the death <i>in utero</i>of a child who was capable of being born alive.  The fact that this is a new question for other common law jurisdictions makes it prudent for us to adopt a discretionary approach, at least initially.<br/><br/>The proposed subsection (3) sets out circumstances which may be taken into account by the coroner inquiring into a stillbirth where the cause of death remains unknown.  Any of these circumstances, if applicable to the death of the mother, would give rise to a mandatory post mortem and inquest under sections 17 and 33A of the principal Act inserted by the Bill.  As sections 17 and 33A are disapplied to stillbirths, these relevant circumstances are set out in section 2A(3) simply to clarify that a coroner can still take them into account when exercising his or her discretionary powers.</p></speech>

As the Minister said, while the section is not providing for mandatory inquests into baby deaths, it does provide that they will be reportable and that other provisions of the Act will apply, such as the coroner being empowered to compel the handover of records and so on.  I certainly hope that although the power is discretionary, its inclusion in this Bill will bring us to a safer position in our hospitals in circumstances like those suffered by the Reilly family, for example.  The investigation into the death of their baby, Asha, took place a full 11 years after she died, thanks to the most appalling actions on the part of Portiuncula Hospital.  I hope these measures will prevent that happening again.</p> <p>  It is important to put the importance of this legislation on the record.  We constantly hear about the excellent quality of our maternity services but between 2007 and 2017, there were 31 inquests into baby deaths in the Republic of Ireland.  In June 2016, the investigation of baby deaths in Portiuncula Hospital was only one of many.  Seven out of the 19 maternity units at that time were either under independent investigation or involved in inquests.  It is a very big issue and we need to learn the lessons.</p> <p>  The added trauma parents have to endure following the death of a baby, as we saw in hospitals like Portlaoise and Portiuncula, due to the stonewalling by hospitals is abhorrent.  We know from the sample of 30 baby deaths due to negligence in Irish hospitals between 2008 and 2016 that in every single case where there is a record of an apology or a settlement, it was received three to nine years after the baby had died.  In many instances there was a settlement with no admission of liability and no apology.  The parents are on the record as describing the added trauma that caused to them.</p> <p>  I will not make those points again but it is a thread on this legislation that people deserve answers.  It improves our health service and if one wants to be cynical about it, it potentially saves the State tens of millions of euro every year in legal fees.  We have to move to a situation where we give people the information, tell them what they need to know and improve our services.  The amendment is very important and I welcome it.</p></speech>

Section 6 provides for a more strengthened regime for the reporting of certain deaths to the coroner.  It inserts new sections 16A and 16B in the principal Act.  Section 16A sets out an expanded and clarified list of the types of death which must be reported to the coroner, while section 16B sets out an expanded and clarified list of responsible persons who are required to report such a death to the coroner.  Accordingly, amendment No. 4, which proposes to delete &quot;prior to&quot; and substitute &ldquo;before&rdquo; on page 11, line 8, is a technical drafting amendment.  This was suggested by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure consistency.  Section 16B(3)(h), as amended, will provide that a person who had care of the deceased person immediately before his or her death is required to report the death to the coroner if it is a reportable death for the purposes of section 16A.</p><p>While amendment No. 5 may be technical, it is important.  The amendment provides for an additional category of persons who are responsible under the new section 16B(3) for reporting a death to the coroner.  It refers to those who were responsible for a person while he or she was in State custody or detention immediately before his or her death.  It would apply, for example, to the governor of a prison. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are purely technical, providing for the re-lettering of the remaining paragraphs in new section 16B(3) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill.  The re-lettering is needed following the insertion of the new paragraph 16B(3)(i), as discussed under amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

This relates to mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  The measure will have a triple effect when it is implemented.  It will give families the fullest picture about the train of events that led to the death of a loved one.  It will give clinicians and the HSE a crucial insight into where the system is failing women.  Finally, it will give us, as policymakers and those holding the purse strings, the information to make our services safer.</p><p>This is critical, and the reason I was a little stressed in asking about the amendments on Report Stage was that I was mindful that several of the people in the Gallery today, including midwives and husbands who have lost their wives, were here three years ago looking for this legislation.  Three years on, we know that a number of other women have lost their lives in our maternity services.  This is beyond urgent.  I say as much in recognition that this is where the tetchiness came from.  I have no wish to see Report Stage delayed.  Having said that, I want to be absolutely clear that we are in a completely different place now to where we were three years ago.  We are on the verge of delivering this legislation - there is no question or doubt about that.</p><p>This is the amendment we are really pushing.  I want to explain why because the reason gets to the heart of much of what we are talking about.  The World Health Organization estimates that between 88% and 98% of all maternal deaths are preventable.  That is shocking.  It means they should not or did not need to happen.  Obviously, every one of these cases is a tragedy.</p><p>We need as much information as possible delivered through inquests into maternal deaths to make our services safer.  Let us consider the case of the death of Tania McCabe in March 2007.  The inquest found that Tania and her son Zach had died as a result of septicaemia and returned a verdict of medical misadventure.  As a result, the HSE created guidelines on the management of septicaemia, something that should have been implemented in all maternity units.  Of course, we found out some years later at the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar that only five of the 19 maternity hospitals or units had implemented those guidelines.  In other words, without the inquest into the original death or the latter case we would not have had the guidelines or found out about their non-implementation.  The inquests were critical in developing the services.</p><p>I will set out some detail on this specific amendment to the Bill.  What we are trying to do is make it absolutely and crystal clear that a decision by the coroner to not hold an inquest &ndash; we are talking about mandatory inquests into maternal deaths &ndash; will only be taken after a family member has asked for that decision and provided the coroner is satisfied, on the basis of the post mortem and other information available, that the death of the woman was natural.</p><p>This question arose three years ago on Second Stage.  This was the major issue.  The relevant Minister at the time, Deputy Harris, said that we did not want the unintended consequence of a bereaved family having to go through an inquest where the causes were obvious and the family did not need an inquest.  The reasoning was that there may have been a pre-existing cancer or something like that and there may have been no dispute about it.  The idea was that no one would want to re-traumatise people in cases of a tragic but natural death, as it were, or force the family to go through an inquest.</p><p>We have been trying to strike a balance between the needs of the family and the wider public interest.  We have to be absolutely sure that we avoid a situation under this section whereby deaths that are avoidable do not get the inquest they should.  We believe the way the Government has framed the legislation at the moment gives a little too much latitude to the coroner.  It is a little too broad for us to be entirely comfortable with it at this stage.  We would prefer a situation whereby it would only be possible for a coroner to decline to hold an inquest if specifically asked not to in writing by a family member as well as being satisfied, on the basis of the information available, including the post mortem, that the death was natural.  The provision is not strong enough at the moment.</p><p>The issue for us is not that we believe the coroners will be declining inquests left, right and centre.  We do not believe that to be the case &ndash; I am keen to put that on the record.  I fully accept that these instances will only arise in exceptional cases.  However, it is still important because the concern boils down to the fact that whether a maternal death is natural or otherwise is not always obvious.  We need to be clear on that point.</p><p>Maternal healthcare is getting more complex.  Our knowledge of what amounts to maternal death and natural death is changing.  There has been a fall in direct maternal deaths, which is to be welcomed.  It is probably as a result of improvements in our health service.  However, the number of indirect maternal deaths has increased due to issues like obesity and diabetes, which are now major problems in Irish society and in many other European countries as well.  Clinicians and coroners are faced with what one researcher called increasingly intricate associations between underlying medical and pregnancy-related pathology.  Now more than ever it is likely that a death that looks natural and as if it has nothing to do with a pregnancy might actually be a maternal death.  That is the issue we are trying to get to the heart of with this amendment.  It is about changing and understanding the links between these complex medical factors.  The coroner might not actually be up to speed about the nature of these changes.  A coroner might think, entirely innocently, that a death is natural, for example, because of a heart attack.  The coroner may believe it is clear that the woman died of a heart attack and so the death was natural and could have happened to anyone.</p><p>The reality is that an aneurysm that was made more likely by pregnancy could have been avoided and the right medical pregnancy treatment might have altered the situation.  This is what we are trying to get at.</p><p> The window of discretion available to a coroner not to hold an inquest should be closed little further.  This should only be an option if a family specifically requests it.  We should put on the record, because in some ways this is where it started, that what we want to avoid is a worst-case scenario whereby it is less a case of intricate associations and is about more obvious ones.  I will use the example of the death of Bimbo Onanuga who died in March 2010.  On the basis of a perfectly written and perfectly correct post mortem report submitted to the coroner's office, the coroner first ruled there was no need for an inquest into her death as he deemed it was one of natural causes.  Subsequent queries by international experts centred on what lay behind the rupturing of her uterus and what was the train of events that led to that moment.  When the coroner was subsequently presented with the queries and granted an inquest he asked for 19 depositions and witnesses from the hospital concerned and, ultimately, there was a verdict of medical misadventure.  The point here is that initially the coroner was satisfied it was natural causes on the basis of the post mortem but this subsequently turned out not to be the case.  This is what we are trying to do here.</p><p> I recognise that once the Bill becomes law there will be a very strong positive obligation on a coroner to hold an inquest, which was not the case previously.  I realise fully that for a coroner to take a step to decline an inquest when the Bill is law would be much more serious than before and there will not be a huge amount of wriggle room but the concern remains that if it is a coroner who starts the process of exercising discretion regarding to whether to hold an inquest the whole point of a discretionary element to make things better for bereaved families will be lost and an inquest that perhaps should take place will not.  This is the impetus behind the amendment.  We feel strongly about it.  We do not think it is huge.  All it does is tie the hands of coroners a little tighter so that matters are cut and dried and the families are respected but the health service gets the information it needs.</p></speech>

I would be very keen, if we complete Committee Stage today, that we would be ready for Report Stage early next term.  Not by way of any reason or excuse for any perceived delay, I acknowledge that many of the people working on the amendments to the legislation and engaging with Deputy Clare Daly and others on the committee are also very much involved in the termination of pregnancy legislation.  It may well be reasonable to assume that Bill will be enacted by the end of this year.  I assure the committee there will be no delay in proceeding to Report Stage.  The intention is that we will be in a position to seek a date with the committee by the end of the first month of next year.  I know the urgency on the part of the committee.  It is one that is shared by me in the context of issues that have been raised.</p> <p>  On the matter of the amendment, which is important, I want to stress that under the provision I have proposed there are three tests in which the coroner needs to engage.  These are consultation with a family member of the deceased woman having due regard to the matters listed in subsection (4), including, of course, the views of the family members of the deceased woman, which is the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly, as to whether the death was natural; the result of any post mortem examination; and that the coroner needs to be satisfied that the death was natural and that an inquest is, therefore, in the circumstances not necessary.  If all of these tests are satisfied the coroner has the decision-making capacity on whether to hold an inquest.  It is after due and careful consideration.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly really got to the nub of the argument when she mentioned tying the hands of coroners.  It is important that we recognise the independent and official capacity of coroners.  My concern with regard to the amendment is that we could well tie the hands of a coroner who, irrespective of any considerations, would have to inquest every late maternal death unless a family member of the deceased requested otherwise in writing.  I see this as being, in many respects, unduly restrictive of the independent role coroners have in law.  I am also of the view that the amendment would create a further issue in that, effectively, the action or inaction of a single family member could exercise a greater level of authority than might in the circumstances be necessary, where an individual family member may be in a position to decide unilaterally whether an exception, which is provided for reasons of public policy, would apply to a maternal death.</p> <p>  While I have some sympathy for the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly in her amendment, my view is that a coroner would be inclined to hold an inquest in any event if a death is clearly unnatural and even if it in a case where it may be unnatural.  We have to look at the long-standing approaches that have been taken by coroners under the existing legislation, section 17 of which requires that it shall be the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest into a death if the coroner is of the opinion the death may have occurred in an unnatural or violent manner.  I stress that in arriving at a decision a coroner is required to have regard to all of the evidence, with specific reference to the proposed section 7(3) on the results of the post mortem, the views of a family member and whether sufficient information was made available at the time.  In practice coroners attach considerable importance to the views of the family, and rightly so.</p> <p>  I also note that Deputy Clare Daly's amendment would remove the statutory obligation under section 7(3) that would require a coroner to engage in active consultation with a family member.  It is important to acknowledge there may be circumstances where family members might disagree with each other.  Often, an individual family member might take a different view from other members of the family.</p><p>When such circumstances arise, it is important to acknowledge that, as a matter of general public policy, a coroner acts as an independent public official and never in any capacity as a private individual or in circumstances where there might any connection, perceived or otherwise, to the deceased.  It is the coroner who makes the final decision on whether a death that may appear natural should be, in the public interest, the subject of an inquest.  That is a fundamental principle of the system and I would be concerned if we moved towards weakening or changing that in a way that might be perceived as being compromised.  There is no precedent for making an exception to this principle.</p><p> I acknowledge, with sympathy, the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly but I also wish to stress the independent role and function of coroners and the long-standing practice of coroners in any event, as well as the mandatory obligation there will be in respect of consultation.</p></speech>

The Government's wording creates the possibility that a coroner could go against the family's wishes and decide not to hold an inquest, but that would not be possible with our wording.  Equally, the Government's wording creates a situation where it is possible for the coroner to start the ball rolling in terms of having a discussion about not having an inquest, but the goal here, as the Minister said on Second Stage, is to avoid a situation where a bereaved family might find itself having to participate in an inquest which it might not wish for in certain circumstances, and that it is not to give coroners a route out of holding maternal death inquests.  However, that is an unintended consequence of how the Government has drafted the Bill.  With our wording, only the family can precipitate any conversation about not having an inquest.</p> <p>  A final consequence of the Government's wording is that it leaves too wide a gap through which deaths that appear to be natural but are not could slip, meaning inquests that should be held are not held.  If the goal is to protect bereaved families from having to go through a process which, on the basis of the all the facts of the case, is not necessary, our wording achieves that while the Government's does not.  We are trying to put safeguards in place for women.  Let us ensure we do that and leave no space for it not to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018121200002#H00300"><p>That sums it up very well.  The point is that the legislation ties their hands.  We are instructing coroners to hold a mandatory inquest in cases of maternal death.  The only exception that has emerged is in cases where it would not be necessary, where the reason was obvious and clear and we do not wish to traumatise the family again.  That was the only exception we all wanted.  As Deputy Wallace stated, our amendment allows us to do that, but the Minister's does not.  His amendment permits a scenario, albeit that it might not happen very often, with the possibility of a coroner deciding not to hold an inquest in a case where one should be held.  Maternal deaths are different.  We are talking about otherwise healthy people interfacing with the medical system or maternal care and ending up dead.  It is a major issue.  The examination of the underlying events that led up to that is immensely important.  I again make the point that what might appear natural to a coroner in the post mortem or in the report from the hospital might not be, due to underlying issues, and we are losing valuable information there if our amendment is not accepted.</p> <p>  I accept the point about consultation.  We are not opposed to tidying that up on Report Stage.  Obviously, the family's decision not to have one should be following consultation with the coroner.  That is accepted.  At the same time, however, it should be the family's decision, not the coroner's.  That is the purpose of the Bill and what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

It is too open-ended for what Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace are trying to achieve with their amendment.  The Minister's amendment which proposes to insert "if any" after "views" removes the focus on the engagement with family members.  He is inserting an ability for the coroner perhaps to opt out of the level of consultation the Minister aspires to in his words.  Why is he inserting "if any" after "views" in section 7(4)(d)?  Would it not be better to leave the existing wording?</p></speech>

I agree with it.  I had intended to say that but I forgot.  If our amendment is passed this amendment would be redundant but if our amendment is not passed I will definitely oppose the Minister's amendment, precisely because of the point Deputy Jack Chambers made.  The spirit of this section was supposed to be a coroner exercising discretion to spare the feelings of a bereaved family.  This stands all that on its head.  The coroner can do it even without the wish of the family.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018121200002#H00600"><p>I wish to add a further comment before the Minister responds.  I appreciate the difference in the two positions.  The amendment proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace states, "At the request in writing of a family member of the woman concerned, a coroner may decide not to hold an inquest".  There still is a degree of determination on the part of the coroner who "may decide not to hold an inquest" or who could proceed to hold the inquest.  I have followed the issue of maternal deaths and the need for mandatory inquests and this moves it positively towards the mandatory position.  The wording of the Bill leaves a degree of flexibility and independent action on the part of the coroner.  Like Deputy Clare Daly, we would all be of the view that this, please God, will be very rarely employed, and it would be preferable that it would not have to be employed at all.  Where it does present there is consultation with a family member, but when one looks at the definitions in that regard there might not be a representative view that is a unanimous view of all concerned.  According to what is stated on page 6 of the Bill, the coroner could speak to "a parent, grandparent, child, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle or aunt, whether of the whole blood, of the half blood or by affinity, of the person".  That is very wide; it is not specific.  One could have a consultation and in that situation many others might feel that their views were not properly reflected.  In the other situation, at the request in writing of a family member not to hold an inquest the coroner may decide and could proceed to hold an inquest.  On balance, given the history of this and the genesis of the thinking behind it, amendment No. 8 is the more appropriate reflection of public thinking on this issue at this time.</p><p>I think amendment No. 8 is a more appropriate reflection of public thinking on this issue.  I just offer that further observation and invite the Minister to respond to our collective views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018121200002#J00200"><p>Without repeating the points raised earlier, under section 17(4) there will still be a provision for the coroner to take account of any written views that may be submitted by the family.  While that section does not provide for an obligation on the part of the coroner to consult with family, this is provided for in section 17(3), which Deputy Clare Daly proposes to replace.  That could be problematic.  I would ask the Deputy to reflect between now and Report Stage on how we might best meet the concern as adverted to by the Chair.  I do not think there is much between us in terms of what we wish to see enshrined in our legislation but I do not want to be accepting amendments that will have unintended consequences.  There are a number of drafting issues to which I made reference earlier.</p> <p>  Reference has been made by Deputies to a number of deaths, some of which took place many years ago.  I want to acknowledge that coroners are very well aware of issues and of the significance of maternal deaths.  They are well minded to hold inquests in such cases.  Coroners experience regular briefings on the latest research and development.  They have a technical understanding of issues to hand that may be developing in accordance with updated and modern research.  We can expect that to continue to intensify further as this legislation is passed.  I ask Deputy Clare Daly not to press the amendment but to see how we can reflect over the course of the Christmas vacation on reaching a meeting of minds.  I must acknowledge the independent legal role of coroners in our public service.  Coroners are not directly connected with any matters of substance that may appear to be the subject matter of decision.</p></speech>

That is my understanding of the Bill.  I am aware of maternal deaths in my own locality where the husband, as it was in those cases, had to fight tooth and nail to have an inquest held.  I am aware of two cases where it took some time and a lot of persuasion to ensure that the inquest was held.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment is reasonable in the sense that people will not have to go through that trauma to make sure that an inquest is held.  As it stands, the coroner has the option based on the autopsy to decide whether or not to have an inquest.  I agree with the other members that it is a bit loose and needs to be tightened up.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about the independent legal role of the coroner and that is absolutely and totally accepted.  While acknowledging that, however, we have of course already got legislation placing a mandatory requirement on them to carry out inquests in a number of cases.  We are just adding maternal deaths to that category for all of the reasons Deputy Scanlon highlighted.  The only objection was that we do not want inadvertently to damage or harm bereaved families.  That is the purpose of this opt-out clause.  The very reason this legislation is tabled and the reason there is a bit more awareness of it among coroners is that it was precisely the families who led the battle to get this information.  It would be incredibly unusual for a family not to want to get the answers.  These are instances in which the partner or family may have been present and may have a difference with the hospital.  The hospital could be saying everything is grand and there is nothing to see here.  However, the partner or family members who were there with the woman may have seen a sequence of events for which they want answers.  Families want answers and we should not be afraid of that.  Our amendment provides a better balance; this is about mandatory inquests.  We can look at tweaking the consultation part on Report Stage but I will be pressing it now.  If the Minister wants to reflect on it over Christmas, by all means, he may do so, but I am happier to go with our wording now.  If the Minister wants to come back with something different in respect of the consultation issue on Report Stage, that is fine.  It is critical that we move on this now.</p></speech>

Where an inquest has been denied and it is very definitely the view of the bereaved that an inquest is important and necessary, the process for appeal, as I understand it, currently takes place through the Attorney General.  Can the Minister clarify whether that is the case?  I have a sense that this merits serious reconsideration.  Let there be no mistake; the Attorney General is a politically vulnerable individual who sits at the Cabinet table and is open to the vagaries of the political system.  That office or officeholder does not strike me as being independent in every respect.  Has any consideration been given to this matter in the drafting of the Bill?  If not, I reserve the right, as the Minister has done, to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage if colleagues feel it is appropriate to do so.  I would appreciate whatever light the Minister can shine on that matter.</p></speech>

If she decides to press the amendment with the support of the members, my concern is that, regardless of whether it is intended, it will have one serious consequence.  That is that it would remove the statutory obligation under section 17(3) for the coroner to consult with a family member of the deceased woman.  I would be concerned if we are now to insert amendments without the type of reflection that I believe is both appropriate and necessary.</p><p>Under the current provision, there is a clear obligation on the coroner to consult, have regard to and be satisfied before making a decision.  These thresholds are in-built in the legislation and can adequately deal with the circumstances as outlined.  I am prepared to look further to see whether we can reach a meeting of minds on this matter, but I am concerned by a number of weaknesses in the amendment.  If the committee was minded to accept it in its entirety, I would have to caution against that.</p><p> Regarding the Chairman's question, there is not an appeal.  It is an application to the Attorney General to direct that an inquest take place.  Notwithstanding this legislation, there is something of a major re-organisation of the coroner system.  Members will be familiar with the Bill of some years ago.  Enshrined in that proposed Bill was a plan for a chief coroner to examine the matter of appeals.  This is an issue on which work continues.  It would involve significant organisational restructuring, but it is an issue that is receiving consideration.</p><p> The Chairman will be aware that there is a provision whereby a decision of a coroner can be subjected to a judicial review.  That is in addition to the application that can be made to the Attorney General.</p></speech>

It is an appeal - that is how we lay people would view it in any event, and the Minister used that language in his concluding sentences.  The Attorney General can direct a coroner or, actually, override a coroner's previous decision not to proceed.  In preparing for today's meeting and informing myself of the methodology, I was alarmed to see that this was the recourse that people had.  I do not believe that anyone who works in this institution would be in any doubt that the Attorney General is hardly an independent arbiter in such a situation.</p></speech>

The element that we removed, and which can easily be put back in, referred only to instances where the family would be consulted before any decision on not proceeding was taken.  However, that removal has to be seen in the context of what we are including, that being, a requirement that the inquest can only not go ahead if the family initiate that decision and write to the coroner.  There is no question of the family's wishes being diluted by our proposition in its entirety.  We are reflecting fully the family's wishes.  However, I accept that, prior to the family making that decision, it would be better if the family had a chat with the coroner and aired those views in an holistic way.  That is not a big deal and can be added to the Bill later by the Minister.  It is not that we are taking out a family's right to consultation or involvement.  Rather, the purpose of the amendment in its entirety is to put the family's wishes centre stage.</p> <p>  All of this comes back to our point that the coroner already has discretion under this legislation.  We are making it mandatory.  This is a tiny exception that we do not want to be blown apart, putting us back to where we were in the beginning.  I just wanted to clarify the point.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that a coroner must, under the Bill, have regard to all of the facts listed in the proposed section 17(4), must be satisfied that the death was a natural one and must be satisfied that an inquest is unnecessary.  Even if all of those tests are satisfied, though, it appears that a coroner cannot decide not to hold an inquest unless a family member asks him or her in writing.  For example, if the deceased woman has no identified family members or if there are no family members who contacted the coroner involved in writing, it seems in these circumstances that the coroner must hold an inquest even if there is clear evidence that the death was natural.  I am concerned that Deputy Clare Daly's amendment - I accept that she may not have intended this - appears to tie the hands of the coroner who, irrespective of any other consideration, would be obliged to have an inquest unless a family member requested otherwise.  Under the amendment, that request must be in writing.  I would ask that this issue be reflected on.  I would offer assistance in reaching a position that could gain favourable consideration across the board.</p></speech>

I want to put this to a vote.  The purpose is mandatory inquests.  If the case is that straightforward, the inquest will not be too taxing, so I would not worry that much about it.</p></speech>

Certainly, it is my view that the most straightforward approach, legally, would be to provide that changes made by the Bill apply only to deaths occurring after the commencement of the legislation.  However, there is a preference for a broader approach.</p><p>My amendment limits the application, only, of the changes made by section 7 of the Bill to section 17 of the principal Act dealing with mandatory inquests.  It allows application, even of those provisions, to deaths occurring before the commencement of the Bill if, on commencement date, the coroner has not yet completed his or her inquiries into the death and has not yet decided whether to hold an inquest.  Having consulted with the Office of the Attorney General, and having consulted with coroners, it appears that legal complications and legal uncertainty would be likely to arise if the Bill were applied to pre-commencement deaths, in respect of which the coroners had completed their inquiries and perhaps even held an inquest.</p><p>Having regard to the large numbers of natural deaths occurring in different types of State custody, such as in detention, it appears from consultation with coroners that requests to reopen such cases with a mandatory inquest now could give rise to a very significant consequence in the coroner system.</p></speech>

The amendment provides that the duty to hold an inquest into maternal death and a death in State custody does not have retrospective effect.  This prevents the State from having to investigate the deaths of everyone who died in prison of old age, for example, but I would like to hear more about the position on maternal deaths.  It is worth having a conversation on whether the provision could work in tandem with some other route for people who have been denied an inquest up to now, or who will have been prior to the enactment of this legislation.  We are aware of a death that occurred a number of years ago in respect of which the husband of the woman had never been granted or had never sought an inquest.  That process is now under way, however.  Is there some route for such people?  We envisage something other than a formal appeals process or something else in order that families who are currently unhappy about a coroner's decision not to hold an inquest would have a route under this legislation to have their cases re-examined without giving rise to the Minister's problem of retrospective application in all cases.  Could something be built in on Report Stage in this regard?  It might be worth considering.  I am not opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

The new provisions provide that where a coroner has directed a post-mortem examination into a death, he or she may also direct the head of the hospital where the deceased person was treated immediately before the death, or a doctor who has medical records of the deceased, to provide the pathologist conducting the post-mortem examination with such records as the coroner considers necessary to enable a proper examination to be made.</p><p>The amendment is considered necessary to enable the coroner to carry out his or her statutory functions effectively and to ensure the fullest possible transparency in regard to the investigation of unnatural deaths or where the cause of death may be unclear.  It is expected that such records would be provided on a voluntary basis on request by hospitals or other health institutions.  However, difficulties have arisen in the past in certain cases where the coroner had considerable difficulties in obtaining appropriate records over a sustained period.  It is particularly critical that relevant medical records of the deceased be provided in a prompt and timely manner.  The window for conducting the most effective post-mortem examination is short, optimally often within 24 hours of the death.  This provision is intended to make it clear that the coroner has the power to compel the production in case of difficulty.</p><p>Some of the finer points of this amendment are still being teased out with the Parliamentary Counsel.  I intend to propose further amendments of the provision in question on Report Stage, particularly regarding appropriate enforcement provisions.  We are considering in this regard what enforcement provisions would be most effective, having regard to the urgency that will obtain in the circumstances in question.  I propose the acceptance of this amendment but with a commitment to consider adequate provisions in respect of enforcement.  Possibilities might include, in addition to an offence, a power for the coroner to apply <i>ex parte</i>to the High Court should records not be forthcoming in a prompt and timely manner.  I am happy to hear the views of members of the committee but I accept that while the amendment is important, we need to examine the matter of enforcement.</p></speech>

This issue definitely was flagged and we fully support the Minister in his efforts on this.  I echo the point made by the Minister that our support on it is dependent on some sanctions being included on Report Stage.  There are no sanctions at all on medical institutions or hospitals that refuse to hand over records.  On the understanding that these sanctions will be included, I would be happy to accept the amendment.  While this was flagged, a number of the other issues raised by the Minister were not flagged at all in the conversations we had in preparation for this Bill.  I am pretty sure some of the issues were not even flagged on Second Stage.  Some issues were flagged on Second Stage, dropped in the pre-discussions about Committee Stage and are now being re-entered.  Perhaps the committee could deal with this after today's session.  I just wanted to put it on the record.  This issue, however, was flagged and we fully support it.</p></speech>

There is ample evidence of where this has not been done.</p></speech>

It would propose enhanced provisions, for example, on the conduct of post mortem examinations by registered medical practitioners and on the powers to remove and retain human tissue and other material during a post mortem examination.  The provision may include a power for the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Health, to set out by regulation a code of practice for post mortem examinations.  We do not have such a statutory code currently.  I am also examine a provision for a new power allowing the coroner to request the Minister to order the exhumation of a body in the rare circumstances where the body has been buried but the coroner may be satisfied that further post mortem examination is required, and that such an exhumation is, in the circumstances, justified.  There will be a provision for a defence post mortem.  These are rare situations but may arise where a person is accused or is likely to be charged with criminal involvement in the death of a person very soon after the death.  In such a situation the High Court has confirmed that the accused is entitled to request an independent post mortem examination of the body of the deceased in addition to the examination already carried out by the State pathologist's office.  This independent defence post mortem differs necessarily in some important respects from a coroner's post mortem.  For example, it is facilitated but not directed by the coroner.  It is important that a statutory provision for the defence post mortem would provide more clarity for everybody concerned.  I acknowledge that it is a complex area but it would enable provision, for example, for the appropriate balancing of the rights of the accused person and the family of the deceased.  Defence post mortems can be distressing for the family of the deceased and any delay in this regard should be kept to an absolute minimum.</p></speech>

Subject to the advice of the Attorney General the intention would be to provide for a consultative case-stated-type process.  It would allow for a coroner to apply to the High Court for directions on a point of law relating to the performance of his or her functions.  Under the Act, it is proposed that the High Court would determine such an application by giving directions, making such orders as it may consider appropriate.</p> <p>  I want to reflect that, in common with other quasi-judicial bodies, coroners are being called upon to conduct inquests in a more adversarial and perhaps challenging environment than was heretofore the case.  While coroners are not deciding the issue of adversarial litigation, they are nevertheless required to conduct an inquest in accordance with administrative law and they need to apply principles of procedural fairness.  They need to comply with requirements of the European Convention of Human Rights Act.  They increasingly deal with complex and sometimes challenging points of procedural law, which are raised by parties to the inquest from time to time.  I merely cite an example of applications for discovery of documents to be provided to the coroner.  All of these are positive for ensuring the system is adequately robust.  I intend introducing a small number of amendments to the section.</p></speech>
