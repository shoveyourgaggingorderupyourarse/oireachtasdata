    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#B00300"><p>We are very grateful for the opportunity to discuss our research findings with the committee.  As part of our work we support several Departments with our analysis and the committee's meetings with them have highlighted that.  The committee's work is both very timely and important.  One of the things we will show in our analysis is that the lack of political leadership is one of the reasons we are in the current position.  I do not mean just Government leadership.  If the committee can achieve cross-Oireachtas consensus on urgent climate action, that would be a key requirement for Ireland to move forward from a laggard position to a leadership position.</p> <p>  I would like to reiterate an invitation to visit the centre given by Mark Ferguson from Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, when he attended the committee.  I am delighted to invite members to visit us at the MaREI Centre, if timing allows, to see some of the work that we do and some of the opportunities associated with the energy transition.</p> <p>  I will turn to my presentation, which highlights some of the research findings on climate action.  The key policy insights are the headline outcomes.  We have introduced some successful policy measures in this country, and I will touch on them, but they are not enough and they are not across the full gambit of the emissions spectrum.  We have a gap to our mandatory 2030 target that is quantified at 100 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  I will show where that comes from.  Early and sustained action in climate change mitigation is essential and requires political leadership.  The energy transition requires everything to be addressed.  We have a significant challenge and it requires efficiency, reduced consumption, bioenergy, renewable electricity and carbon capture and storage.  There are many elements to the energy transition and one of the challenges is that we tend to focus on a few individual things and that is partly the reason we are in the current situation.</p> <p>  I ask the committee not to forget the 28% of households that experience energy poverty.  That is one of the reasons we do our analysis from a least-cost approach.  We see a lot of technical guidance being provided to communities for community development and community energy, which is great.  That is essential, but the societal capacity that needs to be built is critical and community development approaches are essential in that.</p> <p>  The mission of MaREI is to advance energy and marine research in order to facilitate, underpin and provide evidence for the energy transition.  A key part of that is the policy context but also societal engagement.  Those are topics that we will come back to.</p> <p>  We have seven different research areas.  As well as being the director of the centre, I lead the area on energy policy and modelling.  That is where we do the number crunching for climate action.  We also have significant research capacity and activity under way in marine renewable energy technologies, offshore wind energy, wave energy and tidal energy.  Bioenergy has significant untapped potential.  We also have a particular focus on energy management and efficiency in industry.</p> <p>  Most of our work is nationally focused but we have done some work internationally.  We have been informing the delivery of the Paris Agreement, which was agreed in December 2015.  It was a political agreement and at the time there was not much analysis available as to what was required to deliver it, so we undertook some analysis on what would be required in an Irish context.  We fed that into a book that I edited which captured case studies from countries across the world and that was referred to recently in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on how we can achieve the transition to a 1.5&deg; Celsius world.</p> <p>  Another area we have been working on is informing EU policy.  In 2014 the EU decided that a minimum target for 2030 for the EU would be to achieve 27% of its energy from renewable sources.  We did some analysis with the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, to see if that could be increased and one of the recent decisions that was made in the summer of this year was to increase that target for 2030 from 27% to 32%.  That is where we have contributed internationally in terms of policy development but most of our focus has been national.</p> <p>  In 2013 we produced the first low carbon energy roadmap for Ireland.  That fed into the discussions.  I was at one of the Oireachtas committees around the time the climate legislation was being developed.  We subsequently did some work focusing on other aspects of energy policy, including energy poverty and energy security.  That fed into the White Paper on energy that was published in 2015.</p> <p>  We did some work then to inform the national mitigation plan that was published last year.  We also did some work on informing the Government's negotiations with Brussels about what should be Ireland's ambition and targets for 2030.</p><p>The two most recent analyses have been to inform the national energy and climate plan for the Department and to look at a higher ambition strategy for Ireland, associated with the forthcoming all-of-Government action plan.  That is some of the analysis and how it feeds into policy decisions.</p><p> We have more than 61 million tonnes in annual greenhouse gas emissions.  Over a quarter of that is associated with the emissions trading scheme, ETS, which includes emissions associated with electricity generation and large industry.  The rest are non-ETS emissions, which are agriculture, transport, heating in our homes and in other buildings.  That is what we have the current mandatory target for emissions reduction for, for 2020 and 2030.  This shows where those emissions come from in detail.  Electricity production is a significant part of our emissions but does not form part of our non-ETS obligatory target under the 2020 and 2030 EU directives.  We can see that the non-ETS emissions relate to cars, trucks, homes and cows.  Those are the bigger elements of our non-ETS emissions.</p><p> We have done very well in some areas in the last years.  The carbon intensity of our electricity has halved since 1990.  Every kilowatt hour of electricity we use results in approximately half the emissions it did in 1990.  Some 30% of our electricity now comes from wind, up from 7% in 2005.  We talk about leadership sometimes.  We are world-leading with wind energy integration.  In transport, the carbon intensity of new cars is one third lower than it was in 2008 due to the change in the car tax regime.  Our biofuel obligation is not talked about much but it is probably our biggest result in the last number of years in contributing to our non-ETS emissions reduction target, with 300,000 tonnes a year.  We have approximately 4,000 electric vehicles and 26,000 hybrid cars on the road.  With regard to heating, we have introduced significant building regulations and our new homes now have 70% better energy performance than in 2005.  We also have grant schemes available for people to retrofit their homes and 390,000 homes have availed of these.  It is not that we have done nothing.  We have done a number of things.</p><p> On where that leaves our numbers, a graph in my presentation shows EPA projections and historical analysis of our non-ETS emissions.  We can see that, broadly, it was flat for the first years after 2005.  It dropped in the recession.  Since the recovery, we have been in an expansion with regard to emissions.  It is estimated that by 2020, we will be close to where we were in 2005.  The way in which compliance with that target is achieved is not specifically through achieving the 20% reduction but by staying within the carbon budget of 338 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.  During the recession years, our emissions were lower than what was in our targets so we were able to bank them.  Since the recovery, our emissions have grown so our current gap to the target is 17 million tonnes.  When we talk about fines, what is generally meant is purchasing compliance and we are purchasing 17 million tonnes of credit.  These numbers that have come about, whether &euro;150 million or &euro;600 million, relate to the purchase of those emissions.  That is the current estimate of the gap to target.</p><p> Why are we so far off target if we have these policies and measures in place?  The first area is growth and politics.  There has been a 16% growth in the population of Ireland and a 30% growth in the economy since 2005.  This is the new revised measure of economic growth, not GDP, which would be much higher.  Unfortunately, political leadership on climate action has been lacking.  We have had significant changes in electricity but they do not contribute to this target so they do not appear.  Moneypoint, peat plants, wind and solar are important to talk about but they do not contribute to that mandatory target.  Despite what we have done on transport, there has been a 24% increase in the annual distance driven since 2005 so we are driving much more and we have no policy measures relating to freight.  Freight is like a sleeping giant.  With regard to heating, we had great building regulations but we have not been building many houses so those have not kicked in.  The retrofits that have taken place have largely been shallow, including people putting insulation into their attics, which is important, but there is still significant energy wastage in our buildings.  We have not had any support for renewable heat until recently.  If we look forward to 2030, we can see that the target is more ambitious.  It is 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.  We have a set of annual targets, which effectively sets a carbon budget over the period 2021 to 2030.  One can see the difference on display between that line and the EPA projections.  The gap is in the order of 100 million tonnes.  That is our current gap to target in the latest official national projections from the EPA.</p><p> I will address our key findings.  Since this is a carbon budget, rather than just what we achieve in 2030, anything we do in 2021 is sustained across the period.  If we get 1 million tonnes in a saving in 2021 which is maintained over that period, it contributes 10 million tonnes to our gap to our target.  Early action is important.  We need a more urgent focus on renewable heat and transport.  Most of our discussions on renewable energy have centred on renewable electricity, including wind and solar photovoltaics.  We have not had the same level of discussion on biogas, biofuels, biomass and heat pumps, which are other areas that can contribute to renewable heat and transport.  Our heat and transport account for 80% of our energy use.  Electricity accounts for 20% of our energy use.  While we get 30% of our electricity from renewable sources, that is only 6% of our overall energy.  If we really want to expand our renewable energy, which we need to, and to meet our emissions reduction targets, we need to focus on renewable heat and transport.</p><p> Another finding from our work on 2030 relates to a number of measures in the national development plan focusing on electric vehicles, heat pumps and people upgrading and retrofitting their homes.  These are essential.  It is hard to see how they can deliver a significant amount to our target for 2030 because these things take time and there is a cumulative effect of somebody making an individual decision which then transfers outwards.  Those things will take time.  They are essential but they are likely to contribute more to the period post-2030 than to our target for 2030.  That is not to say we should not be doing them, since they are important.</p><p> With regard to 2030, there has been much discussion in this committee about carbon tax, which currently raises approximately &euro;400 million per annum for the economy.  We did some analysis for the Citizens' Assembly.  If that was doubled, there would be approximately &euro;400 million more per annum.  Using &euro;35 million of that to offset energy poverty would be important.  Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;4 per tonne for the approximately 400,000 households in receipt of fuel allowance would mean that the carbon tax would be offset by that increase in payment.  It would only knock &euro;35 million off the &euro;400 million and is an important point to raise about energy poverty.</p><p> With regard to 2050, we did an analysis that I mentioned earlier which fed into some of the global discussions.  When we look at 2050, one can see that the steepness of what we need to do is phenomenally challenging.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states that we have 12 years to go, which is the kind of thing that comes through in this analysis.  We are on the brink of missing the opportunity to stay within 1.5&deg; C.</p><p>Some of our analysis on 2050 suggests that the time to act is now.  When we look at 2050, there is a danger that the measures needed to achieve those targets are not put in place now.  Electric vehicles, EVs, are a good example and we had a target in 2007 to have 10% of our fleet electric by 2020.  That means that in two years we should have 230,000 EVs on the road but we have 4,000 at the minute.  It is important that when long-term plans or ambitions are put in place that the activity is started now.</p><p> Some of the other findings from our 2050 analysis tell us that there are no silver bullets.  This goes back to what I mentioned earlier about how we tend to focus on specific issues.  Homes and EVs are one initiative and wind and solar energy are another.  These are all important but we need other initiatives.  We need to sort out freight.  Our analysis shows that if efficiency and electricity are sorted in terms of renewable electricity and the electrification of heat and transport, that will get us about halfway there.  There is still another 50% that needs something else.  There is much less discussion on biofuels, biogas and carbon capture and storage and it is important that these discussions happen now in the context of timing.</p><p> Near zero carbon, zero carbon or even negative carbon electricity are needed to achieve the ambition of mitigation by 2050.  Significant reductions in carbon dioxide from electricity and other sectors are needed but we need to have some discussion on carbon capture and storage in that context.  If we only rely on wind and solar photovoltaics, PV, there is an energy security consideration and there are cost considerations so we need to have those discussions and develop approaches where we can move towards near zero, zero or negative emissions in electricity and these will not be easy discussions.  This transition will be difficult.  Sometimes simplistic solutions are mooted and put forward but pretending it is simple only makes it harder.</p><p> I reiterate that 2050 is not just about electricity.  Parts of the energy system are discussed less such as aviation, maritime shipping, freight and the heavy goods industry where much of our energy use takes place so we need to find solutions for same.  Within the MaREI Centre, we have an active biogas research group focusing on energy from waste, grass and algae and there is also a need to look at energy from wood.  In the short term, this would not be wood for electricity but it would be biomass for heat and transport, using liquid and gaseous biofuels.</p><p> I refer to community energy.  Energy citizenship is becoming more accepted but energy communities are struggling, according to our experience and our research and we have conducted transdisciplinary research with communities to try to understand how they are grappling with the challenges they face.  Intermediaries such as the Tidy Towns and the GAA would not traditionally be associated with the energy transition, which could be tapped into.  Even there, supports are needed to help them to do that.  Infrastructural supports are emerging but they need more coherence.  Much of the focus is on technical support but community development approaches to build societal capacity are also needed.  This is particularly challenging when we think of the timing and that notion of 12 years and we have to build capacity in society in that time to enable a response.  This is a difficult circle to square.</p><p> We expect a lot from volunteers and we give them grants to commission consultants to do work for them but the volunteers are struggling to meet their day-to-day needs.  Community energy does not guarantee community acceptability and that is another important point.  There are examples of projects that have been developed with a community energy approach and have struggled to get that acceptability.  It is unhelpful to talk up community energy while these barriers exist.</p><p> I will finish by summarising the key policy insights.  We have introduced some measures but not enough and not throughout the energy system.  I have not talked about agriculture and that is an important aspect that I intended to mention at the start.  Our focus is on energy but agriculture comprises two thirds of greenhouse gas emissions or half of the non-ETS emissions.  It has come up a number of times in the deliberations so our gap to target is 94 million tonnes and I showed where that comes from.  Early and sustained action and political leadership are essential and the energy transition is about a full range of measures, not just a few.  The people who are experiencing energy poverty should not be forgotten.  We do not want to introduce measures that will exacerbate energy poverty and we need more community development approaches in our community energy efforts.</p></speech>

I will begin with some of the questions that came to me as he was working through his presentation.</p> <p>  What are the obstacles to the development of a successful offshore renewable industry in Ireland, according to the MaREI Centre, and what can be done to overcome these obstacles?  We will all have to work together to make that happen and I accept Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's point at the outset that the greatest result we could get from this committee is to move towards political consensus and take some of the politics out of this issue because we all have skin in the game as to how this will play out in the coming years for the country.</p> <p>  Are there best practice examples of offshore energy regulatory systems in other countries that Ireland can seek to emulate aspects of?  With regard to offshore energy, wind and tidal energy offshore seem to be attractive issues to raise in public meetings in comparison with onshore wind developments that have not had community acceptance.  How does the Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's find that they compare?  We are told that costs are coming down but what are the challenges to the further development of that?  I accept the his point that at times there is probably too much focus on this element.</p> <p>  On tidal energy, countries such as Portugal are probably ahead of us in terms of best practice but we have a lot of coastline so does the MaREI Centre believe there is potential in this regard?</p> <p>  Does the MaREI Centre have an approximate price or trajectory for a carbon tax out to 2030 to drive the necessary behavioural change for Ireland to work us towards our 2030 targets?</p> <p>  Does the organisation have a view on the potential approaches to the tax such fee and dividend or hypothecation models?</p> <p>  Teagasc are up next and I acknowledge that Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir did not touch on agriculture much as it is not necessarily its main area of focus.  Teagasc had a report on emissions abatement in agriculture that the MaREI Centre is probably familiar with.  How far could these measures bring us towards the 2030 targets and how can the sector move towards this?  It would be interesting to get the MaREI Centre's views on that before Teagasc come in.</p> <p>  On carbon capture and storage, how sound is the technology around that?  Is it well proven at this stage and is it a realistic option for Ireland as part of its low-carbon energy solution?</p> <p>  There was a throwaway comment in the middle about sorting out freight and Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir made it sound easy.  How does he envisage that we sort out freight?  Did his comment mean that it should just be banned?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#D00400"><p>I will take the final question first.  I apologise if I made it sound easy to sort out freight.  My point in that was that there are areas that we have focused on and there are areas that are blind spots to us.  For example, from our analysis on electrifying car transport by 2050, we see a challenge on the freight side.  Because of the efficiency gains in moving to EVs, the proportion of energy drops.  Energy use in cars is probably twice that of freight and that will flip around in 2050 in this analysis and, therefore, it is an issue that we need to sort out.  Some of the solutions are emerging with EVs for larger fleets but some of the more proven measures are in the use of biofuels and biogas such as compressed natural gas vehicles.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is currently building out what is effectively a refuelling infrastructure for compressed natural gas to target freight vehicles.</p><p>If we can get biogas into the gas network in the way we do wind and solar electricity into the electricity network, we can have a renewable gas system powering our freight requirements.  Hydrogen is another possibility, which is sometimes discussed in the context of freight.  These are some of the options.  However, my point was that it is a blind spot.  It is not something we are talking about.</p><p> On obstacles to offshore renewable energy, it is an area where political leadership is essential.  The biggest challenge is that of policy.  It is not precisely my area, but from what I hear from colleagues, the maritime spatial planning framework is in disarray.  There is none of the clarity offshore that exists with the onshore planning system.  The political and policy challenges are the greatest ones there.</p><p> The costs in offshore wind energy have come down significantly.  There are headlines associated with some of the numbers from auctions and so on.  In this country, we have experience of auctions associated with onshore wind energy but not all of those projects were delivered.  We must be careful to see what comes through to delivery and then assess the costs.  However, the costs are coming down and, according to our analysis, will continue to come down.  The only question is the pace.  It has been faster than had been anticipated.</p><p> I would be inclined to look to Denmark as one example of best practice.  They were one of the forerunners of developing offshore wind energy.  Making offshore attractive is another challenge.  It can be seen as a panacea if there are challenges with developing wind energy onshore.  Sometimes it is as though the faraway hills are greener.  There are other interests where one will find competition such as fisheries or the movement of ships.  It is important to be careful about things that might be seen as an easier option until we try to get out there.</p><p> We are doing some research on tidal energy within the MaREI centre.  There are some interesting companies emerging.  There was a disappointing situation relating to OpenHydro which had looked promising, but there are other countries out there, such as GKinetic and others, that we are supporting to develop the technology.  This is an area where there is an opportunity.</p><p> On the carbon tax trajectory, our national mitigation plan analysis, published in July 2017, suggested that we needed to go up to about &euro;99 a tonne by 2030.  This price has been adopted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which was using shadow prices of carbon.  We have done some more recent analysis.  A tricky aspect of this is that the cost of doing something different depends on the future price of alternatives, in this case oil and gas, and there is uncertainty around those.  Some of our more recent analysis, with the drop in oil prices, suggests it might be more expensive.  The figure of &euro;100 might be a lower estimate.  It is not necessarily that that will be the carbon tax price, but that is the price of mitigation.  If we do other things, it should reduce that need.  If we have grand schemes, regulations and obligations, they could all chip away at what might have to be the carbon tax itself.</p><p> I have not looked into the detail of what might be the best way to frame a carbon tax.  The early analyses suggested simply using it to reduce labour tax, so that the thing that is bad is taxed, not the thing that is good.  If carbon tax is increased, then the labour tax is also reduced.  Different ideas are emerging now such as using it for dedicated climate action activities or, indeed, just handing it back to people.  Therefore, for instance, one could take &euro;400 million, divide it across the population of Ireland and hand it back.  That would help offset energy poverty, and those emitting higher levels would pay a greater amount.  However, we have not looked at this in detail and they are just some reflections on things I have seen.</p><p> On agriculture, given our Grain and Agriculture Free Trade Association, GAFTA, target of 100 million tonnes, the analysis suggests it would be 18 million tonnes.  That would knock off about a fifth of the GAFTA target in terms of the 2030 target, but Teagasc would be the best organisation to speak to on that.  If it is 18 million tonnes and our GAFTA target is 100 million tonnes, that gives a sense of where things sit.  There is a provision within the directive to use flexibility measures, so we could reduce the amount of emissions trading scheme, ETS, credits that we auction and could also use some offsetting, effectively sequestering carbon.  Those flexibility measures would knock about 50 million tonnes off that 100 million tonnes in addition to the Teagasc element which would knock off a further 18 million tonnes.</p><p> On the soundness  of carbon capture and storage, CCS, a colleague who is not at this meeting visited some of the plants in the US where CCS is not so much associated with power generation than enhanced oil recovery.  The technology for that is well developed.  Plans were put in place about ten years ago.  Like many plans put in place, and this is something I have touched on about our own situation, none of the plants has been built.  We need to demonstrate and become familiar with the technology.  It is available and is used for enhanced oil recovery but it is not as developed.  My colleague, Dr. Glynn, has done some work on this and I will ask him to come in on this in a moment.  There is an area that is very difficult to mitigate.  We do not have systems that are 100% renewable electricity either, so when we look at decarbonising electricity, there is the element that can be delivered from the variable renewable electricity - hydro, natural gas with CCS, biomass, nuclear, biomass with CCS - and in each of those latter sources there are elements that are liked and disliked.  The latest analysis from the IPCC and the International Energy Agency, IEA, shows that achieving the 1.5&deg;C target cannot be done without carbon capture and storage.</p></speech>

I will give some high-level figures.  There are 17 large carbon capture and storage plants globally, capturing about 13 million tonnes, that is, about half the annual Irish annual CO2 emissions.  As Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said, the IPCC scenarios for the recent special report, SR1.5 are capturing about 200 to 800 billion tonnes of CO2 cumulatively over the whole horizon, so it is almost doubling the remaining carbon budget, giving us space.  CCS in power generation costs about $50 to $100 per tonne of CO2.  Therefore in the IPCC scenarios it is relatively cheap.  However, we see from those models that less and less CCS is coming through in the power sector scenarios.  It is largely renewables.  Where CCS is being used is in industry.  It is about $400 per tonne for steel furnaces and cement process emissions.  How do we protect industry which does not have other options to decarbonise or get down to zero CO2 emissions?  The Sleipner oil field in Norway is the oldest CCS plant in the world.  It has been running since 1996 and captures about 1 million tonnes of CO2 annually.  Ireland's chance of CCS is in the Kinsale field, an old gas field which could store 250 million tonnes of CO2 at about a rate of 2 million tonnes per year relatively cheaply.  It is probably cheaper than CCS in other countries.</p></speech>

We have done some analysis on the electric vehicle, EV, measure in the national development plan, NDP, which is getting 500,000 EVs by 2030.  That would give us about two million tonnes, which would be the same amount as if 2% of gas going through the pipeline came from biogas.  If we start that in 2021 and have it as a fixed amount from 2021 to 2030, it would give us an amount similar to the target of 500,000 EVs.  It is because of this thing.  It is a carbon budget so the EVs will contribute far more in 2030 but over the period, it is a reduced amount.</p></speech>

Our car fleet is growing by 55,000 vehicles every year, and unless there is an economic downturn or something changes in our transport system, there is no reason to think that it would change.  The way we are going over a long trajectory and with a population increase, even if we got half a million EVs, we would still probably have half a million more cars, so we might have no net decrease in the transport sector.</p></speech>

The figure of 2.3 million tonnes is just associated with the EVs in terms of what it would be without them.  Our analysis would show that some of the other reductions in transport are associated with efficiency gains and using the biofuel obligation.</p></speech>

Our analysis contains what is called elastic demand, so as the price goes up for the different fuels and different forms of energy, part of addressing or responding to that price increase can be to reduce demand.  We have not looked at how that could be achieved in terms of lifestyles or consumption patterns.  I am not aware of analysis that points directly to that.  Our work for the mitigation plan shows what meeting that emissions reduction target will cost.  Our analysis came up with a figure of the order of &euro;100 per tonne by 2030.  The Teagasc analysis was not available to us at that stage so energy took the full hit.  The full 50 million tonnes were taken by the energy system so it involved measures in homes, freight, transport and the services sector.</p></speech>

I believe there is an overemphasis on the role of biomass, biogas, biomethane and biofuels in this projection of where we are going.  Modelling what is going to happen next is always uncertain.  A very good report was produced by a series of environmental NGOs such as Climate Action Network Europe, Greenpeace, Oxfam, Transport and Environment, the European Environmental Bureau, worldwide federations and wetlands associations concerning the pitfalls and potential of the role of bioenergy in EU climate and energy policy post 2020.  I cite that report because there is a real concern in seeing biofuels as a solution in the transport area because we know that the effect of biofuels on land use is really acute.  I remember someone high up in a UN agency being asked at a conference I attended how much biomass would be required worldwide if we were to replace our oil energy use with biomass.  His answer was that we would need to use every single piece of biomass on the entire planet, with no food being produced because we would be using all of it and it would produce 20% of the energy we currently use from the oil sector.  Looking at it from a global perspective, the reliance on biomass is not the silver bullet.  We must be very careful.  We should be looking at models such as those used by the Danes and others who agree that anything we do in biomass should possibly involve setting a global cap per country, because they say this problem will be tackled globally, and not going above that cap.</p> <p>  I have real concerns about some of the solutions here.  I have real concerns about the possible use of biomethane and anaerobic digestion.  If this is coupled with what I see from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, a massive continuing increase in pig and poultry production involving animals fed on imported grain and thinking that is sustainable, we will have water problems and all sorts of other problems such as ammonia down the line.  If we keep going with an agricultural model, which is all about global trade and plcs making money, which is trashing the environment, and call it green because we have some biogas at the end of it to run our transport system, it will be a flawed solution.  Bord na M&oacute;na appeared before the committee.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a significant future, but if we import three million or four million pellets or wood biomass from native forests somewhere else, which involves chopping down trees, and using half a million tonnes of our own biomass here, it will quadruple the price of biomass in the area where we need it most, which is combined heat and power in the food industry.  There is all this talk about grass to gas when we face the risk of not being able to feed our cattle this winter if it is a long winter.</p> <p>  Does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir not agree that there needs to be a national land use study that would work out the land use implications of all this reliance on biomass that he seems to be promoting and that we should also check in on the international community, including the environmental NGOs, as to the likely long-term strategy with regard to the use of biomass on a global level?  What is being proposed, which involves buying it all, shipping it in and burning it here, with two thirds of the energy ending up as heat going up a chimney, or a massive increase in pig and poultry production to give us anaerobic digestion as biogas, is just not sustainable.</p></speech>

If we want to remove carbon from our economies, there are very significant challenges.  There are challenges associated with any of the technology options.  We do not promote one over the other.  There might be a misconception of what our analysis does.  What we try to do is feed in agnostically the costs associated with different technologies, how they are projected to develop or evolve over time and see how we can meet the climate ambition at least cost.</p><p> As mentioned, we have also carried out an analysis where we rule out certain things given that many things can be ruled out.  We do not promote certain things but, instead, we do experiments.  The question of CCS came up earlier.  We have run scenarios where we assume CCS will not be developed and others where we assume we cannot import any bioenergy.  Two things happen when we do that.  First, the solutions become more difficult because we have fewer options to choose from and, second, they become more costly.  It is not just an energy poverty issue and there is a range of social and economic inequalities.  However, we do not want solutions that veer away from least-cost unless there is a very good reason to do that.</p></speech>

As an engineer, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir would agree there is no economic case for losing two thirds of waste heat up a chimney and that it is purely a social case.  I would love to see us drive Bord na Mona towards the retrofit business.  The economic cost to the State of Bord na Mona continuing to run peat-fired power stations to 2025, to give that as an example, must be some 5 million tonnes a year.  If we stop that earlier, let us say in 2020, in that five years we are taking about saving 25 million tonnes.  It is in the ETS but, as has just been stated, we will have to pay hundreds of millions of euro to buy credits or give up credits in the ETS.  This would be an economic decision that would return hundreds of millions of euro to this State, which we could invest in Bord na Mona directly to employ people to develop energy efficient housing.  That is the clever economic development we should take.</p> <p>  I come back to my key question.  As well as doing the energy modelling, does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir not think there is a case for preparing a national land use plan?  For example, if we are going to ramp up to 20,000 hectares of new forestry as a good form of carbon storage, what type of forestry do we need and where will it be?  How much grass is going to feed our animals and how much are we going to send into the transport system, if that is the plan?  Where is that going to grow and who is going to grow it?  In addition to all of those questions is that relating to where we stand globally.  Do we just get as much biomass as we can in a winner takes all, "grab the biomass from wherever we can get it" approach, or are we going to be part of a global, responsible management system for biomass?  Does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir agree in regard to the national land use plan and being part of an international co-operative mechanism in terms of what we do on biomass?</p></speech>

We have a lot of bioenergy coming through in our analysis but, in the short term, that bioenergy is used for heat and for transport.  In the long term, there may be a need for biomass with CCS in order to get negative emissions in electricity, depending on what can be done in the other sectors.  It is important to clarify that on the record.</p></speech>

Different Departments brought up the issue of relying on our analysis.  It is the same message that is on the record all the time.  The comment is always, "We do not agree with this analysis on the use of biomass in power-gen", even though that is not in our analysis.  We have bioenergy in our analysis.  I cannot see how we can have a climate mitigation solution with bioenergy.  I see potential economic, agricultural and social opportunities associated with bioenergy and I believe it is not being discussed in the way it should be.  It is a difficult thing to discuss and there are environmental consequences, but there are consequences with everything we do.  We could look at the EVs that are promoted and that are excellent, but if one talked to the people in the Congo where cobalt mining is being used to generate that, they would give a very different picture of how green EVs are.  For every one of these technological solutions, we can find benefits and challenges associated with them.  Our analysis is technology-agnostic.  We do not pick winners; we look for least-cost solutions.  It is a question of what an energy system of the future will look like if we want to meet this ambitious target at least cost.</p></speech>

On all the other uses, all I am asking for is detailed analysis on the environmental effects and the sustainability, social and international aspects.  I am not disagreeing with what Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said but we need that analysis.</p></speech>

In a broader context, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir said in his presentation that the MaREI Centre has introduced some successful policy measures.  If he had to pick one area to advance to get the policies behind the MaREI Centre, which on has been the most progressive and successful to date?  I take into consideration that we are all conscious of the fact we are playing catch-up and we are coming to the table way too late on this, which is unfortunate but cannot be denied.  With that in mind, there is also the danger of not getting the maximum from our inputs and efforts in that there may be a knee-jerk reaction whereby we start spending money foolishly.  From his research, what technological advancements does Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir foresee?  Would we be well advised, without sounding like we are shirking the issue, to take a step back and look at where technology will be in two, five or ten years time and plan towards that target, rather than everybody losing the run of themselves, if the professor knows where I am coming from?  What technological advances does he foresee?</p> <p>  I was at a meeting this morning at which we discussed heavy haulage, air transport and so on.  This is going to take a long time and our best way of making progress will be the mixing of biofuels with fossil fuels.  We can achieve fantastic results but the bottom line is that, for the foreseeable future, there will not be a day when we are not burning fossil fuels in heavy vehicles.  Our best approach is that there is a mixture with biofuels.  With that in mind, what is Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir's view on proposals with regard to exploration in Irish seas for gas and oil?  We are going to need a combination and there is also the potential benefit of CCS, which was mentioned earlier, so it is not all negative when it comes to taking fuel from the ground.</p> <p>  We get many different opinions on tax versus incentivisation and we have talked about carbon tax.  In the broader spectrum of the Irish public, what one incentivisation scheme would Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir think is the most advantageous?  If he had a pot of money to try to progress this project, what way of spending it would give the best value in terms of incentivising communities to buy in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#G01300"><p>Those are very good questions; there was a lot in that.  In terms of coherence and political leadership, the Senator is right that these are the two things that are necessary but missing.  We have had some successful measures but they have been bitty, so having a coherent targeted approach is essential.  Political leadership has been lacking so we have not actually delivered on some of the ambitions we set ourselves.</p> <p>  In terms of what is the most important, it is probably the least discussed.  The one that is discussed most in terms of meeting our targets has been the biofuel obligation but when one goes into a petrol station, there is no signage up and no mention of it, and it does not get the same discussion.  Transport is seen as the most difficult sector to decarbonise, after agriculture, and there is good reason for that.  However, the biofuel obligation scheme has been probably the most successful measure in terms of delivering on our emissions reductions targets.</p><p>I was asked about the technology and advances.  I will bring Dr. Rogan in momentarily because we have just finished a project on the opportunities associated with the energy transition.  It is about the opportunities associated with the technologies and it ties into the question on timing and whether we should wait.  We do not have the luxury of time in which to wait because of the urgency-----</p></speech>

We have to keep doing what we are doing and perhaps a bit more on a target we can afford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#H00300"><p>There is a good point in that the technology costs are coming down.  If we come in later, we will avail of technologies others have paid for.  While there is a logic to the argument, that ship has sailed now, in particular if we are talking about leadership.  We must be careful, of course, about what we invest in, which is another point the Senator made regarding tax versus incentives.  If there is one measures I suggest considering - and it is only because it has not been on the radar - it is an obligation or incentivisation scheme to introduce biogas into our gas system.  If we do not decarbonise our gas pipeline and if it does not become renewable, it will be come obsolete.  The opportunity exists to make it renewable.  There are six gas utilities around Europe which have committed to decarbonising gas by 2050.  I refer to our 2030 targets.  Gas Networks Ireland has a target of 20% of the gas in the pipeline being renewable by 2030.  If we started at 2% in 2021 and ratcheted up to 20%, it would save us 16 million tonnes on a crude, back of the envelope calculation.  It would knock 16 million tonnes off our 100 million tonnes gap to target.  It would be the one thing I suggest looking at because it is not in any of the documents anywhere but is nevertheless a significant proposition.  The key advantage of it is that people are using gas in their homes already.  If one changes that gas to renewable gas, the customer does not have to make a decision around anything.  It happens on the supply side and is therefore something that can be implemented quickly.  It would not require end-user choices to inject biogas into the gas grid.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a ban on oil and gas exploration.  I watched with interest the discussions at the other committee in that regard.  I again found that our analysis was used by different parties on both sides of the argument.  Some argued with each other using different parts of our analysis.  It is a very complex question.  The reality is that whatever our trajectory is, 75% of our energy currently comes from oil and gas.  Apart from Corrib, it is all imported.  We are relying currently on imports of oil and gas.  Oil should certainly disappear from our system whereas gas can be converted over to biogas.  On the timing of a ban, it would send a symbolic message.  It would not deliver any specific emissions reductions but would be symbolic.  There is a choice which needs to be made as to whether the message outweighs the fact that we could use the product of a find rather than to continue to import fuels in the timeframe during which we are still using oil and gas.  That is a short answer to a complex issue.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly mentioned heavy oil use in aviation and he is right that those are areas in which there are blind spots.  We see biogas as having potential in that regard.  We see hydrogen as having a role also albeit more in freight than aviation.  Aviation is likely to require a liquid fuel.  This is where it gets tricky and it touches on the discussion of electricity versus bioenergy.  We see half of the energy system requiring something like a solid or liquid form of energy.  That can be renewable but there are challenges associated with it.  Dr. Rogan wants to come in on the question of advances in technology.  I think I got the others.</p></speech>

There are a few technology areas we explored in greater detail to understand the opportunity and potential.  To pick up on some of what Br&iacute;an said, there is a potential resource regarding biogas and freight.  There is also an existing gas network which could be ungraded to use with renewable energy.  With the right mix of incentives, whether that is the right level of carbon tax or a grant, a lot of progress could be made.  There is a great deal of potential also from energy efficiency in industry and we have also developed some smart digital tools to sustain energy savings in industry settings in Ireland.  Wave energy innovation is another area we have looked at as to the policy and technology needs.  We have done some initial analysis on the risks and returns of different technology.  There is uncertainty about how technologies will development and how the cost and mix of technologies will develop over time.  One of the risks we considered in our risk-return matrix was political risk and how uncertainty in carbon prices or around political decisions can negatively affect investment.  Political leadership and cross-party agreement on climate change can mitigate that risk, strengthen the investment case and ease the pathways to a low-carbon economy.  They are all challenging but that is an area where the risk can be mitigated.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the biofuel obligation delivered more than anything else as a single measure.  An obligation around renewable gas could be significant.  While carbon tax is very important, it is only one measure.  We are missing out on that big piece.  If the committee is having a discussion on carbon tax, I implore it to consider whether the fuel allowance could be increased by &euro;4 a week for the heating period to avoid a negative impact on energy poverty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1439" speakername="Ian Marshall" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#H00800"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  A number of things spring to mind.  At the outset, Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned the collective responsibility we have.  We have the legacy of a silo mentality on this problem.  We have not worked across Departments and different areas of industry and business to adopt a holistic approach.  Targets are ambitious.  The fact that the target has been increased highlights the imminent crisis and the necessity for us to crack this discussion up.  When we look at the growth of industry, agriculture and business on the island of Ireland, we are sometimes caught up in the headline figures while missing some of the improvements and gains in efficiency that have been made in how we conduct our business.  That does not get away from the headline of increasing emissions which we must address.  However, we must be cognisant of the fact within this environment of growth.</p> <p>  Taxes versus incentives have been mentioned.  Dr. Rogan made the important point about getting the mix of incentives and taxation right.  We must take a leaf out of the book of our neighbours in France where President Macron got carbon taxation wrong.  That society was under immense pressure, whether in respect of agriculture, rural life or freight.  When one takes a group of individuals who are under financial pressure, stress and duress and applies further taxes to them, it might not be an appropriate strategy as the French case indicates.</p> <p>  Regarding the electrification of our fleet of vehicles, we were told there were only 4,000 EVs on our roads.  The majority of consumers would be keen to go to EVs if the cost were not so prohibitive.  Electric cars are ridiculously expensive compared to their diesel and petrol counterparts.  In the context of the need for a holistic approach, we must consider whether the grid and generation capacity will exist in the next few years to charge vehicles if a large proportion of cars in Dublin become EVs.  I am led to believe we would need to install gas turbines atop buildings to provide charging points for some of those vehicles if that were the case.  It is important to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  Mention was made of energy communities and the intermediaries and support they need.</p><p>We may have missed a trick in historically not embedding district and community solutions in our planning strategy.  We have failed there, but we could deal with that in future.  Should district initiatives and district heating infrastructure be incorporated into the planning process now that it is mandatory for development?</p><p> There have been a number of references to an holistic approach.  It is an issue of not cherry-picking and not trying to get quick wins because we need to be mindful of the unintended consequences of some of our actions now.  This discussion is about the next 20, 30 and 50 years.  We have focused very much on generation.  Deputy Eamon Ryan said we probably have not focused enough on encouraging people to consume less energy, thereby reducing our impact on the environment.</p><p> There is a reference to biomass and a reference to a land-use plan.  Sometimes biomass can be misrepresented in this discussion.  While it is not a silver bullet, it is certainly part of the solution.  What is the view of the Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy on the production of biomass?  I am not referring to agroforestry because agroforestry tends to be a turn-off for farming and agribusiness people.  It is like suggesting changing the shapes of all the windows and doors in our houses.  While we can all do that, it is a slow process to convert it back to what it was originally.  For those in agriculture, agroforestry does not always float their boat.</p><p> What is the view of the MaREI Centre on the production of hemp as a sustainable crop?  In light of the shift in the business model in the midlands from peat extraction especially, could hemp as an alternative crop along with a decortication plant in the region create jobs and at least go part of the way to addressing some of the issues?</p><p> Deputy Ryan spoke about conventional farming practice.  We cannot oversimplify this discussion.  In the past two weeks I visited a large pig facility which will be carbon neutral.  There will be no slurry and it has air scrubbers.  There are no emissions and no pollution.  It is a circular economy producing its own heat and electricity.  We need to be careful in our discussion on agriculture.</p><p> Members of this committee are lobbied from many areas of society and we have the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  At the moment there is major pressure to deliver policy that is popular.  What is the view of the MaREI Centre on the importance of focusing on evidence-based policy?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#J00300"><p>I will ask Ms Watson to respond on the community question.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about the legacy of silos.  I have seen it in Departments.  In recent years I have seen Departments working together.  However, I now see silos in the political system and that is why this committee is so important in trying to build consensus and coherence.</p> <p>  Headline efficiencies have improved.  Efficiency is a tricky one.  While it is the low-hanging fruit in terms of cost, it generally requires getting people to change practice which is where it gets tricky.  It is a no-brainer on the cost side, but difficult to achieve in practice.  It is important that we do that; otherwise we are wasting energy and money.</p> <p>  Regarding tax under duress, it is important to learn from what is happening in Paris and the experience here with water charges.  We need to learn from such experiences in how we implement policies and how we engage.  Dialogue is very important in that.  It creates this challenge where we have both this urgency to act and the need to bring people in a full societal movement.  That is a very difficult one to square.</p> <p>  On electric vehicles, EVs, being cost prohibitive, it is not just costs.  We recently did analysis that I am happy to share with the committee.  One of the issues was not having enough models available.  When people thinking of getting a new car go to forecourts, they do not see an EV and are not even told about an EV.  That is changing, but while cost is a factor, there are other ones.  Do we have the grid capacity to accommodate charging?  In many cases people would get a grant for a home charging kit.  That raises challenges not just with electrification of transport, but also with heat pumps.  The analysis can, and should, be done.  I do not necessarily see a need for it to be gas turbines on the top of apartment blocks.  We can mitigate that.  It is important to consider the unintended consequences in all these.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about biomass and hemp production in the midlands.  That brings together the climate justice element with the renewable energy solution.  On the specifics of hemp, I believe witnesses from Teagasc will address the committee in the next session.  The Senator is correct that biomass is not a silver bullet, but the difficulty is that we need everything.  In defending biomass, it is not that I think that it is the best or that it will do it.  However, it is not getting the discussion it needs.  From our analysis it is hard to see it being achieved without biomass.  Biomass incorporates biogas, liquid and solid waste, wood and so on.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about popular policies and how we make decisions.  It is a tricky one.  Members all know the political game better than I do.  They are trying to navigate around having the correct evidence base so that it is a well-informed policy decision.  Society needs to be behind it; ideally it should lead it.  I ask Ms Watson to talk about that and the issue of planning and community involvement.</p></speech>

Without people collaborating and participating in a decision it becomes top-down quickly leading to what we have seen in France.  The plastic bag tax a positive example of a tax that worked.  People were prepared over a period of two years for that.  We need to feed that into our thinking.  My research shows the importance of the resources put in at the grass roots.  While leadership is key, grass-roots involvement is also key.  At the moment we have many community energy groups and sustainable energy communities.  We are working with people in Dingle on an interesting project.  However, they cannot access money to employ somebody, for instance, to co-ordinate the work, or someone with community development experience who knows how to work with people.  There is a significant gap and I urge the committee to bear that in mind and to put some time aside to look at how to engage with people.</p> <p>  The issue of getting the message out has come up previously.  It is key to get the right message goes out.  At the moment what we hear on the radio is conflicting.  We are being advised to get a condensing boiler, a heat pump or an electric car.  There is a debate over whether we should burn turf briquettes.  Somehow we need to overcome that as part of the package.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of spending a Friday afternoon at the MaREI Centre a few months ago.  It was engaging and helpful.  The witnesses bring a bit of clarity to major issues.  I will just ask two short questions because the Chairman has put me under such time constraint.</p> <p>  Where are we going with the carbon-storage model?  I will be parochial.  There is an energy hub in Cork Harbour.  The Kinsale gas field is going through a decommissioning phase at the moment.  Both of those stars are shining at the moment.  What is the timeline for a national policy on carbon storage, taking into consideration the decommissioning of the Kinsale gas field in the next three to five years?  The witnesses referred to the Norway model.</p><p>Can I hear the view of the MaREI centre representatives on the Kinsale gas field and the energy hub we have in Cork harbour?  How will they all tie together?  What do they believe we need to do at a policy level to ensure that it can be part of it?</p><p> Another parochial or minor issue concerns anaerobic digestion.  Where does that fit in?  There are more dairy cows in County Cork than in the entire area of Northern Ireland.  Where can we tie that in with the co-operative industry across the southern and eastern base of the country?  Can those involved play a role at an environmental level by improving water quality, as well as addressing the carbon issue and producing the gas that is required?</p></speech>

We enjoyed the visit from the Senator.  Senator Lombard referred to the Kinsale gas field.  I know Ervia has developed plans for it.  Since the gas field is largely depleted a policy decision is urgent, because there is potentially a lost opportunity.  We need analysis around that, what it would deliver and we need to try to anticipate unintended consequences.  It would be important to have a serious look now at some of the things that have come up rather than in a few years' time, when it is too late.  I will ask Dr. Glynn to come in on that point.</p> <p>  Senator Lombard asked about anaerobic digestion.  We have done some analysis.  It was undertaken by my colleagues who work in biogas.  They have mapped out the country and looked at where we could put digesters based on the different types of farming activity, the different potential for grass and the different feedstocks.  I would be happy to share that with the committee.</p></speech>

The timeline for the Kinsale gas field will be dictated largely by the flooding of the field.  It is kept pressurised for strategic storage.  Once those responsible stop doing that, the field will flood.  That is the lost opportunity Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned.  That is a key issue.  The Norway field is for enhanced oil recovery.  The Kinsale field would only be for CO2 sequestration.  It would not be a matter of producing more oil but getting rid of CO2.</p></speech>

It has not been mentioned.  Has the MaREI Centre done any analysis on that area in the context of the mix we have discussed?</p> <p>  Is the MaREI analysis of transport only an analysis of the vehicles used?  Does the analysis cover the travel options and choices available to people?  I am referring to public transport, cycling and walking.  What does the MaREI analysis tell us about the public health benefits of the various options for meeting the energy scenarios, in particular with regard to air pollution and physical activity?  Can the MaREI representatives add these issues to the results generated by the models?</p> <p>  The question of freight is relevant.  One of the big technological developments in recent years has been the automation of transport systems in ports.  Has the model looked at the potential to increase the use of rail for freight as this technology becomes more widespread?</p> <p>  Can the deputation supply a marginal abatement cost curve for energy emissions similar to that supplied in the Teagasc presentation for agriculture?</p></speech>

I am happy to send that to the committee.</p> <p>  We do not have specific research activity within MaREI on solar power.  It is not one of the technologies we focus on.  We see it emerging in our results, especially on the electricity side as one of the options as the price of solar power comes down.</p> <p>  I mentioned wind and solar several times.  Part of our goal in presenting to the committee today is to show that wind and solar are important, but some of the other elements do not get the same level of discussion.  That was where the emphasis lay.</p> <p>  I was asked about the public health benefits.  We are working with colleagues in China, where air pollution is a major issue.  In China, a total of 1 million deaths per year are associated with air pollution.  We are working with colleagues who do similar modelling to bring air pollution into our scenarios.  This will enable us to assess not only the implications for climate action but for air pollution as well.</p> <p>  As for public transport and cycling, essentially our model finds least-cost solutions.  We have done some analysis but it is rather difficult to find a least-cost solution between public and private transport.  If we simply put the data into the model, it would immediately go to public transport because that involves moving a larger number of people.  However, it does not take into account the value that people place on their time if they are waiting at, or walking to, bus stops etc.  We have done some analysis on this previously, and I can share it with the committee.  We have not done anything precisely on cycling and walking and the other benefits.</p></speech>

I am keen to go back to the issue of carbon capture and storage.  A spokesperson for Science Foundation Ireland, which funds the MaREI project, said recently at another committee meeting that we should not be too panicky about climate change.  The view was that developments in science like carbon capture and storage will save us at the end of the day and that we are making great developments.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn said that when he visited the US it was all about enhanced oil recovery.  Do the MaREI representatives acknowledge that carbon capture and storage is not as developed as it sounds?  It will not capture carbon from agriculture or transport, although it can do it from the production of fossil fuels.  We should therefore be looking at afforestation, open bogs and other natural ways of carbon capture, rather than taking the view that science is going to save the planet.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on investment in tidal and wave energy?  Reference was made to some companies investing in research and development in these areas.  Most people who look at Ireland would maintain we are the wealthiest country in tidal and wave energy if we could capture and exploit it.  We are way ahead of anywhere else.  Sweden tops the agenda in doing the best that it can do to tackle climate change.  As we are on the Atlantic, we could be really wealthy in resources if we could capture those energy sources.  Will the deputation comment on the amount of investment needed for the exploration of tidal and wave energy?  Reference was made to how our policy on planning is an obstruction.  I understand why it is an obstruction to wind energy and putting wind farms in place.  As politicians we really need to address that.  Can the deputation explain why the policy also is an obstruction to the development of tidal and wave energy technology?</p> <p>  We have 13 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly.  I imagine the MaREI representatives have seen them.  If they were to pick three, which three would they pick?</p></speech>

I have said that previously.  Carbon capture and storage, CCS, is not a silver bullet from our perspective.  There have been arguments that we should delay things and that CCS will deliver.  There have also been arguments that we should not rely on CCS at all and that we should do other things.  What comes through in our analysis is that CCS is an important part of the solution but it is a small part of the solution.  We need everything else as well.</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Glynn to address the comment on enhanced oil recovery.</p> <p>  On the question about tidal and wave energy, one of our colleagues in the audience is from Maynooth University.  We have teams throughout the country working on wave and tidal energy.  We have done some analysis recently on what is required and by how much the costs would have to come down to make it competitive.  We are trying to explore what kind of actions and polices we would need to put in place to deliver it.  I will bring in Dr. Rogan on that point in a moment.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to say that we are wealthy as a country in terms of our wave and tidal energy resources.  It is a very difficult environment.</p><p>I did my PhD in wave energy.  Some of the early prototypes put out in the ocean were ripped apart.  It is a difficult and challenging environment.  We do have some interesting developments, including a company called Ocean Energy building a device in Portland, Oregon.  That is going to be shipped to Hawaii for testing.  We have companies working with us in Ireland, such as GKinetic on tidal energy.  Regarding policy, it is clear, as the Deputy noted, how that affects offshore wind energy.  Turning to policy on wave and tidal energy, we put devices in the water to test then and that is where policy has an effect.  We can put the test devices in our own tanks but we need permission from somebody to go to the open sea.  Where is the process and planning for that?  There is some leniency and we have been able to do some testing.  Moving to the next level is where we need that planning policy.  </p></speech>

A reduction of about 80% was required from where technology costs are now for wave energy to be competitive.  That sounds like a dramatic decrease.  We looked at historic precedents for cost reduction as well, however, in respect of wind and solar PV.  An 80% cost reduction is very big but there are historical precedents for that.  We did additional analysis on the innovation needed to achieve that 80% reduction.  We can share some of the results with the committee.  We put together a policy brief on those recently.  In summary, we looked at infrastructural needs, such as building up the knowledge and industrial base in Ireland.  There are also technology challenges that some of our engineering colleagues are working on in the MarEI centre in Cork as well as the regulatory and consistency needs Professor &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir mentioned.  A number of things have to come together and we can share our analysis with the committee.</p></speech>

That is as clear as we can put it.  Sequestration of CO2 through afforestation, CCS, direct air capture and enhanced weathering is critical.  We definitely need afforestation as well as any other way to prevent the emission of CO2.  The IPCC is highlighting direct air capture, enhanced weathering and CCS in its analysis.  Bioenergy carbon capture and storage is the big question.  What is the global resource?  It is about 50 EJ now.  In some scenarios, there is talk of trebling that or even an increase of up to 15 times that amount.  That is the big question on CCS.</p> <p>  In the plants we visited in the United States, the most mature plants are capturing about 1 million tonnes to 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.  Those plants are in place because of tax regimes in Texas and Canada, where carbon taxes are about $50 per tonne.  Some are in the form of rebates and some are investment charges on the cost of electricity.  In the scenarios coming from the IPCC, in all of the integrated assessment models produced, bioenergy CCS, or CCS in general, is not for power generation.  It produces small amounts of electricity to stabilise the grid but it is mainly to produce liquid and gaseous zero emission fuels for transport and industry.  Those are sectors where it is otherwise really difficult to bring CO2 emissions to zero.  In the long-term then, CCS will be concerned with zero emissions and liquid and gaseous fuels.  Developing the technology is the main aspect of CCS in the short term but whether that technology is then used for fossil fuel or bioenergy in the long term is up for debate.  </p></speech>

There is an attempt to address that with insulation and other sustainable measures in housing.  Most people cannot afford that and cannot match grants.  Those supports are too difficult for people to access.  That is, however, one of the ways we can get community involvement and get communities talking to one another.  The need to insulate is inextricably linked with a realisation of the nature of climate change.  Do the witnesses have ideas on how progress can be made on a community basis by talking to people and taking direct action at the same time?</p> <p>  Regarding the difficult area of heavy goods haulage, which is a significant emitter of CO2, have we examined the capacity of the rail network to take over some of that transport in a more environmentally-friendly way?  On community ownership and the research that needs to be done on groups that have not survived, can the witnesses, off the top of their heads, give the main reason why those groups might have collapsed?  </p></speech>

My own thoughts are that the Senator is exactly right regarding energy poverty and addressing that through community energy schemes.  That is a very positive way to go.  It is not just the money, it is also the aspect of people coming into each other's homes.  In a community setting people are known to each other.  That is an important dimension because there are many barriers to making community energy schemes work.  The question of the rail network came up earlier as well.  I apologise for not addressing it and I thank Senator Devine for reminding me of it.</p> <p>  We have not looked at this closely.  The dispersion of the population of Ireland around the country makes this a difficult area.  What we have noticed is a decline in the use of rail for freight transport.  The ports are used to a slightly greater extent for freight transport but the roads are much used.  There has been some analysis of electrifying rail and where that might make most sense regarding investment versus return in emissions reductions.  My understanding is that it is more in the greater Dublin area than some of the intercity lines.  I will try to find the information and send it to the Senator.  </p></speech>

They could not access funding, they could not access the electricity grid and they also had trouble with planning.  They got no infrastructural or leadership support.  There were others, later on, that tried to be community-oriented by accepting shares locally.  Those involved will admit now, however, that they did not have the information on how to do it properly.  There does seem to be a problem as well in that, even if there is an attempt to get community involvement, some people do not like wind generators.  Much of the research will show that people have something called place attachment.  People are very attached to the place where they live, to the view as it is now and maintaining that view in the future.  Some big development coming in, or even a community development, threatens to wreck that.  That is part of where long-term and in-depth engagement is needed.  This cannot be rushed into, even as a community project.</p></speech>

The first recommendation was that climate change should be at the centre of policy-making.  This has come up during the deliberations, but I do not think a new body is required.  We need, instead, to strengthen what already exists, such as putting this committee on a permanent footing, as well as the advisory council.  The fourth recommendation was on the vulnerability of critical infrastructure.  The issue of adaptation does get not much discussion but it is an important recommendation.  The sixth recommendation concerned trying to increase levels of community ownership in all future renewable energy projects by encouraging communities to develop their own projects.  There are some moves on that with the recent renewable electricity support scheme.  It does focus on electricity and community ownership and better community engagement could be extended to renewable heat and transport,</p></speech>

We started hearing about this 20 years ago.  I heard the reply to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith but are there examples from around the world where wind and wave have been utilised effectively?  Is the issue in Ireland due to lack of investment in research and development or is it because those technologies do not seem to be a viable alternative in respect of cost benefit or consistent output?  Regarding Moneypoint power station, what is the most effective way of powering that in the future?  That is a major issue and it gets bounced around.  Is it natural gas?  If it is, do we have the natural gas potential to supply it?</p><p>What are the greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas compared with those from oil and coal?  If something is powered by oil and coal and there was a switch-over to natural gas, what would be the percentage reduction in greenhouse gas emissions?</p><p> I listened carefully to the earlier discussion about HGVs.  It is a big issue because some solutions can be found in the public transport sector, including electrification of the fleet and so on, but for the haulage industry, in providing torque, or pulling power, we do not yet have them.  What we are really looking at as adding biogas to the grid.  What percentage of the fleet could be powered by biogas?</p><p> My last two questions are very brief.  What is the optimal way to develop and implement a carbon tax, not only to achieve a reduction in emissions but also public acceptance, particularly in view of what has happened in France?</p><p> I refer to the potential to use hydro power.  I do not want everyone to answer my last question, but perhaps one of the panel might answer it.  We have had a dry year, weather wise, but there is still a lot of water on the island.  There have been other years when there has been a hell of a lot of it.  Plans have been brought forward in the past release water and flood valleys to generate electricity.  Some very innovative methods used in other countries have been considered.  The power plant at Ardnacrusha supplied all of the electricity needs of the State in the 1920s; my understanding is that it now supplies less than 4%.  Considering that we have heavy rainfall and mountainous terrain, is there an opportunity, perhaps through using a number of hydro plants, to provide for our power needs?  Obviously, hydro is a clean source of energy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018121200002#M00500"><p>They are great questions and I hope I can do them justice in responding to them.</p> <p>  I was asked for examples of places where the use of wind and wave energy was successful.  Ireland is very successful in the use of wind energy.  We are a world leader in the amount of wind energy the power system can take.  Denmark is one of the few countries that obtains a higher share of its electricity supply from wind energy, but it is heavily interconnected to two large power systems which act as a cushion.  The work we have done in Ireland is world-leading.  Some 30% of our electricity supply now comes from wind energy.  In any instant wind energy can account for a figure of 65% in our power system, which is higher than in any other power system in the world, of which I am aware.  </p> <p>  As for examples of good practice in the use of wave energy, there is still that opportunity and no one has taken the lead over anyone else.  At different times different countries have moved forward and then pulled back.  They include some of the same countries mentioned, including Denmark, Portugal and Scotland.  There is significant potential here, notwithstanding the challenges faced in bringing down the cost and the ocean environment, but it is an opportunity.</p> <p>  The future of the plant at Moneypoint is a very interesting question because it is presented as a topic in itself.  If we were to close the plant at Moneypoint, what would we do?  Our work looks at the whole system and it is a much bigger challenge than the one associated with the plant at Moneypoint.  The fact that there is great infrastructure at Moneypoint suggests one could consider having a large power plant in the vicinity.  One of my colleagues has presented the idea of having wave energy feed into that grid connection point.  I saw some analysis, although it was from a couple of years ago, that in knocking the plant at Moneypoint out of the picture the overall cost of electricity would increase by &euro;200 million a year.  The reason it is being used is that coal is cheap, but, obviously, does have climate change implications.  It does not help us in meeting our targets because it is in the ETS, not the non-ETS, sector.  </p> <p>  We probably have five options to have a central station.  They are natural gas, natural gas with carbon capture and storage, biomass, biomass with carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy .  There will not be a fan club for any one of them, but they would all result in reduced emissions compared with the plant at Moneypoint.  </p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about gas versus coal.  Gas has lower emissions intensity than coal, but producing electricity from gas in the plants typically used throughout the country would be 55% efficient.  The plant at Moneypoint is 38% efficient.  It is a question of reduced emissions content and also efficiency.  Therefore, we are talking about approximately half of the emissions.  That is a crude estimate and I could come back with a more accurate one.  If one was to switch to biomass, there would be zero emissions.  If one was to switch to biomass with carbon capture and storage, one would have negative emissions.  If one was to switch to gas with carbon capture and storage, one would be close to negative emissions.  I made a presentation to the Department on this question and it did not like my answer.  I said it was almost the wrong question because the challenge was what we were doing across the entire system and all elements.  The discussions tend to focus on narrow silo topics that move us away from the bigger picture.  Of course, it is a significant emitter, accounting for approximately 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year, but they are the options.</p> <p>  Regarding HGVs and on what we see as the role for biogas, gas feeds homes in many of the cities.  Therefore, if one had biogas entering into the gas network, one would have a seamless way of decarbonising heat because biogas would deliver home heating and homeowners would not have to make a decision if they were already connected to the gas network.  In the short term that would be an option while the infrastructure was being developed.  It is already happening in respect of refuelling, with the focus on freight; therefore, one could then transition from home heating to freight transport because that is where biogas would be most valuably used in the future.  The options in the case of freight transport are more limited.  I can come back to Deputy Stanley with a number.  He asked about the percentage reduction.  The target of Gas Networks Ireland for the use of biogas on the gas grid is 20% by 2030.  I suspect that that would meet all of our needs in the area of freight transport, but I can come back to the Deputy with a firmer answer.</p> <p>  I have addressed the question of a carbon tax.  There are a number of ways by which the money could be given back, used to reduce labour costs or for climate action measures.  It is important that the issue be discussed but, generally, the issue that is discussed less and receives less airtime is ensuring it does not impact negatively on the level of energy poverty.  Increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;4 a week during the heating season would be offset by a carbon tax of &euro;20 per tonne; therefore, there would be a doubling of the carbon tax.  I think that also addresses the question of the use of biomass in the plant at Moneypoint.</p></speech>

In a short presentation I will take it through some of the work Teagasc has done in the area of greenhouse gas emissions in the agriculture sector.  It looks at what the emissions could be in the future and sets out a range of mitigation actions which, if employed, could reduce the emissions produced by the sector.  I will skip through my first background slide which sets out the state of affairs with respect to agriculture's share of greenhouse gas emissions and with which I am sure the committee is familiar.</p> <p>  It is important to emphasise when looking to the future - I am referring to the years to 2030 - that the position in agriculture is quite uncertain.  It is a sector heavily influenced by policy.  When I refer to policy, to a large extent, I am referring to the Common Agricultural Policy.  The sector is also heavily influenced by international demand.  That is a particularly important issue for agriculture.  On the key agricultural outputs, we export very large shares of dairy produce, beef, sheep and pigmeat.  Exports account for a very high share of total production, which is unusual in a EU context.  The level of activity in the sector is heavily driven by international considerations.  </p> <p>  Acknowledging that uncertainty, we decided to look at six future scenarios for the level of agricultural activity and the associated emissions that will be produced by the sector.  Given that most of the greenhouse gas emissions in Irish agriculture are generated by cattle, that is, in beef and dairy production, we centred our scenarios on different views of how the total cattle population could evolve and knowing what the total cattle population would be in different scenarios.  In assessing them and the level of activity in other sectors of agriculture and the amount of nitrogen used, an important source of emissions, we can come up with a suite of projections for what the emissions from the sector will look like in the future before we take mitigation actions into consideration.  </p> <p>  Reflecting on what I have said, I draw the committee's attention to the graph for the cattle population.  I draw its attention to the relatively narrow vertical axis.  There are a little over 7 million cattle in the country.  We have produced projections for six scenarios which we have labelled Nos. 1 to 6.  The key point to note is that we have projected a range of about 1 million head of cattle by the time we reach 2030.  It is important to emphasise the current population is a little over 7 million.  The most important scenario, the one about which I will talk most, is scenario 1.  It is the central scenario in which the cattle population will increase to about 7.4 million in the period to 2030.  </p> <p>  Why do we have these scenarios?  We have them because we have based them on different possible evolutions of the dairy cow and suckler cow populations.  They give us a spread of six potential outcomes.  The reason we have done it is to emphasise that we cannot know with certainty what the total cattle population will be or what total emissions will be in agriculture.  The same is true of any other sector of the economy and the associated level of emissions.  It is an important point to note.  If we take the six scenarios and factor in the emissions from other sectors of the economy, we can come up with six scenarios for the emissions that will be produced in the agriculture sector.  There are some important figures to note on the graph.  The figure for 2005 is the reference level of emissions relative to which we are trying to achieve by way of a reduction in emissions by 2030.  All six scenarios show emissions increasing relative to where they are.  In all six emissions are higher than they were in 2005.  The key point that needs to be made is that the six scenarios and the levels of emissions exclude mitigation actions.  It is before we take into consideration actions that could be taken in the agriculture sector to address the emissions.  We have identified about 25 actions that could be taken to address them.</p> <p>  That is not the final outcome.  Other key figures to note are the 10% and 20% reductions in emissions relative to the figure for 2005.  If we take the figures and put them in tabular format, we can see the associated percentage changes in emissions.</p><p>The most relevant is probably the one in the second last column for 2030 versus 2005.  As members can see, under all of the scenarios shown, the level of emissions would be higher than it would have been in 2005.  Again, the caveat here is that this is before we take into consideration the mitigation actions.</p><p> I will home in on scenario one, which is the central scenario across the six scenarios we have looked at.  In that context, we are talking about a 9% increase in emissions relative to 2005 by 2030.  This is without mitigation being taken into consideration.  We then identified three mitigation pathways, three ways in which we can address the emissions being produced by the agriculture sector.  The first of those was to reduce the methane and nitrous oxide emissions produced by the agriculture sector.  This would involve lowering the emissions produced by animals, animal waste and the application of synthetic fertilisers.  The second mitigation pathway is sequestering carbon, which, in large part, involves increased afforestation.  The third mitigation pathway is energy efficiency, biofuels and bioenergy.  It mainly involves biofuels and bioenergy production.  In other words, we want to reduce the overall energy usage on farms.  I caution that energy usage on farms is a relatively small share of the total emissions produced by agriculture.  The focus in this area is on biofuel and bioenergy production and what farmers could do that would result in the displacement of fossil fuel emissions.</p><p> We produced three associated marginal abatement cost curves, MACCs.  It is easier to focus on the figures on the right, rather than dwelling on the detail on the left.  The key point about these three marginal abatement cost curves is that very few of the individual measures are large in size.  We have identified those that are large in size in yellow for the benefit of members.  In the three marginal abatement cost curves we can see that many of the measures are small in size.  This reflects the fact that there is no silver bullet to address emissions being produced by the agriculture sector.  We will need to continue to attack this issue from a whole range of angles.  The first of the two key figures shown is the dairy economic breeding index, EBI, which is geared to producing dairy cows that have superior performance.  That is one of the ways we can address methane emissions produced by dairy cows.  The second key figure is on changing the fertiliser type that is used.  We can change to fertilisers that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> When we take into account the mitigation I just outlined in terms of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, we can see what this does to the curve in the future.  Members can see a projection out to 2030 in the absence of any mitigation, which would see the emission level for the agriculture sector to 20.5 million tonnes.  We also have the mitigation that we identified which brings the figure to 7% below the 2005 level, as opposed to 9% above that level, by 2030.  I should emphasise a point of which members are probably aware.  While the focus of my submission is 2030, progress towards the 2030 target has to be achieved on an annual basis.  We cannot continue as we are until 2029 and achieve all the mitigation in 2030.  The way the system works is that countries are basically assessed in terms of emission reductions from 2021 through to 2030.  This also highlights that early action on mitigation is particularly useful because it is important to get onto a good pathway towards achieving the 2030 target.  This is the mitigation associated with methane and nitrous oxide emissions produced by the agriculture sector.</p><p> Figure 2 is the MACC associated with land use sequestration.  The main source of emission reductions within this category is forestry.  I should have emphasised in my previous point that we are looking at the mean level of mitigation, that is, the average level of mitigation achieved between 2021 and 2030.  This will ultimately be what our success will be measured against in respect of addressing greenhouse gas emission reductions.  A key point is that forestry is, by a long distance, the most significant sequestration source.  This is based on planting rates for forestry of about 7,000 ha per year.  Ireland's planting or afforestation rate is only about 4,000 ha per year at the moment.  We are, therefore, below target and even below the assumption we are making for the purposes of this exercise.  Forestry is a long-term game.  While we are thinking about targets for 2020 and 2030, we should probably also have in our minds targets that will exist beyond that point, out to 2040 and 2050.  Having trees in place in the short term would have significant benefits in the longer term beyond 2030.  That is an important point.</p><p> Figure 3 is the MACC for energy efficiency, bioenergy and biofuels.  The energy efficiency component is relatively small.  I mentioned already that energy emissions by the agriculture sector are not particularly significant as a share of the total emissions produced by the sector.  The largest single contributor here is wood biomass for energy.  This covers thinnings from forestry and some residues used to produce electricity and fuel for heat.</p><p> When we accumulate all of these mitigation actions together, the summary figure shows the mean level of mitigation and the level of mitigation by the time we reach 2030.  We can also see the figures on the level of emissions before mitigation is considered.  That is the first significant row of figures on the slide.  Taking all of these into consideration, the agriculture sector could be producing a total level of mitigation of some 7.7 million tonnes by 2030.  It is important to emphasise, however, that the final category on energy mitigation would not be credited to agriculture on the basis of the way the accounting system works for the greenhouse gas inventory.</p><p> On the costs associated with mitigation, most of the mitigation actions we have identified cost less than &euro;50 per tonne to achieve.  That is just our assumption for the purposes of this exercise as to what the cost of carbon would be.  We could also say that the agriculture mitigation, which is the first of the three categories of mitigation I referred to, is generally cheaper to achieve than the mitigation associated with land use and bioenergy production.  On the figures for costs, there is considerable uncertainty around bioenergy in particular.  It is very difficult to determine the extent to which farmers will be interested in moving into bioenergy.  For this reason, we are less confident in respect of the figure we have produced for bioenergy production than we are in respect of the other figures in the presentation.</p><p> This submissions is the product of contributions by about 20 individuals.  I am just a spokesperson and I will endeavour to answer questions to the best of my ability but I am sure there will be some on which I will have respond in writing. </p></speech>

Mr. Donnellan is here to give members a briefing in advance of meeting the farming organisations.  I ask that members limit questions to points of clarification around the Teagasc report.  That would be very useful.  We will try to limit the time for lead questioners to five minutes and other questioners to three minutes.</p><p>This report will be very important in drawing up our report in the end of January.  Based on Teagasc's interactions with the farming community, what are the challenges and barriers to rolling out the findings of the Teagasc report to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions?  What incentives or supports should the Government provide to help implement the report and reduce greenhouse gas emissions?</p></speech>

We need to address the level of understanding of what farmers need to do to mitigate emissions.  There is some understanding of this but it can always be improved.  Teagasc is active in that area.  We have an aid called a carbon navigator which is designed to assist farmers in identifying ways in which they could address their emissions.  Communications would certainly be one of the issues we have identified.  Without farmers understanding what they need to do, it will be difficult for some mitigation actions to take hold.</p> <p>  Some of the mitigation actions are much easier to explain and implement than others.  Some are more complex and require farmers to develop skills that they may not yet have.  Some of them, as I also identified, are probably more significant in terms of the emission reductions that they produce.  It may be relevant to focus in the short term on some of the bigger emission reduction actions we have identified.</p> <p>  On policy, the upcoming reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, creates an opportunity in the sense that there is some national level scope now to design aspects of the CAP, with the agreement of Brussels, that can address specific concerns that member states have.  Some of the environmental concerns would  be to the fore for Ireland.</p></speech>

Based on its engagement with the farming community, what does Teagasc need?  Is there anything we can include in our report?

That is above my pay grade, as they say.  Resources are always welcome in this regard.  If we delay in achieving some emission reductions, that will make it all the more difficult to achieve the 2030 target, or get anywhere near it.  The sooner we begin on a pathway towards emission reduction, the better.</p></speech>

Having said that, what has happened in recent years with respect to the development of Irish agriculture following quota elimination is that with the increase in agricultural activity is even greater than many of the most optimistic people would have suggested.  The associated level of emissions is higher than we would have anticipated as well.  This is not a finished product.  We will have to come back and do this again.</p></speech>

The number of cattle in the country could stabilise rather than increase in the future.  Mr. Donnellan's presentation refers to achieving more efficiency and refers to "better before bigger" coming into tune more than in the past.  Prior to the abolition of milk quotas, there may have been a serious push to increase cattle numbers.  Mr. Donnellan also spoke about the economic breeding index, EBI, which is crucial.  We will see more production from smaller numbers.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

My expectation is that we will see more produced by each dairy cow, but we will probably also see more dairy cows in the future.  That is baked into all of the scenarios we are looking at here.  The level of profitability that is in the dairy sector is so high, relative to other sectors, that expansion of the sector is inevitable and arguably desirable from an economic point of view.  The question ultimately becomes one of what happens to the other part of the cattle population, the breeding and suckler herd.  Whether that stays the same size in the future or decreases in size is the question.  I cannot see it growing in size in future.  That will be a key factor in terms of what will be the total level of cattle population in the future and what will be the total level of emissions.</p></speech>

I agree with his statement that there is no silver bullet.  At the same time, some of the measures are common sense and would not take an awful lot to push forward.  Is more incentivisation required to achieve those targets?  Should we show more carrot than stick in our approach to this?</p></speech>

Returning to the answer I gave to the previous question, awareness of what farmers need to do in the first instance is critically important.  Measures that do not cost farmers money, in some sense, are the ones that farmers should look to adopt in any event.</p><p>Some of the measures we have identified potentially save farmers money by increasing their profitability.  Farmers should be looking at these measures, apart from the fact that they help to mitigate emissions.  </p><p> Some of the measures we have looked at are quite expensive.  I had not mentioned that earlier but some also have the dual benefit of addressing ammonia emissions, which is another important environmental target that agriculture faces as well.  That is almost as an aside but it is important in the context of the emissions mitigation actions we have identified. </p></speech>

In my opinion there has been a general lack of communications about what has been achieved to date.  A great deal has been achieved and we must consider what can be achieved by following some of the strategies Mr. Donnellan has outlined today.  Has Teagasc a strategy in place to try to inform, enlighten and encourage farmers on how to achieve some of these targets?</p></speech>

How can we marry CAP reform to Food Wise 2025 targets to increase agricultural exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025 and create an extra 20,000 odd jobs, which the economy needs and the exports are very important as well?

The serious deliberations in terms of what the next CAP reform will actually look like in a broad sense, not just from an environmental sense, have not started in Ireland in a meaningful way at this point in time.  We will be active in that space and we will be open to informing all stakeholders in terms of scenario analysis of different possibilities.  Our position is that we do not prescribe policies, we look for people to come to us with suggestions of policy because we do not want to be put into the position of being policy advocates.</p></speech>

I will watch a replay of the full presentation and I read Mr. Donnellan's slides with real interest.</p> <p>  Our job is to help the State in this major herculean task of meeting its climate change ambitions.  The more we can come up with concept block ideas on which we can get agreement, the more we can help the State.  I recognise the good work that Teagasc has done in agriculture, for example Dr. Rogier Schulte's study in 2012, which recognises that environmental care and farming community interests are going to go hand in hand into the future and that profits will increase the more we look after the environment.  Should we take that concept to the national scale and think that we need a national land-use plan that thinks in detail in the next 20 to 40 years as to what type of farming we do and where we should do it, what type of forestry and where we should do that, how do we protect biodiversity, how do we restore wetlands and, to revert to research by UCC on grass to gas, how much do we need and how that affect the land-use plans?  Has Teagasc a land-use plan in mind?  Is work being done on a land-use plan?  Would that be a useful contribution and a really strong detailed one to the task we have ahead of us?</p></speech>

What the Deputy is suggesting is quite prescriptive.  I may be taking a wrong interpretation, but it sounds to me as though the Deputy is suggesting that we effectively determine what happens in different parts of the county.  I think what would be more effective and more realistic is to work with the circumstances as they exist.  We have a situation where agriculture is driven by market forces to some degree and by policy forces to some degree.  When I say policy, I mean agriculture supports provided for by Brussels.  That is the framework from which we must begin in terms of looking at what can be achieved in the future.  I cannot think of any instance in a western country where people are going down to the level of detail of prescribing what type of activity should happen in a particular hectare of land.  I do not know if that is a realistic objective.  We need to bear in mind that there are 140,000 farmers in the country.  It is a different process from looking at what six factories might be doing.  The heterogeneity that exists in terms of agriculture is critically important as well.  I think we would be much better off to focus on measures that farmers would be more willing to buy into, that is, things that farmers understood as opposed to being very highly prescriptive in terms of telling farmers that they are doing X and they should now be doing Y.</p></speech>

I have no intention of telling farmers because they know the land better than anyone and they are business people and have to make business decisions, taking into account everything that is happening.  I think we need a land-use strategy plan to shape the policies that give farmers the payments and the signals for what we want done.  For example, the need for this would be influenced by what seems to me to be one of the best ways we can get beyond 2030.  While much of the forestry we have done already will account for the mitigation we do between now and 2030, we need to be thinking in terms of post 2030.  The best analysis I have read from Teagasc in the recent report on showing the 27 emissions, was toward the end of the report where it states we need in the region of 20,000 ha per annum of afforestation to meet our future targets.  That matches the analysis that I would have done in terms of the scale of ambition in forestry.  We know that in counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon and elsewhere, we are not going to be able to tell people to set 20,000 ha of Sitka Spruce monoculture, which would have implications for the soil and so on.  My sense of a national land-use plan is that we would know how much might we get in agriforestry in a land-use plan to help people to decide.  Similarly, I recognise that the country is very different.  Having talked to people such as Dr. Rogier Schulte for many years, I am aware that what is happening in the north and west of the county regarding soil, climate, the nature of farming and the nature of farms is totally different from what is happening in the Golden Vale.  A land-use plan would assist in laying the policy determination of how we would pay the farmers in the north west, instead of leaving the farmers in the west and north to compete with the farmer in the Golden Vale, as if all the land was the same and the market will sort it out.  The benefit of a national land-use plan is that it can pay farmers for protecting biodiversity, managing water, for training young farmers, for storing carbon and so on.  One leaves it up to the farmer how to do it but to give them the signal, one needs a land-use plan to know what the signals are.</p></speech>

The concern I have - again this reflects the remit of this committee - is that the pressure is most acute in respect of greenhouse gas emissions but we know we have other objectives to which we want agriculture to be able to contribute and deliver.  Having a more holistic view of what agriculture should be delivering for Ireland from an environmental perspective is critically important in the context of assessing what it can do in respect of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> We are in a difficult place at present in regard to intensive agricultural activity.  I do not think we have significantly intensive agriculture in this country, certainly nothing by comparison with what would be found in the US.  We have aspects of agriculture which are more intensive and more focused on delivering profit from the marketplace and agriculture which is more focused on the delivery of environmental goods.  We are telling both groups of farmers that they are doing one thing correctly and the other thing wrong.  We are telling farmers who are not making very much money but are farming at low intensity that they need to intensify their production and become more profitable and similarly we are telling farmers who are quite profitable that they are not doing enough in terms of consideration for the environment.  Perhaps we should consider that both groups are delivering on two different objectives, both of which are important from the perspective of Irish agriculture.  If that is something that policymakers decide is important, then perhaps it should be reflected in a policy that evolves in the future.  Beating everybody over the head and telling them that they are doing something wrong and telling others they are also doing it wrong, that one farmer needs to be more like the other person in one respect and his counterpart needs to be more like the other farmer in a different respect, could be counterproductive.  I do not know if we can deliver a situation where every single farm is delivering on the objective of producing a significant level of income from the marketplace and simultaneously doing 100% of what it could from the environmental perspective.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions on the report.  My colleague, Deputy Deering alluded to the cattle numbers.  Since we started on this committee, everybody has been trying to predict the future and to say what we should be doing, and we are all trying to look forward, which is nigh on impossible.  What can we learn from looking back at what we have done?  Based on the cattle figures, it is a fact that the agriculture sector decreased the greenhouse emissions from 1990 to 2016 by 3.5%.  In the middle of that period, 1998, cattle figures were in excess of 7.5 million.  What did we stop doing?  What can we learn from looking back?  What were we doing right at that point?  Was it due to the production process?  Was it the result of farming style, farming habits or a change in farming philosophy, in that there was much more mixed farming at that time and we now seem to have moved away from tillage?</p> <p>  I see from the report that tillage is in the mitigating sector.  What are the proposals for tillage going forward?  Where would the beet crop come into that?  Would beet be grown with a view to biofuel production or whatever?  At this stage I get nervous analysing reports because we have to wonder if we are wasting our time because so many of them seem to end up on shelves.  At what stage are the Teagasc reports, what is Teagasc working on at present and at what stage are its communications with the Department?  Teagasc is the research wing of the Department.  What communications has it had since it published its report?  It is a fabulous report but what is the Department's position on it at this stage?  Has it started to buy in?  What is the next level the Department intends taking it to?  I assume the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has already looked at the Teagasc report.  I wonder about its position on it.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Donnellan give a brief summation of where the report stands in comparison with similar reports that would have been done in other countries?  I am coming from the angle of carbon leakage.  Mr. Donnellan has made the point that we have to take a global holistic approach.  If  we tick all the boxes, plant the entire country in forest, we will still not solve the global problem.  We will make it worse in cases because the food we produce so efficiently will be produced elsewhere with a far greater carbon footprint.  How does the report that Teagasc did on Ireland compare with a report that it would do on South America, eastern Europe or wherever?</p></speech>

The simple answer as to why emissions have increased in recent years is because we have had an increase in activity in the dairy sector and an increase in the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which are also an emission source.  Historically, one of the things we achieved was a very significant reduction in the amount of nitrogen-based fertiliser that is used.  That is forgotten to some degree, but over the period of ten or 15 years, we reduced the amount of nitrogen fertiliser we used in agriculture in Ireland by between 25% to 30%.  That was one of the contributors to the stabilisation in greenhouse gas emission reductions and even a reduction in some years in the level of greenhouse gas emissions that were achieved historically.</p> <p>  On the question of what Teagasc is doing in terms of communication, it is too much from my perspective.  During the summer when we launched the report, I travelled around the country in the height of the heatwave, with a broken air conditioning system in my car, presenting this report in a range of different forms.  We had a very large stakeholder event which was organised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Kilkenny with probably about 200 people at it, some of whom are in the Gallery today, where we discussed in detail what was in the report.  We also had briefings for smaller fora, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other interested stakeholders from different sections of the agrifood sector.  We have done a great deal in terms of communications.</p> <p>  The use of sugar beet for ethanol production was raised.  Different groups have expressed some interest in doing that in recent years.  I think it would depend on the yield.  It would depend on where the sugar beet plant was located as well as where the sugar beet was grown because one would want to economise on transportation costs.  It depends ultimately on the level of oil prices.  If oil prices were very high, the price of ethanol would be high and that would make for a product that is probably more likely to be profitable.  It depends on sets of circumstances, only some of which we have control over.</p> <p>  I was asked to contextualise the report in terms of what is happening internationally in terms of transparency.  From our work, the agriculture sector nationally is very transparent on where emissions could get to in the future and the potential solutions that will address these emissions.  While agriculture gets unfavourable mention in commentary about climate change, there is a very high level of understanding on greenhouse gas emissions.  I guess that greenhouse gas emissions are of interest in other countries.  A key point is that agricultural emissions as a share of total emissions in other EU member states in general is much lower.  The average in terms of greenhouse gas emissions produced by agriculture in other EU member states is only about 10%, whereas in Ireland, as members are aware, it is 33%.</p><p>That results in a different level of political emphasis on reducing agricultural emissions in Ireland by comparison with those in many other countries.  Obviously, in countries such as New Zealand agricultural emissions also comprise a very high share of the total.  Countries concerned about addressing agricultural emissions will be engaged in this type of MAC analysis.  It requires a good scientific understanding and capacity which not every country has.  The reality is that for our type of agriculture which is bovine based, we are in the premier league in terms of emissions efficiency.  At the same time, bovine agriculture generates more emissions than other forms of agriculture.  This is related to a point I made previously.  It would not be very sensible to try to engineer a situation where every country in the world had the same type of agricultural output.  There are natural reasons Ireland in largely involved in bovine agriculture.  They include climate and topography.  Ireland is never going to be like the Paris basin where the tillage sector is dominant.  In Ireland we just do not have the type of land, climate or farm size to switch dramatically to other types of agriculture.  Therefore, we will continue to have a bovine-based agriculture sector.  Therefore, it is inevitable in some sense that agricultural emissions will comprise a higher share of total emissions than in other European countries.</p></speech>

As we all know, agriculture and transport are very often portrayed as the villains, but it is important to state at the outset of the discussion that agriculture and farming reacted to demand.  Food demand stimulated growth in agriculture, to which farmers were only reacting.</p> <p>  Senator Daly has alluded to the period in which there was no growth and no opportunity for it in dairy production.  Therefore, we have a set of figures and information that probably do not reflect the true position on the expansion of dairy production, which was explosive.  The sector has been portrayed in a poor light, which is unfair.</p> <p>  Mr. Donnellan has mentioned what could really make a difference by way of mitigation in agriculture.  On estimated breeding value, EBV, we all know that better performing and more efficient animals help our case.</p> <p>  An interesting concept associated with forestry has been raised a number of times at this committee.  I made the point at an earlier meeting today that when forestry was mentioned to farmers, it was a little like saying to the those in attendance that if they made the windows of their houses smaller, they would be more efficient and conserve more heat.  That is radical and represents a long-term, significant change.  In a similar vein, planting a forest represents as radical a shift to farmers and I understand why they have difficulties with it.</p> <p>  Let me refer to something we sometimes miss in this debate.  Reference has been made to our ability to grow grass.  This is arguably the second best grass growing region in the world.  Actively growing productive grass would sequester a lot of carbon.  I am led to believe 15 cm of topsoil sequesters as much carbon as a tropical rainforest.  In other parts of the world forest plantation can present a challenge owing to arid conditions.  This is the result of carbon loading and the risk of fire.  As much as planting forestry is an option, has there been enough emphasis placed on actively managing productive farmland and pasture?  That, in itself, would sequester a lot of carbon.  Mr. Donnellan has mentioned the impact of fertiliser and referred to making the shift from calcium ammonium nitrate to urea.  I am led to believe this is subject to the pH value being right.  It is not a simple switch, as sometimes portrayed.  If we are to make a shift to using urea, especially urea with inhibitors, we have to manage pH values.  Therefore, more lime would have to be spread on land.  Is there a risk in some of these discussions that we will oversimplify solutions?  Is the matter not more complex than very often portrayed?</p></speech>

There is an issue in Ireland with fertiliser use in the sense that farmers probably do not place as much emphasis as they should on soil testing from an economic point of view.  It will identify issues such as pH level and the requirement to use lime.  There is a general issue in Ireland owing to not enough lime being applied to agricultural land.  The consequence is that fertiliser is less effective than it could be.  Lime is not particularly expensive and having the right pH level can actually reduce the amount of fertiliser required.  I do not believe it is particularly challenging for farmers to understand, but at the same time we would like many more farmers to engage in soil testing.  It is an area in which progress certainly needs to be made.</p> <p>  The question on the sequestration levels associated with grass and forestry is more scientific and beyond my personal remit.  As I am coming from an economic background, I cannot answer it for the Senator, but we may be able to follow up on it in written correspondence.</p></speech>

Having said that, we were quite active in the period before the milk quota was eliminated in emphasising to policymakers elsewhere in Europe that agricultural emissions in Ireland were going to increase in the short term because we knew that the dairy sector was going to expand considerably after the milk quota was removed.  The difficulty was that policymakers elsewhere in Europe were a little circumspect about it.  They did not believe expansion to the extent that it occurred was feasible.  They had a very poor picture of the dairy sector in Ireland from a competitiveness point of view, but we did as much as we could to put them right on the issue.</p><p> There was a question about carbon sequestration.  The main mechanism we have identified is forestry or afforestation.  It dwarfs all other carbon sequestration measures we have identified.</p><p> Carbon budgeting is a difficult issue.  I mentioned that there were 140,000 farms in Ireland.  How could we ever measure with certainty, by which I mean with 100% certainty, to the level of a breathalyser test or a blood test to measure alcohol levels, the level of emissions a farm was producing?  We can approximate the level of emissions it is producing based on the number of animals, fertiliser usage and so on.  We do this as part of the national farm survey.  However, we can never tell with 100% certainty what the level of emissions will be.  When we are talking about trying to reduce emissions, being 100% certain about the level of emissions being produced on a farm and in determining whether they have gone down is challenging and rather expensive.  It would have to be done for every farm in the country.  I suggest that, as a mechanism to address emissions, it could be prohibitively expensive.</p><p> It could also be difficult, given that the science is evolving all the time.  I could claim today that the emissions from farm X in 2015 were X amount.  However, if the science evolves, we might get a more accurate picture of what we believe the emissions were.  When that happens, it leads to a complete revision of all of the estimates made historically and we could have a revision of the calculations for a farm.  A revision could suggest the emissions from a farm in year X were actually higher than estimated.  That would be rather contentious for farmers.  We may have to say to them we figured the emissions were X amount but the science is telling us that they are X amount plus 5% and that they will have to work even harder to reduce them in the future.  That could be counterproductive from the perspective of creating trust and a buy-in if we want to reduce emissions.  It could be counterproductive to try to assess the level of emissions produced on each individual farm to that level of detail.  Expense and controversy are relevant in that respect.</p><p> Some people like organic farming.  It can deliver environmental benefits, but I contest the view that it actually reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  Ultimately, it means that there are lower emissions from a farm, but there is also lower output from it.  It is producing lower emissions, but it is also producing less food.  When we factor that in, ultimately, we may find that it is actually producing higher emissions per unit of output.  An organic farm potentially has a bigger carbon footprint &ndash; I trust committee members understand what I am saying &ndash; than a conventional farm.  Organic farming is not a silver bullet, but certainly it has a place.  That brings me back to my earlier comment that we need to think in an holistic way, not only on the single issue of climate change but also about what we want agriculture to deliver for the economy as a whole.  Organic farming is relevant, but seeing it as something we should pursue uniquely to address greenhouse gas emissions could be misplaced.</p></speech>

I said we were a little concerned about one area with respect to the report we had produced.  Persuading farmers to become involved in producing a new crop is challenging.  Like anyone who engages in an activity from a business perspective, farmers want to be confident that if they are to produce something, someone will buy it from them at a price they consider to be attractive or one they envisage is possible.  Who is going to buy it?  Where is the market for this produce?  That is a concern farmers would have.</p> <p>  Another concern farmers would have is acquiring the skill set required to grow the particular crop.  There is a misconception is some quarters than an individual farmer knows how to engage in any type of farming.  That is not the case.  A plumber cannot fix my car and a carpenter cannot plumb my house.  There are different types of farming and some skill sets are common to all forms, while others are far more specific.  There is also a skill set to be acquired.  That is another aspect.  Farmers would need to be confident that they could grow the crop and achieve the yield they would expect to achieve in order that the crop could be sold and have commercial value.  The supply chain is important in that respect.</p></speech>

Some have asked why in 1995 we were able to have 7 million cattle and now all of a sudden it is a problem.  Let us consider the reports, especially the most recent report from the Environmental Protection Agency.  We can see that the emissions from the herd are actually growing.  If I have it right, the EPA projects that by 2020 agriculture will account for 33% of emissions.  That figure is projected to rise to 34.5% by 2030.  If we combine Teagasc's presentation with the previous one and think about the graph in terms of where our problem is in not reaching our targets, agriculture is a major part of the picture and, in turn, the size of the herd.  This is something we have to tackle.  </p><p>Mr. Donnellan has said there is a desirable economic outcome from increasing the size of t he herd and the output from each bovine creature.  I accept that there is a desirable economic outcome for some farmers, but I do not believe that is the case for all of them.  In its last presentation Teagasc illustrated clearly to us that a significant tranche of farmers lived in poverty and struggled on low incomes.  Many of them find it difficult to cope with the pressure to increase their herd.  They have told me personally - I have also witnessed it - that it is coming from all quarters, including the Department, the IFA and the journals they read, including the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.  The view is increasing one's herd is the way to go, but that is not of great economic benefit to those who operate on a smaller scale and have the least income.  It is especially the case in the context of climate change and when we move from drought to flood and the fodder crisis when farmers have to watch the catastrophic deaths of animals on their farms.  That must be so awful for them because it is a major financial loss, as well as a major tragedy for them.  That cohort has to be thought about.</p><p>I am not convinced that it would be that difficult to convince farmers to shift to more sustainable methods of farming.  That is why I am keen to ask Mr. Donnellan about this matter further.  We are to hear a presentation later by the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  Has Teagasc held discussions with it?  Is it on its radar in the context of how farmers should move forward and how it should communicate and convince them to make changes in how they farm?</p><p>There is also the idea that we can grow the herd and at the same time reduce emissions.  That is a glaring contradiction, which I do not accept.  I know that Teagasc's representatives do not accept it either, but some think that because we are increasing the herd, we are simultaneously more efficient in reducing emissions.  There is a glaring contradiction.</p><p>Mr. Donnellan has said a lot about afforestation being a major part of the solution.  Let us suppose that is the case, but it is only a proposal, on which I am keen to hear a comment on from him.  Perhaps this is above his pay grade, but would it be sensible for the Government to pay farmers to engage in afforestation, rather than buying carbon offsets or engaging in carbon trading?</p></speech>

I said, specifically, that dairy farming was highly profitable.  That is not the only form of farming in Ireland that involves cattle and it is actually the minority.  There are about 17,000 farmers in Ireland who would describe themselves as dairy farmers.  Most cattle in Ireland are on what we call cattle farms, either suckler farms or farms that specialise in bringing cattle to a finishing age for slaughter.  In a broad sense, those cattle farms are not particularly profitable.  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on that.  Cattle farms tend to be smaller than dairy farms and some of them, historically, were dairy farms.  The change from dairy production came about because it was found that the work involved was too arduous or the farm was too small to provide an income.  Many of those cattle farmers also have off-farm employment as well.  Some of them certainly are limited in their income sources while for others the agricultural income is only one source of income and their spouse may be working or they may be working off-farm themselves.  There are also some farms where the income from agriculture is the only income source and it is not very large.  I agree those are the farms in acute difficulty from an income perspective.</p> <p>  Having said that, we have many cattle farms in this country.  It is difficult to see how we can address the issue of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions without involving all of the farmers in this country who have cattle on their farms, whether those are dairy cows or beef animals.  While cattle farms do not generate as many emissions as dairy farms, there are many more of them than dairy farms.  If it is left to the dairy sector alone to resolve the issue of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, then there is not going to be a very satisfactory outcome.</p> <p>  I am open to correction on this, but I believe we met the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association only about three or four weeks ago in our offices in Athenry in County Galway.  The question on afforestation is interesting.  In the ordinary run of things with the Common Agricultural Policy, if we are going to spend money on any new or different scheme, such as the one suggested involving an annual payment just to have trees existing indefinitely on farms, then the money for that has to come from somewhere.  The same applies in respect of increasing the level of money spent on such a scheme.  In that context, the money probably has to come from somewhere else within the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy envelope available to Ireland.  There are options available where the State can co-fund schemes to some degree.</p> <p>  That is one of the first difficulties.  If farmers were asked tomorrow whether they would like money for planting trees they would say "yes".  If they were told, however, that it was just going to be a reallocation of money they are already receiving for doing other things, then there might not be the same interest.</p></speech>

Without actually saying anything, perhaps Mr. Donnellan can give us the answers.  I see the Department as being very limited in what it is doing.  It seems to be completely hung up on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The next opportunity for anything to happen will be the new CAP in 2020.  We should be making sure now we get the right environmental aspects into that CAP, and all aspects of the CAP, to ensure it responds to the problems we have discussed.  If we do not do it then, it is going to be lost and we have to be realistic.  The only time farmers are going to respond is within the CAP.  Will Mr. Donnellan comment, insofar as he can, on how the Department deals with the research information it gets from Teagasc and how accepting it is of the role of Teagasc, because what Mr. Donnellan is saying is very useful and interesting?</p> <p>  On the graph Mr. Donnellan referred to earlier, in scenario one or two of those Mr. Donnellan said we should be examining, what would be the impact of a model where the herd was reduced by 500,000 along with that?  What difference would that make and what would the impact be on farmers?  That is a key consideration.  In the context of my own work as a Deputy in Donegal, cattle farmers do not make money and they depend on social welfare to make an income.  Farmers who keep sheep, however, do much better and there seems to be more money to be made from sheep, somewhat bizarrely.  Could farmers change over from cattle to sheep?  It seems that would have a positive impact on emissions and it is also a traditional type of farming that people are still involved in and know as well.  How feasible is that?</p></speech>

Just last week, we produced our income estimates for 2018 in agriculture and our forecasts for next year.  One of the things we highlighted at our conference last week was this progressive improvement over time in the profitability of sheep production.  The better sheep farmers, in particular, are returning fairly significant margins at this stage.  The difficulty in thinking about farmers transitioning into sheep production is that, compared with keeping beef animals, it is a labour-intensive activity.  I had discussions with staff in our own organisation in recent days, especially those who meet farmers and collect economic data from them.  One of the points they made was that sheep farmers are increasingly an ageing population.  Regarding those farmers, despite sheep production becoming more profitable relative to beef production, we might still continue to see them leaving sheep production.  That is purely because it is a labour-intensive sector and, as farmers get older, that aspect of the business makes it unattractive, especially if there is no successor to take over the farm.</p></speech>

Being a beef farmer is more compatible with having a full-time off-farm job than being a sheep farmer.  Sheep farming is particularly demanding in respect of labour at particular times of the year, especially at lambing time, and that is a consideration.</p> <p>  On reducing the herd by 500,000, Deputy Pringle did not clarify which herd he was talking about.  If it is the breeding herd, looking at scenario six from the chart, that involves a significant reduction in the size of the suckler herd, which is the less profitable part of cattle production in Ireland.</p><p>It would involve the lowest future level of cattle.  I will display on the screen the corresponding data with respect to emissions before the mitigation option is factored in.  As the dairy sector continues to expand, the smaller the suckler herd, the fewer total emissions from agriculture in general.  This is a contentious issue because although beef production is not particularly profitable, there has not been a significant exodus from suckler production.  The number of suckler cows has fallen by approximately 8% over the past three or four years but the figure is higher than we expected five or ten years ago.</p><p> On engagement, when I started working for Teagasc more than 20 years ago, evidence-based policymaking did not have the same foothold it currently does.  That probably holds true across Government.  Much of my background and training in terms of my work is derived from the US and the way economists engage with policymakers there.  It has been relatively successful in the sense that we have significant engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on issues it is unable to answer from an analytical perspective.  We provide that input to the Department.</p></speech>

Member states are being given greater discretion with respect to how they shape the Common Agricultural Policy to meet the specific needs of a member state.  At a European level in Brussels, the environmental dimension is centre stage with respect to agriculture.  The deliberations of this committee on agriculture are not unique in that regard.  The interaction of agriculture with the environment will be very prominent in the next CAP.</p></speech>

The station in Edenderry is currently co-fired.  What is the potential for Irish producers to supply that biomass?  What would be involved in developing a supply chain in the midlands, namely, counties such as Longford, Laois, Offaly and Westmeath?  I ask Mr. Donnellan to keep his answers brief because other witnesses are waiting to give evidence.</p> <p>  The willow scheme was not a success.  I do not know the detail of the matter and have been trying to gain an understanding of what happened.  Was the failure due to the type of land that was being used?  What crop should we use for biomass?</p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, today stated on a radio programme that emissions from agriculture could be halved if we did the right things.  Does Mr. Donnellan agree with that statement?</p></speech>

It is not an area on which I claim to have any expertise.  We may be able to revert to the committee with a response on that issue.  The earlier forays into the use of miscanthus were not especially successful for several reasons.  I would prefer to be able to provide the committee with a more comprehensive answer on that issue.</p> <p>  I do not know the timescale for halving agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.  As stated in the previous session, it is very difficult for us to know with any certainty what scientific breakthroughs will emerge in the coming ten, 15 or 20 years.  Based on current knowledge and technology, it is very hard to see how we could halve agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland without doing something very differently in terms of the type of agriculture we have.  The only way to achieve that reduction by 2030 or 2040 in the absence of any dramatic scientific breakthrough would be for the agriculture sector to be far less focused on the bovine sector in favour of crop-based agriculture, for example.  It is difficult to see how that would materialise.</p></speech>

How realistic is it for sugar beet to be used a covering crop for up to four or five months of the year?  Typically, there was a covering crop from late June until December.</p></speech>

The specific example offered in the report addresses the use of mustard as the cover crop.  Some farmers in Ireland still grow sugar beet or fodder beet as an animal feed.  If the Deputy is asking about sugar beet as a crop that will not be used for animal feed, the issue might come back to the supply chain.  It depends on what the crop will ultimately be used for.</p></speech>

I have some brief questions.  I have read the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, FAPRI, model outlined by Teagasc and questioned members of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who appeared before the committee on it.  A representative of Teagasc may have been present.  The model is quite bleak in terms of what we are trying to achieve across all of the scenarios that have been mentioned and the mitigation measures.  Where is Ireland on the graph referred to by Mr. Donnellan?  Towards the conclusion of his statement he outlined that there is mitigation potential but it is only on paper.  What substantive action is being taken in that regard?  Are any mitigation measures being taken in an attempt to reduce the curve that he outlined?  The FAPRI model is quite bleak when one takes the entire sector into account.</p></speech>

This is an unfortunate reality in terms of some of the projections we have produced from an economic perspective.</p><p>The issue at present is that the dairy sector has expanded quite rapidly over recent years and the extent of that expansion over a five or six-year period is never going to be repeated.  We are never going to have the percentage increase in the size of the dairy sector ever again, in my view.  That was the handbrake coming off and the engine running at full revs.  The situation we have seen in recent years is that emissions are going up in aggregate, and emissions efficiency is improving.  The carbon footprint per unit of product is actually improving, but at a lower rate than the growth in the total amount of what is being produced.  That is why the emissions continue to go up, and not because nobody cares or nobody is doing anything.  It is more on the basis that we are producing more.  There is a global requirement to produce more food.  The issue ultimately that we have to understand in some sense the extent to which Ireland is going to contribute to meeting the increase in global food demand.  Global food demand in terms of growth is very high.  My expectation is that the percentage increase in production in a developed country like Ireland is not going to match the level of growth internationally.  Developed countries themselves will probably have to service some of that growth.</p><p> We are somewhat unique in Europe in the sense of our agriculture sector producing more output, and significantly more so in the case of dairy production over recent years.  No other country in Europe has done something like that.  We are different.  Whether it is a good different or a bad different is a question for policymakers to decide because the development that has happened in the dairy sector has been quite valuable from an economic perspective.  It is not desirable from a greenhouse gas emissions perspective, but as politicians know very well, there are multiple objectives that we are trying to achieve across the economy.  It is not all about greenhouse gas mitigation or economic growth in the agriculture sector.  There has to be a medium found that balances those different objectives.</p></speech>

The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society is the umbrella body for the co-operative movement in Ireland.  We represent a range of co-operative enterprises operating across many aspects of the rural economy, including dairy processing and milk purchasing societies, livestock marts, breed societies, animal health and artificial insemination, AI, horticulture, forestry, financial services and other rural-based societies.</p> <p>  In a few short months, ICOS will mark its 125th anniversary.  I make reference to this milestone merely to illustrate that the co-operative business model is a sustainable one that has served the interests of Irish farmers, their families and rural communities very well across many generations and through some very difficult times.  There is no doubt that Brexit is at the forefront of all our minds at present, and in the most recent developments over recent days, the uncertainties are there as strong as they were two years ago.</p> <p>  It is no exaggeration to state, however, that environmental sustainability, be it climate change, ammonia emissions, water quality and biodiversity, are of equal if not greater importance to the agrifood sector.</p><p>The recent special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change related to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees is extremely stark.  It calls for rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.  At ICOS, we strongly believe that the co-operative model will be an important vehicle to assist the rural economy with future challenges in this area, for example, through the development of community-based renewable energy projects.</p><p> The ancillary recommendations by the Citizens' Assembly rightly recognises the importance of agriculture to the economy, especially to the rural economy.  The agrifood sector provided 174,000 jobs or almost 8% of total employment in 2017.  Total agrifood exports were worth &euro;13.5 billion in 2017, with exports of dairy and dairy ingredients valued at &euro;4.02 billion.  An analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young has indicated that additional milk production equates to 90 cent of additional economic benefit for every additional litre of milk produced.  This multiplier effect is due to spending by co-operatives and on farms, spending by service providers to the dairy industry, and spending by those employed in the dairy sector.  The analysis concludes that additional milk production from 2016 to 2020 will result in a &euro;2.7 billion benefit to the economy or &euro;540 million annually.  There is simply no other industry generating wealth, investment and jobs to this significant scale in rural Ireland.</p><p> Dairy farming provides a sustainable livelihood, despite extreme volatility in income from one year to the next.  It is a legitimate aspiration by farmers to develop the potential of their farm enterprises fully to secure better incomes and to provide better futures for their families.  That said, the dairy industry acknowledges the importance of climate change and our responsibility to develop in a sustainable manner following decades of stagnation due to the imposition of quotas that severely impeded the sector and disadvantaged thousands of farm families.  The Irish dairy industry exports to a multiple of Ireland&rsquo;s national population a highly nutritious food product recognised as the most carbon efficient in Europe.  This is because Ireland&rsquo;s temperate climate is perfect for growing grass, with a long grazing season.  This also enables superior animal welfare conditions on Irish farms.  Globally, 80% of milk is produced in confinement-based production systems, in contrast to Ireland where cows are at grass for up to 300 days a year.</p><p> Furthermore, 95% of dairy farmers are participating in the sustainable dairy assurance scheme under Origin Green, which requires the completion of a carbon footprint every 18 months.  The sustainable dairy assurance scheme has enabled Ireland to position itself as a partner of choice globally for sustainably produced and quality assured dairy products.  The inclusion of the carbon navigator tool makes the Origin Green programme unique from a global perspective.  It provides the average carbon figure for production on the farm and also indicates where the greatest potential saving can be made in both carbon emissions and, importantly, in financial savings.  In doing so, it has mainstreamed the message that carbon efficiency goes hand in hand with economic efficiency.</p><p> As an industry, we fully adhere to the principle of sustainable intensification, as set out in the European Council conclusions from October 2014.  These conclusions also recognise the lower mitigation potential of agriculture.  The European Council further acknowledges the need to ensure coherence in policy between the EU&rsquo;s food security and climate change objectives.</p></speech>

Climate smart agriculture has three main objectives: to increase agricultural productivity and incomes sustainably, in view of the responsibility of the agrifood sector to provide more food for a growing population; to adapt and build resilience to climate change, which is particularly pertinent considering the weather extremes of 2018; and to reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions, or both, where possible.  In line with recommendations 5 and 6 by the Citizens' Assembly, we agree that sensible financial tools are required to stimulate widespread uptake of on-farm renewable energy projects, including biogas from anaerobic digestion and the installation of solar panels on farm buildings.  ICOS also urges the Government to prioritise the establishment of community-led and co-operative projects in the area of renewable energy and microgeneration.  The reality is that mitigation in agriculture is limited.  There are no quick fixes.  That is why we must work collectively to ensure that mitigation in agriculture is maximised.  This will require a sustained and concerted effort by industry, farmers and the Government.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Bridget Murphy, who will answer some of the members' questions.  My other colleague in the Public Gallery is Mary Rooney from Leitrim, who is chair of Cavan west.</p> <p>  The simple truth about climate change is that we have ignored it for too long.  Our beef, dairy, sheep and timber plantations have made a significant contribution to the modern Irish economy but, unfortunately, this contribution has come at a very high cost of loss of biodiversity, loss of soil fertility, considerable air and water pollution from chemical fertiliser, and a significant contribution to greenhouse gas in our atmosphere.  In fact, if climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution costs were included in the true cost of producing beef, dairy and sheepmeat, much of Ireland's agrifood sector would instantly lose its economic viability and green image.  We talk about having to farm this way to feed the world's growing population, but at the same time we are struggling to find markets for our beef and dairy and the farmer is no better off for all his work.  We must rethink how we feed the world.  It is no use doing so at the expense of our land, water, air and the other non-human species with whom we share the planet.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, farmers are responsible for many things, not least feeding ourselves and the world's growing population and being the country's first line of defence against climate change.  We will do this at the same time as restoring biodiversity and soil fertility, eliminating our pollution, and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  This is a huge task, and to meet it, the role of farmers will undergo massive change.  The INHFA's approach in tackling this task is led by common sense more than other more sophisticated agriculture models.  This is not to say that science and technology are not important in our approach, but making the right choices about what we are facing requires wisdom, a vision for the future, values and the fact that we choose to care about the farmers, our environment, health, culture and identity, and our future.  We support the approach that understands farmers are not just producing commodities but are taking care of the health of society by providing natural food.  They are taking care of the health of the ecosystem by preserving biodiversity and environmental services.  They are also taking care of the health of rural communities by generating an adequate income for their families while preserving the cultural heritage of society in terms of tradition and historical landscapes.</p> <p>  We will need new tools, skills and resources.  We must have upskilled Departments that work much more closely together.  Bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, will have to be far better funded and resourced.  Others such as Coillte will require a new remit and a board with environmental and change management expertise.  Schools, agriculture colleges and universities will require new curricula.  The INHFA would like to see a great deal more research undertaken on land use and management in the uplands and designated lands.  More importantly, we want those who are deciding what to do to speak to us, especially farmers who farm mountain commonage and Natura-designated land and valuable carbon-rich soils.  Let our inherited knowledge and direct experience of these high nature value areas help to design the programme of schemes that will deliver on the task we have as well as provide a livelihood for farm families into the future.</p></speech>

Mr. Lorcan McCabe sends his apologies that he is unable to attend.</p><p>I am pleased to get the opportunity to respond to the Citizens' Assembly climate action and mitigation strategy.  The recommendations that are of relevance to us are Nos. 11 and 13, which have a significant effect on the dairy and livestock sectors.  Recommendation 11 suggests that a carbon tax would be applied to farmers based on carbon output.  That would have a disastrous effect not alone on the dairy and livestock sectors but also on the rural economy, given the impact of agriculture on rural areas.</p><p> We must establish a few facts.  The first is that global demand for food is increasing as the population is increasing.  Dairy and meat remain main constituents of our diet.  Ireland has been proven scientifically to be the most carbon-efficient producer of milk in the world and the fourth or fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef.  They are facts.  Mr. Donnellan spoke earlier about Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  Irish agriculture is on course to deliver the aspirations in that regard.  When those ambitions and goals were set out, a commitment was given to the primary producer in order that they would drive forward for the betterment of the rural economy and the industry.  We cannot envisage an unfair levy being applied.  To apply a tax on the producer would completely undermine our ability to export.  We are unique in that we export 85% to 90% of our agricultural produce.  People need food and it would be unacceptable to be paying a liability and for the food to be produced in a less efficient country.  Given that our climatic aspirations and liabilities are a global issue and not just a geographic one - it is not a case of Ulster against Munster or Connacht against Leinster - we need to be in a position to produce food in the most efficient countries.  That would have a significant impact on the viability of family farms.</p><p> Recommendation 13 concerns afforestation and organic farming.  I was interested to hear the experts from Teagasc say that organic farming can have a high carbon footprint for each unit of food produced.  We must remember that.  Another drawback with organic farming is that it is very much a niche market and is easily oversupplied.  Not alone would it be environmentally unsustainable, it would be economically unsustainable if there were a surge towards organic production.  The Government must incentivise and encourage more positive land use to mitigate climate change.  At the same time, however, we must be mindful of the social as well as the economic issues associated with forestry.  Previously forestry was stigmatised due to poor felling practices where eyesores were created in rural areas.</p><p> Methane and nitrous oxide are the main greenhouse gas contributors from the agriculture sector.  For a farm to remain environmentally sustainable, there needs to be economic sustainability.  Unfortunately, in the debate thus far this afternoon there has been very little discussion about economic sustainability.  For that to happen, there needs to be an education process for food consumers around the globe.  They must know what they are getting and where they are getting it.  People get high-quality, environmentally sustainable produce from an Irish and European perspective but the bridge must be crossed in terms of the education curve.</p><p> We have heard about measures that can be introduced to improve efficiency from the point of production per food unit.  The economic breeding index, EBI, and the use of slurry and fertiliser are important in that regard.  Farmers have been active in that regard with the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, resulting in a significant level of applications for low-emissions slurry spreading.  There are many opportunities to use slurry and to develop solar and wind energy that are underutilised.  It is unfortunate that they were overlooked in the recent budget.  Our European counterparts can make as much from the roof of the barn as they can from the basement, and a third of their profit comes from the middle.  There is an opportunity.</p><p> I will reiterate the four critical points.  We are carbon efficient from a dairy and beef perspective.  The carbon stored in grasslands needs to be fully incorporated into the greenhouse gas emissions abatement strategy.  Fertiliser and slurry management needs to be incentivised through schemes such as the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, to bring our lime pH up to the optimum level.  Energy generation from renewable sources must be promoted.  There is an opportunity to do that annually as well as through CAP reform.  We will be pleased to take questions.</p></speech>

The European Commission's science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre, has confirmed that Ireland's dairy farmers have the lowest carbon footprint for milk in the EU and our beef farmers are among the top five most carbon-efficient.  That is important at a time of increasing demand for these types of proteins, produced sustainably by farmers in Ireland.  It did not just happen.  It is underpinned by our grass-based model of food production.</p> <p>  Ireland is to the fore in targeting CAP funding to address the climate challenge.  For example, 87% of the measures in the rural development programme are focused on environmental protection and addressing climate change.  The IFA's smart farming programme is run in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  That has highlighted a climate impact reduction in emissions of 9% and a reduction in costs of &euro;7,000.</p> <p>  The measures included in GLAS and its predecessor, the rural environmental protection scheme, also highlight the work farmers are doing.  The schemes promote the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, green cover establishment and low-emission manure spreading techniques.  Almost 50,000 farmers are in the GLAS programme, but it is oversubscribed.  I strongly encourage the Government to reopen the scheme to allow maximum participation.</p> <p>  In addition, every one of the 130,000 farmers in receipt of a basic payment under CAP has to meet stringent EU requirements to keep their farms in good condition, including compliance obligations regarding the management of soils, hedgerows, water courses and fertiliser management.  Farmers are subject to onerous inspections to ensure adherence to these obligations.</p> <p>  CAP also delivers for consumers, ensuring that the sector provides a secure supply of top-quality safe food, produced to the highest standards at affordable prices.  A fully funded CAP budget is critically important for Ireland in respect of its farmers, economy, jobs and consumers, as well as contributing to environmental protection and combating climate change.  The IFA has called on the Government, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to insist that the CAP budget for Ireland is increased to cover the extra costs and to cover inflation.  As part of Bord Bia's Origin Green programme, more than 200,000 carbon assessments have been completed.  Uniquely, Ireland is the only country in the world that measures, monitors and manages carbon from farm to fork at a national level.</p> <p>  Extra carbon taxes are not the answer.  Almost &euro;3 billion has been collected in this country in carbon taxes since 2010.  Despite that, national climate emissions have increased.  Therefore, the carbon tax has failed to make any environmental difference.  Indeed, research work conducted by the ESRI indicates that increasing the annual carbon tax take to more than &euro;1 billion may reduce emissions by just 4.7%.  While the Citizens' Assembly suggests ring-fencing carbon taxes, I note the significant reluctance of Departments and agencies such as the ESRI when they addressed the committee on this proposed hypothecation.  Regardless, the IFA will continue to oppose the imposition of further carbon taxes on farming.  Environmental taxes such as the plastic bag levy worked because there were alternatives.</p><p>Carbon taxes on farming represent an additional cost on production with little or no extra benefits.  The IFA supports the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on carbon taxes which states that in place of a carbon tax that penalises farmers for failing to meet emissions targets, the application of additional incentives for farmers who sequester carbon may be a more effective approach in delivering change.</p><p> This year, Teagasc published 27 measures as part of its analysis.  Those measures have the potential to reduce climate emissions by 9 megatonnes.  The delivery of this requires intergovernmental and inter-State agency co-operation.  It is a solid piece of work that can be a roadmap for the future.  The IFA is also seeking a fairer share of the value food chain so we can reinvest in the climate proofing of our farm businesses.  After all, it is hard for farmers to be green when they are in the red.  In Ireland, this requires the Government to appoint an independent retail regulator and to support fully the European Commissioner's initiative to eliminate unfair trading practices.  We are also calling on the Government to back French proposals that aim to eliminate food imports from unsustainable sources such as the Mercosur countries where beef is produced in the Amazon.  Greater support for community and farm-scale renewables, including anaerobic digestion, must be put in place.  This requires the Government to introduce a guaranteed feed-in tariff model, increased grid access and the development of a regional biomass trade and logistics centre.  We will continue to work with the EPA to maximise cost savings and climate improvements in our smart farming programme.</p><p> I ask members of the committee to consider carefully the recommendations included in its report and not simply default to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  This is particularly important in light of Ms Justice Laffoy's comments to the committee in September when she stated: "In truth, if we had time we could have had more information on the agricultural sphere and, in particular, on how various parts of the sector are and would be affected."  The committee has taken the time and afforded a range of stakeholders, including the IFA, the opportunity to outline the complexity of addressing the climate challenge and to ensure Ireland's carbon-efficient model of food production is not compromised.</p><p> As president of the IFA I am proud to stand up for the agrisector, which is Ireland's indigenous sector exporting food, drink and forest products worth in excess of &euro;13.5 billion in 2017 and providing direct or indirect employment to 300,000 people and 130,000 farmers.  It has been a key driver in Ireland's economic recovery and it is the backbone of the economic activity throughout rural Ireland.  From a carbon efficiency perspective, we are best in class.  We seek a more complete and nuanced set of solutions for agriculture that safeguard Ireland's climate-efficient model of food production while providing innovative opportunities for farm families and rural Ireland to climate-proof their futures.  We recognise there are challenges for all of us and agriculture is up to that challenge.  We ask of the committee that its climate proposals be based on logic and take full account of the potential economic and social impact on farm families and the wider rural community.</p></speech>

Perhaps they feel their voices have not been heard on these matters.  We welcome their presence at the committee meeting.</p> <p>  Before I go to members for questions, I propose that members direct their questions to a specific organisation rather than to all four organisations.  Everybody will have a number of questions.  Members should put their questions to the representative of a specific organisation.</p> <p>  I have a number of brief questions.  My question for ICOS is about the co-operative potential.  I was very interested in what was said about the potential for co-ops and biogas.  Do the witnesses see it as a real alternative?  Is there a lot of potential in terms of second and third incomes for farmers?  It is not just the premium from beef and milk but perhaps also from energy.  Has ICOS looked at models in any other countries that could be held up as an example?  Will the witnesses keep their answers brief?</p></speech>

One of the positive things that came out of the address in Poland this week was a recognition of the co-operatives getting involved in this.  We know there is ring-fencing of 10% with regard to access to the auction for the electricity input that will be generated from the solar development in particular.  We believe there is scope for co-operatives to be set up where the community would benefit from it.  There is huge potential for that.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman asked if we know something else that happened.  There are small towns and villages in Germany that have maximised the co-operative model and have delivered very high levels of generation capacity.  In Freiburg, which is near the Black Forest area of Germany, they are 130% self-sufficient in energy generation meaning they export 30% over and above what they require.  It is something that could operate in Ireland just as well as it operates there.  The dairy industry in Holland was able to support farmers there in microgeneration of roof-based solar power.  Without a doubt there are opportunities.</p></speech>

One is about GLAS.  Mr. Healy mentioned it in his presentation.  There are 50,000 farmers involved in it.  Mr. Healy said the scheme should be reopened.  There are two parts to my question.  From an IFA point of view, does it have a significant positive environmental impact?  Would it be possible to bring another 50,000 of the 130,000 farmers in the State into it?</p> <p>  I have a question on hedgerows, which are a bugbear of mine.  I heard what the IFA and farming organisations have said.  They put forward a very strong and coherent argument on the production of beef and milk.  It is the most sustainable in Europe.  There are some things that could be done a little bit better on farms to try to improve things such as the sequestering value of farms.  One thing is hedgerows.  There is a programme of reinstatement.  One has to reinstate what one takes out.  We all know that when one takes out a hedgerow, it is not something that can be recreated in one, two, three or four years.  I am especially concerned about the practice of cutting them down to about a foot high.  Why can we not go back to the practice of what used to be referred to as breasting ditches, in other words, cutting the outsides?  I asked one of the IFA's members about this recently.  The person will remain nameless.  I asked him why people were doing it.  I was curious about it.  I noticed a lot of it happening around Ballymena and places like that.  He said it was a Protestant thing.  He will remain nameless.  I am curious about it.  For the life of me, I cannot understand it.  Apart from being able to see someone's farm or show off how tidy and neat my farm is, I fail to see, as a rural Deputy, the benefits of cutting them down to one or two feet high.  I will keep the name of the IFA member secret.</p></speech>

The first question was about the impact of GLAS.  Perhaps I left it out so my presentation would stay within the time allowed but nine out of ten measures in the rural development schemes have climate mitigating actions within them.  I will read out some numbers.  In the GLAS scheme there are 357 km of arable grass margins.</p><p>There are more than 238,000 ha in low-input permanent pasture, almost 6,500 ha of minimum tillage, just shy of 13,000 km of water courses protected from bovine animals, 62 km of riparian margins, and 46,000 ha of traditional hay meadow.</p><p> The Acting Chairman mentioned the hedgerows.  Mr. Cooney might be better on this.  I think there are 1.4 million m of hedgerows.</p></speech>

Hedgerows have also been a protected feature, as part of CAP, since 2018.  It is now against the law to remove a hedgerow unless one has an equal amount of hedgerow planted somewhere else on the farm.  If one looks at the rest of Europe, we have a far higher percentage of hedgerows than most other European countries.  There was talk about the Paris Basin earlier on.  There are not too many hedgerows there.</p> <p>  There are a couple of measures in GLAS for maintenance of hedgerow.  One is laying of hedgerows which rejuvenates a hedge that has been only grown up recently, in the past 20 years.  It thickens it up.  There is also a measure called "coppicing of hedgerow" where a hedgerow grows up into trees and there are large gaping holes in the bottom of it where livestock can walk.  That is one of the measures where it is cut at approximately 6 in. high and it grows up into a nice thick hedge again.</p> <p>  I understand the Acting Chairman refers to where a hedgerow is trimmed every year.  There would be a very small percentage of those around the country.  It is predominately roadside hedges that are done like that and it is done on a road safety basis.  That is the logic for doing them.</p></speech>

This is an important meeting.  I concur with the comments that the farming organisations and agriculture in general did not get a fair hearing in the Citizens' Assembly.  I was one who asked Ms Justice Laffoy here last September the question Mr. Healy mentioned earlier, that is, if she had more time, would she have taken on board some of the comments the agriculture sector may have had.  It is important that everybody is here today.</p> <p>  It is also important to point out the contribution the agriculture sector makes to the economy in Ireland.  We saw this during the ten difficult years in this country.  The value of agriculture exports have increased from &euro;7.5 billion to &euro;13 billion in the past year.  It could be argued that had it not been for agriculture building the foundation at that time, the economy might not be as good as it is today.</p> <p>  Reference was made in two of the reports, those of the ICMSA and the IFA, to the carbon tax issue.  Has an economic analysis has been done by the ICMSA on the potential implication of a carbon tax being imposed on agriculture?</p></speech>

From a dairy farmer's perspective, we are the most efficient in Europe.  Our concern is that if a carbon tax is imposed on our sector, the consequences will be that it will make us less competitive on the global market and shift production from a carbon-efficient region such as Ireland to a less carbon-efficient region in some other part of the world and make the climate situation worse rather than better.  The point we would make strongly is that a carbon tax does not work from the point of view of climate change because there will be different carbon taxes in different countries and our dairy sector could be targeted unfairly.</p></speech>

In that regard, what could we be doing to make sure that will not be a difficulty for the future?</p></speech>

That will give Deputy Deering an idea of it.</p> <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, Irish farm incomes are always a problem.  We have fought for many years to ensure that the deal with Mercosur is not done.  We have listened to European politicians tell Irish farmers to get real about climate change and at the same time they are trying to push through deals between Europe and countries such as Brazil, the efficiency of whose farmers is four times less than ours.  The figures show that it takes 18 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef across Europe and it takes 80 kg of CO2 to produce 1 kg of beef in Brazil.  That shows what we need to do.</p> <p>  We have stated clearly that climate change is not only an Irish issue.  Listening to some commentators in this country, one would imagine that it is only an Irish issue.  We heard Mr. Donnellan talk about the increase in demand for food and the increase in the population in the future.  There will be increased demand for protein products and dairy and beef are strong protein products.  If we are not producing the dairy and beef here in Ireland, which is recognised as the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy product and in the top five in Europe, to satisfy the extra demand, it will be produced in a less efficient country.  From where I stand, that goes against improving climate change and carbon emissions.  The point needs to be put across strongly that food should be produced in the countries where it is most efficient to do so, particularly if there is demand there for it.</p></speech>

An article in yesterday's <i>Farming Independent</i>regarding the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, began: &quot;Suckler herds can reduce their Greenhouse Gas emissions by 10pc over the next 20 years if they use genetics to produce profitable and carbon efficient cows.&quot;  I welcome that statement.  The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, has been one of the most efficient and best programmes introduced.  It is the only one of its kind in Europe whereby there is the collection of data developing the maternal trait, getting the information about the suckler cow and feeding it back.  It can be most advantageous for the future.</p><p>On my last count, 25,000 suckler farmers are in the BDGP.  In the recent budget, there was another scheme introduced, the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, which will be most beneficial in that regard as well.  There are many more than 25,000 farmers in the country.  What can the IFA do to encourage more farmers to join this scheme in the event that the pilot is opened up in the future and so that it will form a significant part of the next Common Agricultural Policy?</p></speech>

It was fully subscribed.  Deputy Deering correctly stated that just shy of 25,000 farmers participate in it.  There are 550,000 cows involved in it.  It was a good scheme that was probably sold and explained badly to farmers at the start, and despite that, farmers showed their willingness to get involved in it.  It is important that they are for a number of reasons.</p><p>Many of the measures help the environment.  As direct payments account for more than 100% of the average farm income on those farms, obviously it is important.  Even going back to the emissions per calorie of food, that has been reduced on Irish farms by 14% since 2013.  The target is that it will be reduced by 25% by 2030.</p></speech>

The only way that can be done is by a communications and education process about the role played by agriculture in rural Ireland and the whole economy.  We need to educate those who may not be as aware of what has been achieved in efficiencies in the beef industry and other areas which have assisted with climate change.  How do the three farming organisations believe they might be able to improve communications and education?</p> <p>  Had it not been for Brexit, there would be much more discussion about CAP reform.  There will be a great deal of talk about it, however, over the next two years.  It plays a significant part in the sustainability of the agricultural economy.  Looking at the different income streams, 75% of farmers&rsquo; incomes are from Europe.  I like Mr. Healy using my line, &ldquo;You cannot go green if you are in the red&rdquo;.  It is important that the agriculture budget is maintained.  What do the farming organisations see as the main elements that will be required in the new CAP to ensure we are not just efficient and sustainable but can contribute to tackling climate change?</p></speech>

We sought an increase to 1.3% of gross national income, GNI, from member states.  It was increased to 1.1% but we saw the new initiatives, for example, migration, defence and security, eat up more than that 10% budget increase.  We talk about a 5% decrease.  Taking the European Commission&rsquo;s proxy figure of 2% for inflation, we came up with a decrease of 17% to 18% in CAP for farmers.  It is imperative that CAP is fully funded.</p> <p>  In 1984, CAP was over 60% of the EU budget.  Now, it is at around 30%.  By the end of the next CAP round, it will be at 28% of total funding.  It has been a successful policy.  While people might look at it as only a benefit for farmers, when it was introduced, over 30% of the average household income was spent on food.  Today, that is somewhere between 10% and 12%.  It has probably had more benefits for the non-farmer than for the farmer.</p> <p>  The one original aim for farmers in which it has failed, however, is ensuring a viable income for the farming sector.  Borrowing Deputy Deering&rsquo;s line again, it is hard to expect us to be green if we are in the red.  The average farm income across Europe is only 40% of the average income in other sectors.  Farm incomes are indexed for inflation and there is a significant amount of extra costs to get that CAP payment.</p></speech>

They have to be results-based and have targets given to them to deliver results.  There are targets put on farmers in different schemes and they have to achieve various thresholds to get their payments.</p> <p>  Deputy Deering referred to imports from Brazil.

There is slippage in itself given the cost of inflation over the past 30 years.  We would like to see the Pillar 2 rural environmental schemes practicable for commercial farms.  There is a pH issue with our lime levels in soil where only 10% of soils are at an optimum pH level.  That has an effect on water quality and fertiliser usage.  That needs to be got right.  There needs to be a funding mechanism, be it through the Exchequer or CAP reform, for our renewables policy where we can see Ireland come back into the equation from a renewable energy point of view.</p> <p>  There needs to be education for the consumer.  Origin Green has educated farmers and made them environmentally aware as well as compliant with animal records and so forth.  We need to bridge that gap.  There is probably a place for Ornua and Bord Bia with some of the larger multinational companies to educate the consumer.  If they want top-quality and environmentally friendly food products, they need to pay an economically sustainable price to ensure a farm family can have a viable living.</p></speech>

The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society identified the need for additional support to knowledge share.  Will the representatives expand on that?  Would it be an advisory type programme or a form of sectoral training?  Are they aware of a similar model in another country that could highlight best practice?</p> <p>  I do not want farmers to be the fall guys.  We are here in a sense of co-operation.  On hedgerows, GLAS was discontinued because the nurseries were unable to meet demand.  Importing hedge saplings was not an option as it ran the risk of bringing in plant diseases.  There was a failure to guarantee the supply before the scheme was put in place.  What needs to be put in place to ensure supply before a scheme of funding is in place and farmers sign up to it?</p> <p>  The demand for protein, be it beef or dairy products, is increasing.  If it increases and we stand still, other countries will come in with their imports.  We cannot expand any further, however.  Teagasc stated the emissions from the cattle population are up and the population is due to increase.</p><p>This probably goes against Mr. Healy's product, but what does he think about diversifying and suggesting that we decrease some of our protein intake for our health?  In terms of dietary intake, it was popular until the 1950s and 1960s to have meat on the dinner table only twice or three times per week.  </p><p> I love the quote from Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, which states, "We need to rethink how we feed the world, for it is no use doing so at the expense of our land, water, air and biodiversity."  What Government supports do those witnesses believe are available to re-skill us to rethink how we feed ourselves and other people?  That is in the same vein of diversification.  Is there any data on the available Government supports of which the witnesses spoke that reflect positive outcomes?</p></speech>

We hit our targets for the planting of hedgerows very early and we hit the targets in the GLAS programme as well.  The funding was used up.</p> <p>  Demand is there for dairy and beef protein products.  That is what farmers are doing.  We are supplying a market that is there and looks likely to grow.  As I said, we are the most carbon efficient producers of dairy products in the EU and in the top five in beef.

We are producing 40% more from farms at the moment than we were in 1990 but the amount of carbon being produced has flatlined.  We are at the same level as 1990.  We are down in carbon emissions from agriculture since 1998.  Figures came out the other day.  Emissions were 22.4 million tonnes in 1998 and that figure was 20.2 million tonnes last year.  There is a lot of very efficient work being done and that is a result of science, research and genetics and we can build further on that, particularly in light of the Teagasc report that was launched in June.</p></speech>

We have a roadmap but it is about communicating these steps clearly to farmers.</p> <p>  One thing that should be pursued is milk recording.  Less than half the farmers in the country are milk recording.  It is a logical thing to do because it improves their efficiencies in so many ways but we need to work a little better to spread the message that this technology should be adopted and farmers can increase their productivity while reducing their emissions.</p></speech>

We said, in our longer document, that the INHFA approach will be led by common sense, as opposed to more sophisticated agricultural models because neither the support nor the research are there.  That is not to say the science and technology are not important to our approach, however making the right choices about what we are facing requires wisdom and vision for future values and the fact that we choose to care more about the farm and the environment etc.  Unfortunately, there is a shortage of research into the complex socioecological systems underpinning agriculture in Ireland and we need to proceed on that basis with common sense.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan made a suggestion earlier, when Mr. Donnellan was speaking, about land use and in some senses a lot of research needs to be done in that area because it is quite critical to start understanding exactly what we are working with within ecosystems, rather than firing ahead with what we have.  Traditionally the practice has been to get the pH up and throw a bunch of fertiliser at it and make something out of that land.  That might work very well on lower land where there are more established grass systems, but for us, up in the high nature value areas, throwing a whole bunch of lime at a mountain is not going to make much difference and we certainly do not throw a huge amount of fertiliser up there.</p> <p>  Essentially, we need much more research.  We called for that as well, saying that we would like to see a lot more research undertaken on land use and management in the upland and designated areas.  It is an area that needs more exploring.  Traditionally, we have got where we are because the research has been focused on a different angle.  Perhaps we need that spotlight to shift and it really starts with understanding what land we have, what can be produced from it, where is the best place to locate certain things and move on from there.</p></speech>

I had to go up to the Chamber for a contribution on the European Council debate but, as it happened, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin approached me and informed me that he had made some sort of deal to extend this D&aacute;il by another year.  I asked, in my contribution, what are we going to use that year for?  We should use it for consensus on certain key issues and I hope we can get consensus on the key elements of the new national energy climate action plan that has to be delivered by next year.</p> <p>  For the farming sector, the timing could not be better in the sense that, in getting ready for it, we have to have a vision of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Extending that vision of new politics, I hope the environmental movement can sit down and talk with the various farming bodies to see how we can achieve both better pay for farmers and a restoration of nature in our land.  Mr. Healy was talking about 1990.  Since then, we have lost pristine water.  Could we pay farmers to help restore that?</p> <p>  The World Wildlife Fund report came out last month saying we have lost 60% of invertebrate wildlife in the world and that has happened in Ireland the same as elsewhere.  Could we pay farmers to help restore that in this consensus that we seek?</p> <p>  Mr. Healy said that things have not changed since 1990.  One thing that has not changed since 1990 is that most farmers, I understand, are getting the same price for the produce that their mother or father got in 1990.  Could we change the power structures in Irish retailing and the power of the PLCs to start changing that as a precondition?</p> <p>  If we were to do all that, we should also pay farmers, under CAP, for turning the current situation.  No matter what is said, the physical reality is that our emissions went up 3% last year and roughly the same the year before.  It is a hell of a challenge to turn that around, but we must collectively turn it around.</p> <p>  The Green Party is in a really interesting place.  Our colleagues in Germany, Belgium and Holland, the people who are going to be paying this budget, are on the rise.  I would love to bring over my colleagues to sit down with the witnesses here.  My colleagues have their objectives and interests and the witnesses have theirs.  Those interests may be different because, as the national land use system recognises, we may have different needs for different types of farmers.  Would the witnesses be willing to sit down with my colleagues under new politics and in a just transition way?  We need a just transition with Irish farmers in the same way we need a just transition with Bord na M&oacute;na workers and perhaps do a just transition with each different category of farmer in terms of how it works for the witnesses, us and everyone.</p><p>We must do this in the next year.  In respect of a willingness or not to do that, do the witnesses think the current system serves their members?  If we are talking about changing it, are we talking about tweaking it or radical change going into that process for the next year?  </p></speech>

Everybody thinks CAP can solve every problem.  First, there is a proposal to cut the CAP budget.  Second, if we are to solve all these problems, what other issues are we going to drop because there is only a certain amount of money in the budget?  More and more objectives are being set out and more and more demands are being placed on CAP, and in my honest opinion, I do not believe it can achieve what everybody thinks it can achieve.  We have no issue with power and the supply chain but that has been an issue for 20, 30 or 40 years.  To be fair, the current Commissioner is making an effort in that regard but the reality is that the primary producer is getting a smaller share of the final consumer price.  In my opinion, food is probably too cheap.  Its price does not take account of the cost of producing that food.  I would agree with the Deputy on those points but the problem is how we solve them.  The idea that we will solve all these problems with a reduced CAP budget is not correct.</p></speech>

We would like to change the supply chain.  There are issues around that.  We would like to see CAP simplified.  There is a range of issues that need to changed with the key one being the price of food.  The farmer is not getting true value in respect of what he produces on his farm, taking account of all the costs involved such as animal welfare or environmental concerns.  The farmer is not being adequately rewarded for that.</p></speech>

We have always agreed to sit down and have sat down to discuss issues relating to Irish farming and its sustainability.  The Deputy is right about prices.  We would love to see more being done about prices.  It is important to build on Commissioner Hogan's agri-markets task force with regard to unfair trading practices and give a bigger share of the margin to farmers.  We have seen this margin being continually eroded to the point where the farmer gets 21 cent out of every euro paid by the consumer while the retailer gets 51 cent with the processor taking 28 cent in the middle.  When this report is rolled out and when there is legislation around it, we have called for an independent regulator to be there to enforce it.  Where it is found that retailers are not acting fairly with their suppliers, a regulator needs to be there to levy penalties in the same fashion as Christine Tacon, the groceries code regulator in the UK, can.  Mr. Enright has covered most of the rest of it.  Many of the aims of the original CAP are being met.  What is probably not being met is an adequate income going to farmers.  CAP has definitely ensured the production of safe, top-quality food that is traceable from farm to fork and that the European citizens get a good deal from it.</p></speech>

How right he is.  When we hear that, we must ask whether people are prepared to pay more for the food they eat.  That is a serious question.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that now might be a good time to have a national conversation or forum that would look at all aspects of the future of farming in Ireland.  ICOS understands that we face major challenges on issues like generational renewal and getting people to represent the industry at board level.  Many things will change dramatically in the coming years.  For example, on average terms across the EU, 46% of farmers' income comes from CAP.  If CAP is not properly funded and if the funding is not enhanced in the short to medium term, there will be a further decline in farming activity in rural areas.  We talk about continuing expansion.  There are areas in this country where we will not be able to engage in any great form of expansion and if there is no support for the sort of measures and programmes that are working very well on farms at the minute - I referred to GLAS, TAMS and other programmes that are supported - we will see a further decline in our industry and we will all suffer, particularly when we must face the enormous challenges posed by climate change.  If we are not there to do that at individual farm level up and down the country, the citizens of Ireland will be the greatest losers.</p></speech>

It feeds in from one thing to another.  To be honest, our starting point on all of this should be whether we are prepared to realise where we are.  We saw a report the other day that measured 56 countries where we were ranked 48th.  We are the lowest in the EU when it comes to making progress.  Emissions rose by 3.5% in 2016, 3.7% in 2017 and 2.9% this year, which is 10.1% increase in total.  If we do not realise that this must be our starting point and stop the rise in carbon emissions, we are all wasting our time.  We can produce all the research and waffle we need and want.  We were told by the summit in Poland a week ago that we were going to lose huge parts of the world to climate change through flooding.  Depending on how high sea levels rise, it could affect parts of this country such as Dublin, Cork and Waterford.  Is our Government looking at things like this?  While we invest all this money in cities and towns, are we listening to the scientists and the advice we are getting because we have not been listening for the past 20 years?  Our starting point must be to stop the rise in emissions.  With regard to pristine water, it involves flow and pollution from agriculture.  There is no point denying it is happening because it is happening.  It is as simple as that.  Farmers are spreading slurry four times a year because we did not make adequate provision for this in digesters and correct our systems.  There are no fish left in rivers in our part of the country and in several other parts of the country.  In many of these cases, it is because of run off from forestry - Sitka spruce plantations and aerial fertilisation.  Farmers cannot spread fertiliser into rivers or streams but forestry companies can do so.  That is not a problem at all.  We had gorgeous spawning rivers of salmon and trout but the salmon and trout have now gone and nobody says a word about it.  It all seems to be fine.  When I was sitting in the Public Gallery, I heard an earlier speaker from Teagasc make the point that 20,000 ha of Sitka spruce plantations are required to combat greenhouse gas emissions.  There are about 740,000 ha of Sitka spruce plantations in this country.</p><p>Their carbon sequestration is less than 4%, and between 20% to 25% of that is planted on the most valuable soil in the world, peatland.  Some 3% of the world's surface is peatland.  That 3% sequesters more carbon than every tree on every plantation on the globe, yet here we are discussing planting more trees.  If trees were doing such a good job on this, why are our emissions at the rate they are?  The rhetoric we must listen to is unbelievable.  We have been doing the same thing with thicket spruce plantations for 100 years, since the Brits were here, and we continue to do it.  It is just crazy.  Are we or are we not serious about this?</p></speech>

Our hill sheep farmers are high nature value farmers.  We expect them to do both environmental work and production while being paid for production, which is limited, as our stock are management tools on mountains.  We do not have the luxury of putting very heavy, bigger animals up on a mountain.  They must be light and lean to work on a mountain.  We earn off production but we are providing a management service instead.  The CAP document, however, does not get to grips with that.  In fact, one of the new good agricultural practices, the good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, refers to peatlands having to be kept in a good condition before we can even receive a Pillar 1 payment.  Keeping wetlands, peatlands and boglands in good condition takes a lot of resources, information and skill.  It cannot be a precondition for getting a first payment.  It must be further down in the ecoschemes.  It would be possible to say something along the lines that the bogs should not be degraded, but it certainly should not be that we must maintain them in good condition to receive the Pillar 1 payment.</p></speech>

More than &euro;2.5 billion has been invested in Irish farms, in slurry storage, effluent management and so on.  The code of good agricultural practice is improving.  By European standards, we are in the top ten.  There is more to do but we are confident that the new measures in the latest river basin management plan will deliver the agricultural sustainability and support advisory programme, ASSAP, which is being rolled out.  We are confident it will give us further improvements where the 30 sustainability advisers will help further improve water quality.  There has been a decline in some of our pristine waters, but we should remember that not all was in intensive agricultural areas.  It will probably be discovered when the local authority water support and advisory teams go out there and there will probably be improvements.</p> <p>  On emissions, it is important that 27 measures that Teagasc has recommended are implemented and that every effort is made to ensure this.  As the previous speaker from Teagasc noted, to take out 7 million tonnes is over one third of agriculture emissions.  There is potential to do that with the current stock numbers.  There is no point in rehashing it, but that is our line.</p></speech>

The farmers of Ireland are the custodians of the environment.  That is our starting point.  The people present at this meeting represent them.  This is a major issue, no matter where one goes, in every sector of society.  What kinds of ideas are coming from the meetings?  Are the farmers - I am one, so I cannot be criticised for saying this - simply saying that they are farmers, they will keep farming, and how can they do anything when they are not making money?  Alternatively, are they making any suggestions as to how they can turn it to an advantage?  We sell our food and agricultural products all over the world as being green.  Were we to add carbon efficient approved to that, could we turn that to our advantage?  What feedback have the organisations present received from their members on this?</p> <p>  At the first meeting of this committee there was agreement across the board that whatever decision we made would have to encompass all parties from a political perspective, and whatever suggestions would be made would transfer from Government to Government.  We are in agreement on that.  How well are the different sectors communicating about what everyone can do collectively into the future to improve the situation?  This is a global issue.  The majority of the grain feed coming into this country comes in on boats from Russia, which is a massive global footprint, yet according to our own report, although it is obvious to anyone, our tillage farmers are on their knees.  As people in the sector, will the witnesses give us an idea of how we can overcome that type of issue, where we would cut out the carbon footprint of the imports, which are transported across the world and help the tillage sector by using home-grown feed?  In a product for which we are world famous, Guinness, over 50% of the grain in Guinness is not Irish.  The farmers would love that it was, naturally, but how can we overcome these things and turn them to our advantage so that we turn the red into the black and at the same time turn green?</p> <p>  What relationships do the organisations present have with other organisations outside farming in the community?  It comes back to the co-operatives and where they were started by the farmers.  There was a whole community buy-in and effort.  If farmers were providing slurry, grass or whatever to an anaerobic digestion plant that was providing district heating into communities, the us and them aspect suddenly goes, everyone is united and happy, and it is much easier to get a buy-in to the problem.  What initiatives can the groups present come up with rather than waiting to see what the committee arrives at?</p></speech>

For instance, in relation to the economic breeding index, EBI, when farmers breed their cows every spring-summer, they use more climate-efficient animals. It is an ongoing issue.</p> <p>  The area of renewables is something in which farmers would be significantly interested, whether solar, wind, anaerobic digestion, or biomass.  Farmers need to see the policy framework around that which would allow them to get into that area, whether rooftop solar panels on farms or anaerobic digestion.  They need to be convinced that there will be an economic return from it.  There has been bad experiences of this in the past, for instance, in relation to miscanthus, and these are issues that need to be resolved.  The Government must come forward with initiatives in the area.</p> <p>  The matter of grains in Ireland comes down to economics.  The key issue is the price of food and whether the farmer can make an economic return from the product.  Unfortunately, tillage farmers have been struggling in recent years, but it comes down to the way we are pricing food.</p> <p>  On working with other sectors, our members work with dairy co-operatives, local LEADER groups and so on in different initiatives.  Renewables are an area in which farmers have a great deal of interest but they need to see the policy framework.</p></speech>

I wholly agree with his remark that farmers are the custodians of the land, and so it should be, but with the amount of bureaucracy, legislation and so on, one would sometimes wonder who are the custodians.</p><p>We talked earlier about 1995 and the number of animals, cattle, cows and so on we had in the country.  At that time the cattle numbers might have been similar, but there were considerably fewer cows.  As we all know there is much less spreading of fertiliser slurry.</p><p> The industrialised business-led model we have adopted in this country has failed miserably.  Let us consider the distribution of CAP.  Of 120,000 farmers, some 53,000 are on a basic payment of &euro;5,000 or less and some 27,000 are on &euro;10,000 or less.  Things have changed from years ago where everybody had everything on a farm and we were self-sufficient.  Last winter at the time of the snow, if it lasted for another week many would have died of hunger.  If we look at where the money is at the end of the year, is it in the farmers' pockets?  It is not in mine and I do not know if it is for many.  Because of this golden circle running Irish agriculture with corporatisation creaming the profits from the top, farmers have little or nothing.</p><p> We have heavily promoted the dairy sector.  Much of this relates back to Teagasc which came up with the idea because of global warming and the increasing carbon in the atmosphere we were going to have much more grass, as we do.  That has now resulted in major increases in our emissions, a dairy sector that is &euro;1.5 billion in debt, and mothers and fathers who cannot sleep at night because they have signed up to loans for their sons and daughters to get into this racket promoted by many people, including politicians, dairy co-ops and farming organisations.</p><p> In fairness, Commissioner Hogan has given a serious hint to farmers over the past year in outlining where we were going with our emission targets and farmers were not biting the bullet.  Most recently he talked about a cull and so on.  We cannot continue to sacrifice our taxpayers at the rate of &euro;600 million per year from 2020 to 2030.  Why should they be sacrificed when people in responsible positions who should have directed us on a different road up to now did not do so?</p><p> The way out all of this is, unfortunately, going back a bit in time, decreasing production and putting in place proper schemes for all farmers.  I am not saying that cows cannot be milked; of course they have to be.  I am not saying beef cannot be produced; of course it can.  However, we must look at diversification.  Farmers could be doing many other things than producing excessive amounts of milk, beef or whatever.  We need to look at it in a general context.  We import far too much material, food and so on.  For example, we imported 40,000 tonnes of potatoes last year, 20,000 tonnes of chip potatoes, 16 million tonnes of junk meal from South America that I would not give to anything.  I would not feed it to my animals although some people are prepared to feed it and promote it.  Then we sell this idea of Origin Green.  Ornua, the company behind Kerrygold, is involved in a major court case over false advertising.</p><p> We are also seeing enormous rises in the incidence of diseases in people and I am not sure why.  However, I am saying we should be producing top-quality food for the people of this country and we should also export whatever top-quality milk, beef, lamb etc. we can.  First and foremost should be 100% healthy food.</p></speech>

Two specific things are coming up.  One is that people want to explore growing hemp.  The problem is with test-running it.  There is a long process to get licences etc.  If we are on timeframes, it would be great if those timeframes could be shifted down to allow some trials to happen.</p> <p>  The second thing is to have bees designated as a livestock unit.  The managed honey hive would have a very large margin of forage around it which would include the wild pollinators.  It would kill two birds with one stone; I accept that analogy is not very environmentally friendly.  We could sort out forage and habitat of the wild pollinators which is a critical issue for the environmentalists.  It would also give farmers another source of income from a different livestock unit.</p></speech>

As I outlined earlier, we could see an expansion of the energy on a co-operative level.  For example, the group water schemes have been well served by their involvement in ICOS and the co-operative structure.  We need Government support for energy projects and they should be community-led to get a better buy-in as far as the community is concerned.  The difficulty with many of those energy projects for many years has been the opposition and the difficulty in procuring planning permission.  If the local community benefits from the existence of such a project in the area, that would be a way of avoiding that difficulty.  To talk about killing two birds with the one stone, if we generate more of our electricity from a renewable source here on a co-operative or community basis, we would need to import less of what is required to generate our energy today.  It is a win-win situation for everybody.  It would take care of the issue raised by my friend here regarding diversification.  It would be a way for the farmer to diversify from what he has been doing well for generations.  He can see this as another opportunity.</p> <p>  As it is being done right across Europe, why not give support to put panels on the roofs of the big buildings that exist in every farmyard?  We will be able to add an additional dimension to that very shortly because the technology for battery storage is improving which would allow us to make better use of the energy generated from the roof.  There are enormous opportunities and they can all be done on a co-operative community-led basis.</p></speech>

The farmers I meet are very engaged.  Some 200,000 carbon assessments have been done on farms, which means someone must be doing them.  There is at least one done per farm household if we think about 135,000 farm households.  Some 50,000 farmers are involved in GLAS.  The IFA president, Mr. Joe Healy, has said we need to get that reopened because there is a pent-up demand to participate.</p> <p>  Every farmer who gets a basic payment and is part of CAP has to complete an inspection and to comply with 20 key measures, 13 of which are called SRMs and a further seven good agricultural environmental conditions.  Any farmer who does not is subject to a penalty.  Some 24,000 farmers in the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, are genotyping their stock in order to try to reduce their emissions by 10%.</p> <p>  We can also consider what farmers are doing voluntarily.  In conjunction with the EPA we run a voluntary scheme, called Smart Farming, which is oversubscribed.  We are heading into 2019 with more farmers interested in participating than the capacity of the scheme.</p><p>That is because it focuses on the win-win that Deputy Ryan referred to earlier of improving farm returns while also enhancing the environment by focusing on climate.  The committee's report earlier this year stated that it should look at expansion.  That is before renewables are considered.  This is the great value of the Teagasc abatement climate roadmap in trying to pull all this together.  All the ideas for generating, whether about renewables or efficiency, seem to be included in the 27 measures.  To give direction and guidance to the sector, IFA president Joe Healy has written directly to the Taoiseach, stating that we should look at what delivery of the climate roadmap looks like.  For the first time ever, we have some sort of vision regarding what 9 million tonnes of emission reductions from the sector could look like.  The farmers I meet are very engaged.  They have to be because their future depends on getting sustainability right.</p></speech>

With regard to Northern Ireland and Protestants cutting hedges, I would like to make it clear that one's religion is probably not a sign of one's predisposition towards being environmentally responsible or irresponsible.  It may be a reference to the fact that Protestants have a tendency to cut their hedges around the 12th fortnight.  I hope that is what he was implying.</p> <p>  I echo Senator Paul Daly's comments about the Citizens' Assembly.  I have concerns that agriculture was underrepresented in that and that we need to revisit it.  It is good to hear the contributions here today and the fact that a strong lobbying exercise is being done to say that agriculture is a critical industry for Ireland and it will have a role to play in this.  I do not want to repeat everything but obviously agriculture has delivered on efficiencies, which has been well-proven and documented.  There was a reference in an earlier meeting today about a successful venture, the taxation of plastic bags.  It changed behaviour and delivered.  My concern when one looks at taxation of farmers and primary production can be seen in the analogy drawn with the plastic bags tax, which was applied at supermarkets and was paid for by consumers.  My problem with the carbon tax on agriculture is that the farmer cannot pass that on or recover it from the marketplace.  It resides with the farmer as a cost he or she will bear.</p> <p>  Before he left, Mr. Pat McCormack from the ICMSA referred to sustainability.  We have all discussed environmental sustainability at length today.  We all know what is economic sustainability.  If it is not profitable, there will not be an industry.  I do not think we pay enough attention to social sustainability, which is about the creation and vibrancy of rural villages, towns, schools, shops, post offices and Gaelic football clubs, all of which are dependent on strong, profitable agricultural structures.  A number of references have been made in the committee to the importance of agriculture in the Irish economy, but it is disadvantaged by this headline figure of its percentage impact or contribution to the emissions discussion.  New Zealand was referred to as an economy that is similarly heavily dependent on agriculture and is disadvantaged.  I do not think we have recognised the contribution we have made with regard to ammonia.  Every 1% by which we have reduced protein in our animal feeds reduces ammonia by 10%.  The intensive sector reduced ammonia output by 30%.  If we consider these things and the reference made earlier by Deputy Ryan to the possibility of paying farmers for a positive contribution, in the opinion of the different representatives, what is the possibility of farmers being paid for carbon credits for delivering benefits to society?  Mr. Thomas Ryan referred to there being 200,000 farm audits.  Are enough data and information emerging that we could be in a position to pay farmers carbon credits for positive delivery?</p></speech>

We do not feel, as a sector, that there is a fair picture of farming where climate is concerned.  That is because methane and nitrous oxide are counted and accounted for but the carbon sink from our forestry, hedgerows, grasslands and permanent pastures are largely ignored, with forestry beginning to be involved.  Ireland has the largest permanent pastures in Europe, yet there is no carbon credit or recognition for that.  This all relates to keeping farmers engaged.  If we look at forestry alone since 1990, some 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide are stored that could be accounted for from 2021 to 2030.  That will probably come into play in 2025.  The EPA has done work on between 0.5 and 2 tonnes of carbon on our soils.  Where is the value of that coming back into the sector when the magic 20 or 21 million tonnes are compared to agriculture?  We contend that it is absolutely not a fair reflection on the sector that methane and nitrous oxide are counted.</p> <p>  Let us go a step further and look at the landscape.  Deputy Ryan referred to a land use strategy.  Whatever the committee's view might be, more than 200 wind farms are offsetting approximately 3.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.  That is happening on our landscape.  If we look at the landscape and landscape contribution, since we are all tied up in the methodology, we are blocking a really positive discussion that could take place about carbon stores.  We are all concerned about 2020, when in reality, if we do not make progress on the carbon sink discussion, we will be here in the run-in to 2030, having an identical discussion.  It is a barrier to positivity in the discussion.  The value is there and the more quickly it is recognised, the more positive it is for engagement.</p></speech>

There is a serious concern relating to the loss of services in rural communities, whether Garda stations, doctors' surgeries, banks or other services.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young indicated an increase in milk production from 2016 to 2020 was putting an additional &euro;540 million annually into those rural communities.  They were supporting jobs, including the farmer producing the milk, who supported the store, local grocery or supermarket, the butcher, garage and whatever else.  That sort of sustainability is critical too and there is a place for all levels of sustainability to be nurtured here.  Sustainability in the production of our food is critical, as is sustainability of the communities that live in rural areas.  It is worthwhile to keep in mind that a little change can make a big difference.</p></speech>

It is a helpful engagement.  One very strong message is that the witnesses all accept that climate action has to be taken.  It may surprise some people who might have had different views about those in the agriculture sector, and it is great that the witnesses are being proactive in their messages this evening and about actions they want to see taken.</p><p> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine compiled a report on climate change and sustainability in the agrifood sector.  Have the farming organisations had a chance to examine the report?  It has some good ideas, which were referenced earlier, particularly for agroforestry.  Earlier we heard that agroforestry would be a quick win for mitigation measures.  We do not expect dairy farms to completely plant mixed plantations.  There are 130,000 farmers in this country.  Have the organisations considered the possibility of asking each farmer to set aside an acre of land for agroforestry?</p><p> Do the organisations think Food Wise 2025 should be reviewed in terms of the pressures the policy puts on farmers to deliver reduced emissions?</p><p> Have the organisations considered the carbon taxation models that have been discussed?  The British Colombia's fee and dividend model is being considered at present.   The model proposes that money would be returned to the rural economy or poorer communities when money is circulated.  Do the organisations have a view on that model? </p><p> ICOS is in existence for 125 years and I congratulate it on reaching such a milestone.  Recently I attended the 50th celebrations for the Arrabawn Co-Operative Society that took place in Birr, County Offaly.  Two of the founding members attended the event and it was a great afternoon.  Has ICOS put in place a model?  Let us say there is a policy that recommends farming co-operatives should get involved in anaerobic digesters or the biofuel industry and models have been designed.  If a group of farmers approached the organisation, said they wanted to undertake such projects and have a plan, does the organisation have a funding model available? </p></speech>

Of course, yes.  We provide rulebooks for every society and we have model rules for every sector.  We have already developed model rules for energy co-ops, farm machinery co-ops and every type of co-operative one can imagine.  We are working with a number of groups and we have model rules ready to go.  If a group has a proposition we will have no problem providing a structure for them and certainly the legal basis for their existence.  We do not have the money to fund them but we have legal and democratic structures in place.<br/><br/>I shall comment on the carbon taxation models.  I echo what Mr. Donnellan said this morning that carbon taxation models are the bluntest of instruments.  A carbon tax on agriculture <i>per se</i>would be the bluntest of instruments.  If one would put a tax on every animal then the good, bad, efficient and inefficient animals would be taken out.  Such a policy would not deliver.  It would simply reduce our competitiveness, reduce production and increase inefficiency.  We cannot assess the carbon efficiency of every cow in the country.  That would be possible only if one could do so with the press of a button, but that is not possible.  My colleague, Mr. Spellman, will comment in terms of the committee.  </p></speech>

In the first instance, we recommended the removal of the replanting obligation in standard afforestation as it acts as a significant barrier and prevents farmers from converting agricultural land into forestry.  In addition, we recommended, in order to assist with afforestation targets, that livestock farmers would welcome a worthwhile agroforestry initiative using native broadleaf trees to increase forestry cover, provide shelter belts, offset emissions and increase biodiversity.  Certainly, it is something that would get a positive response.  I understand what was said about dairy farmers not putting large areas of their farms into forestry and how a couple of acres on every farm might be preferable.  Some of our co-ops have reached out in a small way to their members by supplying them with trees to plant in small coppices on their farms.  We could extend that, thus partially addressing what is needed in terms of afforestation.</p></speech>

I am not sure it would suit every farm but we believe the scheme should be promoted.</p> <p>  In terms of a review of Food Wise 2025, we would need to know what a review would entail.  I have certain concerns about the matter.  ICMSA members have invested in their farms and taken on long-term debt on the basis of Food Wise 2025 and a review could have major implications for those individuals.  We must be cognisant of those people who have taken the brave decision to invest in their businesses and contribute to the whole area.  We need to be careful about what is meant by a review of Food Wise 2025, in my opinion.</p> <p>  The ICMSA has stated its views on carbon tax in our submission.  We believe a carbon tax is not a good idea for the agricultural sector.  </p></speech>

There is an urgent need within Government to review the existing forestry regulations as they limit planting on unenclosed land. More than 180,000 hectares of unenclosed land are not designated.  If the same rules that apply in Scotland were applied here that land could be planted.  The measure would go a long way towards addressing our shortcomings in forestry because the forestry rate for this year was a little more than 4,000 hectares but the target was 10,000 hectares.  If the restriction was lifted there is a potential to plant 180,000 hectares.</p> <p>  In terms of Food Wise 2025, it does not address farm level profitability.  Farmers all around the country have raised that issue with the IFA. </p> <p>  Carbon tax makes sense only if there is an alternative.  Most farmers use jeeps and tractors on their farms.  There is no such thing as an electricity powered jeep or tractor.  Until there is an alternative it does not make sense to impose more carbon taxes.  As was said earlier, every &euro;5 a tonne increase in carbon tax takes another &euro;8 million out of agriculture and the current carbon tax takes &euro;30 million.  There is no alternative at the moment.</p></speech>

What Mr. Spellman has said is close enough to the right idea.  The INHFA totally disagrees with short-term payments.  The agroforestry scheme lasts five years and is a bit like the afforestation programme overall.  We have told here today that 4,000 hectares were planted last year, which surprises me.  The scheme is just a land grab because one gets paid for 15 years but ends up with nothing, which is what happens when one plants Sitka spruce.  At the end of that scheme, if one wants a felling licence to fell one's timber, one must agree to replant the land and pay for it oneself.  That is how good the Government is at conning people in this country, and that has gone on for quite a long time.</p> <p>  The agroforestry scheme is a five-year payment.  One can fence off the land but ten years must elapse before one can allow an animal to graze on that land.  The conditions of the scheme insist that trees are planted about six metres apart and one cannot graze the land for ten years.  One is paid for only five years so what payment does that land produce for the next five years?  It produces nothing and from there on the land is taken up with trees.  The INHFA suggests that if we are serious about tackling climate change and truly want farmers to participate in these schemes, they must be paid indefinitely, and whoever is their successors must be paid indefinitely.  Fewer than 4,000 hectares will be planted in forestry next year because the people of the west of Ireland are sick of the scheme.  A beautiful county like Leitrim has been wiped out, communities have been wiped out and rivers are being polluted.  For what?  So we can milk cows?   </p></speech>

I asked whether an acre of land on each farm should be planted with small amounts of mixed species of trees.  I am not going down the line of making previous mistakes again.  I based my question on findings and recommendations in a report compiled by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

In our CAP proposals we have proposed that the eco scheme, which replaces greening, be mandatory for all farmers to measure their carbon footprint in order to determine their carbon levels.

There are a very limited number of farmers in the beef genomics scheme.  It is not resulting in accurate measurements.  We need this to be done right across the board, mandatory for every farmer, if we are to make a start on this.  A voluntary scheme was mentioned in the CAP proposals.  Commissioner Hogan's wording is now that farmers will have to "partake" in this.  He has not said it is mandatory.  If it is not mandatory, however, it is just a waste of time.  It is a starting point to determine carbon credits.  Of course carbon credits should be traded.  They are being traded right now.</p></speech>

That component is missing.  It is especially critical for our sector, which is providing a massive sink through peat soils and some other measures.</p> <p>  Should Food Wise 2025 be reviewed?  We would say yes.  We would want to look at an industrial-led model of continued growth.  We are talking about &euro;19 billion by 2025.  When we get to 2025, are we going to flatline that growth and maintain it or set another, much higher target and keep moving along on a growth model when we know at this stage it is causing many problems?  I can understand the contention that there is resistance due to sunken costs, but perhaps in some senses it is time to look at repositioning the plug sooner rather than later rather than allowing people to get in way too deep.  We saw this happen in Paraguay, where farmers were all encouraged to expand and then the price of milk dropped and the loans were called in and every single farmer lost his or her farm.  We really would not want to see this, especially for the young farmers who have been encouraged to expand into dairying.  Yes, it is critical we look at Food Wise 2025 and perhaps change the metric from &euro;19 billion to a different set of metrics that looks at whether we are feeding people in a good, healthy way and keeping a stable economy and environment.</p></speech>

I wish to start by fully agreeing with the IFA that this is not just an Irish issue.  Greenhouse gases do not go up over a country and keep within its border; they go into the atmosphere.  It is a global issue, and I fully acknowledge that the IFA acknowledges this.  It was therefore really unhelpful for the Minister to say the other day that there is no contradiction between growing a herd and reducing emissions.  Clearly, this is not in line with the reports that continually come before us, whether from Europe or the EPA or our own reports.  They show us that agricultural emissions are increasing year on year and have increased for four out of the past five years, and the main contributor to that is the growing of the herd.  I understand that the IFA is here to defend its members and their position but I also appreciate that people will find it difficult to be green when they are in the red.  This is why the notion of a carbon tax that should be imposed on everyone, regardless of their circumstances, is not on, as proven by the people of France - the farmers and the workers and the people from villages, towns and cities.  One does not impose a carbon tax on ordinary people who cannot afford it without providing an alternative.  If people in this country had a great alternative in terms of public transport but refused to use it because they wanted to go in and out in their Ferraris, I would say, "Tax them to hell."  They do not have an alternative, because we do not have good public transport.  We have people living in satellite towns outside of the big cities who must drive in and out to work because they have no choice.  If we were given the alternative, the carbon tax would be absolutely sound, but in this situation it is not.  Neither is it sound for farmers, except, of course, in the case of big ranchers who make vast profits.  I am an urban dweller and not familiar with who is who in rural Ireland in terms of agricultural production but I do know that there are certain types of farmer who are vastly wealthy, grow huge numbers of cattle and dairy herd and make a lot of their profits from exporting.</p> <p>  I wish to make a small point about the discussion about Food Wise and food production because this is also not just an Irish issue but a global issue.  I was quite shocked to see Bord Bia recently spend an awful lot of its time, money and energy on promoting Irish beef and dairy in countries whose populations have never eaten beef or dairy, such as China and the Middle East, countries where there is no tradition of eating these types of food and no health barometer in this regard.  Bord Bia is really pushing farmers to grow more cattle here for more exports.  This just does not make sense because it is leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  On the question of global food production, this conversation is really useful and interesting.  I think it was the witness from ICOS, Mr. Spellman, who proposed that we should have a national forum on the future of farming.  That is a brilliant idea.  I am not as critical of the Citizen's Assembly as some of the witnesses are but I do not think the recommendations on agriculture are sufficient.  I would like to know what they think of the idea of a national forum on farming and food production and how it might contribute to this overall plan to help us reduce our national CO2 emissions.</p> <p>  Lastly, I noticed in the submission from the hill farmers that there is a lot of talk of a national forestry policy.  Do they believe that the policy as structured and implemented through and by Coillte is sufficient?  If not, what must change to make our forestry policy more realistic, more long-term and more sustainable?</p></speech>

I agreed with him as I think it would be helpful because we will find it difficult to confront some of the changes that are taking place and the issues we must confront in the medium to long term.  For this reason it might be a good time to have a national conversation or a national forum on the future of agriculture, remembering that we are an agricultural country, no matter how we look at it.  I think it would be worthwhile exploring that initiative.</p></speech>

A well-run forum can achieve a lot, as opposed to a forum that becomes a political tick-box exercise.</p> <p>  Regarding the comment to which Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred about there being no contradiction, we have shown that we have increased output by 40% and actually kept a flatline on the emissions going back to 1990.  People might think that the dairy and beef sector is not paying its way back in respect of debt and emissions.  Lest anyone get the wrong idea, I again highlight that farming is one of the best performers in the country when it comes to repaying debt.  The farmers will just do it.  They will pay back their debt no matter what.  What is crucial, though, and we can never move away from it, is that there is a growing global demand for dairy and beef protein.  I keep repeating this.</p><p>It is not the Irish Farmers' Association that is saying it.  It is the European Commission Joint Research Centre that says Ireland is the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy products. That is the simple truth.  Those are the facts.  We can deal with facts or we can deal with emotion.  We like to deal in facts. </p></speech>

The planet will need 70% more food to feed those people.  Every country is going to have to play its part in that.  It is not Bord Bia that is driving the demand for dairy and beef products all over the planet.  It is not even being driven by the western world.  It is being driven by newly developing countries that are acquiring new tastes and have a demand for these products.  There will be global demand.  It is the case that if we do not produce a kilogram of beef in Ireland it will be produced somewhere else.  It may well be produced in Brazil through a reduction in rainforest cover.  That is the reality.  Ireland will not control, decide or stop the march of the global demand for these products.  To be fair to the Deputy, we have to realise what has happened in the dairy sector.  The context here is that we had a milk quota in this country from 1984 to 2015.  There was huge pent-up demand for expansion.  Naturally when that was lifted we saw an increase in the number of dairy cows, as was predicted, in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  There probably will be further increases in the next few years.  It is impossible to predict for how long it will go on.</p></speech>

There has been a huge focus on the fact that there has been an increase in emissions and it is all negative.  The Senator mentioned it earlier.  We have to recognise the huge positive the ability to expand into a profitable sector like dairy has been for Irish farm families and the rural economy.  Balance is the key issue.  The point the president is making is that we have managed to expand from 1990 to now and flat-line our emissions.  What Teagasc is proposing today is a clear pathway by which we can grow our agricultural businesses while reducing emissions through adopting the 27 measures it has put forward.  The Deputy acknowledges that she is not from rural Ireland.  If agriculture is removed there is not much going on outside the M50.  We have to recognise that.  We must realise that for many families and spin-off businesses there, agriculture is where it is at.  We need to find a balanced approach to what we do.  In our presentation we did not get to mention the comments made by Professor John Fitzgerald.  He stated:</p><blockquote>When I was appointed as chairman of the [Climate Change Advisory Council] it was my understanding of the science that I was going to have to tell farmers they would have to get rid of their cows.  It turns out, however, that the scientific evidence on this issue is more complicated.  </blockquote> <p>Agriculture needs a more nuanced solution.  What the committee heard today from Mr. Trevor Donnellan is the outcome of years and years of scientific research aimed at producing a marginal abatement cost curve.  Unfortunately, what we saw in the Citizens' Assembly was four days of fairly superficial argument without any economic or social balance.  I wish to point out to the committee members that this committee's recommendations will be massively important for the livelihoods of all of our members and for many more people in agriculture and in rural Ireland.  Balance is key.  We have a State agency which has set out a very credible pathway.  We talk about fora.  We have clearly put on the record that we need political leadership to pull together all the Departments.  Let us get cracking on achieving this.  That will not be easy either.  </p></speech>

That is my point.  Saying that this is not the problem, that this activity could be carried out in the Amazon forest or New Zealand, is a bit like the Minister opposing my bill which would prevent the issuance of any more exploration licences for fossil fuels by saying that if we do not do it they will do it in Iraq or Saudi Arabia.  It is saying the same thing.  It is a bit of climate change denial.</p> <p>  The last point I will make is that all of this means the science has settled on climate change.  It was not settled previously.  Reference was made to the size of the herd in 1990.  Most countries did not actually accept the science then.  It is accepted now, except by a few oddballs like President Donald Trump.  It is mostly accepted.  Now that we have acceptance let us look reality in the face.  We are emitting too much carbon into the atmosphere.  I repeat, the atmosphere, not just Ireland.  Therefore we have to deal with it.  Dealing with it in the agricultural sector is hugely important.  We need a balanced, nuanced and diverse approach to agriculture, but overgrowing the national herd is not balanced, nuanced or diverse.  I would welcome a national dialogue on this. </p></speech>

I am looking at the CSO figures from June 216 to June 2018.  Total cattle decreased by 0.2%.  I will share this with the Deputy at the end of the meeting if it is helpful.  There is a narrative, which I understand and which Deputy Smith has articulated several times, that there is a huge glut of extra stock.  I am sharing CSO data with the committee here.  Since the quotas were lifted, total cattle numbers have decreased by 0.2% from June 2016 to June 2018.  The number of dairy cows grew by 3.4%; the number of other cows fell by 3.1%  That is what the facts say.  I am happy to share that CSO data with the committee.</p></speech>

Yes, perhaps men might see this as more emotional, although there is often a very big difference between getting something done and sitting down and looking at how to get something done.  Women generally tend to realise that it is not just a question of feeding the world.  We actually have to look at how we do so.  The IFA says that we will need 70% more food to feed the world's population.  That 70% will escalate over time .  We do not have enough land at the moment to provide that extra 70% in the form of beef and milk.  That is a reality.  There is not enough land on this planet to feed the population we have at the moment with beef and milk.  To look to fill 70% more demand with beef and milk-----</p></speech>

Speaking from a woman's point of view, feeding countries flavoured and condensed milk and telling women to switch from breastfeeding to powdered milk and infant formula does make us emotional.</p><p>We are talking about the fact that we are feeding the world.  We recently started back sending live exports to Libya.  Two women bravely stood up in Dunnes Stores years ago and refused to sell oranges that came from South Africa because they had principles.  We are seeing a Bill that is going through to prevent the import of products from the occupied West Bank.  Personally, I find it really offensive that we are selling beef to a country that is selling human beings as slaves - that is happening in Libya.  I have a problem with how we sell our beef and to where we sell it, especially as we have 75,000 children dying of starvation in Yemen at the moment, but we are not sending any food to them.  That is from a woman's point of view. I am sorry if that sounds emotional but I want to challenge the claim that we are feeding the world.</p><p> I will go back to answer Deputy Smith's question.  She asked whether the Coillte policy was realistic and sustainable.  We would like to see Coillte with a new remit.  In 1988 when Coillte was set up the remit was to make as much money as possible from the forest estate in any way the company found profitable.  We would prefer to see the company being less about making money - there has not been a great deal of money made from the forest estate - and more about providing a national sequestration service and a major biodiversity service.  As the Sitka spruce forests come up to felling and get felled I would rather see them replaced with natural forest that is predominately native and broad-leaf.  We want to have a look at replacing the Sitka spruce.  We want to look at restoring the biodiversity and clean water from it.</p><p> Another suggestion is that the Coillte board needs to be reviewed.  The board is sitting with a good deal of experience from Glanbia, Kerrygold and so on, but there are no environmental people on the board and no one with change management skills.  With all due respect, we are in for something of a bumpy ride and we are going to need as many skills as possible to get through it.  One such skill is some experience in change management.  We need to get that expertise on the board of Coillte.  As a matter of fact, we need it on many boards.</p></speech>

I am a little depressed by the IFA attitude today.  It is amazing, to tell the truth.  Let us expand on what the IFA representatives have said.  The view is that we should do nothing because we are producing the most valuable food in the world.  The view is that the Brazilians have to sort out the rain forests. If they do that, our farmers will be grand and we can produce even more and send it on.  That is simply not feasible.</p> <p>  I have listened to the IFA representatives saying this for the past couple of years. They are fighting a rear-guard action on behalf of their members. They would be far better to embrace the decisions and go forward positively.  That is my personal opinion.  It is unbelievable.</p> <p>  The IFA representatives have endorsed the Teagasc figures.  That is interesting because it is the first time I have heard them do so, and it is positive.  Would the IFA endorse the Teagasc figures if they included a reduction in the beef herd stock by 500,000?  If that were achieved, we would be coming near the benchmark and making real change in terms of society.</p> <p>  The IFA representatives made other claims in the presentation to the committee today.  I have challenged the Department on this.  The IFA website has set out five steps to support climate action.  We heard this in the presentation today.  Step 4 states that the role of methane should be re-examined and alternative measures created.  Can the IFA confirm its views on climate science and the damaging role played by methane?  Although the gas has a shorter lifespan than carbon dioxide, it is actually 34 times more potent than carbon dioxide.  How can the IFA square that circle?  That is set out on the IFA website. I have brought up this matter with the Department as well.  I do not blame the IFA necessarily because the Department has said exactly the same thing about methane.  That is interesting in itself.  The Department has said that methane does not have this effect.  That is absolute craziness - it is mental stuff.  There is no other way of explaining it.  I simply do not know how the IFA can square that.  I am sorry for getting annoyed, Chairman, but it is madness.</p> <p>  The only way any of the farm organisations, apart from the Natura farmers, probably, will agree to any changes in terms of how farmers are paid will be through CAP renegotiation.  We will have to wait until 2020 before we see any change.  Does the IFA support changes that would make farming more environmentally friendly?  Does the IFA support changes that would lead to the positions that Teagasc has recommended?  Will the IFA take down that rubbish off its website?</p></speech>

Under the rural development programme, nine out of every ten measures have climate mitigating actions.  This comprises the rural development fund and schemes for which the IFA has lobbied.  We encouraged farmers to participate.  It is important that we acknowledge that work has to be done.  We have constantly said that.  The IFA and other organisations have encouraged farmers to partake in that.  This has meant that the figure we have mentioned several times today has been achieved with regard to the increase in the production at no increase over 28 years in emissions.  I read out those figures, but if Deputy Pringle did not listen to them earlier he will not listen to them now either, so there is no point in repeating them.  It is crucial &ndash; this goes back to the last point &ndash; that we produce food that is in demand where it is efficiently produced from a carbon point of view.  Anyone who is in denial of that is in denial of positive action in climate change.</p></speech>

We were in the Gallery at the time.  He said that methodologies change.  We have been having a discussion on carbon sinks and our frustration at the fact that there is 4.5 million tonnes of CO2 from forestry that is sitting there but not being counted when it comes to landscape, land and agriculture.  In the same tone, the lifespan of methane in the atmosphere is being actively discussed right now.  When the Department representatives came before the committee they referred to it.  The scientific community is referring to it and we are rightly going to refer to it as well.  If methane lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years, then, unlike CO2, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 200 years, of course we are going to bring it to the attention of the committee.</p></speech>

Of course we are going to ask whether it is right that methane, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 12 years, is benchmarked like-for-like against carbon dioxide, which lasts in the atmosphere for up to 200 years.</p><p>One should not be surprised, as Mr. Trevor Donnellan said, that methodologies change; things evolve and with that evolution we will bring to the fore changes around the methodology calculations.  I do not know why Members are surprised because in the event of things changing we will continue to highlight them, just as we continue to highlight our frustration at the carbon sinks not being included.  We have the largest permanent pastures in Europe and yet we are getting zero carbon credit for the grasslands.  All the permanent pasture and the grassland that we are renowned for and despite the fact that there is between 0.5 and 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide being locked into the pastures, we are not getting credit for that.  </p><p> This is all part of that discussion.

What we are saying is that we should wait and see what comes from that review.  There may be no change or they may be a change.  We have to see what will come from that review of the methodology.  That is the point on methane from our perspective.</p> <p>  It is unfair to say we are not looking at measures in respect of climate change.  We made our pre budget submission in August and September and I can send the Deputy a copy of it.  We proposed a number of measures in our pre budget submission on climate change issues.  We are very conscious of climate change and we are putting forward measures to support climate change.  I do not want members to go away with the impression that we are not addressing the issue, because we are very conscious of it.</p></speech>

It is not as if we are comparing methane to carbon dioxide.  It is counted that it is 33 times more polluting, so it is not disappearing anywhere.  In the sums, it does disappear after 12 years.</p> <p>  The term rancher was used pejoratively and this is not a point against the Deputy but we should put on the record that the average dairy herd is small by global standards.  It is 83 or 84 cows and the average beef herd is of the order of 50 animals.  It can be corrected by the secretariat.  I just want to ensure that members do not have notions that there are enormous herds out there.  The average herd is very small by international standards.</p></speech>

The idea that it is not being taken into account is that it counteracts all land that is heavily fertilised.  One has to counteract that with something; that is not in the statistics we are being told today.</p> <p>  Let us face facts when it comes to cows.  One does not need 800 cows to live.  Let us get real.  We are pushing out one of the most valuable enterprises this country has ever had, that made the name of Irish agriculture, and that is the suckler cow.  To come up with figures for the base year on which to make comparisons, the reality is that the suckler cow herd has dropped by about 250,000 cows in the past two and a half years, to make place for dairy cows.  That is not acceptable to the farmers throughout rural Ireland who have reared families and want to continue to see the family, sons and daughters take over the small family farms.  That is why we cannot buy into this nonsense that we should all pack up and sit down and do nothing and let the dairy sector take over the country.</p> <p>  The idea that we are promoting the beef genomic scheme is another farce.  We are producing the most rubbish cattle at present because of the scheme that is going through our livestock marts.  If we talk to any shipper who wants to transport animals, they cannot get suitable cattle to put on a ship because of the idea we have come up with which is to produce a smaller type poor quality cattle.</p> <p>  As I said at the outset, we have to get away from the business-led industrial model of farming we have in this country and the fact that 18,000 or 20,000 farmers think they can run the show and forget about the rest of us.  That is not going to happen.</p></speech>

It is wrong to say that 18,000 to 20,000 farmers are trying to run the whole country for farmers.  That is incorrect.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Audry Deane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200003#E00300"><p>As the largest representative body for older people in Ireland, Age Action is delighted to come before the committee to give a brief overview of home supports, the current context, deficits and impact on service users and their families, which is critical.  We will conclude this short presentation with our key requests, which align with the Home Care Coalition, a grouping of 22 national organisations which advocate and engage with the Department of Health on this critical area of health and social care policy.  We know that the deficits and challenges facing the Irish health system are complex and multifaceted, but from our experience and our direct work with older people and their families across Ireland, we are aware that older people do not receive the quality home support services they need to maintain their health and well-being and to allow them to continue to live independently within their homes and communities, and to avoid or even delay hospital and residential care stays.  Home supports are critical for older people.  It is clear from our work that families are not getting adequate quality, affordable home care supports.  The Citizens' Assembly has dealt with this issue and the findings were clear.  Some 99% of members wanted the Government to expedite the current commitment to place home care on a statutory footing.  We now have the beginning of that emerging and are working closely with the Department to develop that.  A further 87% of people want an increase in public resourcing to ensure this is delivered appropriately.</p>  <p>  We all know the demographic challenges.  Life expectancy is rising and people aged over 65 now can expect to live well into their 80s, with two thirds of these years being lived disability-free.  However, as they age, the risk of disability increases.  Some 72.3% of the population aged 85 and over will have a disability by 2038.  I am not here to labour this.  We all know the statistics and they are stark.  The cohort of people over 85 is projected to double in the next 20 years.  By 2030, the cohort of people over 65 will increase by 59% and the cohort of those over 85 will increase by more than 95%.  This creates capacity challenges and has been well-signalled.  We have had two key reports.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, report on healthcare projections noted that the demand for home care packages will increase by between 44% and 66% by 2030, and the demand for home help hours will increase by between 38% and 54%.  The health service capacity review also flags this.  Various numbers are included in it and are in our presentation.  Looking at just home care packages, which the committee understands are a critical component of wraparound care for people, these will have to increase by 70% from 15,600 a month to 26,600.  There will be a need for an additional 7.2 million home help hours by 2031.</p>  <p>  Unmet need is the crux of this.  Due to the dramatic demographic challenge, the projections for unmet need in home care supports are a cause of deep concern.  Various research puts the level of unmet need at varying levels but it is at least between 26% and 50%.  This will cost between &euro;120 million and &euro;205 million over the first five years of Sl&aacute;intecare, which we will come back to because it is the blueprint for how we should reform healthcare systems in the country.  A report by our colleagues in Care Alliance Ireland published just a few weeks ago gives very important information on the length of waiting times for home care and the gap between assessed need and the service that the person ends up getting.  This report is sobering reading as, despite sending a freedom of information request to all nine community health organisations, only three responded fully to the questions asked, two gave partial information and one refused outright after an initial acknowledgement.  The report found that the average time spent on a waiting list for home care supports for non-priority cases was at least 3.3 months, with the gap between assessed need and actual service provided being 15%.  More worryingly, the report found an inconsistency in the approach to measuring and documenting unmet need.  We in the Home Care Coalition believe that it is a cause for grave concern when the statutory health provider does not have a uniform approach to measuring, prioritising and allocating need.  The figures on unmet need vary from month to month.  Various reports give various statistics but we know that at least 6,100 people are assessed as in need of home care, waiting for an initial service.  As I said, these figures vary.</p>  <p>  Age Action Ireland is aware that the numbers receiving home supports in the community do not accurately reflect current and future need.  Some older people opt not to reply, as they know that service provision is not sufficient and will not meet their needs.  We are also concerned at the lack of data on private home care provision in the country.  We know that the variety of negative consequences can badly affect the health and well-being of older people and their families.  These range from minor consequences such as feeling unhappy because housework is not done, to major consequences, such as being unable to eat when hungry.  Older frail people often sustain an independent lifestyle at home if they can receive appropriate, timely, quality physical and psychosocial supports.  The absence of available home supports impacts fundamentally on the range of choices available to old people.  Without access to home care supports, some older people are forced to move to a residential care setting, which is often not their first choice.  This undermines their human right to live with dignity and independence.</p>  <p>  On funding, as part of the Home Care Coalition, we know we need a large injection of funding into home supports to enable the service to at least meet its yearly growth in service users and to return to 2008 levels of service provision from before the austerity cuts.  I have provided a graphic to the committee on research and will not go into it in detail.  Members can see a significant disparity between the nursing home support scheme, which received &euro;962 million in funding in 2018, catering for 23,500 older people in nursing homes, 4% of the cohort, while the home support element of care, including the winter initiative, receives &euro;430 million, which covers more than 50,000 people.</p> <p>That encompasses home care, home help hours, home care packages and intensive home care packages.  One can see there is a big disparity.</p> <p> The committee will be aware that there are serious challenges facing the planning and provision of home supports.  The deficits have a serious impact on the quality of choices people make, if indeed they are able to make any choice, about where they will receive the care they need.</p> <p> In summary, we know the following.  The average home care package is now six hours a week and not, as we all thought previously, ten hours.  It is now more difficult for over 60s to access home support than it was in 2008.  The waiting lists still persist.  There are now fewer hours being spread more thinly per client every week, with an increase in the provision of short 30 minute slots.  There is not much one can achieve in 30 minutes.</p> <p> There is an absence of legislative entitlement to home supports.  There is a postcode lottery, which quite frankly is shocking, in service provision, and there is a lack of transparency and accountability.  There is limited access to packages due to chronic underfunding and the eligibility criteria for supports remain unclear.  Sl&aacute;intecare is working hard on that issue with Ms Laura Magahy.</p> <p> Overall lack of provision of supports is the key issue.  At Age Action, our helpline constantly get calls from people needing to remain in hospital or who need to go to a nursing home because there are no supports at home, to where they want to return.  This is a serious deficit.  We face a steep increase in demand due to our population growth.</p> <p> There are two clear messages I need to leave with the committee today.  All of us here are asking for an increase of at least 10% in the home supports budget in each year until the statutory scheme comes on stream.  We are working closely and innovatively with the Department on how we should design and deliver this service but it is not here yet.  According to the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, it will take three years to get this scheme in place.  To maintain access and to meet the demands of the expanding demographics, funding has to increase by at least 4% to 5% per year.</p> <p> Age Action Ireland's last really critical issue for the committee, as elected members, to take away is that the new statutory home care scheme must be underpinned with robust eligibility legislation and it must have the quality standards monitoring framework.  Eligibility without capacity will not work and needs will not be met.  The development of a robust equitable funding model will necessitate an honest conversation where collective societal values must be articulated and an agreed approach to the generation of funds to support the scheme must be reached.  Age Action Ireland looks forward to working with the committee to make sure older people's needs for home supports are adequately addressed.</p></speech>

I will share my time with my colleagues from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p>  <p>  Care Alliance's focus is on family carers and on supporting our member organisations and others to better support such carers.  For many families, State funded home care provision can be a key support in keeping people well at home.  I refer the committee to our recent report on home care, published in October, copies of which I have here.</p>  <p>  I am glad to say there is much consensus on home care - the importance of it, the good value it represents and the likely future demand for it.  On the latter point, the 2017 ESRI report speaks of the need for what we estimate to be a 70% increase in home care support by 2030, from a current provision of 17 million hours to an estimated 30 million hours.  That figure is reinforced by recent correspondence I understand Deputy Donnelly received from the HSE in its projections on future demand.</p>  <p>  We welcome the Department of Health review of home care but we are concerned about its slow progress to date.  We, alongside a group of more than 20 other NGOs, are engaging actively with the relevant Department officials in articulating a vision for the future of home care and we, in Care Alliance, appreciate that it will take political courage to grapple with the challenging issues of funding.  The committee last week discussed the HSE budgetary overruns.  To put it in context, the likely acute hospital overrun of &euro;225 million represents more than 50% of the entire home care budget for 2018.</p>  <p>  Finally, I echo the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, at this committee last week about the unhelpful dominant narrative of hospital trolleys and that the focus needs to be more on how long people are waiting for a service, specifically, a home care service.  In that regard, we have asked the HSE to include this as a key metric in its 2019 service plan.</p></speech>

The first is the De-Stress study into 200 plus spousal carers. The following is a summary of the study's findings.  In 2010, family carers and friends provided 81 million hours.  That is approximately 50 % of the total amount of investment in dementia.  Fifteen per cent of carers had given up their jobs to care for their spouses.  Seventy-nine per cent of them stated they provided 81% to 100% of the care.  On average, each of them had cared for his or her spouse for five years at the time of assessment.  Only 50% of them had received any home help in the previous 30 days and the 50% who had, received an average of 34 hours in total in the previous 30 days - a little more than one hour a day to look after somebody with dementia.  Only one-in-four had received family carer training.  Seventy-one per cent of the carers had two or more health conditions at once, including arthritis, hypertension and diabetes, one third had fairly bad sleep quality and a further 9% reported very bad sleep quality.  Approximately 37% of carers reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 20% of carers themselves possibly had problems with cognitive functioning.</p>  <p>  We would argue that if one wraps around services in the community, they can be a tremendous support to carers.  This was mapped by the HSE and ourselves in 2018.  One can see a very different range of services available, from 23 in CHO 3 to 44 in CHO 1.  Looking at day centres nationally, only 41% of day centres operated on a five-day week basis.  One might assume that means that people attend those day centres on five days, but they do not.  Eighty per cent of people from our services attend one or two days a week.  That is all they receive.  Twenty per cent of those day centres operate only one day a week.</p>  <p>  Wexford, Laois and Leitrim have no day care centre for persons with dementia.  That denies nearly 2,000 people access to a service.  In fact, taking three counties which are quite close, Leitrim has three services, Longford has six and Roscommon has ten.  The point being made about the lottery certainly is true.  Based on costings to the satisfaction of the HSE on the evidence of the number of services in an area and the minimum services there should be, &euro;12 million would transform dementia services in this country.  It would triple the services and provide a basic minimum level of service in each county in the country.</p>  <p>  The challenge is significant.  It is estimated that by 2046, the number of persons living with dementia in Ireland will rise threefold.  That needs to be considered in the context that the number of people over 65 will increase twofold in that period of time.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Mr. Ed Crotty, managing director of Heritage Homecare and a board director of HCCI.</p>  <p>  HCCI represents more than 70 member companies which provide care to 20,000 clients and employ 12,000 carers.  I was appointed chief executive of HCCI on Monday, 17 September of this year.</p>  <p>  There are a range of things we can do to improve home care in Ireland.  From HCCI's perspective, we need a non-exhaustive list to ensure operational changes, to increase the supply of carers, to professionalise the caring workforce, to improve trust and dialogue between the key stakeholders, and to work together to ensure Sl&aacute;intecare's success.</p>  <p>  One of the most pressing issues facing the service is waiting times.  While any increased funding to expand capacity would be welcome, there are crucial operational changes that need to be made.  At present, none of the IT systems talks to one another &ndash; those in the acute system do not talk to the public health nurses and the allocation of home care packages is poorly commissioned.</p> <p>This negatively impacts the ability to forward plan and to build capacity. </p> <p> The current allocation of packages, which is done by fastest finger first as per the HSE&rsquo;s 2018 tender, is sub-optimal.  HCCI would prefer to see a different model that would be uniform across all CHOs, allow providers to participate in holistic care planning and thus end the widespread practice of inefficient rostering.  This would provide more meaningful work for carers.  The current home care package is designed to fit all situations, but the type of support needed in rural Ireland differs from that of urban Ireland.  We need to look at a new funding model for home care.  Lessons can be learned from the fair deal scheme for nursing home care. </p> <p> As our population ages - we are all familiar with the statistics - we will need to expand the home care workforce.  To do so sustainably, and to attract and retain the talent of people that we would all wish to care for our loved ones should the circumstance arise, we need to stop a race to the bottom on pay and increase the pool of available labour.  HCCI submitted a case to the economic migration policy unit to allow non-EEA workers into Ireland to become home carers.  We think it is vital that we broaden the base of available workers.  In addition, HCCI is currently working on a submission to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the hopes we can end the current system that punishes a worker for providing home care while in receipt of State benefits. </p> <p> We need to change the HSE procurement rules so that the tendering process is a tool to improve the conditions of the workforce as well as to deliver value for money.  The reality is that the HSE sets the conditions of the market.  That carers do not receive travel allowances, except in rare circumstances, is as a result of the procurement practices of the HSE.  Caring needs to become more culturally embedded, and turned into a profession with a defined and rewarding career pathway.  Innovations are limited only by our imaginations.  Why not provide a mandatory caring module in transition year, for instance?  Professionalisation should also spell the end of a single hourly rate for carers.  Specialist skills should be rewarded, as they are in every other industry.  HCCI is pleased the HSE have conducted a review into the career of health care assistants, and we eagerly await the results.  </p> <p> HCCI welcomes this hearing today, but we are disappointed the attitude of this committee does not seem to be replicated elsewhere. One month after my appointment, I wrote to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly, to request a meeting with him or his officials to talk about the range of issues facing the sector.  That letter has not received a response from the Minister of State.  The HSE last held a home care providers forum in April 2018.  This meeting of the HSE, HCCI and the non-profits should be a regular occurrence, and it is deeply regrettable the meeting scheduled for 5 December was postponed by the HSE.  My hope is that in addition to the forum becoming a regular place to discuss operational issues, a high-level working group will be formed, convened by the Department, between the principal stakeholders so that we can work together and form long-term policy proposals.  We also need more transparency in the operation of the service.  Recent work by members of this committee shed light on the current waiting lists, and work by my colleagues at the Care Alliance similarly enlightened us.  However, it would be better if the HSE regularly reported a standardised set of figures on the operation of home care across all nine CHOs.  HCCI would welcome this extra scrutiny and transparency, for only in understanding the true picture can we all act on an informed basis. </p> <p> Two developments that will shape the future of home care &ndash; namely, the statutory entitlement to home care and Sl&aacute;intecare &ndash; provide a rare opportunity for us to rethink some of our assumptions and design a robust and sustainable home care service.  Laura Magahy and her team are, by all accounts, doing great work at this early stage and I hope for a formal meeting with her soon.  HCCI would like to see a framework that draws on the expertise of the relevant stakeholders and meets regularly to ensure Sl&aacute;intecare is a success.  We need to clarify how we will fund the expansion in community services needed to support the reforms, as well as start preparing the entire sector so that it is ready to provide this care.  The regulation of home care is vital, and therefore we should be teasing out now what model of regulation will deliver the best outcome in the future. </p></speech>

We say this because traditionally there has been a sense that family carers look after old people. but we have a much bigger agenda than that.  We engage with more than 20,000 families each year.  We also deliver 350,000 hours of home care every year, which gives us an insight into the operational aspects of caring.  I would like to formally say that we are a member of the Home Care Coalition and support its goals.  We also support many of the points put forward by HCCI.<br/><br/>Our position engenders a slight degree of confusion.  When Mr. Musgrave spoke about labour and manpower shortages he was speaking about carers.  Under Government policy, carers are unpaid.  Care workers and care assistants are people who work in the home.  There is a lot of confusion when people talk about caring, and it is very important that this committee is clear about it.  Our agenda concerns the co-production of care, because we would maintain that the State has no remote prospect of being able to afford home care without co-production with unpaid family carers.  Taking the CSO's estimate and charging it up very conservatively, families provide &euro;10 billion worth of unpaid care in the home.  The irony is that the way policy is going threatens to strangle that care and reduce it instead of helping it.  <br/><br/>We are encouraged by the emerging themes which the Department of Health has abstracted from the first phase of its consultation.  However, there are a number of issues which are causing real concern, mainly because they are not being discussed as opposed to there being a lack of consensus on them or that they are going in the wrong direction.  The nature and purpose of home care will have to be defined in the legislation.  We believe the legislation will seek to place primary responsibility on the family, with the State in a supporting role.  We agree that is the right way to go and would command widespread support.  Unfortunately, the HSE recently seems to have set its face firmly against this approach.  I do not have time to develop this point in my opening statement, but I would suggest that there is a real prospect that the State will end up spending several hundred million euro extra because of the direction this is taking, with no increase in home care services.<br/><br/>There has been much talk about a funding model.  In the initial stages, when the legislation was being proposed, there was almost a rush in the direction of co-funding.  Our position is that we recognise that co-funding will be required in some shape or form.  We are not willing to talk about co-funding the current system; it is completely unacceptable.  The debate must focus on what we are trying to fund.  Standards for home care must be defined and a model for home care found before we discuss how it is to be funded.  A lot of current discussion centres on wonderful models from overseas.  There has been quite a lot of discussion about the German system, for example.  It is excellent, and is based on a very sophisticated insurance model.  For example, if one does not have children one's insurance premium is higher, on the not unreasonable assumption that when a person is older there will be nobody to look after him or her, whereas if a person does have children they are required to under the German system.  An insurance based system was first floated in Ireland decades ago.  There has never been evidence of a political appetite to address it.  We believe it is an interesting model to explore, but the reality is that good systems cannot be delivered without a proper funding model.  Trying to fund this by way of means testing via taxation is never going to work.  <br/><br/><i></i>As HCCI has said, there is a crisis in the staffing of home care.  That crisis is going to get worse.  We absolutely do not accept the ESRI and Department of Health-HSE projections because they are based on a steady-state situation.  Over the next ten years, as part of the demographic shift, unless the ratio of family carers is increased from one in ten to one in five, we will have to provide massive numbers of extra paid care.  That has to be built into a policy and thought about carefully, but it is not being mentioned or discussed.<br/><br/>The other elephant in the room is that the HSE itself is massively conflicted in terms of the delivery of home care.  I do not say that as a cheap shot at the HSE.  Many of the problems are not of its making, but rather are failures of policy.  We should consider that.  The HSE is a major direct provider of home care services throughout the country.  It delivers services on the basis of historical funding patterns, meaning that consistent service planning and delivery is problematic.  The current CHO system, where each CHO has an independent accounting officer and therefore a degree of operational autonomy - which the new regional integrated care organisations, RICOs, will also have - means that it is still practically impossible to achieve a consistent framework across the system.  <br/><br/>The HSE places an emphasis on home care, yet I would argue that when it comes to service delivery the priority is secondary to the priority it accords to its own internal industrial relations.  That must be named, acknowledged and discussed.  I am happy to be proved wrong, but I do not believe I will be.  <br/><br/>An effective system for dealing with grievances and complaints is essential to ensure quality home care services.  We are dealing with individuals who are at the front line, with enormous independence and autonomy who usually work unsupervised in someone's home.  HSE systems in this regard are unfit for purpose, which is a direct result of arrangements set by the Government, not by the HSE. </p> <p>As I understand it, the HSE wrote to the Government two years ago asking for those policies to be changed.  That does not relate just to home care; it relates across the system.  There has been no movement on that but there needs to be movement in that regard.  In our case, if we have a complaint it is signed and sealed within 30 days.  That can include either the rejection of the complaint, the person is dismissed or anything in between.  We have seen cases in the HSE where a similar situation has dragged on for years.  There is no reason for that to happen.  Furthermore, because of differential arrangements mandated by the HSE regarding working conditions for its own directly employed staff and for the staff of commission services, the hourly cost of direct provision is up to twice the cost of commissioned services at current rates.  That is a major discrepancy and potentially, if we want to look at it that way, a total waste of money.  That is worth discussing as well but I do not have time to develop it now.</p> <p> In terms of commissioning, Family Carers Ireland would contend that since commissioning was introduced in 2010 there has been a steady reduction in baseline quality indicators.  When the shift to a lowest common denominator home support specification is put beside the increasingly complex cases now being assigned to the home care system, it looks to us like a serious accident waiting to happen.</p> <p> Far from saving money, we believe this year&rsquo;s tender for home support services has resulted in avoidably higher costs of service because of the extent of gaming of the scoring system that was allowed in that tender.  To be clear, I am not suggesting anything that happened was unlawful.  I am just saying it was very bad policy.</p> <p> On regulation, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was originally scheduled to have assumed responsibility for regulating home care by 2016.  There is not even an alternative date in place.  The implications of failing to adhere to this timetable are not even being discussed or addressed, possibly because a HIQA survey in 2017 showed that 76% of people responding to the survey thought there was independent regulation in place.  I am sure the HSE would rather not be the regulator but if one is the regulator, the commissioner and the direct provider, one has a massive conflict of interest.</p> <p> This is, inevitably, a very high level review of issues, with five minutes to do it, relating to improving home care.  I will be happy to discuss any of the points later.</p></speech>

They are very useful.  This question is to whoever would like to respond.  In terms of the quality of the service, several witnesses suggested that the service is under more pressure than it was previously.  Reference was made earlier to 2008 and, just a minute ago, to a degrading of the service.  I have two questions.  First, how is the service doing over time?  Is it getting better or worse and If it is getting better or worse, in what ways?  There is time per person; consistency, for example, having the same carer available to the same person; waiting time and access to getting what one needs; the quality of the care provided; equipment that is sometimes needed and so forth.  The witnesses know that much better than I do.  How are we doing and, specifically, in what areas are services getting better or worse?</p>  <p>  In terms of the second opening question, several witnesses stated that access is getting more difficult.  I presume that means that waiting times are increasing and that the amount of care available per person or per home is decreasing.  On the basis that the spending on healthcare per person has increased every year for the past six years and is significantly higher than it was in 2008, what do the witnesses believe is happening if we are spending more money per person if the services are indeed getting worse?</p></speech>

It is quite simply demographics.  We have 20,000 people entering the 65 and older cohort each year.  A proportion of them, particularly those in their 80s, are likely to need home care if they want to stay out of hospitals and nursing homes.  It is a demographics issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of labour costs, it is labour-intensive work and there is no getting away from that.  Unit cost early rates are increasing, therefore, incrementally, that will continue. </p>  <p>  I cannot speak to the issue of quality equipment but to reiterate, there were 10% cuts overnight in home care provision in the tough years of 2011, 2012 and 2013.  They have begun to be restored but we are still playing catch-up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.376" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Crotty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00600"><p>I run a home care company in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dundrum areas of Dublin South.  To answer the Deputy's questions, the labour shortage is the biggest problem we face.  We are at full employment.  We are paying more per hour than we were a few years ago but it is becoming more difficult to recruit carers as they have a choice of other employment.  The number of hours per client is reducing over time.  Where someone might have got two or three hours a day from the HSE, they might get an hourly visit now or maybe half an hour, as someone said earlier, later in the day.  That is less attractive work for carers, regardless of the hourly rate.  The hourly rate is not as important as the conditions of employment.  Mr. Musgrave spoke about professionalisation of the industry and said we need to do all those things, and get more carers into the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat McLoughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00700"><p>We certainly have not caused any of the HSE's deficits.  In 2013, we received &euro;11 million from it and in 2018, we received &euro;11.2 million.  In terms of what has happened, with 4,000 new people being diagnosed with dementia each year, in effect the services have ended up being rationed.  People who might have been receiving two or three days a week in a day centre have been rationed.  We are paying our staff at 2010 rates of pay.  The differential between someone who commenced in the HSE in 2010 versus 2017 is now &euro;5,500 per annum.  That is for a care assistant providing direct care.</p>  <p>  We evaluate satisfaction with our services.  It is consistently high because we have the same staff.  They have empathy, they are trained and they are not into clock watching or pressure to go to another client.  People with dementia and their carers tell us that even if the State can give them only seven hours a week, they want the flexibility as to how that seven hours is used rather than giving one hour a day to get somebody up in the morning.  By the time the carer arrives, the person may be already up.  They may be living in a rural area.  They cannot get the time even to go into a shop.  Even if the HSE can give only a certain number of hours, it should give families and carers some role in determining how that is provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200006#H00800"><p>To give some examples of reductions in care, when tendering was introduced in 2010, organisations were allowed 48 hours to match a care worker to a particular case.  In some parts of the country, one is now given four hours.  Often one is not given details of the case to which one is being asked to match.  There is not even a pretence of trying to get suitable matching.  That is one example.</p>  <p>  We have gone from requiring staff to have a full QQI level 5 qualification by 2012 to the current competency assessment approach, which costs deliverers.  In our case it costs almost &euro;100,000 a year to administer this monster, which is really a way for the HSE to say it has checked thoroughly that these people are competent in that it made them certify themselves rather than simply requiring them to have a qualification.</p>  <p>  A major example is the 30-minute calls.  They are poor anyhow but in respect of 30-minute double assists, where one has to do something with somebody using a hoist, which involves two staff working together, we refuse to take those cases on the basis that it is a serious risk and we will not deal with it.  However, it is becoming commonplace to be asked to do it.</p>  <p>  There is another example that is less tangible.  I would argue that in the past ten years there has been a stripping out of social care into purely personal care.  Personal care is starting to be neglected in favour of clinical care.  However, the social care is very important.  When we talk about home care, it is meant to be an integrated, wraparound service.  It is not just a case of getting in there and stopping a person from dying today.</p>  <p>  In terms of where the money is going, I agree with the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, it is not going to us.  If the members could get an answer to that question, I would be very interested to hear it.  I am taking a crude figure as an example.  There was an office within the HSE, and I am taking into account the costs of the leader, the support team and all the rest, which had a budget of approximately &euro;500,000 a year to manage home care.  There are now two.  I do not understand the reason for that.  The members might get to the bottom of it but in terms of this issue, there is &euro;0.5 million on the spot.</p>  <p>  The second question was about access getting more difficult.  It has become routine in the past year for the HSE to arrive into a house and tell the person that because he or she gets the carer's allowance he or she will not get the home care package.</p> <p>This will cost the State money in two ways.  The State defended an action from the European Commission in the European courts on the exportability of carer's allowance.  It defended that action on the basis that this was an income support, not a payment for the delivery of home care services.  The HSE is now saying that is exactly what it is.  Income support for carers comes to &euro;1 billion per year.  Exportability will be a significant slice of that.  That is reckless.  Quite frankly, it is lunacy.  I do not believe it is being done intentionally but it does reflect a style of policy making that involves saying "this is what we are doing" with no consultation or discussion, instead of bringing people into a room and saying "this is what we intend to do, tell us if there is anything wrong with it and we will see if we can fix it."  The HSE seems to like to learn not just by bumping into things but by jumping off cliffs and then discovering what is going wrong.  </p> <p> Regarding the second problem, we have met people who have been told that in order to get services they needed as part of a home care package they could not undertake themselves, they had to give up their carer's allowance.  We had a case where somebody did that and then went back and said they had given back their carer's allowance to be told there was no budget to give them support.  Another case involved an able-bodied young adult son being required to move out of the house before they would consider that home care was needed.  That is how difficult it is becoming to get home care.  </p></speech>

If we are going to deny someone home care on the basis that someone is receiving carer's allowance, it is important that we remember that only a quarter of all carers receive carer's allowance in the first instance because it is means tested.  Those who are lucky enough to receive carer's allowance receive &euro;16 more than the basic social welfare rate.  By rationing, withdrawing or denying home support to such persons, we are telling them that they would be better off on jobseeker's allowance instead of carer's allowance.  Complicating this is the fact that carer's allowance for carers over 70 is assessed in the means test for the medical card.  It is not assessed if the person is under 60.  There is a litany of ways in which we are penalising and punishing family carers rather than recognising and rewarding them.  The pension is another example but I will leave that one.</p></speech>

In response to very clear frustrations the witnesses are obviously all managing on a daily basis, is anything working in the system?  What is going well?  In terms of the different types of support available, one of the presentations listed home care, home help hours, care packages and intensive home care packages.  We know there has been a shift from discretionary home care or home help hours to these care packages which, in some cases, make sense.  However, they do not always make sense, for example, in respect of cases in Wicklow with which I deal.  What is working?  What are the successes in the system on which we should build?  How is the mix working out between the different types of package available as in package versus home care versus home help hours and so forth?  Is there an opportunity to adjust the mix to bring in additional ones, stop doing particular ones and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Musgrave" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00400"><p>I will take Deputy Donnelly's first question.  HCCI welcomed the development of clinical governance in the HSE's 2018 tender, which many of my members have taken to mean having a qualified nurse or somebody similar.  Codifying that is a good development.  It is a baby step towards what regulation might look like and we think that is important, so that is one tick.  The effort by carers remains immense.  I attended the HCCI carers conference a couple of weeks ago and spoke to removed carers, some of whom were angry.  They got a much-needed pat on the back by a lot of people for the work they do.  My colleagues here would testify to that.  There is also a lot of expertise in the system.  Now that we have been operating for more than a decade, we have built up and have learned a lot of lessons.  The frustration, particularly in this room, arises out of the fact that this expertise does not seem to be capitalised on.  Again, while I would call that out as a positive development and a good thing, it is a shame that not much advantage seems to be taken of it.  I will let others address Deputy Donnelly's second question in more detail.</p></speech>

We have been consistently successful in growing our fund raising to &euro;3.2 million, which is shoring up State services.  On a positive note, the National Dementia Office is including persons with dementia and carers in all its working groups looking at diagnosis, post diagnosis, support and care pathways.  However, when we come to negotiating the service-level agreement with the CHO areas or the HSE, that is just set at nought and there is no further funding.  We also would be very supportive of the Understand Together campaign, which is raising awareness of dementia services.  It raises awareness but those people ring a national help line provided by our volunteers six days a week who have to tell them that even though they have come forward, there is nothing for them if they are in a county with no services.  We support Government policy in respect of the national dementia strategy.  It is not mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare.  We support all of the initiatives that Government and the National Dementia Office are undertaking.  We have been included in it but we are simply not seeing any dedicated resource for dementia and no realisation of just what it is like to be a family carer or indeed a person with dementia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dunne" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00600"><p>When one comes in here, and particularly when one is asked to boil down our statements to five minutes, it is inevitable that one will throw out the negativity.  It is worth acknowledging that millions of hours are being delivered.  It is a valuable service and a life saver for people.  There are individual care workers - not carers - within the system who provide an heroic service.  We were not unique in this, but during the storms last year I had a difficulty because when a Status Red weather warning is issued, the rule is that services are cancelled.  People were going out delivering meals and making unscheduled and unpaid calls to ensure the people they were looking after were catered for.  That is the positive energy in the system and it is worth celebrating and acknowledging.  Having said that, the system is not fostering or feeding that.  I know where the Deputy is coming from in terms of looking at the positives as well.  What I am looking at is the trajectory, which is going the wrong way.  Dublin is broken.  The Deputy mentioned the difficulties in terms of Dublin.  We did not even bid to deliver home care services in the Dublin area this year because it is a zoo.  This relates to the policies and systems that are in place.  It certainly does not relate to the care workers and the clients.</p></speech>

We still do not have that.  I do not envy Laura Magahy and her small staff untangling that one because it is the legacy of the extremely bizarre hybrid system we have inherited and managed to devolve incrementally over the decades.  We do not have a strong and robust eligibility and entitlement framework.  Therefore, the HSE has a myriad of ways of looking at this.  The nine CHO areas have different ways of measuring, allocating and prioritising need.  This, quite frankly, is shocking - that a small territory of a few million people is unable to know what is happening and project adequately.  Our colleagues have told the committee what is coming down the track.  This has to stop.  It needs to be addressed very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018121200007#J00800"><p>I apologise for not being here at the beginning of the meeting but I was watching on the monitor.  I thank the witnesses for appearing before us this morning.  My questions are pretty much directed at all of the witnesses.  My first question concerns rates of pay.</p> <p>We know the rates of pay that are paid to home help carers directly employed by the HSE.  I am curious to know the average rate of pay for home carers.  I think pay and conditions are central to the recruitment issue to which the witnesses have alluded.</p> <p> The average number of hours per person is going down but the number of hours allocated is going up.  The Minister for Health often loudly proclaims the percentage increase in the number of home help hours but, in real life, people come into my clinics saying they cannot get home help hours.  There is a disconnect there.</p> <p> Ms Dean mentioned calls that last only 30 minutes.  Have the witnesses encountered a 15-minute call?  I have heard of that happening and it shocks me.  Collectively, those agents who provide home care should be telling the HSE, with one voice, that there is a minimum standard and number of minutes that should apply.  The minimum should be an hour.  Half an hour is not right but 15 minutes is beyond even that.  I have heard of that, so perhaps the witnesses could comment.</p> <p> Mr. Dunne mentioned that it is possible to game the numbers in the tender process.  I would like him to elaborate on that because we need more information about that. </p> <p> I ask the witnesses individually if they would subscribe to a national minimum standard in terms and conditions.  To put my cards on the table, some of the witnesses may be aware of the fact that I used to represent home helps in the HSE and voluntary sectors, though regrettably not so much in the private sector.  There may have been improvements in that since I moved on.  One issue that was raised by our members was about stability.  I could never get my head around the fact that the work was there and there was a demand for the service and yet the contract could not reflect that.  I believe that, if there was standardisation in terms and conditions, a standard minimum rate of pay and standardised contract, we would not have the issue with recruitment because very often when people leave the home care sector it is not to go to jobs with a dissimilar rate of pay.  The rates are often very similar but the difference is stability.  In the new job, one might work on a changing shift pattern but would work for only eight hours a day.  They are some of the most flexible workers in the workforce, as both I and the witnesses know.  They are looking only for stability of income and the capacity to plan in a small way.  Oftentimes carers leave for shift work so the awkward times are not the problem, it is more being able to know how much work they will have.  I could never understand why the HSE would not commit to that contract in the context of rising demand.  I would be interested to know the witnesses' views on a standardised contract and guaranteed minimum numbers of hours, given we know there will be an increase in the demand for home care.</p> <p> Mr. McLoughlin mentioned that funding for the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland, ASI, over a long number of years, had gone from &euro;11 million to &euro;11.2 million.  Perhaps the other organisations might be in a position to comment on their funding, or their contracts with the HSE and what direction that is going in because it does not seem to be moving very fast.  I would be interested to know that.</p> <p> Finally, is there a role for HIQA, or a similar agency, in providing the regulation?  We know that regulation is very tricky for any lone worker who deals with the public.  Do the witnesses see a role for HIQA in bringing in that regulation?  Do they see a role for another agency?  I see the difficulty with the HSE being the regulator and the commissioner and provider of services.  That would cause some issues.  HIQA is already in place, so do the witnesses see its remit expanding, or do they think that there might be a role for another body?</p></speech>

I have already outlined the fact that, in the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland service level agreement with the HSE, it has not been able to pay its staff an increment.  We took our cuts in 2010 and no member of staff has taken an increment since then in ASI.</p>  <p>  Our allocation of hours is going down because we do not provide generic home care services so we did not get the tender.  Our home care footprint is reducing by anywhere between about 8% and 12% each year.</p>  <p>  I would absolutely support national minimum standards.  The number of intensive home care packages at the moment for persons with dementia in the community is 178.  That is not allowed to grow, as far as I understand, unless somebody dies or goes into residential care.</p>  <p>  I totally support the idea of a separate regulator.  What is going on at the moment is dreadful.  If a respite centre provides one week of respite for somebody with dementia, a nurse is in charge right throughout the evening.  Nobody else will be allowed to give a drug to the individual.  There has to be a care pathway for it.  There is nothing like that for the other 51 weeks of the year but, for that one week, the State gets very self-defensive about how it provides care.  We absolutely support a separate regulator.</p>  <p>  Over the five-year period that Deputy O'Reilly mentioned, we have moved our fundraising from about &euro;2 million to more than &euro;3 million and that is propping up the system.</p></speech>

HCCI, supports an independent regulator.  The more pertinent question is the model of regulation.  Would it be a compliance model, where inspectors are sent into people's homes, which would be quite invasive?  Would it be a licence to operate a model from existing providers?  The more interesting and complicated question is how to regulate the sector, rather than who would do it, although I agree the HSE should not do it because of the conflicts of interest.</p>  <p>  HCCI does not receive any funding other than from members but, similar to what Mr. McLoughlin was saying, most of our members are operating on legacy rates.  The HSE has not updated its hourly rates of pay dating back to 2008.  For instance, some carers are going into one home at one rate and into another home at another rate, which is unusual.  The tender ties members in for two years and the HSE refused to touch or to reopen it.</p>  <p>  I will return to the Deputy's point about national minimum standards because I think that is the largest topic.</p>  <p>  No member has reported to me about a 15-minute call.</p>  <p>  The rate of pay averages around &euro;14 by the time the higher rate for weekend work is included, as well as holidays and other entitlements.  The national minimum standards point ties back to the rate of pay.  HCCI has a set of national standards to which every member subscribes.  I came to this job only in September and one thing I want to do is to update those standards to perhaps include some of the points about which the Deputy is talking.  Other than the HSE tender, the standards of my organisation are the only ones of which I know that apply nationally and against which members are independently audited.  </p>  <p>  We need to look at professionalising care workers because, at the moment, we commission services based on one hourly rate of pay, regardless of whether it is a legacy rate.  We do not ask if someone is high, medium or low dependency, or requires a care worker with a separate set of skills.  People in my family are frontline care workers so I know this well.  What is the career pathway to develop and incentivise people to get more skills?  We want to look at that.  The current commissioning system is locked into a cycle of fastest-finger-first bidding to provide the care, rather than taking a holistic approach, which I am hoping this committee is getting to the bottom of, because the Department and HSE do not seem to want to engage with me about this.  We are locked into a stalemate whereby there are some good ideas at the table about national minimum standards but the pathway to implementation and further development seems obscure.</p></speech>

The number of service providers is also an issue.  In a small catchment area services are spread between different service providers which brings me back to the point of employing enough staff to be able to take up an hour's work here and an hour's work there.  If the number of carers could be spread over a smaller number of service providers that might give an opportunity to employ people on fixed contracts of, for example, 20 hours.  That is where the stability piece would come in and raise the bar a little.</p></speech>

On a practical level, if one takes for example a home care package in Arklow and there is a carer who wants to go there, one wants to add two or three more home care packages so one has a cluster of them in the area.  Each home care package is commissioned independently of all the others so there is no opportunity to cluster them.  I do not mean to focus on Arklow but if one takes a home care package there, assuming one's rates are competitive, one should be able to get the next three or four that come along so there would be one carer who goes there and has a whole morning's work.  Is that what Ms Carthy is saying?</p></speech>

In the context of stability, we had a case recently where we could tell they were HSE packages because there was a four-hour block in the middle of the day.  That is gold to any commercial provider.  I am putting ourselves in that category for the purposes of a tender.  We recruited 12 staff.  A block of cases came to us very suddenly out of the blue and we put in place the packages.  Three months later we got a call basically saying, "thanks very much, you can fire all your staff now as our people are ready to take over again".  The stability for the HSE staff is coming at the cost of the rest the sector.  I am not saying that is necessarily what should happen but that is the way it is being operated at the moment.</p></speech>

If the HSE was adequately fulfilling the demand, there would not be a need for outside recruitment.  There would be a sufficient pool of staff.</p></speech>

It is not an ideological issue: it just would not work because the flexibility is not there.  I attended this committee some years ago talking about a man who was being put to bed at 3 o'clock in the afternoon for the only reason that his HSE worker did not want to work any later.  I was told three weeks later that the case had been sorted, but that is the system.</p>  <p>  As Mr. Musgrave said, HIQA is the one that has most often been cited to do this but it would probably have to stop at the front door.  The problem with that is there is a limit to how much one is regulating the quality of care.  On the other hand, to get into a different sort of model, one must first look outside the health system.  I have a mental image of a reasonably elderly lady carrying her adult son up a very narrow stairs because the only toilet in the house was upstairs and the son was profoundly disabled.  That is an issue of housing adaptation.  That is clearly a major health and safety issue, but are we going to mandate an initiative which states a house is unsuitable and a person must go into care.  We are moving somewhat in that direction with Children First because once one starts to put in place safeguarding measures an inspector will deem a house to be unsafe and that will be the end of it.  There is no debate and no regard to what the family wants.  I do not know what the answer is but introducing HIQA into the process seems to be a reasonable step along the way.</p>  <p>  For us, the direction of funding has to do with consolidation.  We used to have 50 separate funding agreements with the HSE, and that has now been consolidated down to ten, which is very good.  However, like the other organisations, last year there was a big debate and we were told there could be no increase in costs and no reduction in services.  The HSE was doing both itself but that did not really matter; that was it.  We went in and we kicked the stuffing and we got some increases here and we got some reduction in services there, but that is the mindset.  As somebody said, that goes back to the legacy costs.  We were awarded a contract in 2008 or 2010 and I got a contract modification recently to say the HSE would continue to pay us the same rate as was set then to deliver healthcare.  The rate is &euro;14 an hour and if one maps that onto the pay of a home care worker, one is ignoring the fact that, first, there are specifications in the contract around management.  I mentioned already the competency assessment process, which costs approximately &euro;100,000 a year.  That has to be paid for out of the &euro;14 an hour.  There are three pages of policies.  I do not mean a three page policy, I mean a three page list of policies with which we have to comply.  That all costs.  When people ask where the money is going, it is going on bureaucracy, which is required although it is not all necessary, but it is there and we are contracted to deliver it.</p>  <p>  I was asked to comment on the tender process and gaming.  The way the tender process is constructed, one is asked to quote for hours during different periods &ndash; day time hours, night time hours, weekend day time, weekend night time and bank holidays.  It is strange to be asked to tender for bank holidays because there is a statutory definition of what they cost and it does not vary.  In providing the scoring for each of the rates, there was a notional number of hours that would be provided.  One of the frustrations of bidding in this competition is that one can be certain the statistics one is being given are wrong.  In fact, it says in the tender that one cannot rely on any of the figures outlined.  People look at the figures and they look at their own experience.  Clearly, some people looked at it and said, sure there are very few night time calls so the lowest bid on the night time rate was lower than the lowest bid on the day time rate, which from her background Deputy O'Reilly might say is suggestive of gaming.  The advantage of that is that one gets a very significant score by having that ridiculously low rate.  That is the gaming element.  Because one got a high score for the low price on night time rates, one was able to charge a higher rate for the day time rates, which is from where most of the billing comes, and one did not get penalised because one had off-set the penalty with the low score.  People got through with the higher hourly rate in the day time than would have been optimal from the point of view of the HSE's budget.</p>  <p>  A secondary issue is that we would argue that the low rate is borderline if not below the minimum wage.  It is not below the formal minimum wage.  People talk about travel expenses.  The key cost with travel is time.  It is a requirement under European law to recognise travel time, but it is not a requirement under Irish law, which is interesting, but European law takes precedence until such time as it is triggered in Ireland.  Up to now it would have required a court case to trigger it, but interestingly there was a development in the European Court of Justice in the past fortnight which opened another avenue for that.  The travel time is the major expense.  When the HSE is paying its own staff, it pays them a slightly higher rate, but I would not begrudge that.  There are all sorts of flexibility that organisations such as ours can give in terms of a little Christmas bonus or whatever else that allows us to even it up, but the big difference is travel time.  I am a very innocent little man, and the thing that mystifies me most is that if we are contracted to deliver a package from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., we deliver a package from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., yet when I talk to people, especially in Dublin, they ask: what does 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. mean?  I say it means 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., but apparently it does not.  People take their travel time out of that hour.  Even if the HSE wanted to give out a 15 minute package, it would have to pay us for 30 minutes under the rules of the tender.  I wonder if people are experiencing a 15 minute care package because a chunk of time is being used for travel.</p></speech>

About 50 to 100 carers came together.  At every one of those forums, carers mentioned at least once 15 minute calls and half-hour calls.  Yesterday in Donegal I had a girl whose mother who has dementia is getting a 20-minute call to get her out of bed and washed.  I reiterate what Mr. McLoughlin said.  Families are grateful to get anything.  The issue is quality.  Quality sometimes does not come into it because families are so grateful to get anything that they just take it.  They do not complain.  They are terrified to complain when the quality is questionable.  It is worth repeating what Mr. McLoughlin said earlier.  We have an expression in Family Carers Ireland that sometimes home support hours are inflicted on families.  Families take whatever hours they get when they are given them.  It might not suit the family at all because someone is there between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. for example.  People will take them because that is all that is available.  It is important to restate that.  People will not complain, even about the shorter calls, because of the fear of the consequences and repercussions.</p></speech>

I thank them for all the work they are doing in this very important and growing area.  I will return to the cost issue in tendering for contracts.  I was given figures some time ago that showed private home care providers are quoting something like &euro;22 or &euro;24 an hour.  They referred to deducting what they pay to the staff, which is the hourly rate, and adding in the costs of administration, insurance and all the other costs associated with providing a service.  Has anyone asked the HSE for a breakdown of what it costs it to provide homecare per hour when the cost of its administration service and insurance is taken into account?  I was told it was costing the HSE around &euro;32 per hour to provide home care.  Can anyone give information on that?  Mr. Dunne spoke earlier about-----</p></speech>

I am concerned about the people who are being required to provide the service and being asked to tender.  The tender has to meet the HSE's requirements but what is being paid out is way under what it costs the HSE to run it.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years the HSE has taken on an additional 13,000 people in all areas, including nursing, administration and caring staff.  I have heard complaints about companies that were providing home care and a lot of their staff have been recruited by the HSE and have been given contracts.  There are more than 2,000.  Will the witnesses give some clarification on that?  I understand Nursing Homes Ireland is having a problem retaining staff as are the private home care providers.  I am looking for some clarification on that.</p>  <p>  The third issue I want to raise is our growing elderly population.  The figures have been referred to at this meeting and numerous other times.  We now have full employment.  How can we get more people to provide homecare if such competitiveness is a feature?  I understand there are difficulties involved in bringing people in from abroad.  It is a challenge.  The people who are providing homecare privately have the challenge of recruiting workers.  The HSE has difficulties in getting carers for people despite the fact it is paying people a reasonable rate.  We are now facing a major challenge in that area.  How do we deal with that challenge?  </p>  <p>  Where the HSE is providing homecare, I have come across a number of cases where there is a major difficulty at both weekends and public holidays.  How do we deal with that issue?  On the one hand, the HSE is providing a very good service between 8 a.m. or 9.a.m and 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. five days a week but at weekends and on public holidays there is a major problem.  There is no company available to provide care over the weekends.  I am talking in particular about people who live alone and there is no immediate family around them.  How do we face that challenge?</p></speech>

In our research over the years, we have made assumptions because the HSE could not or would not give us the data.  We looked at &euro;20 per hour; more recently &euro;25 per hour is the assumption we are going on.  I am not convinced.  I think it is probably closer to &euro;32 per hour.  Pension and travel costs are not reflected properly in the costing.  When the Minister announces an extra 100 homecare packages, the cost base is a little naive.  Perhaps the committee would seek that information directly from the HSE.  We would love to hear it.</p>  <p>  The Senator was spot on about the increase in staff numbers.  The reality in spite of the reference to primary care being crucial is that hospitals continue to recruit more staff and overrun their budgets massively, five or ten times compared with homecare and community care.  I will give an example.  The committee discussed it last week.  An extra 47 public health nurses have been taken on in the past three to four years, which is a 3% increase.  If one contrasts that with the 27% increase in staff at grade 8 and above, one questions the priorities.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of foreign care workers, the reality is they will provide a future supply of care.  Valuing that and giving people the legitimacy to be employed legally here is really important.  A number of the not-for-profit organisations have made representations on reviewing the criteria and deeming care workers to be in short supply to make it easier for people from abroad to come here and work legitimately.  It will be part of the solution.</p></speech>

We get about &euro;2.4 million from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for our community employment, CE, schemes.  About one in five of our staff is on one of those schemes.  We have situations where we find those CE workers difficult to replace.  What happens in that situation is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection shows a saving and the Department of Health has to fight for the additional resource, perhaps 19 hours, being used by that CE employee.  I have raised the issue with two Ministers of State.  I have said it does not make sense.  There is a pot of money, about &euro;2.4 million, and we could put it towards a proper training programme and a career structure so people can work in areas such as dementia or Alzheimer care and be available in the marketplace.  Some private providers have come together on that issue.  It needs to be made attractive.  We are losing staff to the HSE.  I do not want to over-egg that issue but we have noticed a trend that staff who are working part time with us have advised us they are working part time with a private operator and doing private hours for individuals.  That puts individual staff members in a very difficult position.  They are dealing with three sets of rules and policies and procedures.  They are dealing with Garda vetting for providers.  Safeguarding issues may be also dealt with differently in different organisations.  The situation of part-time carers is very difficult.  It would be much better if there was a proper career structure and training pathway in place and that the money from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection was put towards a proper training programme in health.  That is the view of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.</p></speech>

That is not a cheap shot.  My last job, when I worked in the public sector, was to approve a budget for an organisation like the one with which I am now involved.  I went through it with a fine tooth comb, put lots of red lines through it, and ironically, three months later, I found myself running that organisation, trying to deliver the project on the budget.  I learned how sheltered the public sector is in terms of costing a service.  It is something the committee could usefully investigate.  Furthermore, if the committee does get an answer, I would be very happy to come back to the committee and give it the benefit of our insight on the cost structure that is being presented to it because we do it every day.  The HSE and its managers, to be fair, do not see most of the costs associated with the service; they see the direct pay cost but they do not see the rest.  </p> <p> The number of people we are losing to the HSE is not something I would over-egg but it is certainly true.  In 2011, in the good old days, when a FETAC qualification was specified, we trained all our staff up to that level.  It cost us tens of thousands of euro.  People said they could not afford it but we said that was the standard, we said we would meet it and we will.  We have now lost those staff.  We do not spend money achieving a standard that is not required because if we do, the people will be taken away from us.  There is a dysfunction there with a shortage of staff and the staff are getting cannibalised.  We keep an eye on the staff turnover metrics and we are pretty happy with our retention rate but we definitely do lose people, not only to the HSE but also to the nursing home sector.  When people get to a point where they need a block of work on which they can rely, we cannot provide that, and they go to work in the HSE or a nursing home.  People will work in our sector only if casual flexible hours suit them..  Whether that is good or bad, that is the reality. </p> <p>Deputy O'Reilly's argument for a set of national conditions are relevant.  I do not have any difficulty with that but the same conditions would have to apply everywhere.  I would say we are demanding of our staff in a way that I am not convinced, procedurally, the HSE is.  That is an issue that needs to be sorted out.</p> <p> On weekends and public holidays, we just got a request from a part of the country where the HSE asked if we would help at Christmas and the new year and we said we certainly would.  Our own packages are required to keep working over Christmas, we are a 365 day organisation.  If we are due to do something on Christmas day, we do it.  </p></speech>

We have marvellous, creative and very inspiring discussions about coproduction and codesign of services but I am not hearing any of this today.  Therefore, I want to bring the person back into the room.  As we speak about the back end technical part of this, which is obviously failing and not fit for purpose, every day and hour there are people in wholly unacceptable conditions.  Age Action is not at the technical end of this which we are leaving to our esteemed colleagues but the calls to our organisation are frankly heartbreaking.  The people out there do not know their entitlements and do not care about the back office technical end because they are suffering.  As Yeats would say, we are in the rag and bone shop of the heart.  The elected members here have a responsibility to be part of the robust discussion, which must happen in our society, about how we will arrive at a statutory home care system which is adequately funded and which meets need.</p></speech>

That is why we must grapple with the technicalities.  On the Senator's point about HSE's cost, I would reiterate that other than FOI requests, I do not see how we can get the information.  They have not met with my organisation or non-profits since April which for an operational forum design to get to the heart of a range of issues is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I also would not over-egg the agency recruitment of staff but it does go to the heart of the conflict of interest in the commission of care and hiring staff.  I have been told by members that packages seem to be launched almost on a pilot basis in some areas and once the HSE establishes that the packages can be run regularly, they then hire staff which leaves my members and others in a difficult situation, perhaps having to let go carers if they cannot find other work for them.  While the specific issue of the recruitment of staff may not be the most burning issue, the conflict of interest is one to which we must return.</p>  <p>  As Mr. Dunne noted, weekends and bank holiday work is something my members are required to do, and do provide.  They provide 24 hour care.  I am aware from my own family circumstances of people who are on call having to leave at all hours from family functions to provide care.  I have seen this in action.</p>  <p>  To get people into home care in the workforce will take a combination of capacity building and improving conditions.  HCCI submitted to the Economic Migration Policy Unit a proposal to allow non-EEA workers into the country.  We could do this and be innovative in how we do so.  We could take an approach where we look at where capacity is low in each CHO and establish how many more staff we need and their availability.  The mechanism to do that does not exist and, even if we did have it, we do not have the tools to increase the workforce.  That is what we are seeking.  Following Mr. McLoughlin's point, we need a step change in how we view the workforce, and career path and professionalisation is key to this.  </p>  <p>  On capacity, HCCI is working on a submission to the forum for social protection.  The social protection system is not currently designed for careworkers.  Instead of a tapering system where it is possible to work a certain number of hours and keep entitlements, it is calculated by day.  If someone provides a block of hours of much-needed care, and wants to do this, they will be penalised by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which will tell them they cannot have their entitlement for that day.  I am encouraged by the early signs that the Department is wiling to listen but I must work with others on a submission that puts the case, and I hope to get the committee members' support on that.  That would release more capacity and more people who want to provide care, but are currently penalised.  </p>  <p>  Commissioning is very important in this.  It is difficult to provide meaningful work for carers.  Part of this is rostering where, as Mr. Crotty noted, one can provide care in what would be a sensible way.  One would not send a delivery man half way around an area, he would be sent on a route.  I am not suggesting we send people on routes but if we had a more holistic system and planned more effectively we could give carers a better quality of life and improve the quality of their work.</p></speech>

We have met representatives of the Department in recent years.  We met them when unemployment was at 10% because we could not encourage people to come off the live register and take up caring roles and we wanted to be creative and see what we could do.  The Department pointed to four pre-existing schemes, such as the part-time jobs incentive scheme, that they felt should address the issue but they simply did not.  The Department, which now has the employment portfolio, should be thinking in this space and need to get much more creative.  For example, carers in receipt of carer's allowance are allowed 15 hours a week. Seven or eight years ago income earned during the 15 hours as a home care worker was exempt from the means test for carer's allowance as an incentive to encourage people to work as home care workers.  I am not advocating that specifically but it was a sign of an eagerness of support.  We have 80,000 carers who receive carer's allowance.</p> <p>They are allowed to work 15 hours.  Most of them would like to work in a paid capacity, in paid care work, and we should be looking at how we can incentivise them.  This would address the likes of the pension issue and the financial issues they face.  It would also help them to stay engaged with the labour market while they are caring.  I therefore agree completely that we must look towards the Department of social protection, which now has that employment element of the portfolio as well.</p></speech>

From a practical point of view, what triggers a request for home care?  It depends upon the availability of families to supply support themselves.  Many families make extraordinary efforts in supporting their family members, even their neighbours, in remaining in their homes.  I am aware of cases in which people have been kept out of hospital and out of nursing homes by the extraordinary efforts made by family members who either are living with the person who needs care or come home to look after them, taking time off work.  There is the intervention of the public health nurse, the community intervention teams and, eventually, palliative care teams that come in to look after patients.  An extraordinary amount of care is provided in the home by family members.  There is never a request for home care because they want to do it themselves.  There are other families who cannot do this.  I refer to patients living on their own and their families.  Either they do not have a family or their family is scattered around the world so they do not have that capacity.  An extraordinary amount of work is done by family members in looking after their sick and disabled relatives at home.  Eventually, though, there is a trigger in that there is a requirement for home help or a home care package.  It might come from the patient himself or herself, the public health nurse or the doctor, or, if the patient is in a hospital, when they are being discharged there is a requirement.  There are many triggers for the requests for home help and home care packages.  When this trigger is pulled, a request is put in to the HSE, usually by the public health nurse, but it could be by the hospital, and this is then assessed by the HSE.</p>  <p>  Here I see a problem because now it goes out to tender.  What are the criteria for the tendering process?  How does one decide what someone needs and how it will be delivered?  Quite often home care is delivered in a very fixed and strict manner.  It might not fit the working arrangements of the people who live at home with the patient.  They may have to go to work.  There can therefore be a lack of flexibility when the home care is actually provided.  As someone here mentioned, it may come when there is help at home and they need the help when they are not at home to look after their relative or friend.  Is there sufficient flexibility in the system to do this?  I am really interested in the criteria used to decide how much home help one gets and who gives it.  I am aware of supported housing for elderly people where there might be four different organisations coming in to the same group of 15 or 16 houses when one person could deliver the home care for the people in that very concentrated area.  There might be four different suppliers coming in to give the care, which does not make any sense.  Is there joined-up thinking in how the tendering process is used effectively and cost-effectively?  Furthermore, carers who provide care at home also require respite care.  Is there sufficient support for carers who need a rest themselves from looking after their relatives?  Perhaps the witnesses would like to discuss this point.</p></speech>

The tender is a way for the HSE to pull in supplementary flexible support for a service that is mainly delivering itself.  That is how I would describe it.  There are huge variations geographically around the country.  In some parts of the country the HSE employs thousands of home care workers itself and provides most of the service and only fills in the edges.  In other parts of the country the history is one of outsourcing, so there is flexibility.  To respond to the questions the Chairman asked, an application process has been just put in place, and the interesting thing is that the application must be made by the person needing the home care.  It is not made by a family member, the public health nurse or the hospital.  I do not know how this will work.  It is in its very early stages.</p>  <p>  As for the assessment, again, the Chairman is probably better equipped to probe this, but my understanding is that the care needs assessment is carried out in two phases.  There is a clinical and social care assessment.</p></speech>

What I mean is that there are people who sit down and say, "This is what this person needs."  That then gets passed to a budget office, which says, "This is what this person is getting."  This is an interesting approach, but my understanding is that is how it works.</p>  <p>  Regarding the flexibility of hours, a pilot programme was trialled in Clare last year.  I refer to client-directed home care, which is a model used internationally.  The one thing I will tell the committee about this is that client-directed home care in Ireland has nothing to do with any of the international models but it does allow one improvement, that is, some flexibility around timing and how one phases one's hours.  Given the industrial relations element of core hours and work outside certain hours, I was curious as to how client-directed home care was compatible with the current agreements in respect of HSE staff.  I asked, what are the limits of this?  The answer is that client-directed home care would be offered to people for whom the HSE feels it would be suitable.  I do not know what this means but it covers a multitude and does not suggest a real openness to flexibility and so on.  It is moving slowly in that direction, however.  There are huge problems with client-directed home care.  The way it happened in Clare is that people were handed a list of 20 providers when they were at a peak crisis and looking for home help and were told, "Off you go now.  Sort it out."  One of our worries and suspicions is that in areas where the HSE is struggling to deliver, even with the assistance of the contracted providers to deliver home care, by handing over that piece of paper, the responsibility suddenly passes to the family rather than to the HSE as the service provider.  There are a lot of issues to consider, but if the committee hears talk of client-directed home care, and it probably will, it should be aware that it is highly problematic but may contain the seeds of something that will lead to flexibility down the road.</p></speech>

It is a bit of a joke because at the end of the day one may or may not get this.  Then one must go out and fix it.  The HSE retains oversight to ensure that one's care needs are being met, so one goes off and negotiates with all the providers and then one must go back to the HSE and get it to sign off that what has been negotiated is acceptable to it.  Now, there is good reason for this.  One does not want the &euro;200 to be spent on ice cream.  At the same time, though, all it is doing is creating a huge amount of extra work and pressure for the family.</p></speech>

The client gets an approved list of providers.  Until recently he or she listed three providers that he or she preferred and, in turn, the local health office offered the case to the first, second and third choice until one provider accepted the case.  That situation was changed in the 2018 tender and now there is a system which some of us call a case of the fastest finger.  I mean an offer is made to all of the providers and whoever answers the email first is awarded the case.  That is not a good situation because there is no time to think about whether one has an appropriate carer or service for the entire hours, for the week, etc.  At the moment, our experience in CHO 6 and CHO 7 is that cases are being accepted by providers within one or two minutes of an email being issued.</p></speech>

That is partly due to the way services are commissioned and incentivised by the HSE.  In terms of my group, about 60% of a total membership of 70 provide care in Dublin.  The way services are designed to be commissioned means the HSE does not take on a lot of the Dublin work.  Also, there is no time for my members to cherrypick as they are given only a few minutes notification about a package.  Each case is relatively anonymous because one gets only a brief profile.  I would push back on the accusation of cherrypicking mainly because providers do not have the time.</p>  <p>  In terms of the deeper point, when these interventions happen or when a package is awarded, it is usually as a result of a failure in the primary care system.</p></speech>

We reckon that 360,000 people provide such care and they continue to do so.  Even when there is a good homecare package there usually is a family member who steps up to the plate in terms of the relationship with the care providers and the public health nurse.  Ideally, if we had a more well developed primary care system more of that work would fall to professionals.</p>  <p>  The Chairman made a point about respite care.  The evidence is clear and the figures do not lie.  There has been almost a 40% reduction in the provision overnight respite care.  I cannot fully understand what that is about.  Is it about regulation?  Is it about the HSE getting out of that work because it is difficult to do well?  </p>  <p>  The Chairman asked how needs are assessed.  We would like that information.  We know from our research that assessments are done in different ways.  We asked the HSE to tell us how long people must wait but their people in many of the regions could not tell us.  We asked for a figure on the length of gap between the assessed clinical need and provision.  Unfortunately, many units were unwilling or unable to give the information, which is beyond belief.  The HSE's service plans from 2010 to 2018 have referenced the idea of developing a single assessment tool.  It remains unclear to us why this has not been rolled out to date. </p></speech>

There is absolutely none.  There is a requirement for a person lucky enough to get a carer's allowance that he or she provides at least 35 hours of care each week.  Many carers provide 168 hours.  I am entitled to 26 days off a year but they have no entitlement.  We believe that carers should receive a minimum of 21 days of respite a year as part of the statutory homecare scheme where a full-time family carer is present.  This provision is increasingly important because, which has been mentioned, increasingly the family member is included in the homecare package of support.  Where one gets a homecare package that requires two people to use a house or whatever, it is the family carer who is the second person.  Therefore, they are being professionalised and subsumed into the system but for no reward.  A carer in this case is not entitled to a single day's respite in a year.</p></speech>

Is that what Ms Duffy is speaking about?  Does she mean negotiating with the family member on how best to give flexible homecare support?</p></speech>

First, the Scandinavian system ensures the lead responsibility lies with the State so the State takes responsibility.  The problem there is that if one rocks up to the hospital, care home or local health agency and says "I am worried about my mother", the staff there can say, "Go away.  We are looking after her".</p>  <p>  Second, in former Eastern European countries it is the responsibility of the family.  Therefore, the State says it will do nothing for a person as he or she has family and it is their job to provide care.  We are saying both of those systems would be unacceptable in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Third, we cite the Portuguese model, not because it is perfect but because it has a pretty clear constitutional kind of text.  In that instance, the primary responsibility lies with the family but the State recognises a duty to support the family in fulfilling its primary responsibility in regard to care.  We think that model strikes the appropriate medium.  </p>  <p>  In terms of some work on hospital satisfaction, roughly about 18% of people in hospital do not have a family member visiting them or keeping in touch.  We interpret that as 80% of people having family carers while 20% do not.  </p>  <p>  I echo what Mr. O'Sullivan said and appreciate the comments the Chairman made about carers.  On the subject of respite care, our sense of what is happening is that there are stepdown beds.  Many respite facilities have been taken over to deal with hospital discharges.  Good, bad or indifferent, that is a dilemma.</p>  <p>  Let me outline the biggest issue with respite.  There has been no serious discussion about respite.  Last year, there was a programme broadcast called "Prime Time - Carers in Crisis".  A week later the Minister for Health announced that ten new facilities would be opened to provide respite and I thought to myself, Mother of God, the speed of reaction is wonderful.  Later I realised he was responding to the previous year's "Prime Time" special that highlighted buildings around the country that had been bought for respite but were not being staffed and so they came through.  He announced, with some satisfaction, that there was &euro;10 million in extra spending, all of these new beds and that there would be a great increase in respite this year, although mainly for people with disabilities.  So far this year the level of respite provided is down and I do not know where it has disappeared to.  Stepdown beds and hospital discharges have absorbed or taken over a lot of capacity.</p></speech>

He is right that there are serious delays and technical issues, and the HSE is burdened with many competing demands.  This is a tool which could make one part of it work much more easily.  It is not being prioritised and we are deeply concerned.</p></speech>

Our study paints a picture of three quarters of family carers having no training.  Some 48% look after the spouse for their total waking time.  Most carers were on medication, with 57% on medication for blood pressure.  This is often the time when their own care breaks down.  One in four were frail or on the road to frailty after just one year of caring.  Going back to the point I made to Deputy O'Reilly, because of the difference in regulation of respite in the home or in a facility registered by HIQA, we were not able to recruit the staff because of pay rates or HIQA happened to require a continuity.  We had to exit that service.  We have a respite centre with 11 beds which has been lying idle for two years and we now hope to contract with a private provider to provide it.  Some 1,100 people were denied one week's respite which would have been superb for those with dementia and for carers.  We have a dichotomy with the registration and regulation of home care as opposed to residential care.  There is a very elaborate system and I am not denying that it needs to be, but when one holds a mirror to what is available in respite in the community, it shows the lack of provision to support family carers.</p></speech>

I have known nearly everybody who has come in as a witness for many years.  We use the term &quot;service providers&quot; for these organisations.  That is true but I think we should underline the service they are providing to us today, which is about their reflection, intelligence, insight, problem-solving and analysis.  We have a conundrum as a committee.  How will we pull that into different streams?  I apologise that I was not here at the start of the meeting.  I think what I have heard is a proxy for many of the ills and challenges in our health provision.  I am deliberately not saying &quot;health system&quot; because I hear over and over about all the things that clash with each other in that enterprise.</p><p>It would be useful for the committee to reflect on what it has heard this morning aside from each of the particular things that witnesses have said to us.  I can list things such as hospitals versus the rest of the health system, statutory underpinning versus schemes that are ad hoc or on an administrative basis where the rope can be pulled out from under a body, and whether it is person-centred or system-centred.  There are social aspects to consider.  Other Departments are involved, such as the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has useful involvement in employment.  There is the housing issue.  This committee was involved in work earlier this year when it collaborated with a couple of other committees.  We can talk about this over and over with regard to health but some of the solutions are with other Departments.  The institutional care clashes with community and home care.  I have said it before.  I see young people going into nursing homes and institutions and cannot but think that some or all of that relates to the rationing of supports on the other side.  There are issues with respite to address.  Those are my opening remarks which I wanted to make public.  There was much directed at us as a committee.</p><p>Ms Deane from Age Action talked about eligibility and entitlement going back many years.  That brings us back to the statutory underpinning versus administrative schemes.  Do people have any comment on it?  If I am not mistaken, there is a commitment to introduce legislation that opens up a fair pitch to play on.  That would have the objective of redressing the pull away from where we want people to be.  Mr. Pat McLoughlin from the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland made striking comments.  Am I right in what I am saying?  Since the recession ended at the end of 2013, the witnesses gave a scenario that &euro;11.2 million of State funding was provided with voluntary funding going from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million.  That is the opposite to the end of a recession.  Is that more or less what the witnesses are all experiencing?  If it is, we have a mammoth issue with where our health system is going.  It has been a year and a half since Sl&aacute;intecare, our ten year plan, was made.  We are still not on the road with it.  We have a microcosm here of the large ills in the system.  I think Mr. John Dunne talked about social care <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>home care.  Will he address that?  Where does care reach people beyond their home, if it does?</p><p>This is maybe a provocative question.  We all hear about the hospital crisis, the trolley crisis and the winter issue.  What is the &quot;trolley crisis&quot; for the witnesses?  Is there something that can be expressed that captures the witnesses' side of trying to provide for and support people in the community?  We all have the vision of the trolleys backed up.  Nobody sees what is going on here.  One can go around the edges of a hospital or photograph the ambulances backed up but one cannot do so here.  What is the image here that captures starkly the essence of the problem for people and families?</p></speech>

It is scary for us to provide 68% of all community dementia services.  I do not think there is another sector where the Government and State are reliant to that extent on one organisation to provide services.</p> <p>That organisation is paying its staff at 2010 rates.  It has increased its fundraising by &euro;1 million.  We have ten minibuses which need to be replaced.  We authorised one last week which had travelled 437,000 km and was 12 years old.  These minibuses are to gather people in the community and bring them into centres.  Approximately 80% of those get a maximum of one or two days' service.  We have relied on the goodness of fundraising, especially corporate fundraisers, with companies giving us money.  We have not been able to pay our staff what we should be paying.  We are competing with the HSE.  Our fleet is in difficulty.  None of the &euro;3 million that we earn will have been achieved by six months because one cannot go out after Christmas to start fundraising again.  All of our fundraising is late in the year, from Tea Day to Memory Ribbon Day.  It means money is being spent without us knowing whether it will actually come in.  We have depleted our reserves to keep going for the State.  We cannot do that any more.</p> <p> That does not address what it is like for an Alzheimer's patient to be in an emergency department in the country at the minute, given what is going on.  They are in a crowded, noisy environment with poor signposting etc.  People with Alzheimer's on waiting lists for hip operations and cataracts cannot access our day services because there is no point in having somebody with difficulties of that nature trying to attend a day service.  It has become extremely difficult to paint that picture in the public arena with the system of funding we have.  We are seriously underfunded as a sector.  We do not want to provide any more services.  At this stage, we would prefer to say that we should de-risk the situation.  We cannot provide.  We would welcome the HSE providing in the counties in which we have no service.  We have no wish to be the top provider.  We are advocating on behalf of all people with dementia.  Who provides the care is a separate issue.</p></speech>

That reminds me of the UN convention's reference to the will and preference of people.  There is a question of how people are brought into it.  Mr. McLoughlin said that fundraising was increased by &euro;1 million.  Am I correct in saying that is 50%, from &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million?</p></speech>

We are also heavily reliant on volunteers in our service.  That is the reality of what we face.  We rely on 19 branches in 15 counties.  That means our cost of fundraising is much lower than for many other organisations.  We had 1,000 people collecting for us on Memory Ribbon Day last week.  They were all providing voluntary services for us.  Many of those are staff of different companies, school kids etc., who came out on a winter day and fundraised for us.  We get huge support from the public and corporate Ireland but there does not seem to be an appreciation of the seriousness of dementia in the country and that carers are under serious pressure.  Some 10% of persons with dementia are under 65 and 11 more people will be diagnosed today.  At least one of those will be under 65 and there is no service for that person.  It is an extremely difficult situation.  The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland would welcome discussions with the committee on dementia and Alzheimer's because we are not mentioned in Sl&aacute;intecare.  Our submissions are mentioned but dementia is not.  We are concerned that if we are not mentioned and that bus is leaving the station, we may have missed ten years in getting it to be a priority on the political agenda.</p></speech>

Home care is not sexy.  It is difficult to do well.  It is messy.  It is provided in private by family members and increasingly by paid care workers.  I would put it back to representatives and to the media to reflect on how they respond to those trolley crises that dominate the narrative and consider more nuanced responses that can shift attention towards home care, primary care and keeping people well at home, out of nursing homes as much as possible.</p></speech>

The crisis is all year round.  It is not as visible as the trolley crisis the hospitals have.  Ours is invisible because these people are at home, denied a service.  It is convenient for the Government that they are so invisible but not so convenient for us.  Visualising that, one of the lows of this year for me was when I had to help a family to complete an application for the fair deal scheme for their daughter who has schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, who is the same age as me.  It was seen as a significant success for her to get a nursing home place within 20 miles of home.  One can walk into a nursing home and see people who are my age there because there is no other option.</p></speech>

Ms Duffy is right that it is totally invisible, with pain and suffering behind closed doors.  I am privileged to work with people who have such empathy and caring in their daily job, with the respect and dignity they give to every call they take.  The quiet desperation spills over to become overwhelming and people cannot cope any more, and that is a stark indictment of our health services.</p></speech>

It has the potential to.  My concern, which I raised in my opening statement, is that there is a lack of a dialogue and of a roadmap.  If the statutory entitlement will do certain things in three years, how will we get to a point where we are prepared for it when it lands?  My members are not being invited in to figure out how the statutory entitlement will work.  I have a set of national standards.  How do I use that as a tool to make sure my members are prepared for the statutory entitlement?  I do not have high confidence in how it is being done.  It seems completely opaque.  I echo what others have said about how difficult it is to give a voice or evocative image to isolation when one has disenfranchised people, people with disabilities or people with chronic and acute conditions.  In the modern world, we react through Twitter with 140 characters and such.  It is difficult to give an image.  It would be a disservice to give a flippant response about how it is because the real world is complicated and we cannot give a simple snapshot, given that we provide home care to such a wide range of people, whether through families or care workers.</p></speech>

Over the years I have made numerous references to the way the care has to be distributed and the competition between community-based care, institutional care, private hospital nursing home care and public hospital nursing home care.  There seems to be a great deal of competition between all those sources.  The demand is getting bigger.  The demographics mean more caring is required.  There are competing demands.  For example, 20 years ago a house probably cost &pound;60,000 or &pound;70,000, which would have a relatively small mortgage.  Family members were able to meet mortgage repayments and provide care at the same time, very often with carer's allowance, a supplement or part carer's allowance.  That day is gone.  The demand from mortgages is much bigger and the repayments are the equivalent of one wage.  We have a number of demands and added to them are the family circumstances.  I find in my area that if a person is returned from hospital to be cared for at home very often the family will opt for a local nursing home if it is nearby.  The critical issue is whether it is nearby, both for respite and support.  </p> <p> Questions have been raised about carer's allowance.  The idea in the assessment of carer's allowance is to refuse almost everyone at the start.  An interesting factor in respect of young people, teenagers and those in their 20s is the idea that their carers are doing no more than is required to care for a normal child or teenager.  It is rubbish.  It is crazy stuff.  It meets the financial requirements but it does not deal with the requirements of the child or family concerned.  I have seen instances where it was outrageous to suggest the child required no more attention than a normal child of the same age.  It creates a serious issue for the family if that idea is relied upon.  </p> <p> There are people from other countries outside the European Union who may be here illegally and who work as carers.  We need to talk to the Department responsible for dealing with them to enable them to remain in the country and provide a service because there is a demand for it.  There is not much sense telling them they do not comply with regulations so they must leave.  It is fine from an immigration point of view but it does not solve the other issue we have.  There is a necessity to do it.  They are very good caring people from a number of countries.  </p> <p> We also need to recognise that caring in the community requires a huge input.  It is not simple.  In years gone by it was portrayed as simple, inexpensive and readily available but it is not.  It requires huge input.  I heard what the various speakers said about costs.  There is a requirement for greater budgetary investment in the area.  It has to be balanced.  I am saying it as a member of the Government party.  I cannot say we will do it straight away.  It is not possible.  If we compare it with the situation in 2007 or 2008, we see the experience from then on was not great.  Somebody mentioned austerity.  The real reason there were cuts is because there were not sufficient resources to meet the demand and the payments.  The Government could not pay.  There was nothing there.  There is a danger we might separate that in our minds and say it was austerity that caused it.  It was not.  Austerity was a result of circumstances that arose and it was not possible to pay the public or private sector or both depending on the extent to which they were affected.  We also need to look at the extent to which we have competing groups in the same business.  It would be much better to have a single authority or body seamlessly delivering the service and having responsibility rather than a multiplicity of people trying to provide the same service and competing with each other for resources and staff.  They provide the best they can in difficult circumstances.  We need to look at the area again in a different light, taking into account the increasing demands, demographics and costs involved and find out how best to provide a good quality service without putting patients at risk or creating an impossible situation for family carers and at the same time make it possible to bring people into the service.  </p> <p> I have also noticed that when families apply for care support in the home, they usually get a package or part of a package and they might have to wait some time for it.  There is no time to wait.  Time may be a very serious issue at that stage.  A week can be a very long time and sometimes it takes two or three weeks to put it into place.  The next issue is that some of the carers are not as experienced as others.  It puts pressure on their colleagues.  In some cases lifting equipment, for example, is not being used because there are not the people to operate it.  There have been instances of an older person caring for another older person.  It creates huge problems for both.  If there is any lifting involved, an older person will not last too long at it.  It cannot work.  It cannot happen.  In those circumstances there is a need for more systemic intervention in terms of respite care for a week or two weeks in order to give the carer a breather if he or she is a family member.  It would also give the caring system a bit of space to allow it to do its work.  </p> <p> What I have said comes from my experience of dealing with cases, some of which I am dealing with at present.  They are all reflected in the issues that are being raised.  They are reflective of the increasing demand.  The issue is how to meet those issues while at the same time providing people with good quality care and the services to which they are entitled.  They will all say they never looked for anything before in their lives.  That is the opening statement of people, some of whom are 80 years of age.  They have never looked for anything previously in their lives.  They rightly feel there is an opportunity for the system to which they contributed all their lives to come to their rescue and they deserve it.  </p></speech>

There are technical answers.  There are activities of daily living and instrumental activities.  There are lists of the kind of things one would do.  The pattern is drifting.  In general there is less of a focus on well-being, mental health and social needs.  It is all about getting in, getting the person up, dressed, washed and possibly fed and then getting out again.  There are complications around medication.  One of the real shocks to me arose because we had been providing in-home and respite care where there was a family carer present and then we started going into homes were they were not present.  If a family carer and the care worker pass each other when one is coming in and the other is going out, one of them can say the person being cared for did not take his or her tablets or would not do something else and the information passes seamlessly into the family that is managing it.  Where there is nobody else there, the caseworker cannot administer the medication.  There is a struggle.  It is recorded that the person did not take his or her medication.  It is not a very effective form of care.  That is what I mean.  Let us be fair to the HSE.  It is operating on a shoestring budget in this area.  It is trying to make &euro;10 million go as far as &euro;100 million.  It is being distilled to the bare minimum.  I am not saying there is an easy answer other than resources.  It is not about people wilfully setting out to do this.</p> <p>This is a function of the way the system is going.</p> <p> I will move on to Deputy Durkan's points and I will start with the question on resources.  I accept the point that it is not austerity, but I am getting a bit resistant to the resources line because my experience and observation is that when the system wants it, resources are available.  I will give two examples.  When there was a problem with the Waterford Crystal pension scheme the State came out very strongly and effectively said it had messed up because it did not translate something into law, and that is the reason the scheme crashed, but it could not afford to bail out the scheme to the tune of &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million.  Within three months the State had bailed out the pension schemes of a series of quangos to the tune of &euro;1 billion.  That did not get any headlines, but there is the contrast.  The State could not afford &euro;40 million to help out one group but it could help out another group no matter what the cost.  My main challenge in terms of resources is that the increase to the health system this year is &euro;2 billion but more or less half of that will go on pay and a large chunk of it is for pay restoration.  We are not ready for pay restoration.  The resources are not there.  Our sector is not doing pay restoration and we are not being funded to do it either.  The State is getting very precious about that and saying it cannot afford it, but that is where a lot of the money is going.</p></speech>

They are central providers to the system.  There are competing demands and everybody must be cognisant of that and the situation is not a simple one, but we must also be alert to the fact that we could tip over the edge again very quickly.  We saw it happen once.  I have a feeling that the boom was one of the worst things that ever happened in this country.  It made us more avaricious in terms of what we deserve, as opposed to what we can afford.  Occasionally it comes to our attention that there are people at the bottom of the system that get squeezed.  They do not have the clout or the lobbying power to change anything.  The people we are talking about now are the vulnerable, the ill, those with disabilities and the elderly.  They are not in such a great place and they say that on a regular basis because that is how they feel.</p>  <p>  We are also told on a regular basis that our spending on health is on par with the highest spenders among OECD countries.  That leaves us in an awkward position as well.  The question is what we can do.</p></speech>

It is about priorities.  It is very difficult for someone on a very low income to hear about a proposal on tax cuts when the proposal for a modest increase for those on low pay is not entertained.  It comes down to priorities.  What we hear at the committee time and time again is people, not with extravagant pay demands, who never look for tax cuts, talking about a crisis in recruitment, exactly as has been outlined for us today.  The issue is one of priorities.  We know how high the health spend is.  Often, it is very tough for those who are on the lowest pay to advocate, in particular home care workers, who are very much isolated although they are a big part of the health service.</p>  <p>  It is also a fact that home care providers who work for private agencies are competing with the need for the private agency to make a profit.  However, I do not think it is fair to say we have people coming in endlessly looking for money.  They are not looking for large amounts of money.  There is an element of having to prioritise.  I would like to see the case for increased home care prioritised because it is a really good value for money service.</p></speech>

The public sector provides for itself.  It does not provide for the rest.  I did an exercise in the context of pay restoration.  Mr. McLoughlin sounds like he is in the same position as the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland.  Let us take the case of somebody on our staff who after the cuts in 2011 was on a salary of &euro;25,000.  We abolished incremental scales.  Let us also take somebody in the HSE who was on the same salary of &euro;25,000 in 2011.  If neither of them got promoted, the person working for us would be still getting &euro;25,000.  The situation will be changed next year for the first time.  The person in the HSE, through normal incremental and pay grants, is on &euro;31,000 now.  I am not saying that is right or wrong.  I am saying that is a fact.</p></speech>

That is equivalent to &euro;600 million in additional pay per annum.  There are 135,000 people working in the HSE, including people working on a part-time basis, but when one boils it down there are 116,000 whole-time equivalents.  In December 2014 the number was 103,000.  The cost of the 13,000 additional staff is approximately &euro;600 million.</p></speech>

HCCI came in with a submission today that was not all about funding.  While we said we would welcome funding, even if funding increased dramatically what we are saying is that the system is not designed to cope with increased capacity.  There are changes that can and should be made right now, around how we commission the supply of carers and professionalising the workforce.  I hope the committee can influence those changes.  I would welcome more funding but my submission is largely not about funding.</p>  <p>  I would hesitate to support a single provider of care.  One can take my view with a pinch of salt given who I represent, but at the same time a monopoly provider of care would not take advantage of the expertise in the system and probably not deliver value for money and would put the committee in a position where one is overseeing a mammoth body with very little accountability, which I suggest would be even less than is now the case.  I do not see how that would provide the answer.</p></speech>

That is true up to a point.  On a regular basis the committee is faced with the private sector and the public sector, very often competing with each other.  Sometimes they overlap and at other times they do not overlap and there are gaps in the system.  As one can see from looking at the colour of my hair, I come from an earlier generation and I remember when there was only one provider and everything went through that system.  It may have had its restrictions and disadvantages, but there are multiples of providers for almost everything in the health services nowadays.  They all have good intentions, are well structured and they all compete in the marketplace and very often they almost bump into each other in the provision of services.  That is my observation from dealing with constituents on a daily basis.</p></speech>

There is a point which goes beyond this discussion.  When we hear that the HSE is making more money available, very often a certain amount that money does not add an extra iota of service.  It would serve every interest to say that if an extra &euro;2 billion is invested, X amount of that will increase the cost of delivering the service.</p> <p>People know what will enhance a service and Deputy Durkan made the point that we could tip over the edge again.  All that I am hearing about this morning is people with disabilities and elderly people in need of care and the organisation has gone over the edge.  That is a tricky situation and we need to be clear and forensic in our language when we talk about these things.  Staff have legitimate and valid expectations that conditions would start to improve but that is not just some staff.  People do not care or know who is providing the service, it is simply that the service is there for them.</p></speech>

Are they doing this HSE style competency or is it a QQI level 5?</p>  <p>  I refer to under 65s.  I have heard there is an issue with getting home care in the case of a degenerative neurological disorder for people under 65.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their experiences of that.  I am being told in the community that with rapidly progressing conditions, which are a surprise to many families who have never had to engage with family caring services or the HSE's services before, it can often take six to eight weeks of a family dealing with a devastating diagnosis combined with the patient having to deal with a diagnosis and having no experience in the provision of any sort of care because they have had no hassle up to this point before a home care package is approved.  When someone has one of the really progressive neurological disorders, there is no coming out of it, the end is nigh, it is complex and it is terminal.  I am hearing that this is causing undue annoyance and stress to families at a very difficult time and by the time the package is approved, the person could be 70% of the way through their condition and it leaves for a very difficult experience.  Is that common?  What sort of impact does this have on families in these cases?</p></speech>

We have been rowing back on that requirement.</p>  <p>  I refer to home care packages for under 65s.  The reason for the problem is that home care packages are effectively part of the older persons part of the HSE.  They can be awarded outside of that but it is an awkward case.  When the Deputy said it can take six to eight weeks I was thinking that was fast as opposed to slow but then she mentioned the magic word of "approval."  It is not unusual for someone to get a letter saying he or she has been approved for a home care package and that he or she will get further correspondence when it is possible to provide such a package.</p></speech>

The statutory framework will presumably define a set of entitlements.  There is no statutory basis for any sort of carer's support or home care.  We would have to go out on a limb with bits of the Health Act, 2004, to come up with a statutory basis.  The new legislation will be clearer around that but it always will be subject to resources.  There will be this consistent legal framework and it will then feed out.  By the time the legislation is enacted, presumably we will be RICOs and we will have forgotten about CHOs and hospital groups.  Presumably there will be about six RICOs around the country, each of which will have a chief officer whose job is to balance the budget against the demands and resources and all that will have changed is that there will be a more standardised set of requirements but the decision will still have to be made.</p>  <p>  I refer to the legacy issue.  If there are 1,000 home care workers employed, by definition there will be more home care work done than an organisation that also has 1,000 physiotherapists because they will help with the work.  Therefore, the legacy spending patterns will also help to shape this.  This is about system and policy and not about picking out an individual and saying that person is trying to cause trouble.  It is about understanding the system does not work and then how it might be changed but there will be a limit to how consistent it will be as long as there are regional bodies.</p></speech>

Conversations such as that will happen within those organisations which will hopefully limit the extremes of budgetary cutting.</p></speech>

There will not be two budget silos with two different gatekeepers, there will be a single budget silo with a single decision maker and that is going back to the decision we had before the CHOs where there were integrated care systems, and that is a progressive move.  There are all sorts of other issues and a major issue is the legacy of staffing structures which determine how the majority of the money is spent.  These numbers are like telephone numbers but we are only tinkering at the margins because most of it is fixed in pay and buildings etc.  That is a truism.</p></speech>

I understand Care Alliance Ireland has done some work on the priority given by the different CHOs per condition, which varies wildly.  For example, we have anecdotal evidence that a person entering palliative care will be prioritised by some CHOs but not by others.  For a family member living in Dublin whose relative lives in Cork, trying to rationalise the system does not make sense.  Home and Community Care Ireland gets a lot of inquiries from people about the system and how it works, as I am sure do all of the other organisations.  The impact is huge on families.  Home and Community Care Ireland is a representative organisation for providers but I still get calls from people from abroad seeking help about the system and how it operates.</p></speech>

It appears the word "palliative" strikes a chord in the HSE.  However, a person who is terminally ill and has a 12 week window does not necessarily tick the palliative box, such that families have to jump through a lot of hoops to get services.  As stated, sometimes by the time all of this has been done the patient has died.  To my mind, this affects not only the family's experience of that illness but that of the carers and doctors involved.  It is frustrating for GPs and community pharmacists to see people without services.</p></speech>

What the Deputy describes varies across the CHOs.  In many cases, the mention of "palliative" care does speed up provision but in other cases it does not, which is frustrating.  This goes to the heart of the Chairman's question as to whether Sl&aacute;intecare will bring uniformity.  Currently, some CHOs are on a paper based reporting system for home care but others operate an electronic system for home care.  CHO1 has a new finance system and CHO7 has an entirely different finance system.  We hope Sl&aacute;intecare will bring some cohesion but we are trying to deal with the system as it is now but it is difficult to get any consistency.  Therefore, when designing national guidelines and spreading information one has to constantly add the caveat that the situation may be different in a particular local area.</p></speech>

The society and the HSE would encourage people to remain involved, to develop coping skills, to obtain cognitive training, to seek peer supports and to join social clubs.  There are things people can do to live well with dementia but there comes a point when needs are more complex and services need to kick-in quickly for them and carers.</p></speech>

I say that not convinced it will work, but in principle.</p>  <p>  On the subject of palliative, I would like to give an example of a case that came to mind when it was mentioned earlier.  An elderly woman was discharged from hospital on a clear death trajectory having been told by the hospital that there was nothing more that could be done for her.  When the family responded that they could not cope, they were told to find a nursing home place for her.  When they did so, hospital staff contacted the nursing home and instructed staff there not to give the woman the bed because they said they needed it.  The woman went home and died.  As Ms Duffy said, people are afraid to complain no matter what happens to them for fear of losing whatever services they have.  However, when someone dies a complaint can be made.  Family Carers Ireland received a complaint.  We facilitate people in making complaints.  In fairness, the director of nursing and the consultant in the hospital were distressed and apologised profusely.  I have an image of this woman sitting on her suitcase in the snow in a car park waiting to be picked up to be brought home to die.  The response from the two other people who were in the room, who were responsible for bed management, was that they were just doing their job.  The family did not want to take the matter any further.  I would have been happy to but the family decided to walk away from it.  It was mentioned earlier that "palliative" is a magic word.  That is not always the case.</p></speech>

Meanwhile in another area there were more than 600 people on a waiting list but it was estimated that the majority of the assessed need was provided for.  This highlights the disparity in assessments which leads to the reference of postcode lottery.  This level of discrepancy and disparity cannot be good and fair.  There will be always a level of disparity within clinical assessment protocols and guidelines but the current level of disparity is of concern to us.</p></speech>

All of the organisations working in this area, private, community and voluntary, are providing an excellent level of service to people.  Are there services that are perceived to be offering a service but are not doing so?

This is not a question of private sector good and voluntary and public sector bad or vice versa.  There is good and bad practice in the private sector and good and bad practice in the voluntary sector.  We have to be vigilant.  We are required to report such situations but there is never any follow up as to what happened.  I am mindful of one issue in respect of which we reported an organisation.  To my mind, it was a relatively serious issue, but these incidents can be also one-off.  There are thousands of carers going into houses every day.  I would not like to be held personally accountable for what every one of them does tomorrow at 11 a.m.  In regard to the organisation we reported, when the HSE was drawing up a list of people who would be charged with the most intensive, difficult, challenging cases, that company was on the list.  I did wonder about that.  I do not have any further insight but what I am saying is factually correct.  I am not saying the system is broken.  It is a rare situation but it does happen, definitely.</p></speech>

What is the estimated ratio in terms of cost-sharing?</p> <p>Obviously, the client will have to make a contribution and the State will make a contribution.

Researching and then collectively as a society deciding on the funding model will be absolutely critical, which is why it nests under Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need to take a good hard adult look at how we fund the provision of care in this country.  Will it be from general taxation or a blend of social insurance?  Not dodging the point, but it is early days.  Our colleagues at Sage Advocacy are doing sterling work on the deep technical aspects of this and we are feeding it into the Department.  I do not think we can answer the question today.  Age Action is the largest body representing ageing people in the country and we ask that all elected members of both Houses who are here in front of us do their part to ensure the dialogue and societal conversation that must be held in this country on how we will fund this - it will not be easy - is adult, respectful and sustainable.</p></speech>

We have stated on the record for a long time that we are willing to talk about co-payment.  I mentioned earlier the insurance model because it seems to deserve serious consideration but the great chance to do this in the context of the universal social charge has been possibly lost.  With regard to the fair deal model and integrating the two funds, the problem is the fair deal model is made up of three contributions and if people are caring for someone at home it really does not make a whole lot of sense to take most of their income or savings, and if the house is being used as a care facility it seems a bit rich to take that.  It would need to be a different model.  I agree with Ms Deane that it is early days in the discussion.  To be fair, nobody is suggesting it will be for free.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to see that no night cover was sought.  People who came out of hospitals were able to attend existing day care centres.  Our experience is that carers will not abuse intensive homecare.  People do not want other people in their houses unless they absolutely need them.  It would be a game changer in terms of delaying people going into residential care, which would be a significant saving to the State if we look at the trajectory of the number of the beds that will be needed.  It will be a major change.  We have no information on what the funding model should be or could be.</p></speech>

There is often a discussion on wanting Scandinavian-type services but there is not always the wider societal sense that this takes a level of taxation.  One of the risks if people do have to pay for part of the care, and I do not have strong evidence for this, may be self-neglect.  People may decide they will not pay for it so they will not get it and it may lead to unintended consequences.  We must balance to what extent the State makes a decision on this.</p>  <p>  There are various models throughout Europe and Mr. Dunne alluded to the insurance model, which probably would be preferable.  There is a percentage of direct payment with the rest coming later.  It will require cross-party political leadership to state this will cost us collectively but it will be worth it because we want high quality care, to value family carers and, increasingly, paid care workers because this is the type of society in which we want to live.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and assistant secretaries, Ms Maria Graham, Ms Mary Hurley and Mr. Paul Lemass.</p> <p>  Supporting families, individuals and citizens who are experiencing homelessness and whose lives are being affected by the housing challenges Ireland faces remains the key priority for this Government and for me as Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is vital that we continue to address and drive the supply of housing, and Rebuilding Ireland provides the framework for this.  We continue to face a serious challenge to resolve the crisis of homelessness.  The numbers remain far too high and, while there are some positive signs, tackling this issue will continue to be my main focus in 2019.  Presentations of families to homeless services in Dublin have fallen for three consecutive months now, and of those presenting, greater numbers are being prevented from ever having to enter emergency accommodation.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, is allocating increased resources to outreach and prevention, and we will be working closely to accelerate this decrease.</p> <p>  Our delivery programme for social housing is of critical importance, but in parallel we are working to deliver a range of initiatives to support those individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness.  As we work to deliver the solutions to provide homes for all of the households experiencing homelessness, my Department is working closely to deliver a range of emergency accommodation facilities to ensure that we have accommodation available for all.  This includes the development of a range of family hub facilities, primarily in Dublin but also in a number of areas outside the capital.  In September this year, I instructed the Dublin local authorities to deliver 180 emergency beds to ensure that we have sufficient beds to avoid anyone having to sleep on the streets, and we will now see the delivery of 203 permanent beds before Christmas in addition to 130 contingency beds for the cold weather period.</p> <p>  We know that individuals engaged in rough sleeping frequently require other supports to help them move from homelessness to an independent tenancy.  While the short-term imperative may be to provide emergency beds, we are also committed to delivering longer-term solutions.  The delivery of the national implementation plan for Housing First, which I launched with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in September, is well under way.  Tender competitions have been undertaken in Cork, Galway and Limerick in recent weeks for the delivery of the service in those areas.  In Dublin, where rough sleeping is most acute, the recently issued tender for Housing First includes a target to deliver 125 new tenancies in 2019 and a total of 405 new tenancies in the period 2019 to 2021.  Housing First will deliver long-term sustainable heath and housing solutions for some of our most vulnerable citizens.  For families, experiencing homelessness, we want to ensure that each and every family is provided with safe and comfortable accommodation and that they are supported to identify and secure an independent tenancy, whether it be in a local authority allocated dwelling or a housing assistance payment, HAP, supported tenancy in the private rented sector.</p><p>Following on from the three summits held with local authority chief executives and the first housing body summit, all our efforts are clearly focused on driving delivery forward in a meaningful way.  Working collaboratively is showing results.</p><p> To the end of quarter 3 of 2018, Rebuilding Ireland has delivered more than 63,500 housing solutions across all of our delivery streams.  By the end of this year, I expect that number to have grown to approximately 70,000 and we are on course to achieve that.  We committed to supporting 137,000 households into appropriate accommodation under build, acquisition, leasing, HAP and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, programmes over the six year period, and by the end of this year, we will have achieved more than 50% of our target.  The Government is on track to deliver on the Rebuilding Ireland targets, and funding is in place to secure this delivery.  To date, 17,315 homes have been delivered under build, acquisition and leasing schemes.  The new build pipeline now in place is growing, as evidenced in the quarter 3 construction status report which has just been published.  This report focuses on local authority and housing body new build projects across various programmes and demonstrates that the number of schemes and homes in the new build pipeline has more than doubled since the end of 2016, with 17,676 homes now built or progressing through the various stages of the construction or approval process.  I am committed, as Minister, to increasing build activity at a faster pace, and with the latest construction status report showing nearly 5,000 homes on site and under construction and a further 2,652 homes at the final pre-construction stage, the delivery of our build targets is on track.  As we know, build delivery tends to be end-year focused and, like last year, we will see over 50% of our build delivery come through by the end of the year.</p><p> As Minister, I have also been clear that we need to address issues of housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin.  However, all local authorities are carrying out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites.  In terms of affordable purchase, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  I expect the associated regulations and guidance to issue to local authorities shortly.  This is not delaying the necessary assessment or the development of proposals around land for the development of affordable housing.</p><p> Acknowledging that renters in Dublin and other urban centres are facing significant affordability challenges, I am committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland.  Together with delivering more predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on housing affordability.  The Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of housing bodies are assessing the tenders for our first cost rental pilot at Enniskerry Road.  I expect that project to be on site in the first quarter of 2019.  In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency undertook more detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site at St. Michael&rsquo;s estate in Inchicore, which Dublin City Council will now develop as a major cost rental project.</p><p> To support the affordable housing programmes of local authorities, the Government announced as part of budget 2019 the commitment of &euro;310 million under the serviced sites fund over the three years 2019 to 2021.  The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure on public lands to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.  I envisage a maximum amount of serviced sites funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, and on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated.  I have now awarded funding of &euro;43 million under the first call for proposals.  The projects selected in this first call are in Dublin and Cork and will enable the delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands as well as more than 700 social housing homes, where local authorities are bringing forward these sites as part of mixed tenure developments.  There are also five projects that are still under active consideration, the total funding for which is &euro;8 million, and which have the potential to deliver 230 affordable homes.  These projects are in Fingal, Galway city, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, and my Department is working with those local authorities to make these proposals happen.  I expect the infrastructure works on the approved projects to begin as soon as possible, and a second call for proposals under the fund will be made shortly.  The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities as part of the aforementioned economic assessments.</p><p> In terms of furthering our ambition to maximise utilisation of vacant housing stock, my Department published the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy 2018-2021 in quarter 3.  My Department is continuing to work with local authorities on their vacant homes action plans.  This work is being supported by the vacant homes officers, funded by my Department, to co-ordinate local actions addressing vacancy and to provide a clearly signposted source of information for owners of vacant homes, including the funding options that are available, to assist in bringing vacant homes back into productive use.</p><p> On the rental sector, the Government has given its approval to the publication of the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.  The Bill provides a number of key measures and reforms designed to enhance enforcement powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, provide greater security of tenure for tenants, and further underpin the operation of the rent pressure zone arrangements, along with some further targeted priority measures.  My Department is working closely with the RTB to ensure that adequate resources are provided to tackle any capacity constraints.  The proposed new powers for the RTB are a crucial first step in expanding its overall role and function as part of a multi-annual change management programme to enforce tenancy law proactively within the rental sector.</p><p> The committee is aware of the proposals I recently announced to address, through amendments to planning legislation, the short-term tourism related letting of properties.  I propose to regulate short-term letting through the existing exempted development regime by facilitating unlimited home sharing and the letting of a person&rsquo;s entire home, for a maximum period of 90 days per year, without the need for planning permission.  In addition, if a person wishes to let a second property that is not their principal private residence, they may only do so if they obtain planning permission.  This approach will be underpinned by amendments to planning regulations and complementary amendments to primary planning legislation.</p><p> Last week, I also published, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, as amended, the urban development and building heights guidelines for planning authorities.  These guidelines set out new and updated national planning policy on building heights relating to urban areas, elaborating on the strategic policy framework set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, and these are part of a suite of integrated measures and policy shifts to break the current patterns and development trends for our cities and towns and create more compact and integrated communities.  I have said that we need to shift away from the business as usual development patterns and create a more adaptive and forward-looking vision.  Our cities and our towns must grow upwards, not just outwards, if we are to meet the many challenges ahead.  Along with the apartment guidelines published earlier this year, these height guidelines represent the final reforms to our planning guidelines for apartment development, which continue to increase at pace.</p><p> I thank the committee for its engagement with me and my Department to date, and I look forward to continuing our very important work in 2019.  Members can be assured that we at the Department are all committed to addressing homelessness, accelerating housing delivery, tackling vacancy, as well as ensuring the reform of the rental sector.</p></speech>

We agreed in private session that we would do ten-minute sessions to question the Minister.  It is up to members how they use that time, because if they use the whole ten minutes to speak without going to the Minister, then he will not have the opportunity to come back in.  I will indicate when five minutes have elapsed and it is to be hoped we will get a few sessions.  I ask members to indicate which pillar they are asking the question on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister, his Secretary General, Mr. McCarthy, and his senior staff for coming in because it is an important engagement.  I want to stay focused because we are here today as a joint committee to discuss and examine the progress on the Rebuilding Ireland document.  They are not aspirations or other issues that stray off, so I will keep my attention focused on this document.  I said at the very outset, when the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, came in, that it is a brave politician who sets out targets that are there to be tracked and traced to hold the Minister to account and it happened two and a half years ago.  The Minister is his successor and I know that he is happy to be held to account and he acknowledged the importance and the role of this committee as a statutory Oireachtas committee dealing with and effectively shadowing his Department.  Again, I thank the Minister, the senior management team and the Secretary General in the Department.  I have always found them to be very professional and helpful and I am conscious that they, too, need support.</p> <p>  I initially came in here to say that councils need support but the Department needs support and the Minister's staff need more support.  That is my experience of the task at hand.  Sometimes when a person is at the very centre of power and decision making, especially at the level that the Minister is at in the Department, he or she might not be conscious of the needs within his or her Department.  That is not to say that the Minister is ignoring them but he is not conscious of them because he is a busy politician like most.  I want to put that down as a marker because that needs to be looked at again and additional resources are needed to meet the challenges and to support the local authorities.</p> <p>  I am not expecting the Minister to come back with a very detailed answer to my questions now but maybe he will give a commitment to follow up on them with a written response or an email to the committee if he cannot deal with them all now.  I will kick off by mentioning the Shanganagh site.  I am sick to the teeth of hearing about Shanganagh Castle and the site, who will own it and who is to blame.  I hear stories from local people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that it is a matter for the Department and there is total frustration with the process.  I hear another story from the elected members which is another angle on it and I hear about another problem from the people who live out in Shankill.  In fairness, the Minister agreed with Deputy Boyd Barrett, whom I welcome, some months ago to have a round-table meeting with the stakeholders on this.  There is so much misinformation out there that it is about time that the Oireachtas Members for that constituency, the county council members, the Minister's senior management team and the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council came together at one table and heard the actual story.  There are too many different stories and they are not joining up.  There is a general frustration because there is the potential for 500 houses and that place is in State ownership.  I was talking about it to Senator McDowell, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who sanctioned the sale of the whole thing.  I just wanted to flag that as an issue.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about Enniskerry Road and I would like an update on that.</p><p>People have said to me that if it had been left to the local authority years ago, it would have built the houses by now.  There is not a house on the Enniskerry Road and I want to examine the issue.</p><p> I would like the Minister to provide an update on the Land Development Agency.  We are still not aware of the timeframe for the underlying legislation.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</p><p> I wish to raise the subject of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and online issues.  In the context of Rebuilding Ireland, we talked about how people could engage.  We talked about fast-tracking the An Bord Plean&aacute;la process.  New management structures are in place there but we need the process to sharpen up and be faster.  I am conscious that the Minister has to keep a certain distance from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is reference in Rebuilding Ireland to online engagement in the planning process, but that is not happening.  People are frustrated by the process.  Major reform is required.</p><p> I have some key questions for the Minister as well as some general comments.  What process and checks does the Department use to display and update its data in terms of Rebuilding Ireland, specifically in terms of publication and the internal purposes of that?  Are tables updated continually, for example, weekly or monthly?  Sometimes I get a sense that information is gathered because the Minister is in the D&aacute;il, for example, responding to parliamentary questions or he is coming before the committee and he gathers another load of information.  I appreciate that he is a busy person.  I am not here to attack the Minister but I am interested in hearing about the ongoing and continual monitoring of Rebuilding Ireland.</p><p> Pillar 1 addresses homelessness.  Why has action 1.30 switched from "progress" to "ongoing"?  How much progress has been made under the rapid delivery framework?  Actions 1.34, 1.35 and 1.36 continue to remain categorised as "ongoing".  What level of progress, if any, has been made in regard to these proposals?</p><p> Under Pillar 2, action 2.15 relates to the establishment of a regulator for the approved housing body, AHB, sector.  That is overdue.  Will the Minister report on progress and his intention in this regard?</p><p> Action 2.20 relates to supports for people leaving HSE accommodation and mental health services.  The project was to be rolled out between 2018 and 2020.  Will the Minister provide an update on how many tenancies have been created to date for those transitioning from mental health facilities to community-based living, as of today?  I will come back with more questions later if there is time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#E00200"><p>In his opening comments Senator Boyhan talked about the importance of having targets.  I agree with that because targets bring transparency and provide for accountability.  Targets also help us drive delivery, although we do not always reach those targets, but they will also show us what is working and what is not, so it is important that we have them and work to them.</p> <p>  Regarding the support of my Department, I am well aware of the needs of my Department.  Some reconfiguration has happened recently in terms of bringing in additional staff at assistant secretary level to help reorganise some functions and help us drive additional aspects of Rebuilding Ireland more quickly.  There are many stakeholders involved, not just the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  There is also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and a number of agencies such as the Housing Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which is important in terms of some of the issues to which I will refer concerning Shanganagh.  Work has been continuing in Shanganagh.  It is not as if nothing has been happening.  We have been trying, between the NDFA and the county council, to get the financial model right so that it works when we do it.  The worst thing to do would be to have got the numbers wrong.  The financial modelling is complex when one is trying to develop a site like the one in question.  A delivery board is now in place.  I would have no problem with the committee meeting the delivery board to hear about its plan and how quickly it wants to see it happen.  We have staff out there today meeting relevant officials to discuss the project.  We continue to work on the project.  Last week I had a meeting with the vice president of the European Investment Bank to talk about wider ambition concerning the delivery of affordable housing that we want to drive.  I understand that in January or February of next year the Enniskerry Road project tender will be awarded as the process is nearing completion.</p> <p>  The heads of the Bill for the Land Development Agency are ready and I want to bring them to the Cabinet.  We have one more Cabinet meeting before the end of the calendar year and it is my intention to bring the Bill to the Cabinet if we can finalise the heads.  I am also going to announce the interim board at that point, but that depends on being able to get that item onto the agenda of the meeting.  It is a busy time of year to try to get something on the agenda.  We will continue to work full steam ahead with the Land Development Agency.  It is up and running already as a body, just not under statutory legislation.  We have money that we can now appropriate to it this year, thanks to the Supplementary Estimate that was agreed last night.  The agency is almost ready to submit planning permission on some of the first sites.  The agency is working and it is going well given that it was only established a couple of months ago, but the legislation is important in terms of it being able to capitalise further projects over the course of next year.</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent.  A new chairperson was recently appointed who has come from the Department, so that person is well aware of what we want to achieve under Rebuilding Ireland and the task at hand.  Additional board members above the usual number have been appointed.  New staff have been appointed to the new delivery team.  When it comes to the multi-unit developments, those that comprise more than 100 homes and more than 200 student spaces, the agency has met its timelines in 100% of cases.  Thousands of homes have been approved in the past year under the new fast-track delivery.  The system is going well.  While I have not spoken to the new chair in detail about the e-planning programme, I spoke to the outgoing chair about it in terms of the progress that had been made and the further work that is under way to its ICT system.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has seen its workload increase significantly in recent years and, as a result, we have given it additional resources and funding and we will continue to do so.</p> <p>  In terms of data published by the Department, it depends on the data.  We monitor certain things on an ongoing basis and we produce monthly information, for example, on planning permissions.  Other data will emerge at other intervals.  It depends on where we collect information, for example, whether we are collecting it from local authorities directly or regional leads who are collecting it from local authorities.  There is a statistician in the Department and an entire section which does that work.  Data go to various levels of management to be checked and verified. Most information is then published.  As Minister, I will take a look and, if I have questions, I will query some of the data as to whether I think they make sense or if something adds up.  Data go through a number of checks and balances in that regard.  Other data are published separate to us which we always look at to see how they compare with data produced by us or one of our agencies.  We examine whether they confirm a trend or question a trend.  A considerable amount of work goes into data and we constantly try to improve our data collection methods.  We are examining ways of improving data collection when it comes to those in emergency accommodation.  I asked the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to take on board the responsibility for counting the number of completions, and since then we have that information, which is much better than relying solely on extrapolations from ESB connection data.  I understand the need to improve our data constantly and make sure that the data we publish help inform the public debate and what needs to be done.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked specific questions about the various pillars and whether the table is updated.  I have information on approved housing body regulation.  We have information on the voluntary bodies, which is being led by the Housing Agency, in terms of getting housing bodies involved in the voluntary level of regulation, but we are moving to statutory regulation.  We are drafting a priority Bill which will not make it onto the Statute Book this year but we expect it to be introduced early next year.  We will continue to work with housing bodies to help the smaller ones in particular.  Tier 1 housing bodies are smaller organisations or volunteers and we want to get them in line with the voluntary regulation before we move to full statutory regulation.  Classification is an issue that is being led by the Department of Finance.  We are treating that as an accountancy issue that will not impact on our delivery from housing bodies.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also asked about rapid delivery under the first pillar.  Under action 1.30, Dublin City Council put a framework in place for volumetric build apartments.  That has been in the newspapers and we hope to publish it before the end of the year.  The council has been working to do that.  Once we have the framework, we can run mini competitions from that in each local authority to start building rapid delivery upwards housing.</p> <p>  Another action under that pillar concerns modular clusters.  We are progressing well with that.  Three sites have been identified for modular clusters.  That framework will be in place by the end of the year.  Galway and Louth are already advancing on those sites.</p><p> I will have to come back to the Senator on the number of people transitioning from mental health accommodation as I do not have that information to hand.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  Before I ask my questions, I want to acknowledge the significant amount of work done by the departmental officials in terms of their preparation of the reports for today's meeting, particularly the pipeline and progress reports which are very detailed pieces of work.</p> <p>  I have a series of questions on each of the pillars.  We are almost half way through the lifespan of Rebuilding Ireland.  Essentially, we are two and a half years into a five year plan.  The spend on emergency accommodation has increased from &euro;70 million per annum to, following last night's Supplementary Estimate, &euro;176 million per annum, which is a 193% increase.  I am not arguing against the provision of emergency accommodation and better quality emergency accommodation but I am concerned that half way into this plan, on which the Government continually tells us very significant amounts of money are being spent and progress is being made, the spend on emergency accommodation is increasing dramatically.  At what point in the lifespan of Rebuilding Ireland will the spend on emergency accommodation start to fall, which would be a key indicator of things beginning to improve at the rough end?  </p> <p>  On the modular hubs, again, I am not against better quality emergency accommodation for families than hotel rooms and bed and breakfasts but following on from the responses I received to two parliamentary questions I am concerned about this project, albeit we have only limited information on it.  In both responses, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said there could be a dispensation from or a relaxation of building regulations for these modular hubs.  Will the Minister set out explicitly how a dispensation from or a relaxation of building regulations could happen?  I was not one of the people who attacked the idea of modular housing when it was first proposed because I understand that such housing can be good quality housing if it meets all of the building regulations.  I am worried, however, that with these modular hubs we are putting in place accommodation that is much closer to the public perception of modular, which is prefabricated or Mosney type accommodation.  I would appreciate if the Minister could elaborate on the quality of those builds.</p> <p>  On pillar 2, social housing, what are the totals for quarter 3 build, acquisition-lease, HAP and RAS, which is not included in the report, although I appreciate it was finalised only last night?  When the Minister has given me that information, I will follow up with a supplementary question on where we are at with the targets.  There has been a significant fall-off on the leasing target and the Minister is trying to match this with increases in acquisitions but I do not see how the numbers and funding match.  Perhaps the Minister would provide reassurance in that regard.  </p> <p>  In regard to the pipeline report, could Traveller specific accommodation be included?  I acknowledge that the Minister gave me a positive response to a parliamentary question in which he said this proposal would be considered but the committee would like to know the progress of Traveller specific social housing.  There is no reason that information should not be included in this report as there is not a huge number of such projects out there.</p> <p>  On pillar 3, private housing, I have no objection to densification.  It is one of the aspects of the national planning framework of which I am broadly supportive.  I have two specific questions with respect to the report, and the new guidelines, with which the Minister provided us today.  In producing the report and the planning requirements therein, was an impact assessment undertaken of land values in urban centres as a result of increasing heights?  We know, for example, that as heights are increased profitability from inner city sites increase and this has an inflationary impact on land values.  Was that examined?  There are people who argue that there is a tipping point between height and density such that as heights increase density increases but that on reaching a particular height there is no significant gain in density because of the need for more surrounding space etc.  Was a specific study done to identify the tipping point in terms of height and density and what height provides maximum density, particularly in areas such as inside of the canals in Dublin?</p> <p>  I note there has been no housing commencement data published since August, either by the Department or by the CSO.  Will the Minister explain the reason for that?  For example, is it that the data have not been uploaded and, if so, when we will the data for new builds of public and private sector housing be published?  On the rental sector, the Minister is aware that Sinn F&eacute;in has been broadly supportive of his intention to provide the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, with new powers.  As discussed earlier in private session, the relevant legislation needs to be progressed quickly in the new year.  I am concerned about the preference for criminal sanctions over civil sanctions simply because it would mean the RTB would have to take cases to court and that would be expensive and time consuming.  Will the Minister clarify if it is the intention to make those criminal rather than civil and, if so, explain why?  </p> <p>  My final question is on the right to housing, which was a matter of public debate in the President's speech this week and at launch of the Simon Community's annual report yesterday.  At the constitutional convention, 84% were in favour of a constitutional right to housing.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to examine it but that task has been removed from this committee and given to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which has yet to do it.  As I said, the issue was mentioned in the President's speech earlier this week.  In the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's research by Am&aacute;rach, 63% support a constitutional right to housing.  Has the Government set its face against this or is it willing to consider it and how can we have a discussion about it?</p></speech>

It is always appreciated when they are acknowledged for the hard work they do.  They give this committee a lot of time and they are happy to do so.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, we are roughly half way through Rebuilding Ireland.  While the spend on emergency accommodation has increased, not all of it is spent on the provision of emergency accommodation.  A lot of that spend is on prevention as well.  That does not mean there is not an issue in terms of people needing to have supports coming from Government and local authorities.  It is not the only measure of the success of the plan.  Looked at in isolation, it tells only one story.  The additional spend for the delivery of new homes is another way of measuring the success of the plan, as are other measures such as planning permissions, commencement notices and so on.  As always what is important is not how much we spend but how we spend it.  In terms of Rebuilding Ireland, we know that in 2020 and 2021 we will be spending more money getting people into the stock of social housing that we will have.  HAP will always exist.  There will be always people who want to avail of it but we will be spending our money in a better and more efficient way when we are spending on increasing the stock rather than the amount we are spending now on HAP.  That will happen over the course of the plan in terms of a reprogramming of money.  </p> <p>  On modular hubs, what is important is that we can provide people with quality accommodation that is temporary.  We are building amazing homes.  In all of the new housing schemes that have opened recently, the quality of housing is fantastic, as it should be.  Emergency accommodation also has to be of the highest standard possible.  These modular clusters are different.  We do not yet have them in Ireland but they have worked successfully in the UK.  We want to progress them here.  In regard to standards, we regularly hear that there is too much red tape and the standards are too high and so on.  What we are seeking to do is in line with the successful projects in the UK, in particular a development in Scotland which comprises approximately 40 modular homes.  The type of regulations needed are different from those which apply in respect of an apartment building because it comprises multi-units or in respect of stackable rapids in a volumetric scheme.  I have a more detailed note which I can supply to the Deputy in regard to the changes that have been made.  Everything is being done in terms of ensuring that minimum standards are not breached, in respect of heating and fire regulations and the security and safety of the building in terms of its structural integrity.  This is not about half measures.  Rather, it is about making sure we are not gold plating what needs to be done in terms of what has been successful in other countries.</p> <p>  On the social housing targets, the breakdown for quarter 3, as per the published report, is: new build, 1,764; voids, 605; acquisitions, 1,661; leasing, 476; HAP, 13,741 and RAS, 534.</p><p> We talked about leasing in the committee yesterday evening.  With regard to our targets for leasing and what we wanted to achieve in the first year, it was working well.  When we look at what has been delivered and what might be delivered under enhanced leasing, it is not delivering what we thought it would.  We have sought expressions of interest on enhanced leasing twice.  We have to look at it now to see what other changes need to be made to deliver more quickly.  I think I know where a couple of the sticking points are but they are ones that cannot be resolved on our own in the Department.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy English, to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to see if further changes can be made to the enhanced leasing programme.  There was considerable interest in these programmes but some of the interested parties did not have all of the requirements.  There were also other concerns raised about things on our side.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, will examine them with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because we have to deliver a certain number of homes through leasing.  </p><p> As a result of leasing not hitting the targets we wanted it to hit, as we discussed yesterday evening, we have had to do more with acquisitions.  We have done more with acquisitions because we could get the money to do it.  It is still value for money in certain local authorities outside of Dublin.  Housing bodies are pursuing acquisitions because they make sense for their own programmes.  There have been some bank acquisitions we have been able to get our hands on which has been a good thing.  </p><p> With regard to the pipeline report and Traveller-specific accommodation, we are looking at it.  We allocate funding and we have the policies.  It is a priority.  One of the difficulties we have is getting planning permission and local objection when it comes to Traveller accommodation.  The committee needs to have a conversation about the role of elected representatives when it comes to objecting to planning permissions because it is still happening.  Citizens will always have the right to object, whether on spurious grounds or not.  We might see more of it now as the local elections come closer.  Some candidates might seem to be acting in the interest of the local community - they are not - by supporting local residents' objections to new housing whether social housing, Traveller-specific accommodation or private housing because that is also happening.  It speaks to a bigger problem we have with people who are fortunate to be living in an area and who own a home.  We need to provide more homes.  </p><p> We need to increase the densification of our urban centres.  That is just a fact.  In many parts, which are very close to very expensive infrastructure such as transport infrastructure or schools, densities are not being used efficiently.  That means building up.  To come to the latter part of the Deputy's question, height is not necessarily a way of achieving density.  Anyone who has helped to design a city or county development plan, as I have, knows density is achieved in many other ways.  That is why the first thing we did when it came to looking at apartment guidelines was to look at density, the number of units per core, car-parking provision and the aspect ratio, which are all things that would help to provide more apartments on a site.  Height helps.  We saw it on a previous piece of work we did.  When it gets to a six-storey shoulder height, for which the guidelines now provide, it absolutely helps in terms of density.  They are trying to make a six-storey shoulder height the default position in our urban cores.  As we go beyond that, the height densification question becomes one of diminishing returns but it allows us to have things like mixed use which we need to see.  We can have other uses that are not just about people living in the building but also about people working there or using it for other types of community and sporting facilities.  In terms of liveability, height allows us to do more on a particular site than increase densification and provide more apartments.</p></speech>

Some of the questions have been asked.  I will return to the last point on housing delivery figures for this year.  When they are broken down, about 4,506 are through new builds, voids, acquisitions and leasing and 14,275 are through HAP and, to a lesser degree, RAS.  The Minister stated that by 2020 there would be more provided through builds than through short-term housing measures.  One issue I have raised consistently is my concern about our over-reliance on the private rental market, particularly HAP.  When does the Minister see the tipping point happening?  When does he see it equalising based on his plans in Rebuilding Ireland?  Two-thirds of people who deemed their housing needs were met this year did so as a result of housing assistance payment.  Many of them are relatively short-term leases of 12 months.  The Minister states on a regular basis in the committee that it suits many people.  It is not the evidence I have from the people I meet.  HAP does not provide a home.  For many people it is not a long-term solution.  I continue to be very concerned about the over-reliance on it.  Will the Minister give me a projection of the HAP spend in 2019?  We had to provide additional funds in this year's budget.  I am interested to see how the Minister sees us catching up on the capital side and more people being housed permanently.  It is a concern I have.</p> <p>  I want to return to the service site fund and the &euro;310 million for delivery of affordable homes which is something the Minister and I discussed and negotiated as part of the budget.  The Minister did not read into the record the part of his statement that stated he expects the associated regulations and guidance to issue to local authorities shortly.  It is in the Minister's written statement.  When does the Minister feel we will have the criteria published for an affordable housing scheme?  It was a major priority for Fianna F&aacute;il in the budget negotiations.  Local authorities, including mine, are engaging with it on the delivery of affordable homes for working people on State-owned land.  I wholeheartedly support it but I want a timeframe.  It means real delivery.  About 6,200 homes can be delivered under it.  When we start rolling it out, it can and should be expanded further.  We have to look at doing that.  Can the Minister give me a timeframe for the publication of regulations?  It will be greatly appreciated.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the Land Development Agency and that he was bringing the heads of the Bill to Cabinet.  When does the Minister see the Bill coming to the House to debate the workings of the Land Development Agency?  </p> <p>  That brings me to two other questions about pending legislation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin alluded to it.  Both Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I have engaged extensively with the Minister on the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill, which we are hoping to see strengthen the rights of students in student accommodation and provide for enhanced powers for the Residential Tenancies Board.  The Minister's statement - I mean this respectfully - is something he could have delivered to us a couple of months ago.  What is the delay with bringing forward the Bill?  Is there a disagreement on the potential criminal or civil penalties?  My party and I are of the view we should move towards civil penalties.  The issue with the RTB is the issue of bringing enforcement orders to court.  It is not required in many instances.  I would like an update on when the Minister intends to bring forward that.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and others have legislation.  We held back on it - we published it - on the basis this Bill would be brought forward and that the Minister would include some of it in the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned short-term letting.  We know what the Minister has said so far about dealing with short-term letting and regulations.  When will we see this brought forward so we can get it implemented?  The residential tenancies (amendment) Bill is very important.  The Department is doing a review of the Rebuilding Ireland affordable loans.  I asked about this at committee previously.  The review is on the basis of the standardisation of criteria for financial underwriting.  There have been differences between local authorities.  At what stage is that review?  Have we standardised the financial underwriting criteria?  What is required for the applications?  Will the Minister give me an update on the loan approval rate?  We had a refusal rate of about two-thirds which was reduced to 50%, so one in two were being refused.  What is the position now?  What is the level of drawdown?</p> <p> The repair and lease scheme was not mentioned in the Minister's statement.  To be fair, I know the Minister cannot mention everything.  </p></speech>

Have those changes made a difference?  Has there been an increase in the number of properties being made available via the scheme?  It is very good as a concept, but I hope we are not strangling ourselves with regulation.</p><p> Has the Minister an update in regard to the EUROSTAT classification of approved housing bodies, AHBs, as being on balance sheet and the impact of that on the ability of AHBs to deliver social housing units?  He mentioned that he met representatives of the European Investment Bank.  Housing delivery through approved housing bodies is a major part of Government strategy and will be a part of the solution to the housing crisis but, obviously, the on-balance-sheet issue may stymie further delivery in that sector.</p><p> Has the Government given up on rapid build units?  Delivery in that regard was far below the target set for last year and is similarly off target so far this year.  Has the rapid-build-unit idea been shelved or is it being revised within the Department?</p></speech>

We have tenanted at least 40,000 through the HAP programme and it is working for those people.  We are not seeing an abnormal number of people exiting HAP as a result of the tenancy breaking down compared to what is the case in the traditional private rental market.  HAP is not having the impacts which some people claim it is.  There are individual cases involving people who find themselves in difficulty with which Deputies, as local representatives, must deal, but that does not mean the programme is not working.</p></speech>

If the lease is discontinued for whatever reason, the person can move to another accommodation and still avail of HAP support.  Approximately 1,500 people exited HAP via the transfer list into the permanent stock of social housing, while up to 2,000 people exited HAP because they no longer required it due to a change in their circumstances, which is very welcome.  More than 40,000 HAP tenancies have been created.</p></speech>

That will support those currently in HAP tenancies and fund the creation of new HAP tenancies.  As I stated, we will reach a tipping point in 2020 and 2021, which is the final year of Rebuilding Ireland.  By that time, the building of social housing by local authorities and housing bodies will have recovered sufficiently such that people will be primarily supported through our stock of social housing.  There is a funding commitment under the national development plan to continue that to 2027, with a projected 110,000 social housing homes to be built between now and 2027.</p> <p>  We will publish the criteria for the serviced sites fund next week.  That work is almost complete.  I hope to publish it next week before the D&aacute;il rises.  The basic qualifying criterion is an income of less than &euro;75,000 for a couple or &euro;50,000 for an individual.  The documentation provided to the committee contains a table listing the sites that have been agreed in principle and another detailing the sites we are working to get agreed in principle.  We will run the serviced sites fund in a similar manner to the urban regeneration fund, involving A, B and C streams.  The A stream involves sites that are ready to go, the B stream regards sites that need more work and the C stream pertains to sites that were not successful but which we want to quickly progress into the B stream.  Each local authority has been asked to carry out an economic assessment of its area to determine how it will deliver affordable homes on its public land.  The results of those assessments will inform our second call which will go out in the new year.</p> <p>  I want the Bill to provide a legislative basis for the Land Development Agency, LDA, to pass through the Houses by Easter because I want to get extra capital into the LDA as quickly as possible.  If I publish the heads of the Bill next week, the committee will then need to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny.  I hope to appoint a board to the agency as quickly as possible in order that it can begin to take certain steps in terms of accounts and the hiring of additional staff and so on.  It is already working.  It aims to begin lodging its first planning applications next year and I do not want to do anything to delay that.  The agency is up and running but it is important it has a legislative basis.</p> <p>  On the  residential tenancies (amendment) Bill, I will firstly address student accommodation.  Student accommodation let under a tenancy agreement is currently covered.   As Deputy Darragh O'Brien is aware from his discussions with Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and me, the aim is to ensure purpose-built student accommodation under a licence or other student accommodation that might be under a licence from a public body is also captured.  We are trying to compile the evidence and information and ensure the proposal in that regard is robust.  The information I published yesterday, of which members are aware, will form the basis of an amendment which will be tabled on Committee Stage of the Bill.  Work remains to be done in that regard but we have time to do so because, obviously, the measures will not be retrospective but, rather, will apply into the future.</p> <p>  On the delay to the  residential tenancies (amendment) Bill, I wanted to ensure the extra powers being given to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, are robust rather than symbolic.  There was a significant amount of discussion between myself and the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the RTB would be able to have powers similar to those in a European model while recognising that we do not have a European legal system in Ireland but, rather, a common law jurisdiction.  It is sometimes difficult to find that balance.  Certain matters will be liable to be treated as a criminal offence or may instead be pursued by means of administrative sanction.  That relates to a question asked by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  It will be for the RTB to decide whether the breach of the rent pressure zone regulation is sufficiently serious as to warrant a criminal prosecution and possible prison sentence or ought to be dealt with using the new administrative powers of the RTB to issue a fine, warning, caution or similar.  We have provided two streams which the RTB may follow.  Should the RTB wish to pursue a case as a criminal offence, it will be able to do so or, alternatively, may deal with it using its administrative powers, such as imposing a fine.</p></speech>

We have tried to bring forward in the first rent Bill measures on which all Deputies and Senators can agree such that it can pass through the Houses quickly.  I hope Oireachtas Members do not table amendments dealing with other possibly more complex areas which can be covered in a further Bill.  We need to get this Bill enacted quickly because these are important powers that will protect people.  I hope now that the Bill is published, it will be prioritised in the Oireachtas schedule by the Business Committee in order that we can hit the ground running in January and get it through the House quickly.  However, I am in the hands of the Oireachtas in terms of how long it will take for the Bill to pass.</p> <p>  The draft guidelines on short-term letting have been given to the committee.  The required changes to primary legislation are very simple and can happen very quickly.  However, the House may approve or reject the regulations I lay before it but it may not amend them.  We have provided draft regulations to the committee in the hope that it can test them along with departmental officials.  If the regulations are approved following the two-week waiting time after I submit them, they will become law.  We have until 1 June to get this done but we should not wait until the last minute.  The committee and the Oireachtas should be resolute that this change is coming on 1 June, that nothing will stop it and that people should be prepared for it.  We do not want people to come forward on 1 June to say they were not ready for the changes because the law had not been passed.  This law will be passed before then.</p></speech>

That very visible increase is a reflection on the Minister, the Department and, obviously, the more focused thinking that has been employed.  However, I ask the Minister to address certain areas that require further consideration.  Much of our towns is no longer needed as retail space because of a change in retail patterns such as people buying online and so on.  Some retail units in Drogheda and, I am sure, elsewhere in the country will no longer be used as such.  Is there a plan to analyse that obvious shift in usage and to fast-track change of use?</p></speech>

It could be part of the role of the empty homes officer to look at these properties which are vacant and derelict as well as at properties on brown field sites which are derelict and past use.  It could be an important focus to provide increased accommodation as the services are in place.  One has the water, sewerage, footpaths, lighting and everything else.</p><p>I raise also matters relating to Louth.  I keep raising the following point.  There has been positive CPO progress there.  However, while other local authorities are doing it too, they are not all working at the pace they should be.  How can the Minister increase the pressure on local authorities which are not doing their jobs to ensure they step up to the mark and do the business?  The following is an important point.  Louth County Council has a huge debt.  It incurred &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million in debt in buying land at the height of the boom and is now faced with servicing that debt at a crippling cost.  Is there a possibility the Minister might be able to aggregate those loans to take some of the burden off local authorities like Louth County Council so that they can focus on providing more homes and refurbishing existing ones?  It should be a condition of doing so that the authorities would have to commit to using the funding released as a result to provide housing.</p><p>Perhaps the most important point I will make today is that in the past few weeks approximately 15 local authority tenants had their gas boilers fail but the county council does not have the funding to replace them.  When one visits a family of four or five including children with disabilities and people who are sick and unwell in their homes who cannot light the fire and have no heat, it is not good enough.  The local authority can do ordinary repairs but the cost of replacing a boiler in full is a serious problem.  It is hugely important to ensure that any family or person who pays the rent and is a good tenant is not left in that appalling situation.  Week after week, they are told they have top priority but the authority does not have the funds.  It will have the funds in the turnover of the new year, but they need them now.  Can the Minister look at that?  There are also some older people who were corporation tenants and who cannot replace their boilers.  I do not know if anyone else has that problem, but it is a very serious one for many families and we must find a way to assist them.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's proposal to introduce sanctions for people who do not meet their requirements under residential tenancies legislation.  Criminal sanctions are an absolute deterrent.  If one knows for sure that one will be hit on the head with a very significant fine, one will not break the law.  The small number of landlords in this category would instead ensure they treated their tenants in accordance with the law.</p><p>I support a constitutional right to housing.  It is a good idea.  What one has to do is balance the measure to impose a duty on local authorities under such a constitutional amendment to act reasonably and with due consideration for the needs of the individual.  That is how the Constitution would be interpreted.  It would not mean that everybody would get a house just because he or she wanted one; it would mean that housing needs would have to be met proportionately, in good time and in a fair way.  Some people are not having their needs met but I welcome the progress being made.  I thank the Chair.</p></speech>

The only issue with which I want to deal is affordable housing and what housing will cost under the affordable scheme.  A lot of people are interested in hearing the answer to that question.  I note the Minister has informed the committee that he intends to publish next week the criteria for the affordable housing arrangements.  People will be watching very carefully to see what is announced there.  I look at the section of the speech dealing with affordable housing and a key line in it is the statement that there will be serviced sites funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and that on this basis at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated.  I look at the figure of &euro;50,000 and I see that the average market price of a home in Dublin is approximately &euro;380,000.  If one takes &euro;50,000 away from that, one comes to &euro;330,000 which is well beyond the means of a young person out of university who has worked for a couple of years or even of many workers on the average wage.  However, I am keen to tease out how the &euro;50,000 will work because the speech said the funding was available to facilitate infrastructure and to support the provision to purchase or rent.  Am I correct to say that means it is not a straightforward situation of a market price minus &euro;50,000?  Rather, the &euro;50,000 will go on infrastructure and contribute to a lower price in a different way.  Can the Minister clarify that?  To get down to brass tacks, which is what people watching will be interested in, I take the examples of Dublin and Cork, our two largest cities.  Under the terms of the affordable housing arrangements the Minister intends to publish next week, what will it mean in practical terms for a working couple on the average wage for the price of a house in Dublin or Cork?  What will be knocked off the extraordinarily high and unaffordable market rates that exist now?  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dowd referred to the changing nature of our towns and villages and he is absolutely right about how we need to rethink that whole area.  That is why in talking about rebuilding our housing sector, we are not talking about recreating what was there before.  We need to build a new one.  That means more people living in towns and centres and a greater commitment to compact growth, which we have through Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland.  We changed the regulations to allow people to convert accommodation above shops into as many as nine homes - no more - without the need for planning permission.  That also applies at ground level.  A consultation was done on this, which has concluded, and a document will be published shortly to give people greater guidance on doing that.</p> <p>  The repair and lease scheme has been one thing we have tried to pursue to get derelict buildings in town centres back into use.  In our urban fund, which was launched recently, approximately 27% of the first round of &euro;100 million was used for those integrated projects to bring about living in town and village centres again.  We have a process under way to CPO properties to sell back into private ownership.  A couple of pilots are being looked at around that.  Certain villages or towns are not going to have the retail focused high streets they had in the past due to the way the economy has changed.  As such, there are properties which could and should be used for housing because the infrastructure is already in place and due to the benefits that come from that kind of community living.</p> <p>  On CPOs more generally, our vacancy teams are in place.  Vacancy rates are not as high as previously thought and we have much better information now thanks to the recent Indecon report.  However, our local authority teams are identifying vacant units and we have a number of pilots under way in six local authorities.  They are now starting to drill down into what is actually vacant as opposed to what appears to be vacant.  We want them to move towards CPOs on those properties or to at least get into that process.  We are awaiting advice from the Attorney General on a more enhanced CPO process, again around that private side.  The Department of Justice and Equality is leading on reform of our CPO law more generally based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.</p> <p>  I refer to land debt.  We did this previously with the first phase of the land aggregation scheme, or LAGS.  Deputy O'Dowd might not know that we have written to Louth County Council specifically on the land debt issues it faces to see what we can to do ensure they do not impact on its ability to deliver housing.  We have problems in some local authorities where the land that is subject to debt and repayments with interest is not suitable for housing, which is a tougher nut to crack.</p><p>However, we are examining potential ways in which we can look at that.</p><p> The local property tax review has been completed on our side in terms of allocations to local authorities and we are just waiting to complete the second item of work, which relates to the work we are doing with the Department of Finance.  We will see houses that have been built in recent years that are not liable to the local property tax, LPT coming into that net, which will mean we will be able to increase allocations to local authorities based on new criteria that have been designed.  We will announce that when we are ready to go with the second piece of the LPT.</p><p> Regarding gas boilers, &euro;35 million has been allocated to be spent on energy efficiency this year.  If Louth County Council has a particular problem regarding boilers and their replacement, it should contact us directly.  We should be replacing boilers when they need to be replaced and not waiting unnecessarily for the passing of two or three weeks.  In terms of budgetary limits in a year, capital ceilings and so on, that type of spending is done year on year and it is important we are not in breach of those.  The replacing a few gas boilers would not involve a great deal of money and I am sure it is something that could be done.  I would ask Louth County Council to contact us directly on that and Deputy O'Dowd might be able to facilitate it in that respect.  I do not know why it has not contacted us if this is as much of a concern as the Deputy has made it out to be.</p><p> Regarding the rent Bill, I acknowledge the Deputy has welcomed that we are going to introduce new criminal sanctions but also administrative sanctions so that the RTB can move directly to sanction rogue landlords whom it finds to be in breach of their obligations.</p><p> On Deputy Barry's question on affordability, one of the points I was keen to stress in my opening statement - it was shorter than I would have liked just for the sake of not boring everyone with too long a statement - is that this week we have published the first two lists of sites we are moving on with in terms of affordability.  We know the sites in terms of table A that are agreed in principle to be developed for affordable housing and the number of homes that can be derived from that in terms of subsidised housing schemes.  We have a second table of sites we are working on with those local authorities and we have every other local authority doing an economic assessment as to how they will deliver and take advantage of the fund we have in place.  More generally speaking in terms of affordability, we know that one in two first-time buyers in the 12 months up to June bought their homes for less than &euro;250,000.  We know that affordability is not an issue in every part of the country, a point to which, I believe, the Deputy alluded.  That does not mean we cannot have subsidised housing schemes under the serviced sites fund being delivered in many more local authorities other than Cork and Dublin.  That is why we have the second table and the reason we are asking other local authorities to do their own economic assessments.</p><p> The &euro;50,000 figure is an average amount.  Not every home on a site will require &euro;50,000 worth of infrastructure works to be done to open up that site for delivery.  What we are talking about in this context is, if a local authority has its own land and owns it, the cost of contracting a person to build a house on that site.  Obviously, the local authority does not build directly in terms of having its own builders hired directly to it.  What are the ancillary costs of servicing that site in terms of facilities and works, such as different types of infrastructure, for example, an entrance road, roads within the site, lighting, water and wastewater?  Will a housing body be involved?  More than likely it will, and there is the matter of managing aspects of that.  What is the value of the land?  If the land is at market value, that value and the amount that goes into servicing the site can be discounted from the final delivery price.</p><p> We have put in place certain caps to provide that the discounted price can be no more than 40% of the cost of the house.  The local authority takes it equity share, which has to be repaid because this is a co-operative approach whereby the local authority and the purchaser come together to buy the house and part of the mortgage is parked in terms of the local authority having it, and that has to be repaid over time.  That will then give us the price of the house in terms of what the person buying it is going to pay.  It is not a case of taking account of the market value of a house in, say, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and discounting a few thousand from the price.  That is not the way we are doing it.  We have also put other caps in place in terms of-----</p></speech>

In the case of Dublin, if the figure was &euro;378,000 it would bring it down to &euro;330,000.  Is that the way that it works?</p></speech>

We would take those two figures together and discount that, but the maximum discount available is 40% of what the price might be on the market.  If a house was on the market for &euro;400,000, potentially the discount could be 40%, but that is an equity stake.</p></speech>

I always give credit where it is due.  This is a pretty serious matter.  There is a very significant discrepancy in the  local authority output figures in 2017 between what the Minister is claiming and what is in the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, report published in September 2018.  This exposes a spin that is going on about output figures.  According to the Minister's housing delivery for 2017, the total number of houses added to the local authority stock was 4,269 but, according to NOAC, the figure is 2,019, which is more than 50% less new local authority stock than what the Minister is claiming.  The NOAC report sets out the total local authority housing stock at the beginning of, and at the end of, 2017 and one can subtract one figure from the other.  How does the Minister explain this discrepancy?  It is a very significant discrepancy and it has very big implications for all the Minister's targets not only for 2017 but for every year out to 2021.  If the point is valid, there are some serious questions to be answered.</p> <p>  What seems to be at the bottom of the discrepancy, essentially, is the miscounting or double counting of sales of local authority housing, demolitions and, critically, voids.  I raised this point with Brendan Kenny and he more or less acknowledged it.  A void implies something that has been lying empty for ages, work is done on it and finally it is brought back into use.  That is fine if it is a genuine void, but if a void is just a casual turnover, there is a big difference.  I put it to the Minister that those casual turnovers are being counted in his claims for output as new local authority housing stock when they are not that.  If we note the Dublin City Council targets that Brendan Kenny showed us, there are 1,000 voids roughly every year for most of the duration of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  That is preposterous because that would suggest, if we read it at face value, that there are 4,000 or 5,000 voids in the hands of Dublin City Council, but of course there are not.  We noticed there are some but not that many.  What we are counting are casual turnovers or vacancies.  I would like that point addressed.  If the additional local authority housing stock is half of what is being claimed, that needs to be admitted honestly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.595" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>Indeed, the NOAC report suggests that in 2017, in all four local authority areas in Dublin, there were only 564 additional units of housing stock.  That is my first point.  My second point is on the issue of price.  We were out in Cherrywood.  I talked to the guy from Hines.  It is unusual for me to be talking to these capitalists.</p></speech>

I did not name anybody.  He said the cost of the units Hines intends to deliver later than expected - 26 months for the first phase is a long time - was approximately &euro;400,000 per unit.  These are mostly apartments.  If they are costing him &euro;400,000, what will they cost people in the area?  Whatever it is will be in excess of &euro;400,000, which is totally unaffordable for the vast majority of people who are affected by the current housing crisis.  Whether they are working people on average earnings or even those earning up to &euro;80,000 a year, it is way beyond what they can afford.  What the hell is the point of that?  We have fanfare about the delivery of the biggest residential development in the State, but the vast bulk of it will be completely unaffordable.  What does the Minister say about that?</p> <p>  I have just been struck by something I find slightly worrying.  Outside the window where we were, there were trucks with lights flashing and a digger.  I went down afterwards to see what it was doing.  It was doing absolutely nothing.  It was literally waving its arm around and moving a few stones from one place to another because nothing was actually happening on the site.  This was done for the optics of the cameras.  They have been sitting on that site for years and we now discover the latest date they are giving us is 26 months.  What the hell is happening here?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#L01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for the questions.  We need to be very careful when we talk about numbers so that in trying to make a political charge against me, members do not end up inadvertently undermining the system we have in terms of the permanent government of civil servants and Departments.  If we spend money on housing and give numbers on houses delivered through a build programme, those numbers are not verified just by the actual houses built but through a whole system of accounting that goes before the Accounting Officer and the different reporting he has to do.  There are checks and balances with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and everyone else.  We have to be careful in making political charges against each other about how we define voids that we do not inadvertently target the system that supports all of us in delivering public services for the public good.</p> <p>  What bothers me with some commentators, whom I will not name but who are fully aware that we have a number of different streams to increase the stock of social housing, is that they cherry-pick certain numbers or streams, compare them with others and state that something does not add up to create confusion.  We have invited different commentators and economists who are working publicly in the area to the Department on numerous occasions to explain Rebuilding Ireland and the different delivery streams we have, but some continue to do that.  They continue to measure only local authority builds against our social housing stock increases or our social housing builds, which include other streams of delivery.  It is more prudent to spread out our streams of delivery for social housing, because should we then come into difficulty, we will not then have no social houses being built.  That is the approach we have taken under Rebuilding Ireland to protect the delivery of social housing from future shocks.</p> <p>  I met the new chair of NOAC yesterday to go through a number of issues around the commission.  It is a new body, albeit four years old now, and there is a great deal more it can do to give people greater faith and trust around what is happening around local spending.  We often hear about how a local authority may have defaulted with Revenue.  People ask how that can have happened.  To have those things aired at national level is a matter in respect of which NOAC has a great role to play.  It can tell people what is actually happening there so that they can continue to have faith in their local authorities.  However, the NOAC report does not count the increase in stock delivered through housing bodies which are working with us to use public money to increase the stock of social housing.  It does not include houses delivered through the Part V process which are homes we then get into the stock of social housing.  These are social housing homes.  It used to be that Part V was the only delivery mechanism we had but now we have many more, thankfully.</p> <p>  When we publish our numbers under Rebuilding Ireland, it is the State and the Government of Ireland producing those numbers.  It would be a different thing if the Minister was getting a number and requiring the number to be doubled or changing the press release to include another number.  While I know that political charge is not being made against me, when we count the numbers and publish our information in the Department, we are very clear to ensure we publish accurate information on what is spent and what is delivered in social housing stock.  In any event, that is the difference between what NOAC has and what we publish.  There is a difference and people should point it out when they are talking about it publicly.  If a so-called expert on housing is discussing the stock of social housing, he or she should point out what he or she is not counting and be fair about what is actually being done and the progress being made under Rebuilding Ireland.  Of course, not everything is moving in the right direction.  The number of people in emergency accommodation tells us that.  When we look at the repair and leasing scheme numbers, it tells us that.  I have numbers from a previous question I can provide in a moment.</p> <p>  Voids are not being double counted.  They are not allowed to be in the funding line we have.  We are not talking about casual vacancies.  We are talking about houses that need upwards of &euro;30,000 to get them back into use.  Unfortunately, there was something of a perverse incentive regarding a long-term vacancy versus a short-term vacancy when it came to social housing.  There was a fear that some local authorities would allow a house to be vacant longer than it should have been to get more funding.  We do not want that happening.  As we get these voids back into use, funding will go towards maintaining the stock.  It is happening now as we move towards the end of Rebuilding Ireland over the next two years.  Funding will go towards ensuring that casual vacancies are short-term and that it does not take forever to let the house again.  In any event, voids are not double counted and they cannot be under the programme.  We separate voids from our delivery.  I wanted to ensure that when we referred to more than 4,000 homes in the social housing stock this year, it did not include voids.  When we talk about more than 6,000 next year, that will not include voids.  That is important in terms of transparency, accountability and everyone knowing exactly what we are delivering and trying to deliver.</p> <p>  Cherrywood is fantastic.  What will happen there is that more than 23,000 people will come to live in Cherrywood in more than 9,000 homes.  This is a new town.  It is huge.  It is incorrect to say that nothing is happening there.  Look at all the roads.  Look at the Luas going through and the council going through with water services, wastewater infrastructure, lighting, sports pitches and tennis courts.  Now, they are ready to build.  They have got commencement and are going on site and building.  It is important that they will build.  The cost of delivering apartments is high due to the amount of money spent on the excellent infrastructure to serve the communities there.  They are going for the build-to-rent model which is different from the cost of owning and buying.  We need more build-to-rent as it is important.  The standards for apartments are better, which means they are more expensive.  However, we have worked to help cut costs so that, in an area like Cherrywood, the default will be no car parking spaces for an apartment block or just a few to cater for visitors or those people with a permanent need for a car.  When there are five Luas stops through Cherrywood and the Dublin Bus network going across the site, there is great transport infrastructure and we do not need car parking spaces.</p> <p>  The new build-to-rent guidelines will also help to drive down costs for future planning applications which come forward.  Of the housing delivered, 10% will be social and we have an affordability dividend coming from LIHAF.  In everything we do, the fundamental thing is the delivery of supply.  If new homes are not being built, there is no point talking about how much they will cost to buy or rent or what percentage is social.</p><p>We need to make sure we are catering for everyone's housing need. </p><p> If the Deputy considers the approximately 25,000 homes that will be built next year - the Central Bank thinks it will be more like 24,000, but we will know at the end of next year - at least 6,000 will be social housing homes.  The remainder will be new homes for families throughout the country, which will all be bought.  Some, but not all, will be bought at very high prices because people can afford to buy at such a price level.  In the 12 months up to June, one in two first-time buyers bought their houses for less than &euro;250,000.  In parts of the country affordability is not an issue.  Residential construction is now driving the growth in commercial construction.  We are also seeing the slowest pace of house price increases in the past two years.  These aspects of Rebuilding Ireland are working and helping people.</p></speech>

I will make one simple request, which the Minister committed to previously, that is, to bring all the stakeholders and parties together early in the new year.  It is important that it happens.  It is the desire of the elected members of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It is a commitment the Minister gave on the record to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The Government has three Deputies in that constituency, which is a remarkable achievement, and they are clearly very committed to it too.  For a whole range of reasons it is important the Minister's staff, Philomena Poole, the chief executive of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, her staff and the elected members are all on track with the same message.  We hear the same story and the same responses.  We should rule out the possibility that we will not have a house on the site until 2022.  It is totally unacceptable.  We need construction in 2019.  Perhaps the Minister will flesh that issue out and give us a commitment to meet all the stakeholders early in January.</p></speech>

It is absolutely no problem.  I want people to be assured that work has continued.  It is not that nothing is happening.  The NDFA has been working with the local authority to try to get the financial model right.  I had my staff out there again today to see what further work can be done.  I raised it with the representatives of the European Investment Bank, EIB, when they were in Dublin last week at a conference.  It is absolutely a priority as far as the Department is concerned.  A delivery board is in place.  Perhaps the meeting should be with the delivery board.  We can do it in January.  It is not a problem at all.</p></speech>

We are for housing in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We want to make sure there are no unnecessary delays or blockages.  We also want to make sure we get it right.  We do not want this to proceed through the various stages and processes and fail at the last minute because the financial modelling was rushed.  Much has been done.  The NDFA is the expert on this.  If it was as simple as saying the numbers work, it would have happened by now, so obviously there is a problem with the financial modelling that still needs to be resolved.</p> <p>  I will return to the questions by Deputy &Oacute; Broin that I did not get to respond to.  On the constitutional right to housing, not putting a right to housing into the Constitution will not get in the way of us building houses.  It will not get in the way of us completing Rebuilding Ireland.  It will not get in the way of us moving to the national development plan part of Project Ireland 2040.  It will not get in the way of the commitment that one in five homes built will go to the social housing stock or all the many important things we need to do around affordability that can be delivered now because we have specific funding lines.  We now have the first agreed-in-principle site under the serviced sites fund.  We understand that but it is important for the public to understand that the fact there is not a constitutional right to housing or legislation that provides for a right to housing is not stopping us from delivering.  The delivery of supply is ramping up quite dramatically.</p> <p>  As to whether there needs to be protection in the Constitution, the process is being handled by a separate committee looking at socio-economic rights and how we achieve that balance in society.  Is it through constitutional amendment or legislation?  People have different views on this.  I heard Deputy O'Dowd on the radio with Eamon Delaney from the Hibernia Forum debating the role of the Constitution and what it is meant to enshrine.  In recent conversations I have had with some people on a referendum on the public ownership of water, it has moved in part from being a debate on whether it should be in the Constitution to a debate about which part of the Constitution because, it is said, certain parts are stronger than others.  I spoke to the Attorney General about it.  It is nonsense.  The Constitution is the Constitution.  The Constitution is not the appropriate place in which to enshrine every law or right.  We need to come to an understanding at some point about the role of the Constitution as we go through this transformative stage of our history where so much positive change is happening.  The Constitution is the vehicle for that change.</p> <p>  I am open-minded about whether we need to put a right to housing into the Constitution.  I cannot speak for the Taoiseach but I think he is also open-minded.  The Government is not set in a direction on this.  We are engaged in a process that has done the public good in terms of marriage equality and repealing the eighth amendment.  We will continue with that process of Oireachtas committee engagement and coming to a determination of the next step in this public debate we are having.  To return to my previous point, it is not getting in the way of delivery.  If I felt it was getting in the way of delivery, we would be having a separate conversation.  If I felt the lack of a law was getting in the way of delivery, we would be having a separate conversation about constitutional rights.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the Residential Tenancies Board and the powers coming under the legislation that is now published.  We have allowed for two tracks and it will be up to the RTB to decide the appropriate one.  We will be addressing it on Second Stage but I will go through very quickly how it is envisaged from some notes I made on the sanctioning regime before Second Stage.  A complaint will be made or discovered by the RTB and an inspector will be appointed to investigate the complaint.  As part of the inspection process, the landlord will have a right to make his or her views known about what he or she thinks of the complaint.  There will be an independent panel of decision-makers appointed by the RTB and the report will go to a person on the panel.  They will be referred to as decision-makers in the legislation.  They will then make a decision as to what the sanction should be.  It will go to the RTB board for a decision and it will formally issue the decision but the decision will be made by the decision-maker following a recommendation by the inspector.  The landlord either accepts it or challenges it.</p> <p>  The decision-maker will effectively be able to decide, because we are allowing for new criminal offences, whether it warrants criminal pursuit of the landlord through the courts because he or she has breached one of these new offences of not co-operating with an inspection, not adhering to the rent pressure zone, not registering the tenancy or getting around the RPZ by using the substantial change provision in the wrong way.  If it goes through the administrative civil sanction route, which is also provided for in the legislation, which is a fine of up to &euro;15,000, the recovery of costs up to &euro;15,000 and the publishing of the person's name on the website or in the newspapers, it will be up to the decision-maker to decide and then for the RTB to sanction the preferred route.  We have allowed for both to make sure we are really giving a new power to the RTB and that we are cutting out any unnecessary time delays by allowing for an administrative sanction.</p> <p>  From time to time we see rogue landlords - they should not be called landlords - doing despicable things and, effectively, breaching people's human rights.  We are telling the RTB that, if the breach is so severe and if it is that level of injustice, it can go the criminal route if it thinks it should try to get a prison sentence.  We have allowed for both in the legislation under the new RTB Bill, which has been published.  If we all have agreement on the proposed way forward, and I think we do from pre-legislative scrutiny and other things that have happened, we can move very quickly through the House if the committee schedules it.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about the assessment of Rebuilding Ireland.  It has been completed.  I got a couple of people independent from the Department to come into the Department to do some work on that and see if the home loan could be improved.</p><p>It is important to say that not all of the applications received were valid.  Of the 2,850 assessed applications, which were the valid ones, 1,452 have been recommended for approval by the Housing Agency, so it is 51% or half.  It then falls to the credit committee in the local authority to say yes or no about the loan.  The total drawdown of loans to date is &euro;47.6 million from the &euro;200 million tranche.  It is almost 25%.  The scheme was only opened in February of this year.  Anyone who has been through the mortgage process knows that it does take time to find the house one wants to buy, to get to sale agreed and to get through the process.  The expected end of year drawdown is approaching &euro;92.1 million.  That is based on what we have in our tables in terms of the information that is coming in.  We all know how popular a product this is, as people want to get a fixed-interest mortgage over the lifetime of the loan.  I do not know if Deputy O'Brien has met anyone who has been fortunate enough to avail of it.</p></speech>

We have had 1,000 applications for the repair and leasing scheme, RLS, as of quarter 3 of this year.  One hundred agreements for lease have been signed.  To date, we have had 39 solely in 2018.  We know the delivery in 2017 was poor, with nine.  We have 100 leased and we are working through another 100 applications.  The vacant housing offices are prioritising the scheme.  It is a good concept but the more I look at the individual projects that come under the repair and leasing scheme, the more I realise the circumstances are unique.  A person needs to own a second home that he or she is not using, it needs to be in a state of disrepair, and the person must not have the funds to bring it back into use, or not want to use the funds in that way.  That person must be willing to give over the house for use as social housing and there needs to be a social housing need in the area.  While we need to have it in our armoury in terms of getting vacant properties back into use, it may not be what we thought it was going to be initially.  We are seeing greater progress in the system with the repair and leasing scheme.  What we have seen is more take-up in terms of the buy and renew scheme instead.  People engage with the RLS and then they get involved in the buy and renew scheme because that appears to be a better option.  The scheme is working better and we will continue to drive it.</p> <p>  AHBs and reclassification was another point Deputy O'Brien raised.  This came up at the EIB conference that was held in the Central Bank last week.  We had a large housing body from Scotland there.  It is bigger than any of our tier 3 bodies.  It might be as big as our three tier 3 bodies combined.  Reclassification was addressed in terms of how it affected the UK.  We have had a ruling on some - not all - of the larger housing bodies, and we are working through that.  One of the things I wanted to do was to have that led by the Department of Finance to make it clear to the industry that this is an accounting issue rather than a delivery issue and it will not impact on delivery.  The committee continues to do its work and to engage with EUROSTAT and the Commission.  I have raised it in each of my engagements with the EIB because as we look to new lending streams from it, classification is important in terms of whether it is on-balance sheet, off-balance sheet or state aid.  While the EIB is not the classification body of the EU, it has good expertise in this area.  We will continue to examine the issue to ensure that we can work to it without it impacting on delivery.  It will not impact on delivery.  The important thing is that the lead body for housing bodies has also given a commitment that it will do what it needs to do to make sure that classification issues do not impact upon delivery from its point of view in the raising of finance and other such areas.  We will progress the matter in tandem with progressing the Bill next year in terms of trying to come to a more certain outcome.  Sometimes these engagements with the Commission take time and that can be in our interest in terms of what we are doing right now on the ground.</p></speech>

It shows that there are ways around this that may be able to be addressed in the regulation Bill that is coming through.  We continue to look at that to see what can be done in that regard.  We will continue to fight that good fight.  The most important message for the housing bodies is that they have a delivery stream under Rebuilding Ireland and we are determined to make sure that they deliver it, which they will.  The classification issue, which is related to accounting is not going to get in the way.</p> <p>  The rapid build housing programme has not been shelved.  It is a very unfortunate name.  What we are talking about is prefabricated housing off site so that when it gets on site, the on-site piece of housing delivery happens much more quickly.  It does not mean that we are short-circuiting planning, architectural design, the procurement process, or approval processes for money from the Department.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  The programme has not been shelved but the delays we are seeing are not necessarily at the on-site side.  Some of the delays are in getting local authorities to use the delivery method.  I hope the new procurement framework being pioneered by Dublin City Council on volumetric modular housing will open the way for other local authorities to use it as well.  We are seeing significant interest from private companies.  Companies have come to me saying that if I could give them a contract, they would open a factory off the M50 and start producing thousands of products.  There are two problems in that regard.  I cannot do that because of procurement law.  I have sought to address the issue, but I have not been allowed to do it.  The EU law in this area is incredibly tight.  We cannot break procurement law even though we have a homelessness crisis and we know we need to ramp up the delivery of housing.  Even if I could break procurement law, we would still have to go through the proper planning process and make sure that what we are doing is being built in the right place, to the right specifications and will not lead to us asking in 30 years why we did that, as we face a future crisis.  We are trying to protect ourselves from future crises.</p> <p>  To return to the reclassification issue concerning housing bodies, I think one other country that might have been restricted in the same way has either said publicly it will or is considering pursuing this through the European Court of Justice, ECJ, which would have a pause effect on aspects of classification.  I know we want clarity but sometimes a lack of clarity can be helpful in terms of driving delivery and getting things done.  We will continue to be mindful of our obligations to deal with the classification issue while we bring forward the regulation Bill next year and while we continue to drive the delivery of housing bodies.  I think I have addressed all of the outstanding questions.</p></speech>

We have very little time left, so I will allocate three minutes per member.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is first, then Senator Boyhan, Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#N02300"><p>I wish to focus on the social housing output report.  On the basis of the figures the Minister has given us, only 35% of the new builds have been delivered as of quarter 3, which means 65% remain to be delivered in the final quarter.  That is very worrying.  I know we will not know the final output until the end of the year but to have to deliver or complete 65% of the target in three months seems a very big ask.  How reassured is the Minister at this stage that he will come back to us in January or early February with 100% delivery on the new builds?</p> <p>  I wish to pick up on something Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  When Mr. Brendan Kenny was before the committee, he made it very clear that he does not count the expensive casual vacancies as voids.  The Minister can check the transcript.  Will the Minister consider taking them out of the output report?  It is very helpful that he counts them separately and I accept the legitimacy of doing that, but they are not additions to the stock anymore.  They were at an earlier stage in the programme but that is no longer the case.</p><p>I am not challenging anybody, but I wish to point out that the void programme has changed.  Although it is useful to have the figure, it should not be in the output report.</p><p> On the RTB, again, the information the Minister has provided is helpful.  Will the proposed legislation which members have not yet seen give the RTB the power to impose fines on landlords in breach of rent reviews and rent pressure zones without having to go to the courts?  Will it be able to issue a civil sanction such as a fine?  I urge caution in regard to the level of referrals to the board.  The RTB used to have approximately 88 board meetings a year because of the volume of board decisions.  That has been dramatically reduced, which has made it more efficient, so I have a concern regarding the level of referrals.</p><p> On cost rental, one of my concerns is that we do not now what will be the starting rents.  We have been told that for the properties on Enniskerry Road it may be approximately 80% of market rate.  Part of the financing problem is that if a person has an EIB loan, for example, or a private sector loan over 25 years, and he or she wants to pay down that loan and cover the cost of the management and maintenance of the unit, the start-off rent must be quite high.  If that person was able to combine an EIB loan over a 25 year period with a capital advance loan facility from the State for ten years thereafter, for example, the start-off rent could be significantly reduced.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister asking whether he would be willing to consider amending the capital amounts loan facility arrangements to allow such a loan under conditions similar to those currently in place, involving 30% of the loan value, and for that to be paid down after the EIB loan.  That would bring starting rents down from more than &euro;1,000 to closer to &euro;700 or &euro;800, which would be eminently more affordable.  I expected that to have been considered in the budget and I ask the Minister to look at it again.</p><p> On the serviced sites fund, I am a little confused by the report provided to the committee.  Most members thought the serviced sites fund was to be based on the &Oacute; Cualann model such that there would be no reference to market prices and a deduction but, rather, would involve discounting the cost of land and site servicing for the local authority and selling the property at close to the economic cost of its production.  The report indicates that the serviced sites fund is more akin to the local infrastructure housing activation fund.  I ask the Minister to provide more detail in that regard.</p><p> On home loans and to pick up on a point made by Deputy Darragh O'Brien, 2,222 loans were underwritten as of the end of September, 1,134 of which were approved.  My understanding is that the figures indicate a drawdown on approximately 200 of the loans by the end of September.  It is still within the first year of the scheme and we must be cautious about drawing conclusions, but it is a cause for concern that there have been more than 2,000 indicative approvals and 1,000 formal approvals but only 200 drawdowns.  Will the Minister give any indication as to why there has been a drawdown of less than 10% of those eligible to apply and approximately 20% of those approved?</p></speech>

That is long overdue.  Anyone watching these proceedings or familiar with the previous meetings of the committee will be conscious that addressing homelessness is one of our key objectives, along with the acceleration of social housing, building more homes, improving the rental sector and utilising existing housing.</p> <p>  Point 5.16 in the report circulated to the committee by the Minister discusses a pilot scheme of six local authorities.  It states that the scheme has been completed, but according to the Department commentary it has not.  Rather, the Department is awaiting a pilot scheme of six local authorities.  I ask the Minister to provide further detail on the pilot scheme.  There are many local authorities.  The objective was to ensure that an action plan for vacant homes would be put in place across all local authorities.  I acknowledge that the Minister does not have time to go into the matter today, but I ask that he provide further detail on the pilot scheme to the committee in the coming days.</p> <p>  The committee has repeatedly requested that all circulars issued by the Department be forwarded to us.  As I understand it, correspondence again issued to the Minister last week or the week before in that regard.  The more we are informed of what is going on, the better placed we are to deal with it.  There is an information deficit.  We have requested on two or three occasions that the Department provide us with the circulars.  I ask the Minister, as head of the Department, to ensure the Department formally responds to that correspondence, if it has not already done so, and to give a commitment that the circulars will be forwarded to us.</p></speech>

I think the process is under way.  We have asked to be provided with them.  On the local authority assessment of affordable housing, the Minister does not need to be told that affordability is a major issue in most local authorities.  It is certainly so in the four Dublin local authorities as well as in Galway and Limerick.  Is the Minister still awaiting assessments?  He has been in this business for long enough to know that he does not need a document telling him about the assessment of affordability.  Is this a delaying tactic?  What is the reason for the delay?  What is the current status of the four Dublin local authorities in regard to reporting on the assessment of affordable accommodation?  If the Minister does not have that information, why has it not been provided to him?  I have spoken to members of each of the four local authorities and they cannot understand the insistence on the production of this report when the Minister and everyone in his Department knows there is an affordability issue.  If that is a process which the Minister wants completed and he wants those boxes ticked, what progress has been made in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#O00600"><p>On HAP, the figures for this year indicate that 4,506 homes were made available through construction, voids coming back or acquisition or leasing, while 14,275 were made available through HAP.  The overreliance on the private rental sector remains a serious concern for me.  I understand that we have to keep those tenancies going and that is why we agreed to the additional funding in the budget, but it is not a long-term housing solution for families.</p> <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland affordable loan scheme is a good model and product.  I urge the Minister to speed up the review.  I have submitted evidence from across the country regarding greatly differing criteria being used for underwriting, particularly in regard to the financial side and whether overtime and bonuses are taken into account as income, for example.  The process must be streamlined.  I am aware it is a new scheme, so I will not challenge the Minister on the figures.  I am glad that it is increasing.  It is a good product.  Having worked in financial services and being very familiar with mortgages, I consider the refusal rate of 50% to be very high.  The figure for invalidated or incomplete applications should be separated from that for applications refused on a financial underwriting basis.</p> <p>  Will the &euro;2 million discretionary cap for social house building by local authorities, which was raised to &euro;6 million in the budget on the insistence of Fianna F&aacute;il in an effort to give more autonomy to local authorities, come into force on 1 January?  Has the Department been in contact with local authorities to advise them of that?  One of the reasons Fianna F&aacute;il sought that measure was to try to move away from the 59 week process as much as possible and to allow local authorities to build developments of 30 to 40 units through a one-stage process.  It has been broadly welcomed by several of the chief executives to whom I have spoken on the matter.  Will it be ready to go from 1 January?</p> <p>  I did not address credit union funds in my first round of questioning.  I have raised the issue several times with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy English, in priority questions in the D&aacute;il.  The credit unions have a first tranche of &euro;750 million to invest in social and-or affordable housing.  It has been approved by the Central Bank as a vehicle for investment since 1 February 2018 but the special purpose vehicle, SPV, has not been established.  The answer provided to me by the Minister of State, Deputy English, some weeks ago in the D&aacute;il was incorrect.  I have since gone back to the credit union sector, which confirmed that the SPV model has not been set up and that it is not investing in social or affordable housing.  This is a significant opportunity to utilise new funds in that sector to deliver homes.  There is nothing better in terms of credit union investment than investing in homes in their local communities.  What is happening in that regard?  Does the Department of Finance not want the scheme to go ahead?  When will the SPV be set up such that credit unions can invest in social and affordable housing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.642" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018121200002#O00700"><p>I am not interested in making political or other charges for the sake of it.  Rather, I am interested in getting to the facts.  I am aware there are many different streams, but that does not answer the question I asked.  What is the real addition to the local authority housing stock?  The Minister has an obligation to tell us that.  I acknowledge that that is only one stream.  The NOAC report indicates that the additional local authority housing stock for 2017 was 2,019 and that 564 homes were added to the stock in Dublin.  That is substantially less than the additional stock suggested by the figures for 2017 presented by the Minister specifically in regard to local authorities.</p><p>I would like an answer to that question.  When stock is demolished and then rebuilt, if what is built is less than what was demolished, there is a net reduction.  Crucially, the big issue is voids, the way they are defined long term versus short term and that what are, in effect, casual vacancies are being counted as additional stock.  That is my explanation, but there is definitely a discrepancy in the figures.  The Minister might not be able to answer that question now but I would like an answer to it as it is an important issue. </p><p> The Minister gave some additional figures for HAP, namely 13,741 tenancies at the end of quarter 3.  Could he tell us, and these should be included in all the figures, how many landlords pulled out of the HAP scheme in the same period?  We need to know how secure or insecure HAP tenancies are because certainly, anecdotally, we meet many people who find themselves back in emergency accommodation or back in trouble even though they got a HAP tenancy previously.</p><p> On the issue of affordability, the Minister did not answer my question.  The biggest residential development in the State is not unimportant.  We are being told &euro;400,000 is just the figure it costs to build by the developer.  I do not see how that really helps us resolve the problem.  The Minister can say the answer is supply but supply at that price does not help.  The prices are not coming down.  I met young people who were living in the Ires Reit units in Sandyford where Ires Reit tried to put up the rent by about 40%.  The rents were already &euro;2,200 a month for those units and it tried to put them up to &euro;2,800 but it stopped because of the embarrassment of the issue being raised.  When I talked to the people living in those units, I heard there were five or six students or five or six IT employees working in Sandyford piled in together in a unit paying rents they could barely afford.  What will happen in five years' time to those people when they have children and families?  They can just about afford that level of rent if five or six people pile in together.  There will be similar rents in the units in Cherrywood if they are buy-to-rent, but in five or six years' time those units will be useless for those people.  The problem is one of affordability.  Even on the affordable base we are going to get, it is not clear in Cherrywood, in terms of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF for all the structures that we paid to put in place in terms of the infrastructure, how much actual affordable housing we will get and what affordable price we will be given, taking account of the extremely high price about which they are talking. </p><p> Regarding the impact of raising building heights, Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to this issue in terms of land values and so on.  Has the Minister considered that by raising building heights there is the possibility that people who already have planning permissions will pull them and apply for new ones, thereby slowing down delivery because they will be able to build an extra few storeys?  That is very likely to happen.  Has the Minister considered the impact of that?  We know there is considerable hoarding and speculating.  It is very likely that raising building heights will be a trigger for that kind of activity.</p></speech>

I will try to answer all of them, as I have taken a note of them.   I will begin with Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions and deal with the questions in the order in which they were asked.  If we note quarter 3, and the delivery on the build side, it appears we will have to do a lot of heavy lifting in the fourth quarter, but that is not to give the impression these houses have not started to be built yet and that we will have to go on-site in Q4 and get them built.  We are discussing Q3 from the position in the middle of December where we have sight of what is coming through, the different stages of what is in the pipeline and what is happening on sites.  We had a similar conversation last year.  We delivered 60% of the build in the final quarter.  Those homes were completed in the final quarter.  That is the way the delivery was programmed.  Even though similar concerns were raised at this point last year, we ended up being only 8% off our build target which, like any area in government, when one is only 8% off a target, is admirable.  It is not 100% but we were not far off it.  We have a similar stream coming online in the fourth quarter in terms of completions.  Unless there is a severe weather event, which we do not see from the forecasts, standing in our way that would take people off-site between now and the end of the year, we will be very successful in terms of what we will be reporting in January.  I see the increase in social housing stock but also what has been completed in terms of new builds as part of that increase in the social housing stock.</p> <p>  In terms of voids, I am not going to take that out of the report.  We are not counting above the ceilings any more, which is important.  People will know what was programmed in with respect to our voids programme as part of the delivery.  We are not going to keep homes vacant that could be brought back into use under this funding line, but we are not going to count above the ceilings.</p> <p>  The rent Bill has not been published.  My apologies, I thought it had been published yesterday evening.  It takes a few days for the office to do the relevant legal stamps and so on but it will be published imminently.  </p> <p>  Where the RTB decides to go with an administrative sanction and if the landlord accepts that, it is signed off by the Circuit Court.  The RTB might deal with 30 cases at a meeting where what the deciding officer has determined is agreed, then the landlords agree that and the Circuit Court, in a private sitting, will consider those 30 cases and decide they are fine.  Where that does not happen, the landlord has the right to go to the Circuit Court.  We cannot take those rights away.  They are enshrined in the Constitution.  By giving the board these administrative sanction powers, we have short-circuited the potential delays there might be in terms of the RTB being able to do its work independently.  The board has to be the one to do this.  The matter has to go to the board.  That was the legal advice from the Attorney General because the RTB is the enshrined office in terms of the decision making body.</p></speech>

That is the serviced sites fund.  We also believe that by doing it in this way and by using other mechanisms we can leverage European Investment Bank funding which allows us to lock-in cost rental when we talk about affordability.

If one has a 70% EIB loan and a 30% CALF loan and one pays down the CALF loan over an additional ten years, that will give one 35 years to repay which allows one to have a lower start-off rent.  The fear we all have, as with the units on Enniskerry Road, is that the start-off rents in the cost rental units will not be affordable.  Could the two not be combined, as is being done with social housing, to make the cost rental unit rents affordable for average income families?</p></speech>

That is subject to the application to the EIB being successful but we know from communications we have had to date that it is supportive of what we are trying to do.  It is familiar with the models we are trying to use because it is has helped us to design them.</p> <p>  Regarding the serviced sites fund, I have been always very clear that we have been talking about an equity share.  This would be similar to the scheme that is operated in the UK where the local authority would help take the burden of the loan to be retained by the local authority and it would be repaid over time or on the sale of the house, and that it would be an equity stake.  </p> <p>  On the draw down of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, the level of draw down is not necessarily a measure of the success of a financial product.  Many things can happen.  People can get approval and not draw down the loan because the sale falls through, they may have been gazumped or their work circumstances may change and, therefore, where they want to live changes.  While it is important to understand that draw downs are happening and that, therefore, people are beginning to access this loan, it is not a very good measure of its success.  We are potentially going to hit 50% draw down in the first quarter of next year.  On the one-year anniversary of opening up this product we could hit 50% draw down of this product which was meant to be in place for three years, which is significant.</p><p>It is 50% draw down of the allocation, not of approved applications.</p></speech>

These criteria become important to the man on the street at the point at which homes begin construction.  We need to get the sites agreed and then get construction under way.  That brings me to the point regarding local authority assessments on affordability.  We have already done a first call to 11 local authorities, which are the authorities we know, without doing too much modelling, have an affordability problem.  Nine have responded.  As set out in the documentation, Dublin and Cork have been agreed in principle and there are further sites we need to progress.  There are some local authorities that will need a proper economic appraisal, to identify vacant homes and the difference between the cost of a home on the second hand market versus the cost of a new build, notwithstanding that we need to increase delivery anyway.  They need to make the numbers stack up because, again, this is about the spend of public money.  We cannot just sign blank cheques.  The local authorities have been asked to do this assessment, the results of which will inform our second call.  </p></speech>

Of the 11 local authorities to which we made this call, which included the four Dublin local authorities, nine have returned their assessments and we now have first sites for approval.  It is not the case that a local authority is sitting on its hands and not carrying out the assessment.  It is an affordability issue.  As I said, we issued that call to the four Dublin local authorities in the summer.</p></speech>

I am told three have returned them and one has not.</p> <p>  On the circulars, we have agreed the circulars with the committee, as clarified earlier by the Acting Chairman.  On the vacancy, that has been achieved in terms of putting the teams in place as per that item.  The quarter 3 report on the vacancy work was published so the committee should have that report as well.  </p> <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked if we need to review HAP.  Yes, we do but I do not propose to do so until such time as we have a sustainable supply of housing.  When we reach that point we will not need HAP to the degree we need it now.  If I were to withdraw it tomorrow it would not solve the problems that people have.  When we get to the point that a consistent level of social housing stock is being built each year, we can then review other housing measures.  There will be always a need for HAP.  People will always want the flexibility it provides for a number of reasons but we should not be using it to the degree that we are now.  Nevertheless, we have to use it for legacy reasons, which are clear.  As we move in 2020 and on to 2021 we will be ale to put more people into social housing than through HAP.  At that point, we will need to examine to what degree HAP is sustainable into the future.  Now is not the point in time to do that.   Deputy O'Brien and I are not on a different page but now is not the point in time to do that.</p></speech>

Consistency is key.  Among the recommendations made to me one constantly repeated was the need for consistency in application in each local authority.  At the beginning of next year we will be able to implement those recommendations, which I have separated into two tiers.  The first tier, which is the easy stuff that we can commence at the beginning of next year, is work with the local authorities in terms of notifications, training rounds and so on.  The second tier requires discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is a more complicated process.  Both are in train and I have raised aspects of them with the Minister for Finance and with the Taoiseach last week in a meeting.</p> <p>  On the one stage approval process, we have committed to examining the cap and we are currently doing so in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

The increase in the stock of social housing from build through local authorities, housing bodies and Part V is 4,054.  In regard to HAP, the Department provides committee members with a regular update on HAP.  I am not sure if the Deputy has seen the table in that regard in the documentation.</p></speech>

This analysis relates to tenancies exiting HAP.  Some 9,050 have exited HAP since it was established, of which 3,548 were tenant-led exits.  The reason for this includes voluntary exit, deceased tenant, working in a different area, a change in family composition, educational reasons and anti-social behaviour in regard to a third party not living in the home.  In regard to landlord exits, 2,624 landlords have exited HAP.</p><p>That has related to notice being given to a tenant, selling of a property, receivership and monthly rent increases happening.  There were 1,765 exits from HAP to other forms of social housing.  Some 1,113 exits have related to compliance, non-payment of rent, anti-social behaviour and such.  There is a tax clearance certificate relating to property standards.  Every quarter, we are getting more detailed information on HAP because we have an excellent system being run from Limerick, which we are always trying to improve.  It allows us to produce these very detailed reports which the Deputy does not have because he is not a member of the committee.  I apologise since I knew he would be in attendance and it would have made sense to give it to him in advance.  We can and no doubt will have a more detailed discussion next time.</p></speech>

Prices are coming down.  We are looking at single digit price inflation for house buying this year, which is important because it shows the growth in inflation.  All the different indicators tell us that.  In Cherrywood, the cost of building will be expensive but they are looking at the build-to-rent model which we need more of as we professionalise the landlord sector.  I do not see how the Deputy cannot see 9,000 new homes for 23,000 people, a new town with sporting facilities, transport and places to work as not helping.  Of course it helps.  It will not help everyone but it will help.  If people buy at higher prices, that frees up homes at lower prices for those who cannot afford higher prices.  All delivery helps supply.</p></speech>

I said earlier that we need to be resolved as an Oireachtas that we, as politicians, will not get in the way of the densification of urban places.  They are currently lovely places to live with lovely facilities and amenities but they could take more homes if we densify.  Part of that relates to increasing heights.</p></speech>

If we allow for more apartments to be built on that land, then it will be possible to sell more apartments and make more money.  It is possible therefore that the price of land might increase.  It is also more expensive to build higher so more costs are incurred and the economics of that need to be considered.  If we look at it purely with regard to land, we would be building one home per piece of land because that would keep the price at rock bottom.  There is a need to look at an economic model of the different factors relating to land and its optimal use.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a question about possible delays.  We are dealing with a shortage which needs to be fixed in a sustainable way.  There is no point in us building to arbitrary height caps which would see us facing much bigger challenges with prices, affordability and commuting distances 30 years in the future because we did not build enough homes in places where we could have at a time when we knew we could have if we had changed the law.  If it means someone waiting for the last six months for the public consultation to finish and delaying putting in a planning application, which I understand, but it also means we will get 30% to 50% more homes on a site which will be there for the next 100 years, we have to do that now to protect ourselves in the future.</p> <p>  With regard to land hoarding, &euro;300 million worth of land is liable for the vacant site levy which kicks in on 1 January 2019.  That will only increase.  The &euro;300 million accounts for 140 properties but there are 300 now on the register.  We need to do more work but &euro;300 million worth of land is not a small amount.  That will only rise next year because the levy is more than doubling and we have doubled the number of houses on the register to which that will apply.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must remind members they should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality: Ms Anne Barry, Mr. John O'Callaghan, and Ms Mary McKenna.  We are also joined by Ms Niamh Callan.</p> <p>  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the great level of commitment, experience and expertise the chairperson of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, and members of the commission brought to the major task of undertaking a fundamental review of all aspects of policing in Ireland.  I know the chairperson had an opportunity of exchanging views with the committee a few weeks ago.  The committee will have seen that the report addresses in a comprehensive way the wide-ranging terms of reference agreed by the Government, which had the active input of Deputies and Senators, and presents a new framework for policing to meet not only the current challenges, with which we are all familiar, but new and complex challenges that will undoubtedly emerge in the future.  I am pleased to note the broad welcome that the report has received, including from members of this committee.</p> <p>  The report demonstrates the value of bringing people together, all of whom come from diverse backgrounds, to look at an area of public policy afresh, particularly an area that has been as contested as policing has been over recent years.  It is clear the report is the richer for the diverse expertise of the members in policing, human rights, victims' rights, business, governance and right across public affairs.  It is also clear that the report is the richer for the wide-ranging consultation process undertaken by the commission.  It held extensive public meetings, visiting all regions of the country, and it also engaged with a wide range of interested stakeholders, including the workforce of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels, members of this committee, other Members of the Oireachtas, and practitioners in the area of policing and academia, not only within the confines of this jurisdiction but also abroad.</p> <p>  The commission has completed its task and passed the baton, so to speak, to the Government, the Oireachtas and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement its transformation programme for the policing sector.  It is important that we move quickly.  Members will be aware that, on the publication of the report, I made a commitment to revert to Government by the end of the year with my substantive response and a high-level implementation plan.  With this in mind, the report is receiving detailed consideration within my Department and across Government at present in consultation with the relevant bodies.  I welcome the opportunity this morning to hear the views of the members of the committee on the report as an important input to that ongoing process of consideration.  I know that they met the chair of commission and a number of her colleagues last month.  I understand they had a very useful exchange exploring various aspects of the report and clarifying how some of the recommendations might work in practice, especially those that may come before this committee in the form of legislative proposals, which will happen next year.</p><p>I also set out my intention in September to move quickly on setting up the implementation structures recommended by the commission to drive forward a transformation programme.  Much work has already been done in that regard.</p><p> As I stated when the report was published, it provides a new blueprint for the transformation of policing in Ireland.  At its core is a new and expanded definition of policing as a multidisciplinary, cross-agency effort in partnership with communities and built on the foundation of protecting human rights.  Of particular note is the emphasis on understanding policing as including not only the prevention and detection of crime, which all present expect, but also the prevention of harm and protection of people at risk, be they people experiencing mental health challenges, homelessness or drug addiction.  The assessment of the commission that 80% of Garda time may be concerned with harm prevention has given many people considerable pause for thought.</p><p> Grappling with this reality and designing and planning our services to support front-line garda&iacute; in their work will require a whole-of-Government commitment to policing and community safety.  I am heartened that the report highlights some good examples of inter-agency co-operation on the ground.  These can be built on, but if we are to bring about the transformation envisaged by the report, such co-operation must become embedded in the system in order that it is sustainable over the longer term and not reliant on the dedication of individual public servants.  The enthusiasm for and support of the report by my Government colleagues and their senior officials, many of whom do not consider themselves as having any significant role in regard to policing, has been striking.  It is clear that there is a strong desire to take on board and work with this expanded definition of policing and community safety.</p><p> The report makes many more innovative proposals among its 50 key recommendations, but in the time available to me this morning, I wish to deal in a little more detail with a small number of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations that have attracted most attention to date.</p><p> On national security, the commission was tasked with considering the dual role of the Garda as the State policing and security service.  Although it recognises advantages and disadvantages to this arrangement, the commission concludes that, in the current circumstances, it is not convinced of the value of creating a separate security agency, and I share that view.  However, it identifies a need to enhance and modernise the skills and resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the security and intelligence area.  It also recommends the establishment of a structure to bring agencies together to improve the co-ordination of threat assessments and to provide better and more comprehensive information to Government.  This proposal does not aim to take over the functions of the Garda, Defence Forces or other agencies which have clear lines of command and accountability set out in law for their activities.  Rather, the proposed strategic threat analysis centre, STAC, is intended to collate or synthesise intelligence inputs from the bodies and agencies which will be seconded to it to generate threat analyses.  The commission also considered the issue of the oversight of national security and makes recommendations to enhance the current arrangements in this area, including the establishment of an independent examiner who would have a function in carrying out ongoing reviews of how security legislation is being used.</p><p> It is important that I refer to the commission&rsquo;s package of recommendations aimed at ensuring a well-managed police service with robust and independent external oversight.  These recommendations have been the subject of most public commentary on the report to date, some of which appears to be based on a misunderstanding or misreading of the report and, in particular, a sense that public scrutiny of policing would disappear.  It is clear from the report that public scrutiny, which is perhaps the strongest tool at the disposal of the Policing Authority, would continue under the commission&rsquo;s proposals.  I understand that the chair of the commission and her colleagues emphasised this point in their recent engagement with this committee.</p><p> It is important to recall the rationale behind the commission&rsquo;s proposals.  The commission&rsquo;s strong view is that our existing oversight arrangements are confused and lacking in clarity, with overlapping responsibilities between the various bodies.  This view is shared by some of the oversight bodies and by the independent effectiveness and renewal group established in regard to my Department.  The commission also views the lack of distinction between the roles of some of the oversight bodies and the responsibilities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its management and governance as problematic.  Its overall view is that our arrangements act to the detriment of a clear and effective mode of accountability for policing and sometimes lead to responsibility lying elsewhere or nowhere.</p><p> The commission&rsquo;s proposals are threefold.  In the first instance, it locates responsibility for democratic accountability with the Minister of the day and his or her Department.  It endorses the view of the effectiveness and renewal group, as accepted by Government, that my Department should step back from its involvement in managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and not seek to compensate for a lack of capacity in that organisation by inserting itself into day-to-day management of the Garda.  Instead, my Department should focus on three key tasks in addition to securing the resources for the police, namely, providing transparent and timely communication of information required in the public interest, providing structural oversight of the police and oversight bodies, and developing policing and security policy and legislation.  Of course, the commission also refers to the important role of Oireachtas committees, this one in particular, and their suggestions for how that role might operate to best effect, which gives food for thought.</p><p> Second, there are two elements to the commission&rsquo;s proposals on external independent oversight.  It proposes a reformed independent complaints body that would supersede the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and a new independent oversight body to be named the policing and community safety oversight commission or similar.  That body would build on the good work of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  It would absorb the oversight functions of the authority and the inspection functions of the inspectorate, and it would have a greatly enhanced role in promoting accountability at local level and standard setting at national level.  Unlike the current situation, it would concentrate solely on exercising independent external oversight and would not undertake executive functions.</p><p> Third, the commission recommends that the Garda Commissioner, in his role as chief executive officer with responsibility for a workforce of 16,000 and rising and a budget that will exceed &euro;1.7 billion next year, should be fully empowered to run the organisation with the support of a non-executive board.  Although the recommendation for such a board is novel in the policing sector, such boards are best practice in corporate governance teams across the private and public sectors.  Indeed, in its submission to the commission, the Policing Authority suggested that it should be seen as akin to the non-executive board of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The commission came down in favour of separating internal governance and external oversight.  It recommends that internal governance be provided by the non-executive board, while external oversight be provided by the policing and community safety oversight commission.  Of relevance to this issue is the most recent report of the effectiveness and renewal group which was presented to Government in October.  It strongly welcomes the recommendation by the commission for the establishment of a statutory board to strengthen the internal governance and management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> My overriding interest and, I am sure, that of the committee is to ensure an effective, accountable police service.  That requires a police service that is well managed and has robust structures and processes in place such that risks are identified at an early stage and not allowed to develop into controversies which envelop the entire organisation and serve to undermine public confidence and morale in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It also requires robust and independent external oversight.</p><p> I look forward with interest to the committee's response to the proposals in the commission's report.  The Government will decide on its preferred solution shortly.  Of course, given that the oversight architecture will have to be legislated for, the Oireachtas will ultimately decide the issue and this committee will have a very important and fundamental role to play in the development of that legislation.</p><p> Before outlining the work under way in regard to implementation, I wish to comment briefly on some of the other recommendations in the report.  Of particular note are the innovative recommendations in regard to recruitment and the need to create a more diverse workforce in terms of socio-economic and educational background as well as gender and ethnicity.  There is also a welcome focus on improving the well-being of the Garda workforce, including through improved rosters, more appropriate uniforms, and more psychological support services.</p><p> Many of the 50 key recommendations form part of the existing reform programme for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, such as those relating to improved workforce planning, better deployment of personnel, increased focus on training and continuing professional development, improved data quality, and improved ICT, including mobile technology.  It is fair to say the results of that programme have been mixed.</p><p>Some good work has been done, but overall there is a consensus that the pace of reform has been too slow.  This concern brings me to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations to ensure that its programme can be substantially implemented by 2022, which of course is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> I am pleased to say that the implementation group for policing reform, IGPR, has been established with an independent chair as recommended by the commission.  Ms Helen Ryan, a member of the commission and former chief executive officer of Creganna Medical, has agreed to serve as chair.  Her expertise will be invaluable in driving forward the implementation plan to be agreed by Government.  The implementation group is supported by an implementation programme office set up in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The first meeting of the IGPR took place in early November, and the group, which includes representatives of a number of Departments and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has met on four occasions since.</p><p> In addition, a high-level steering board for policing reform chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach has been established.  Membership of this board includes the Secretaries General of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Garda Commissioner and the chair of the IGPR, Ms Ryan.  Secretaries General from other Departments will also be involved as required.  The role of this steering board will be to support the work of the implementation group, including by acting as a clearing house for issues that cannot be resolved by the implementation group.</p><p> I am sure the Cathaoirleach will agree that the speed at which my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach have moved to set up these structures demonstrates my commitment and that of the Government to meeting the ambition in this report.  The Government is deeply committed to the meaningful reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and policing in Ireland.  This is evident through the provision of in excess of &euro;1.7 billion to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for 2019, an increase of &euro;110 million over this year's budget.  In addition, the Garda capital allocation will increase to &euro;92 million, much of it for ICT infrastructure, over the course of next year.  Furthermore, dedicated funding of &euro;10 million has been provided to my Department to support the transformation process in the justice sector, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, next year.</p><p> This is an important report that has the capacity to transform policing in this country.  It is the outcome of serious deliberations over a lengthy period and its conclusions and recommendations deserve to be carefully considered.  This committee, under your Chairmanship, has always shown a keen interest in policing matters and I know your commitment to improving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to the fore.  This committee has much to contribute to the successful implementation of the commission&rsquo;s report and I look forward not just to hearing the committee's response to it now but also to working with the committee as it is implemented over the coming years.</p></speech>

It is important that we all consider the report that has been prepared.  A lot of work went into it.  It is also important that Government makes a decision on where it is going early in the new year because the longer this drifts on, the more of a question mark there will be over the existing oversight bodies.  I am sure that is a concern that the Minister probably has himself.</p> <p>  We agree with much of what is in this report and the commission did very good work, but I want to concentrate on the areas where there is some concern.  The commission has recommended that there be an internal board within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the purpose of which would be to strengthen internal governance and accountability and to support the Commissioner and his leadership team.  The Minister may recall that, back in 2007, legislation was introduced establishing a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na executive management board and that was an amendment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It was never commenced and, when the Minister introduced the Policing Authority, that section was repealed.  Does the Minister envisage that the board recommended by the commission would be similar to the board that was provided for in legislation by the Oireachtas back in 2007 or does he see it operating differently?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018121200002#E00400"><p>Anything I say this morning is, of course, subject to the assent of Government, but I agree with the Deputy when he mentions the importance of ensuring that the momentum which has been built following the publication of the recommendations in the report is maintained.  I intend to publish an avenue for implementation in the near future and I welcome the Deputy's support in that regard.  I intend to bring my proposals to Government very shortly.</p> <p>  The statutory Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na board will have a significant role to play in ensuring that the organisation is both effectively and efficiently run.  The board would be responsible, as other State boards are, in ensuring that the systems and procedures in place to direct and control the organisation are consistent with the statutory responsibilities of the organisation so that the public interest is served.  There is also obviously the issue of value for money which has featured at the committee time and again, and risk management must be done in an effective way.  In short, the board will hold senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account for the performance of their functions.  The board will agree the policing strategy and the policing plan and it will have a role to play in the budget being proposed by the Commissioner, subject of course to the approval of the Minister.  The board would have a role to play in the nomination of the Commissioner and the deputy commissioner and the matter of appointments to the senior management team.</p> <p>  My overriding view of the board is that it would operate along the lines of how many State boards effectively operate in terms of providing support for the chief executive officer and his or her team.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018121200002#E00500"><p>I know the Minister will do this but it is important that we are careful about the make-up of this board.  The legislation that was introduced in 2007 proposed a board of six people, three of whom would be members of the Garda - the Commissioner, the deputy commissioner and a member of the civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There were to be three non-executive members as well who were not going to be members of the Garda or Garda civilian staff.</p> <p>  I was looking at the board recommended by the commission and I am not sure from the recommendations produced whether, for instance, the Commissioner and senior figures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be members of the board.  Maybe that is in there but I have not been able to locate it, so that is an issue that Government will have to consider.  My reading of it is that it may be that senior Garda figures would not be on the board, which would be different from many other boards where senior figures from the executive end of the business are also on the board and there is a mix of non-executive and executive members.  The Minister needs to be careful about that.</p> <p>  The recommendation in respect of the new board is that it should be able to make nominations to Government for the appointments of Commissioners and deputy commissioners, which is something that is done by the Policing Authority at present, but also the board could recommend the removal of a Commissioner.  The Minister needs to think about having an internal body that could recommend the removal of a Commissioner.  I do not know whether the Commissioner will be a member of that board but it needs to be carefully thought out before giving those strong powers to a board that is within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue of the Policing Authority.  I know that the Minister is here to hear our views on this as well.  One of the successes of the Government has been the establishment of the Policing Authority.  It has worked well.  Changing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a slow process, but the Policing Authority, through its public hearings, is having a role in achieving that.</p><p>The point is made by the commission and the Department that the policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, which will replace the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, would also have public hearings.  Does the Minister have any concerns about terminating the Policing Authority, which has been quite effective, and replacing it with PCSOC?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.744" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018121200002#F00200"><p>On the first issue of the board, I am not really sure if it is the intention of the committee to commit something to writing by way of recommendations to Government.  If it is minded to do that, I would be very happy to give full and detailed consideration to such a paper.  In the meantime, I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his commentary.  If the committee is not in a position to furnish a paper which might amount to its view or response to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, I would welcome contact from individual Deputies in whatever form they deem appropriate.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for his helpful comments on the matter of the board.  It is not envisaged there will be members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the board.  It is not part of the plan.  The entire board will be selected on an independent basis and will comprise members other than those who are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will be made up of people of standing in the community, public affairs and beyond who will bring a measure of independence.  I take on board the point raised by Deputy O'Callaghan in that regard.</p> <p>  On the second point on the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, I also acknowledge they have done good work.  The role of the authority in scrutinising policing performance has been very useful.  I assure members of the committee - it is a point that was dealt with in some detail by the chair of the commission - that the new body will continue to exercise a very high degree of oversight of policing through public meetings with Garda management, access to a high degree of information through its inspection function, and through a stronger role in research, for example, and the matter of local accountability.  The functions of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, having regard to their importance, will form the basis of the new legislation for the new body.  They are issues we will be charged with responsibility for teasing out in the context of the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018121200002#F00300"><p>The Minister has clarified the board will not include any members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is different from how semi-State bodies or corporate boards operate.  There are non-executive members from outside who bring independence and external knowledge but there are also internal people.  There are executives on the board who are directly involved in the management of the entity.  It is different.  The board is within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the proposal is to transfer some of the important functions, which are at present practised by the Policing Authority, back into the Garda.  For instance, senior appointments are at present dealt with and recommended by the Policing Authority.  That function will be going back within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I note the point the Minister made about how PCSOC will continue the functions carried out by the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, but what is the benefit of it?  I am not holding the Minister to his answer because he has to formulate proposals for Government.  What is the benefit of getting rid of the Policing Authority other than merging the Garda Inspectorate with it and replacing it with PCSOC?  Is there any benefit other than being able to say we implemented the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland?</p></speech>

What I say is subject to Government approval but I expect that approval very shortly.  In the event the Government decides to proceed with the new framework as proposed by the commission, a programme of legislation will be required.  The legislation will need to be very carefully crafted to ensure we have a clear delineation of the roles of the various bodies.  I am very keen to continue to hear the views of the committee as we proceed.  In the new year, I hope to have a very clear pathway by way of a time-sensitive implementation plan.  We will provide the committee with the proposals for the legislative framework and the implementation of the recommendations as accepted within a clearly defined timeframe divided up into quarters for next year.</p></speech>

We teased out many of the issues with Kathleen O'Toole.  The Minister stated our existing oversight arrangements are confused and lack clarity.  He stated the commission also views the lack of distinction between the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its own management and governance on the one hand and the roles of some of the oversight bodies on the other as problematic.  The Minister probably noticed that Mr. Justice Charleton went out of his way to emphasise that creating new structures will not fix anything and that the culture was more of a problem than the structures.  It is as if we are trying to reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>  The Minister is right that we have highlighted issues with GSOC, the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.  We do not think it is a good idea to get rid of any of them.  We think they need to be strengthened.  There was some overlap in responsibility but it is something that can be cleared up.  It can be fixed.  We have been recommending for a long time that the Garda Inspectorate should be able to follow up on its recommendations and see where they are going.  The Garda Inspectorate did some great work and produced some powerful reports that were the blueprint of where we should be going with policing.  It was obviously a problem that the inspectorate could not follow up on what was happening to its recommendations.  It also did not have the power of inspection, which we recommended.  They are areas where the Garda Inspectorate could have been strengthened.  The Policing Authority was finding its feet.  It seemed to be getting better all the time with a bit of experience.  We also felt it did not have enough powers but it did well given the powers it had.  It would be better to give it the extra powers it needs to make it even more effective.  We have said for a long time that GSOC was designed to fail.  It is not funded properly.  The structure is wrong.  There are too many garda&iacute; inspecting each other, but it is fixable if one had the appetite to fix it.</p> <p>  We find it strange the Government is moving away from that.  Instead of strengthening and improving the three organisations, its move away is watering down external oversight.</p><p>In his opening statement, the Minister made the point that "Unlike the current situation, [the new body, the policing and community safety oversight commission] would concentrate solely on exercising independent external oversight and would not undertake executive functions."  We thought the fact the Policing Authority was engaged in executive functions was a positive.  As Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out, we thought that giving it a role in the appointments process was a positive move.  I find it strange that the Minister is rowing back on that now.  When we put these points to Kathleen O'Toole when she appeared before the committee, she did not really make a good case against them.</p><p> My main point is that we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  We believe this is a watering down of external oversight.  Did the garda&iacute; not like that oversight by the Policing Authority?  Was it bothering them?  I do not want to knock the report too much because there are many good proposals in it, and many recommendations that were discussed in recent years are included in it.  There are plenty of positives in it but the oversight issue in particular would be an area of concern from our point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.749" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018121200002#G00200"><p>I would be concerned if there is a view, and I have read reports of some people forming a view, as the Deputy said, that the proposals are in some way weakening or diluting oversight rather than developing or enhancing it.  I would be concerned if people were of the view that there is a weakening of oversight because I do not see that as being the case.  There is no question of any weakening of the role or function of the bodies.  I would accept there is a strong case for a form of rationalisation, but that should not be seen as taking back power or in any way reducing a level of oversight.  In fact, the report is clear on additional functions regarding in the matter of research and the setting and maintenance of standards, and all that will continue.  I acknowledge there was a lack of clarity on the part of some of the structures between the authority, on the one hand, and the inspectorate and GSOC on the other.  In terms of GSOC, what we see in the report is along the lines of what many Deputies were seeking, namely, changes for GSOC and a greater measure of independence, and this is in tandem with the extra level of resources that have been made available to GSOC.  As we speak, it is recruiting a further complement of staff that will allow it to do the job that the legislation requires of it in a timely and effective manner.</p> <p>  It is important to note, and again I would ask the committee to agree with me on this, that all the investigations of the oversight body or the independent complaints body must be engaged in from an independent perspective rather than referring complaints of a serious nature back to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  It is important that the jurisdiction of the independent complaints body be extended to involve non-sworn personnel and that it would also assume the Accounting Officer function.  The response on the matter of the independent complaints body is along the lines of what the Deputy is on record as having said on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  The new terms of reference of the role and function of the oversight bodies must be read in the context of what is a holistic examination of the current system.  The Deputy should remember this independent commission of experts was charged with responsibility to look at the current bodies with a fresh pair of eyes.  I would be reluctant to depart from the main recommendations but let us see what the Government finally proposes by way of recommendation to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I see it as being an important aspect of the recommendations for change that the responsibility for all human resources, HR, matters would rest with the Garda Commissioner.  Remember it is the Garda Commissioner who will ultimately be accountable in any event.  If we are to vest responsibility for HR matters in the chief executive, that would see the appointment function and the transfer of such functions to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

It is all very well if the Commissioner is good, and perhaps Drew Harris will be very good, and that is fine if it works well, but if the Commissioner has a tendency to circle himself with his friends, it might not work out quite so well.</p> <p>  In terms of the board, it is as if the commission is recommending that it be set up like a commercial organisation, but the point we made to Kathleen O'Toole when she appeared before this committee is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not be run for profit.  It is run to serve the public.  This board is probably more suited to working with a commercial entity rather than a public body like An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What does the Minister think of that point?</p></speech>

As the chair of the Commission said at this committee a few weeks ago, there must be a level of professional tension, as is the case with all relationships between a board and a chief executive officer.  That is important to ensure there would not be that type of soft relationship to which the Deputy quite rightly adverted, and that there would be a limited term appointment.</p><p>In the event the Government does decide to proceed along the lines of the board-CEO relationship, a precedent for that would be the Legal Aid Board within our own area of specialisation, and the relationship there between the CEO and the board members.  If we proceed along the lines of legislating for the new board, having regard to the relationship between the board members and the CEO, it is important to remember that another arm of the new proposals in relation to the new PCSOC, or such name as legislators will decide ultimately, will be an element of oversight ensuring probity in all appointments.  I do not share the view that what we are doing is bringing back power to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that the relationship is either less than accountable or less than transparent.  What we are doing is recognising what is accepted practice right across the public sector.  We will have a further opportunity to tease out the detail of that, should the Government decide to proceed.</p></speech>

One of the most reformist aspects of this report is the fact that the group looks at police and security from a cross-Government perspective.  On the implementation group there will from time to time be Secretaries General from a wide range of Departments, namely, the Departments of Health, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  On a more permanent basis there will be representation from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

I envisage that there will be at least four pieces of legislation required should the Government decide to adopt the recommendations in their entirety.  The important thing is to build on the current momentum.  We will have the implementation group and a steering committee thereof to ensure a parallel process is fully under way across a number of recommendations at the same time.  Once I have the approval of the Government on the matter of the prioritisation of the recommendations, then I will be in a position to advise the committee as to the priority recommendations with a timeframe, the medium-term recommendations with the timeframe, and the recommendations that still require further consideration.  The target is to ensure that, by the 100th anniversary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the recommendations of the report will be implemented.</p> <p>  The Secretaries General involved in the group will meet to ensure that any blockages that might arise along the way are addressed.  The implementation group will oversee the work of the programme office.  The programme office will meet regularly and will drive the management of the programme of reform.  It will be the engine room, so to speak.</p></speech>

Has the Minister read the dissenting remarks made by two members of the commission?  It is reported that they said in their view it does not offer the best prospects of achieving the goal of unambiguous independent, empowered and transparent accountability.  It was said that they believe that external accountability should be developed and matured through the structure of the Policing Authority.  What are the Minister's views on what they had to say?</p></speech>

In the first instance, I must state that all the members of the commission appended their names, signed off on the report and fully endorsed it.  I am grateful to all the members for their commitment and their work.  I note that two members of the board diverged somewhat on a particular recommendation concerning the formation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na board.  It is important that we look at the commission report in its entirety and the fact that all of the members signed off on the report and endorsed it in full.  There has been a significant amount of commentary.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned that there had been public commentary about the concerns about the overall policing architecture and the extent of it in terms of the Garda Inspectorate, GSOC and the Policing Authority itself.  Is the Minister concerned that by taking out part of the functions of the Policing Authority and replacing them with a new merged structure composed of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, we could create confusion about the policing architecture rather than consolidating where there have been difficulties by splitting the accountability roles?</p><p> As my colleague said, if there are no executive members on the board, it may be that not all the relevant parties are involved.  How then do we have a true process of openness whereby it is ensured the board is given the relevant information?  It is an important part of corporate governance to have external oversight within the board but also to include executives to develop a process of openness around the board.  Does the Minister have any thoughts on that?  We could be creating further difficulties around accountability rather than consolidating the existing structures.</p></speech>

My view is in line with the commission's which pointed to a certain lack of clarity under the current structure.  What is designed here will not add further to that lack of clarity but will rather enhance governance for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is not only the view of the Commission on the Future of Policing but of the effectiveness and renewal group in my own Department.  The nature of the existing arrangements has meant that they were often seen to work contrary to the objective of clear and effective accountability.  Should these proposals be implemented, we will have an external oversight body in common with what exists across the public and semi-State sectors.  If we proceed along those lines, legislation will be required.  I hope that whatever legislation is enacted will ensure that what Deputy Chambers refers to will not come to pass and that we will have a greater level of clarity and delineation of roles, functions and responsibility rather than the type of overlap evident in the current structure.</p></speech>

I was dealing, coincidentally, with garda&iacute; at the time.  I record that when we are talking about future policing and the need for change, we must acknowledge the great work done by many garda&iacute;.  I record in particular my gratitude to the excellent Dave Malone in Terenure Garda station with whom I have been dealing while this meeting has been going on.</p> <p>  There is not much point asking many questions, partly as I missed the questions of other members and partly because, from what I have heard, we are not getting any answers.  Given that this is a longer body of work, the current Minister will probably not be at the helm when some of these things come into being, if they ever do.  The Minister was at pains to say the members endorsed the full report, including the two who had the minority view.  Does he not agree, however, that their point was pretty pivotal?  Their point of disagreement was not a minor one but rather one that gets to the heart of a lot of this.  The process of external oversight, which took a long time to put in place and which was implemented in an inadequate way, is now being watered down by this proposition.  While the Minister has said he thinks that is great, which is nice, any attempt-----</p></speech>

I am sorry.  "Great" is probably too strong a word.  What the Minister actually said was that he supported the recommendations of the commission on the new structure, which has been asserted, correctly in my opinion, to be a dilution of the external oversight we had begun to move towards implementing and a serious step backwards.  In the context of all of the experts in this area, including Dermot Walsh and others in that vein, who look at serious reform of policing being of a different view, that concerns me.  It gets to the heart of it.</p> <p>  Why does the Minister not think the adequate beefing up of the Policing Authority to make it genuinely accountable is sufficient?  He thinks the report is fine but there is nothing new around the GSOC recommendations.  There is nothing new in a lot of the report, which is not a criticism of it.  It is a pulling together of ideas which have been out there for a very long time.  It pulls together and includes many recommendations our committee put forward.  The report also pulls together recommendations GSOC made to improve its role and make it a proper, fit-for-purpose complaints structure.  The only thing changing here is the name.  Why has the Minister not enacted legislation then?  What are his plans and what is he waiting for before he enacts what everybody recommends, including this body the Minister thinks is fine?  Why has that legislation not been tabled before us?  We should not have to wait for it.  I see no merit in that.  We can tease it out in the Chamber if legislation comes forward.</p></speech>

I intend to bring forward legislative proposals on the independence and greater authority of GSOC.  I acknowledge that GSOC is recruiting extra staff and expertise to allow it to deal adequately with its responsibilities and obligations in law.  I expect to have the programme of legislative change on foot of the report charted early in the new year.  Of course, I bring the matter to the committee.  I do not accept that what we are doing in any way weakens or dilutes the powers of the authority and inspectorate.  Rather, it is about further clarity on an issue that exercised this committee and many of its members in recent times.  I expect that clarity will emerge in the context of the legislative proposals for the new bodies.</p></speech>

Given that it is for the chop, it must make life very difficult while it awaits the Minister's new legislation.  Does the postponement of the decision to replace someone in the authority, which was supposed to be before the committee this week and which is not now being taken, have anything to do with this or will the Policing Authority be beefed up to its full complement while we await the legislation?  What is the story there?</p></speech>

In his opening remarks, the Minister indicated that he was heartened that the report highlighted good examples of inter-agency co-operation.  Deputy Jack Chambers touched on a whole-of-Government commitment which we all accept is essential to policing and community safety.  If this is to be built on, co-operation must be embedded in the system.  These were the Minister's own words and I concur absolutely.</p><p>I ask the Minister to elaborate on the areas he referenced in that regard and how he sees that coming into effect.  I expect this is a development of the cross-departmental approach.</p><p> The committee has highlighted today, and in recent engagements with the Commission on the Future of Policing and senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, concerns regarding the availability of other key service providers.  Unlike An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which is available 24 hours a day 365 days of the year, for some critical services with a very relevant role a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five-day week is the norm.  Members of the committee, myself included, as elected public representatives have raised difficulties which have been encountered in dealing with problems in the evening time and, in particular, at weekends. I ask the Minister to elaborate on that issue and on how he envisages it being addressed.</p></speech>

It emphasises the importance of multi-agency groups and inter-agency responsibility.  There will be a role for the agencies to which the Chair referred without naming, such as the HSE, homeless services and Tusla.  It is very important that national protocols be established to ensure the level of service available on a 24-7 basis is raised.  Co-operation and co-ordination will need to be further developed and supported, which is why there is active engagement on the part of Departments which might not heretofore have been readily associated with crime, justice and security, in particular, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in regard to homelessness as well as the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE in regard to the association between vulnerability, disadvantage and crime.  The report also recommends that the Garda should have ready access to and support from other agencies to ensure a very active level of connectivity.  Resources will be required to achieve those aims.  As I am very keen that the availability of resources not be an issue in terms of the implementation of the recommendations of the report, money has been made available for implementation next year.</p></speech>

Independent of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing, all members are very conscious of the need to ensure inter-agency co-operation in terms of responses to specific cases.  The Minister rightly referenced several agencies with particular responsibility in that area.  There is a need for work-life changes to ensure greater availability.  That is an absolute requirement.  We cannot continue to depend on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond to situations with which they may not be properly trained and equipped to deal.  The Garda is repeatedly used almost as a crutch in situations where more experienced or better trained and better equipped public servants would be the appropriate first responders.  One such area is mental health.  If the Minister is indicating that there will be progress in that area in the coming year, that is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  The Minister queried whether the committee will produce a report.  We have decided that we will not do so.  However, in the light of the indications he has given, we may offer some observations on our engagements with Ms Kathleen O'Tooole and her colleagues and the Minister.  We will determine that over the coming week following discussion of the matter.  The Minister's indication of interest in that regard is noted.</p> <p>  There is nothing further in regard to this matter which we can address at this point.  On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.</p></speech>

As I informed the D&aacute;il on Second Stage, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, I intend to bring forward a number of further amendments to the Bill.  I am introducing a number of those today, including some new provisions that provide for the first time for an expressed jurisdiction for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth where there is cause for concern.  There is another provision for a coroner to direct a hospital or health institution where the deceased was treated immediately before death, or a doctor holding medical records of the deceased, to produce the records the coroner considers relevant and necessary for the conduct of an effective post mortem examination.</p> <p>  I also flag to the committee my intention, subject to Government approval, to introduce on Report Stage a number of further amendments upon which extensive work is already proceeding.  I will come back to various further amendments during our discussion today as we proceed through the sections.  I expect them to include, subject again to the advice of the Attorney General, a power for a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law regarding the exercise of the coroner's functions.  There would be a section setting out governing principles for regulations to be made by me, with the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Health, on proper and respectful storage and disposal of human organs or tissue retained for the purpose of an inquest or post mortem examination.  There will be a number of amendments providing that in the small number of cases where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is investigating possible Garda involvement in a death under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, a designated officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission may provide assistance to the coroner's inquiry or inquest.</p></speech>

Both terms are used in the World Health Organization, WHO, definition of indirect maternal death but the latter appears to be more grammatically correct.  It also appears clearer.  With this amendment the Bill will define an indirect maternal death as &quot;the death of a woman resulting from a pre-existing disease or a disease that developed during pregnancy and which was not the result of direct obstetric causes but which was aggravated by the physiological effects of pregnancy&quot;.</p><p>The definitions of &quot;maternal death&quot;, &quot;direct maternal death&quot; and &quot;indirect maternal death&quot; set out in the Bill are important new definitions in line with the internationally recognised World Health Organization international classification of diseases, ICD, definitions.  They reflect the initiative on the part of Deputy Clare Daly to ensure the proper investigation of such deaths.  The World Health Organization definitions are also those used by Irish doctors.</p></speech>

There was the possibility of one amendment to be flagged for Report Stage in yesterday's discussions.  The committee already scheduled a meeting for Committee Stage a number of weeks ago to try to conclude this Bill but that was postponed because the Minister indicated a wish to include a load of other amendments.  We assumed those would be dealt with today but now we have references beginning to creep in for amendments we have not yet heard about.  Given that the order for Second Stage of the Coroners Bill 2015 was moved by me exactly three years and one day ago, what is going on?  It is grand if they are only minor amendments.</p></speech>

We have been waiting for this legislation for three years.  We were supposed to have dealt with it on Committee Stage about three or four weeks ago.  Now the Minister is talking about Report Stage as if the wheel had been reinvented because it was flagged nowhere and is against the wishes of the committee, all Members of the D&aacute;il and the Minister's party members the length and breadth of the country.  If he is telling me that there are only small issues and that we will take Report Stage in the first week or two after we come back in January, we can live with that, but what is he talking about?</p></speech>

To provide further information which may help to alleviate the anxiety of Deputy Clare Daly, on publication of the Bill in August, I flagged that it was my intention to introduce amendments for consideration to increase the jurisdiction of coroners to inquire into stillbirths and give them the power to direct hospitals and health institutions to produce medical records of deceased persons for a post mortem.  I am tabling the amendments today.  I also flagged at the time of publication of the Bill for discussion on Report Stage the issue of a case stated and the power of a coroner to seek directions from the High Court on a point of law, with governing principles for making regulations for the treatment and disposal of human organs and tissue that might be retained for an inquest, something to which I referred in my opening comments.  I intend to bring forward the amendment on Report Stage.  I have also mentioned the issue of an amendment in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p></speech>

The Bill defines a stillborn child in section 2 as &quot;a child of not less than 24 weeks&rsquo; gestation, or of birth weight of not less than 500 grammes, who is delivered without signs of life&quot;.  This is the accepted medical definition in Ireland.  It is also the definition used in the Civil Registration Act 2004, section 30 of which requires a stillbirth to be reported in the register of deaths as soon as is practicable.  This is a mandatory reporting requirement applied to the doctor, the midwife and the head of the hospital concerned.  The Civil Registration Act 2004 also provides in section 28 for the optional reporting of the stillbirth by the family and the issue of a special stillbirth certificate, if they so request.  The Coroners (Amendment) Bill 2018 now also requires mandatory reporting of stillbirths to a coroner.  Point 18 in the new schedule of reportable deaths specifies that any stillbirth must be reported to the coroner.  Section 6 of the Bill inserts a new section 16B(4) into the principal Act and provides for mandatory reporting of a stillbirth by the doctor, nurse or midwife who is responsible for the care of the mother.  The Coroner Service website lists certain stillbirths as reportable to the coroner as a matter of good practice and stillbirths are regularly reported to coroners by the doctors involved.  Coroners indicate that the large majority of stillbirths reported to them are natural and expected spontaneous stillbirths and are certified as such to the coroner's satisfaction by the mother's doctor.</p><p>In a very small number of cases there are circumstances surrounding the stillbirth such as concerns about possible medical errors, for example, which give rise to concern.  Coroners are very conscious of the sensitivity of such cases in practice and further inquiry is rare.  It is typically where the bereaved parents request it.  However, the mandatory reporting requirement introduced in the Bill will address the public concerns I have mentioned and support independent oversight and transparent investigation in the small number of cases where concerns arise.</p><p>The amendment I have brought forward complements the reporting requirements in the Bill by providing a discretionary power for a coroner to inquire into a stillbirth and, if the cause of death remains unclear, to direct a post mortem examination and, as appropriate, the holding of an inquest.  There are two special features.  While reporting a stillbirth to the coroner is mandatory, the coroner's inquiry and any post mortem and inquest into a stillbirth will be at the discretion of the coroner, subject to the criteria set out in the new section 2A, sections 17, 33A and 40 of the Bill which provide, respectively, for a mandatory inquest in certain cases, a mandatory post mortem in certain cases and mandatory juries in some cases, which are expressly disapplied to stillbirths.  In exercising his or her discretion the coroner must consult a family member of the stillborn child if it is practical to do so.  He or she must have regard to their views in deciding whether to hold an inquest.  The provisions recognise the particular sensitivity of these cases and the very diverse circumstances that can arise.</p><p>The amendment is also a response to the advice from the Office of the Attorney General that a coroner's powers to inquire into a stillbirth should be clarified.  This arises because the Coroners Act 1962 refers to a coroner inquiry into the death of a person.  This phrase is interpreted in Ireland and similar coronial legislation in England and Wales as referring to a person who was born alive, took independent breath and subsequently died but excluding a stillborn child who never drew what can be described as independent breath.  In practice, however, media reports indicate a small number of cases in recent years in which coroners have held a full inquest into a stillbirth, typically at the request of bereaved parents.</p><p>The question of extending the coroner's jurisdiction to stillbirths is also being examined across the water in England and Wales, as well as in Australia, but remains in early stages in both jurisdictions.  The proposal was welcomed in the UK by the Royal College of Pathologists and by UK organisations that advocate for patient safety and transparency in the context of stillbirths and neonatal deaths.<br/><br/>Conversely, coroners in Northern Ireland can inquire into a stillbirth since a judgment of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in 2013 held that the coroners have jurisdiction under a Northern Ireland statute of 1959 to hold an inquest into the death <i>in utero</i>of a child who was capable of being born alive.  The fact that this is a new question for other common law jurisdictions makes it prudent for us to adopt a discretionary approach, at least initially.<br/><br/>The proposed subsection (3) sets out circumstances which may be taken into account by the coroner inquiring into a stillbirth where the cause of death remains unknown.  Any of these circumstances, if applicable to the death of the mother, would give rise to a mandatory post mortem and inquest under sections 17 and 33A of the principal Act inserted by the Bill.  As sections 17 and 33A are disapplied to stillbirths, these relevant circumstances are set out in section 2A(3) simply to clarify that a coroner can still take them into account when exercising his or her discretionary powers.</p></speech>

As the Minister said, while the section is not providing for mandatory inquests into baby deaths, it does provide that they will be reportable and that other provisions of the Act will apply, such as the coroner being empowered to compel the handover of records and so on.  I certainly hope that although the power is discretionary, its inclusion in this Bill will bring us to a safer position in our hospitals in circumstances like those suffered by the Reilly family, for example.  The investigation into the death of their baby, Asha, took place a full 11 years after she died, thanks to the most appalling actions on the part of Portiuncula Hospital.  I hope these measures will prevent that happening again.</p> <p>  It is important to put the importance of this legislation on the record.  We constantly hear about the excellent quality of our maternity services but between 2007 and 2017, there were 31 inquests into baby deaths in the Republic of Ireland.  In June 2016, the investigation of baby deaths in Portiuncula Hospital was only one of many.  Seven out of the 19 maternity units at that time were either under independent investigation or involved in inquests.  It is a very big issue and we need to learn the lessons.</p> <p>  The added trauma parents have to endure following the death of a baby, as we saw in hospitals like Portlaoise and Portiuncula, due to the stonewalling by hospitals is abhorrent.  We know from the sample of 30 baby deaths due to negligence in Irish hospitals between 2008 and 2016 that in every single case where there is a record of an apology or a settlement, it was received three to nine years after the baby had died.  In many instances there was a settlement with no admission of liability and no apology.  The parents are on the record as describing the added trauma that caused to them.</p> <p>  I will not make those points again but it is a thread on this legislation that people deserve answers.  It improves our health service and if one wants to be cynical about it, it potentially saves the State tens of millions of euro every year in legal fees.  We have to move to a situation where we give people the information, tell them what they need to know and improve our services.  The amendment is very important and I welcome it.</p></speech>

Section 6 provides for a more strengthened regime for the reporting of certain deaths to the coroner.  It inserts new sections 16A and 16B in the principal Act.  Section 16A sets out an expanded and clarified list of the types of death which must be reported to the coroner, while section 16B sets out an expanded and clarified list of responsible persons who are required to report such a death to the coroner.  Accordingly, amendment No. 4, which proposes to delete &quot;prior to&quot; and substitute &ldquo;before&rdquo; on page 11, line 8, is a technical drafting amendment.  This was suggested by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure consistency.  Section 16B(3)(h), as amended, will provide that a person who had care of the deceased person immediately before his or her death is required to report the death to the coroner if it is a reportable death for the purposes of section 16A.</p><p>While amendment No. 5 may be technical, it is important.  The amendment provides for an additional category of persons who are responsible under the new section 16B(3) for reporting a death to the coroner.  It refers to those who were responsible for a person while he or she was in State custody or detention immediately before his or her death.  It would apply, for example, to the governor of a prison. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are purely technical, providing for the re-lettering of the remaining paragraphs in new section 16B(3) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 6 of the Bill.  The re-lettering is needed following the insertion of the new paragraph 16B(3)(i), as discussed under amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

This relates to mandatory inquests for maternal deaths.  The measure will have a triple effect when it is implemented.  It will give families the fullest picture about the train of events that led to the death of a loved one.  It will give clinicians and the HSE a crucial insight into where the system is failing women.  Finally, it will give us, as policymakers and those holding the purse strings, the information to make our services safer.</p><p>This is critical, and the reason I was a little stressed in asking about the amendments on Report Stage was that I was mindful that several of the people in the Gallery today, including midwives and husbands who have lost their wives, were here three years ago looking for this legislation.  Three years on, we know that a number of other women have lost their lives in our maternity services.  This is beyond urgent.  I say as much in recognition that this is where the tetchiness came from.  I have no wish to see Report Stage delayed.  Having said that, I want to be absolutely clear that we are in a completely different place now to where we were three years ago.  We are on the verge of delivering this legislation - there is no question or doubt about that.</p><p>This is the amendment we are really pushing.  I want to explain why because the reason gets to the heart of much of what we are talking about.  The World Health Organization estimates that between 88% and 98% of all maternal deaths are preventable.  That is shocking.  It means they should not or did not need to happen.  Obviously, every one of these cases is a tragedy.</p><p>We need as much information as possible delivered through inquests into maternal deaths to make our services safer.  Let us consider the case of the death of Tania McCabe in March 2007.  The inquest found that Tania and her son Zach had died as a result of septicaemia and returned a verdict of medical misadventure.  As a result, the HSE created guidelines on the management of septicaemia, something that should have been implemented in all maternity units.  Of course, we found out some years later at the inquest into the death of Savita Halappanavar that only five of the 19 maternity hospitals or units had implemented those guidelines.  In other words, without the inquest into the original death or the latter case we would not have had the guidelines or found out about their non-implementation.  The inquests were critical in developing the services.</p><p>I will set out some detail on this specific amendment to the Bill.  What we are trying to do is make it absolutely and crystal clear that a decision by the coroner to not hold an inquest &ndash; we are talking about mandatory inquests into maternal deaths &ndash; will only be taken after a family member has asked for that decision and provided the coroner is satisfied, on the basis of the post mortem and other information available, that the death of the woman was natural.</p><p>This question arose three years ago on Second Stage.  This was the major issue.  The relevant Minister at the time, Deputy Harris, said that we did not want the unintended consequence of a bereaved family having to go through an inquest where the causes were obvious and the family did not need an inquest.  The reasoning was that there may have been a pre-existing cancer or something like that and there may have been no dispute about it.  The idea was that no one would want to re-traumatise people in cases of a tragic but natural death, as it were, or force the family to go through an inquest.</p><p>We have been trying to strike a balance between the needs of the family and the wider public interest.  We have to be absolutely sure that we avoid a situation under this section whereby deaths that are avoidable do not get the inquest they should.  We believe the way the Government has framed the legislation at the moment gives a little too much latitude to the coroner.  It is a little too broad for us to be entirely comfortable with it at this stage.  We would prefer a situation whereby it would only be possible for a coroner to decline to hold an inquest if specifically asked not to in writing by a family member as well as being satisfied, on the basis of the information available, including the post mortem, that the death was natural.  The provision is not strong enough at the moment.</p><p>The issue for us is not that we believe the coroners will be declining inquests left, right and centre.  We do not believe that to be the case &ndash; I am keen to put that on the record.  I fully accept that these instances will only arise in exceptional cases.  However, it is still important because the concern boils down to the fact that whether a maternal death is natural or otherwise is not always obvious.  We need to be clear on that point.</p><p>Maternal healthcare is getting more complex.  Our knowledge of what amounts to maternal death and natural death is changing.  There has been a fall in direct maternal deaths, which is to be welcomed.  It is probably as a result of improvements in our health service.  However, the number of indirect maternal deaths has increased due to issues like obesity and diabetes, which are now major problems in Irish society and in many other European countries as well.  Clinicians and coroners are faced with what one researcher called increasingly intricate associations between underlying medical and pregnancy-related pathology.  Now more than ever it is likely that a death that looks natural and as if it has nothing to do with a pregnancy might actually be a maternal death.  That is the issue we are trying to get to the heart of with this amendment.  It is about changing and understanding the links between these complex medical factors.  The coroner might not actually be up to speed about the nature of these changes.  A coroner might think, entirely innocently, that a death is natural, for example, because of a heart attack.  The coroner may believe it is clear that the woman died of a heart attack and so the death was natural and could have happened to anyone.</p><p>The reality is that an aneurysm that was made more likely by pregnancy could have been avoided and the right medical pregnancy treatment might have altered the situation.  This is what we are trying to get at.</p><p> The window of discretion available to a coroner not to hold an inquest should be closed little further.  This should only be an option if a family specifically requests it.  We should put on the record, because in some ways this is where it started, that what we want to avoid is a worst-case scenario whereby it is less a case of intricate associations and is about more obvious ones.  I will use the example of the death of Bimbo Onanuga who died in March 2010.  On the basis of a perfectly written and perfectly correct post mortem report submitted to the coroner's office, the coroner first ruled there was no need for an inquest into her death as he deemed it was one of natural causes.  Subsequent queries by international experts centred on what lay behind the rupturing of her uterus and what was the train of events that led to that moment.  When the coroner was subsequently presented with the queries and granted an inquest he asked for 19 depositions and witnesses from the hospital concerned and, ultimately, there was a verdict of medical misadventure.  The point here is that initially the coroner was satisfied it was natural causes on the basis of the post mortem but this subsequently turned out not to be the case.  This is what we are trying to do here.</p><p> I recognise that once the Bill becomes law there will be a very strong positive obligation on a coroner to hold an inquest, which was not the case previously.  I realise fully that for a coroner to take a step to decline an inquest when the Bill is law would be much more serious than before and there will not be a huge amount of wriggle room but the concern remains that if it is a coroner who starts the process of exercising discretion regarding to whether to hold an inquest the whole point of a discretionary element to make things better for bereaved families will be lost and an inquest that perhaps should take place will not.  This is the impetus behind the amendment.  We feel strongly about it.  We do not think it is huge.  All it does is tie the hands of coroners a little tighter so that matters are cut and dried and the families are respected but the health service gets the information it needs.</p></speech>

I would be very keen, if we complete Committee Stage today, that we would be ready for Report Stage early next term.  Not by way of any reason or excuse for any perceived delay, I acknowledge that many of the people working on the amendments to the legislation and engaging with Deputy Clare Daly and others on the committee are also very much involved in the termination of pregnancy legislation.  It may well be reasonable to assume that Bill will be enacted by the end of this year.  I assure the committee there will be no delay in proceeding to Report Stage.  The intention is that we will be in a position to seek a date with the committee by the end of the first month of next year.  I know the urgency on the part of the committee.  It is one that is shared by me in the context of issues that have been raised.</p> <p>  On the matter of the amendment, which is important, I want to stress that under the provision I have proposed there are three tests in which the coroner needs to engage.  These are consultation with a family member of the deceased woman having due regard to the matters listed in subsection (4), including, of course, the views of the family members of the deceased woman, which is the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly, as to whether the death was natural; the result of any post mortem examination; and that the coroner needs to be satisfied that the death was natural and that an inquest is, therefore, in the circumstances not necessary.  If all of these tests are satisfied the coroner has the decision-making capacity on whether to hold an inquest.  It is after due and careful consideration.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly really got to the nub of the argument when she mentioned tying the hands of coroners.  It is important that we recognise the independent and official capacity of coroners.  My concern with regard to the amendment is that we could well tie the hands of a coroner who, irrespective of any considerations, would have to inquest every late maternal death unless a family member of the deceased requested otherwise in writing.  I see this as being, in many respects, unduly restrictive of the independent role coroners have in law.  I am also of the view that the amendment would create a further issue in that, effectively, the action or inaction of a single family member could exercise a greater level of authority than might in the circumstances be necessary, where an individual family member may be in a position to decide unilaterally whether an exception, which is provided for reasons of public policy, would apply to a maternal death.</p> <p>  While I have some sympathy for the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly in her amendment, my view is that a coroner would be inclined to hold an inquest in any event if a death is clearly unnatural and even if it in a case where it may be unnatural.  We have to look at the long-standing approaches that have been taken by coroners under the existing legislation, section 17 of which requires that it shall be the duty of the coroner to hold an inquest into a death if the coroner is of the opinion the death may have occurred in an unnatural or violent manner.  I stress that in arriving at a decision a coroner is required to have regard to all of the evidence, with specific reference to the proposed section 7(3) on the results of the post mortem, the views of a family member and whether sufficient information was made available at the time.  In practice coroners attach considerable importance to the views of the family, and rightly so.</p> <p>  I also note that Deputy Clare Daly's amendment would remove the statutory obligation under section 7(3) that would require a coroner to engage in active consultation with a family member.  It is important to acknowledge there may be circumstances where family members might disagree with each other.  Often, an individual family member might take a different view from other members of the family.</p><p>When such circumstances arise, it is important to acknowledge that, as a matter of general public policy, a coroner acts as an independent public official and never in any capacity as a private individual or in circumstances where there might any connection, perceived or otherwise, to the deceased.  It is the coroner who makes the final decision on whether a death that may appear natural should be, in the public interest, the subject of an inquest.  That is a fundamental principle of the system and I would be concerned if we moved towards weakening or changing that in a way that might be perceived as being compromised.  There is no precedent for making an exception to this principle.</p><p> I acknowledge, with sympathy, the point raised by Deputy Clare Daly but I also wish to stress the independent role and function of coroners and the long-standing practice of coroners in any event, as well as the mandatory obligation there will be in respect of consultation.</p></speech>

The Government's wording creates the possibility that a coroner could go against the family's wishes and decide not to hold an inquest, but that would not be possible with our wording.  Equally, the Government's wording creates a situation where it is possible for the coroner to start the ball rolling in terms of having a discussion about not having an inquest, but the goal here, as the Minister said on Second Stage, is to avoid a situation where a bereaved family might find itself having to participate in an inquest which it might not wish for in certain circumstances, and that it is not to give coroners a route out of holding maternal death inquests.  However, that is an unintended consequence of how the Government has drafted the Bill.  With our wording, only the family can precipitate any conversation about not having an inquest.</p> <p>  A final consequence of the Government's wording is that it leaves too wide a gap through which deaths that appear to be natural but are not could slip, meaning inquests that should be held are not held.  If the goal is to protect bereaved families from having to go through a process which, on the basis of the all the facts of the case, is not necessary, our wording achieves that while the Government's does not.  We are trying to put safeguards in place for women.  Let us ensure we do that and leave no space for it not to happen.</p></speech>

The point is that the legislation ties their hands.  We are instructing coroners to hold a mandatory inquest in cases of maternal death.  The only exception that has emerged is in cases where it would not be necessary, where the reason was obvious and clear and we do not wish to traumatise the family again.  That was the only exception we all wanted.  As Deputy Wallace stated, our amendment allows us to do that, but the Minister's does not.  His amendment permits a scenario, albeit that it might not happen very often, with the possibility of a coroner deciding not to hold an inquest in a case where one should be held.  Maternal deaths are different.  We are talking about otherwise healthy people interfacing with the medical system or maternal care and ending up dead.  It is a major issue.  The examination of the underlying events that led up to that is immensely important.  I again make the point that what might appear natural to a coroner in the post mortem or in the report from the hospital might not be, due to underlying issues, and we are losing valuable information there if our amendment is not accepted.</p> <p>  I accept the point about consultation.  We are not opposed to tidying that up on Report Stage.  Obviously, the family's decision not to have one should be following consultation with the coroner.  That is accepted.  At the same time, however, it should be the family's decision, not the coroner's.  That is the purpose of the Bill and what we are trying to achieve.</p></speech>

It is too open-ended for what Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace are trying to achieve with their amendment.  The Minister's amendment which proposes to insert "if any" after "views" removes the focus on the engagement with family members.  He is inserting an ability for the coroner perhaps to opt out of the level of consultation the Minister aspires to in his words.  Why is he inserting "if any" after "views" in section 7(4)(d)?  Would it not be better to leave the existing wording?</p></speech>

I agree with it.  I had intended to say that but I forgot.  If our amendment is passed this amendment would be redundant but if our amendment is not passed I will definitely oppose the Minister's amendment, precisely because of the point Deputy Jack Chambers made.  The spirit of this section was supposed to be a coroner exercising discretion to spare the feelings of a bereaved family.  This stands all that on its head.  The coroner can do it even without the wish of the family.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.853" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1269" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018121200002#H00600"><p>I wish to add a further comment before the Minister responds.  I appreciate the difference in the two positions.  The amendment proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Wallace states, "At the request in writing of a family member of the woman concerned, a coroner may decide not to hold an inquest".  There still is a degree of determination on the part of the coroner who "may decide not to hold an inquest" or who could proceed to hold the inquest.  I have followed the issue of maternal deaths and the need for mandatory inquests and this moves it positively towards the mandatory position.  The wording of the Bill leaves a degree of flexibility and independent action on the part of the coroner.  Like Deputy Clare Daly, we would all be of the view that this, please God, will be very rarely employed, and it would be preferable that it would not have to be employed at all.  Where it does present there is consultation with a family member, but when one looks at the definitions in that regard there might not be a representative view that is a unanimous view of all concerned.  According to what is stated on page 6 of the Bill, the coroner could speak to "a parent, grandparent, child, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle or aunt, whether of the whole blood, of the half blood or by affinity, of the person".  That is very wide; it is not specific.  One could have a consultation and in that situation many others might feel that their views were not properly reflected.  In the other situation, at the request in writing of a family member not to hold an inquest the coroner may decide and could proceed to hold an inquest.  On balance, given the history of this and the genesis of the thinking behind it, amendment No. 8 is the more appropriate reflection of public thinking on this issue at this time.</p><p>I think amendment No. 8 is a more appropriate reflection of public thinking on this issue.  I just offer that further observation and invite the Minister to respond to our collective views.</p></speech>

While that section does not provide for an obligation on the part of the coroner to consult with family, this is provided for in section 17(3), which Deputy Clare Daly proposes to replace.  That could be problematic.  I would ask the Deputy to reflect between now and Report Stage on how we might best meet the concern as adverted to by the Chair.  I do not think there is much between us in terms of what we wish to see enshrined in our legislation but I do not want to be accepting amendments that will have unintended consequences.  There are a number of drafting issues to which I made reference earlier.</p> <p>  Reference has been made by Deputies to a number of deaths, some of which took place many years ago.  I want to acknowledge that coroners are very well aware of issues and of the significance of maternal deaths.  They are well minded to hold inquests in such cases.  Coroners experience regular briefings on the latest research and development.  They have a technical understanding of issues to hand that may be developing in accordance with updated and modern research.  We can expect that to continue to intensify further as this legislation is passed.  I ask Deputy Clare Daly not to press the amendment but to see how we can reflect over the course of the Christmas vacation on reaching a meeting of minds.  I must acknowledge the independent legal role of coroners in our public service.  Coroners are not directly connected with any matters of substance that may appear to be the subject matter of decision.</p></speech>

That is my understanding of the Bill.  I am aware of maternal deaths in my own locality where the husband, as it was in those cases, had to fight tooth and nail to have an inquest held.  I am aware of two cases where it took some time and a lot of persuasion to ensure that the inquest was held.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment is reasonable in the sense that people will not have to go through that trauma to make sure that an inquest is held.  As it stands, the coroner has the option based on the autopsy to decide whether or not to have an inquest.  I agree with the other members that it is a bit loose and needs to be tightened up.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about the independent legal role of the coroner and that is absolutely and totally accepted.  While acknowledging that, however, we have of course already got legislation placing a mandatory requirement on them to carry out inquests in a number of cases.  We are just adding maternal deaths to that category for all of the reasons Deputy Scanlon highlighted.  The only objection was that we do not want inadvertently to damage or harm bereaved families.  That is the purpose of this opt-out clause.  The very reason this legislation is tabled and the reason there is a bit more awareness of it among coroners is that it was precisely the families who led the battle to get this information.  It would be incredibly unusual for a family not to want to get the answers.  These are instances in which the partner or family may have been present and may have a difference with the hospital.  The hospital could be saying everything is grand and there is nothing to see here.  However, the partner or family members who were there with the woman may have seen a sequence of events for which they want answers.  Families want answers and we should not be afraid of that.  Our amendment provides a better balance; this is about mandatory inquests.  We can look at tweaking the consultation part on Report Stage but I will be pressing it now.  If the Minister wants to reflect on it over Christmas, by all means, he may do so, but I am happier to go with our wording now.  If the Minister wants to come back with something different in respect of the consultation issue on Report Stage, that is fine.  It is critical that we move on this now.</p></speech>

Where an inquest has been denied and it is very definitely the view of the bereaved that an inquest is important and necessary, the process for appeal, as I understand it, currently takes place through the Attorney General.  Can the Minister clarify whether that is the case?  I have a sense that this merits serious reconsideration.  Let there be no mistake; the Attorney General is a politically vulnerable individual who sits at the Cabinet table and is open to the vagaries of the political system.  That office or officeholder does not strike me as being independent in every respect.  Has any consideration been given to this matter in the drafting of the Bill?  If not, I reserve the right, as the Minister has done, to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage if colleagues feel it is appropriate to do so.  I would appreciate whatever light the Minister can shine on that matter.</p></speech>

If she decides to press the amendment with the support of the members, my concern is that, regardless of whether it is intended, it will have one serious consequence.  That is that it would remove the statutory obligation under section 17(3) for the coroner to consult with a family member of the deceased woman.  I would be concerned if we are now to insert amendments without the type of reflection that I believe is both appropriate and necessary.</p><p>Under the current provision, there is a clear obligation on the coroner to consult, have regard to and be satisfied before making a decision.  These thresholds are in-built in the legislation and can adequately deal with the circumstances as outlined.  I am prepared to look further to see whether we can reach a meeting of minds on this matter, but I am concerned by a number of weaknesses in the amendment.  If the committee was minded to accept it in its entirety, I would have to caution against that.</p><p> Regarding the Chairman's question, there is not an appeal.  It is an application to the Attorney General to direct that an inquest take place.  Notwithstanding this legislation, there is something of a major re-organisation of the coroner system.  Members will be familiar with the Bill of some years ago.  Enshrined in that proposed Bill was a plan for a chief coroner to examine the matter of appeals.  This is an issue on which work continues.  It would involve significant organisational restructuring, but it is an issue that is receiving consideration.</p><p> The Chairman will be aware that there is a provision whereby a decision of a coroner can be subjected to a judicial review.  That is in addition to the application that can be made to the Attorney General.</p></speech>

It is an appeal - that is how we lay people would view it in any event, and the Minister used that language in his concluding sentences.  The Attorney General can direct a coroner or, actually, override a coroner's previous decision not to proceed.  In preparing for today's meeting and informing myself of the methodology, I was alarmed to see that this was the recourse that people had.  I do not believe that anyone who works in this institution would be in any doubt that the Attorney General is hardly an independent arbiter in such a situation.</p></speech>

The element that we removed, and which can easily be put back in, referred only to instances where the family would be consulted before any decision on not proceeding was taken.  However, that removal has to be seen in the context of what we are including, that being, a requirement that the inquest can only not go ahead if the family initiate that decision and write to the coroner.  There is no question of the family's wishes being diluted by our proposition in its entirety.  We are reflecting fully the family's wishes.  However, I accept that, prior to the family making that decision, it would be better if the family had a chat with the coroner and aired those views in an holistic way.  That is not a big deal and can be added to the Bill later by the Minister.  It is not that we are taking out a family's right to consultation or involvement.  Rather, the purpose of the amendment in its entirety is to put the family's wishes centre stage.</p> <p>  All of this comes back to our point that the coroner already has discretion under this legislation.  We are making it mandatory.  This is a tiny exception that we do not want to be blown apart, putting us back to where we were in the beginning.  I just wanted to clarify the point.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that a coroner must, under the Bill, have regard to all of the facts listed in the proposed section 17(4), must be satisfied that the death was a natural one and must be satisfied that an inquest is unnecessary.  Even if all of those tests are satisfied, though, it appears that a coroner cannot decide not to hold an inquest unless a family member asks him or her in writing.  For example, if the deceased woman has no identified family members or if there are no family members who contacted the coroner involved in writing, it seems in these circumstances that the coroner must hold an inquest even if there is clear evidence that the death was natural.  I am concerned that Deputy Clare Daly's amendment - I accept that she may not have intended this - appears to tie the hands of the coroner who, irrespective of any other consideration, would be obliged to have an inquest unless a family member requested otherwise.  Under the amendment, that request must be in writing.  I would ask that this issue be reflected on.  I would offer assistance in reaching a position that could gain favourable consideration across the board.</p></speech>

I want to put this to a vote.  The purpose is mandatory inquests.  If the case is that straightforward, the inquest will not be too taxing, so I would not worry that much about it.</p></speech>

Certainly, it is my view that the most straightforward approach, legally, would be to provide that changes made by the Bill apply only to deaths occurring after the commencement of the legislation.  However, there is a preference for a broader approach.</p><p>My amendment limits the application, only, of the changes made by section 7 of the Bill to section 17 of the principal Act dealing with mandatory inquests.  It allows application, even of those provisions, to deaths occurring before the commencement of the Bill if, on commencement date, the coroner has not yet completed his or her inquiries into the death and has not yet decided whether to hold an inquest.  Having consulted with the Office of the Attorney General, and having consulted with coroners, it appears that legal complications and legal uncertainty would be likely to arise if the Bill were applied to pre-commencement deaths, in respect of which the coroners had completed their inquiries and perhaps even held an inquest.</p><p>Having regard to the large numbers of natural deaths occurring in different types of State custody, such as in detention, it appears from consultation with coroners that requests to reopen such cases with a mandatory inquest now could give rise to a very significant consequence in the coroner system.</p></speech>

The amendment provides that the duty to hold an inquest into maternal death and a death in State custody does not have retrospective effect.  This prevents the State from having to investigate the deaths of everyone who died in prison of old age, for example, but I would like to hear more about the position on maternal deaths.  It is worth having a conversation on whether the provision could work in tandem with some other route for people who have been denied an inquest up to now, or who will have been prior to the enactment of this legislation.  We are aware of a death that occurred a number of years ago in respect of which the husband of the woman had never been granted or had never sought an inquest.  That process is now under way, however.  Is there some route for such people?  We envisage something other than a formal appeals process or something else in order that families who are currently unhappy about a coroner's decision not to hold an inquest would have a route under this legislation to have their cases re-examined without giving rise to the Minister's problem of retrospective application in all cases.  Could something be built in on Report Stage in this regard?  It might be worth considering.  I am not opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

The new provisions provide that where a coroner has directed a post-mortem examination into a death, he or she may also direct the head of the hospital where the deceased person was treated immediately before the death, or a doctor who has medical records of the deceased, to provide the pathologist conducting the post-mortem examination with such records as the coroner considers necessary to enable a proper examination to be made.</p><p>The amendment is considered necessary to enable the coroner to carry out his or her statutory functions effectively and to ensure the fullest possible transparency in regard to the investigation of unnatural deaths or where the cause of death may be unclear.  It is expected that such records would be provided on a voluntary basis on request by hospitals or other health institutions.  However, difficulties have arisen in the past in certain cases where the coroner had considerable difficulties in obtaining appropriate records over a sustained period.  It is particularly critical that relevant medical records of the deceased be provided in a prompt and timely manner.  The window for conducting the most effective post-mortem examination is short, optimally often within 24 hours of the death.  This provision is intended to make it clear that the coroner has the power to compel the production in case of difficulty.</p><p>Some of the finer points of this amendment are still being teased out with the Parliamentary Counsel.  I intend to propose further amendments of the provision in question on Report Stage, particularly regarding appropriate enforcement provisions.  We are considering in this regard what enforcement provisions would be most effective, having regard to the urgency that will obtain in the circumstances in question.  I propose the acceptance of this amendment but with a commitment to consider adequate provisions in respect of enforcement.  Possibilities might include, in addition to an offence, a power for the coroner to apply <i>ex parte</i>to the High Court should records not be forthcoming in a prompt and timely manner.  I am happy to hear the views of members of the committee but I accept that while the amendment is important, we need to examine the matter of enforcement.</p></speech>

This issue definitely was flagged and we fully support the Minister in his efforts on this.  I echo the point made by the Minister that our support on it is dependent on some sanctions being included on Report Stage.  There are no sanctions at all on medical institutions or hospitals that refuse to hand over records.  On the understanding that these sanctions will be included, I would be happy to accept the amendment.  While this was flagged, a number of the other issues raised by the Minister were not flagged at all in the conversations we had in preparation for this Bill.  I am pretty sure some of the issues were not even flagged on Second Stage.  Some issues were flagged on Second Stage, dropped in the pre-discussions about Committee Stage and are now being re-entered.  Perhaps the committee could deal with this after today's session.  I just wanted to put it on the record.  This issue, however, was flagged and we fully support it.</p></speech>

It would propose enhanced provisions, for example, on the conduct of post mortem examinations by registered medical practitioners and on the powers to remove and retain human tissue and other material during a post mortem examination.  The provision may include a power for the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Health, to set out by regulation a code of practice for post mortem examinations.  We do not have such a statutory code currently.  I am also examine a provision for a new power allowing the coroner to request the Minister to order the exhumation of a body in the rare circumstances where the body has been buried but the coroner may be satisfied that further post mortem examination is required, and that such an exhumation is, in the circumstances, justified.  There will be a provision for a defence post mortem.  These are rare situations but may arise where a person is accused or is likely to be charged with criminal involvement in the death of a person very soon after the death.  In such a situation the High Court has confirmed that the accused is entitled to request an independent post mortem examination of the body of the deceased in addition to the examination already carried out by the State pathologist's office.  This independent defence post mortem differs necessarily in some important respects from a coroner's post mortem.  For example, it is facilitated but not directed by the coroner.  It is important that a statutory provision for the defence post mortem would provide more clarity for everybody concerned.  I acknowledge that it is a complex area but it would enable provision, for example, for the appropriate balancing of the rights of the accused person and the family of the deceased.  Defence post mortems can be distressing for the family of the deceased and any delay in this regard should be kept to an absolute minimum.</p></speech>

Subject to the advice of the Attorney General the intention would be to provide for a consultative case-stated-type process.  It would allow for a coroner to apply to the High Court for directions on a point of law relating to the performance of his or her functions.  Under the Act, it is proposed that the High Court would determine such an application by giving directions, making such orders as it may consider appropriate.</p> <p>  I want to reflect that, in common with other quasi-judicial bodies, coroners are being called upon to conduct inquests in a more adversarial and perhaps challenging environment than was heretofore the case.  While coroners are not deciding the issue of adversarial litigation, they are nevertheless required to conduct an inquest in accordance with administrative law and they need to apply principles of procedural fairness.  They need to comply with requirements of the European Convention of Human Rights Act.  They increasingly deal with complex and sometimes challenging points of procedural law, which are raised by parties to the inquest from time to time.  I merely cite an example of applications for discovery of documents to be provided to the coroner.  All of these are positive for ensuring the system is adequately robust.  I intend introducing a small number of amendments to the section.</p></speech>

It might be interpreted as suggesting that other references to an institution in the Bill excluded a hospital unless that specific mention was made.</p><p>This Schedule, which section 28 inserts as a second Schedule to the principal Act contains a list of specific examples of the types of deaths that must be reported to a coroner under new sections 16(<i>a</i>) and 16(<i>b</i>) of the principal Act.</p></speech>

At the outset I remind members, staff, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting as well as affecting the television broadcast and web stream.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise that any submissions, opening statements or other documents supplied by the witnesses to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>The committee is meeting today to discuss the matter of supporting communities and sustaining small rural businesses within the Border region after Brexit.  I welcome the following witnesses to the committee: from the Centre for Cross Border Studies, Dr. Anthony Soares, deputy director; from the East Border Region, Ms Pamela Arthurs, chief executive; from the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, NILGA, Councillor Seamus Doyle, a member of the NILGA executive, and Ms Lisa O'Kane, programme manager; from the Rural Community Network, Mr. Aidan Campbell, policy and public affairs; and from the Irish Central Border Area, Mr. Shane Campbell, chief executive.  It is proposed that the opening statements and any other documents supplied by the witnesses to the committee be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>This is an appropriate time to consider the risks to the Border region, particularly in terms of rural and community development.  After the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union two and a half years ago, it is still not clear what Brexit actually means in practice.  The withdrawal agreement and a political declaration may or may not be agreed by the United Kingdom Parliament.  There are basic scenarios in relation to Brexit.  There will be a soft Brexit with a withdrawal agreement and a transition period, there will be a hard Brexit without a withdrawal agreement, meaning that the UK would basically crash out of the EU, or there will be no Brexit at all.  There is no good Brexit so we are trying to get the best possible outcome for all of this island and for the EU as a whole.  An added difficulty is that there is no functioning Executive in Northern Ireland.</p><p>We should always remember that policies on one side of the Border can have serious effects on the other side of the Border.  There have been successes, such as the PEACE IV programme, which funds actions that promote social and economic stability in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland and is co-funded by the EU and the Irish and UK Governments.  Some &euro;240 million will be invested by the EU, Ireland and the UK over the programme period.  When there is co-operation between both sides, both sides can benefit.  A good example was rural transport with the joint control of the Great Northern Railway in the 1950s by both Governments North and South.  Later in the 1960s, the Northern Ireland Government closed all cross-Border railways except the Dublin-Belfast line.  Consequently, there are no railway lines in counties Donegal, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Cavan and Monaghan and there is no railway line anywhere between Derry and Mullingar.</p><p>The committee looks forward to enhanced co-operation at local and regional level.  We are interested in hearing the views of representatives here today on how we can mitigate the risks to the Border region and how we can enhance rural and community development.  The joint committee looks forward to the witnesses' contribution to policy formation in the area of rural and community development in the Border region.  As the committee has agreed to publish the witnesses' opening statements, perhaps they can focus on the main points and speak for three to five minutes.  I also suggest that members limit their questions to between three and five minutes.  I call Dr. Soares, deputy director of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.948" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018121200002#B00200"><p>On behalf of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, I thank the Chairman and members of this committee for the invitation to meet on the subject of supporting communities and sustaining small rural business within the Border region after Brexit.  As the Chairman referred to, even as we rapidly approach the date on which the United Kingdom will officially leave the European Union, it is still unclear as to what the scale and nature of the impact will be on Border communities and businesses.  What is at stake here is not only the economic future of communities and small rural businesses in the Border region but also, if not properly mitigated, is social cohesion within the Border region after Brexit.</p><p>Brexit will not alter the fact that the United Kingdom will remain a co-guarantor, along with Ireland, of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  That means that, in terms of maintaining the conditions for North-South co-operation that will assist in supporting communities and small rural businesses in the Border region post Brexit, the UK Government must not shirk that responsibility to a non-operational Northern Ireland Assembly or Executive.</p><p> To support communities and small rural businesses in the Border region fully post Brexit, it is essential that EU funding for North-South and cross-Border co-operation is secured for the next programming period.  However, we, the Centre for Cross Border Studies, are concerned that although the European Commission's fact sheet on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement refers to the "continuation of PEACE and INTERREG for Northern Ireland and the border regions of Ireland beyond 2020 under a single programme PEACE PLUS", the political declaration on future UK-EU relations refers simply to the UK and EU's "shared commitment to delivering a future PEACE PLUS programme to sustain work on reconciliation and a shared future in Northern Ireland".  There is no reference here to the Border counties of Ireland.  Therefore, it is of paramount importance that legal guarantees are given that any future PEACE PLUS programme will encompass the Border counties of Ireland and will be a significant contribution, of at least 15% of any total budget, to cross-Border co-operation.</p><p> Given the potential of the current LEADER programme to support cross-Border co-operation activities in relation to rural development, it is also important that a similar support is provided in the post-Brexit context, either as part of any proposed PEACE PLUS programme or as a discrete programme supportive of rural development as one of the areas of North-South co-operation identified as part of the North-South co-operation mapping exercise.</p><p> Those are some of the headline issues in supporting communities and small rural businesses in the Border region following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  Many imponderables still exist due to the unstable political landscape in Westminster, meaning that we cannot be sure of the kind of Brexit we will be left with, or whether we will have any Brexit at all.  Whatever the case, I assure the committee that the Centre for Cross Border Studies will remain committed to supporting, promoting and advocating for cross-Border co-operation as part of the ongoing process of peace and reconciliation, and as a means of providing practical benefits to communities and businesses on both sides of the Border.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the chairman of the East Border Region, EBR, Councillor Aidan Campbell, from Monaghan County Council, and the vice chairman, Alderman Arnold Hatch, from Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.</p> <p>  Let me first briefly explain the organisation.  The EBR, is a local authority led cross-Border organisation.  It is one of the few genuinely cross-Border organisations on the island of Ireland, comprising three local authorities in Ireland, Louth, Monaghan and Meath county councils, and three in Northern Ireland, Newry, Mourne and Down District Council, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, and Ards and North Down Borough Council.  The east coast area between Dublin and Belfast is covered by the cross-Border organisation.  The mission statement is simple but comprehensive, namely, to promote cross-Border economic development which benefits the people of the region.</p> <p>  The EBR was formed in 1976.  It is one of the oldest genuinely cross-Border organisations and it has always worked under the backdrop of the European Union.  The initial impetus for co-operation came from locally elected politicians on both sides of the Border who realised that there would be mutual benefit to working together.  That was the case in spite of the hostile political climate at the time.  However, it was only since the introduction of the EU INTERREG programme in 1990 that the EBR made a difference in that it had money for cross-Border co-operation.  With our colleague organisations, the EBR has drawn down millions of euro for a host of projects which have benefited communities and small rural businesses along the Border corridor.  Let us be honest: the majority of the Border corridor is rural.  I have a brochure which outlines the scope of the current work.  The projects we are working on reach a total budget of &euro;91 million.  They are all genuine cross-Border projects funded through the INTERREG programme and working on both sides of the Border.</p> <p>  The Co-Innovate project is one example of a project funded by the INTERREG programme.  InterTradeIreland leads the large strategic SME project which will complete in 2022.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to assist 1,409 small businesses in the Border region and west coast of Scotland.  We all know the Border region is dominated by small rural businesses, especially micro business, which have fewer than ten employees.  They require assistance not only to create new jobs, which is important, but also to sustain existing jobs.  There is no doubt the myriad EU-funded projects which have been drawn down have significantly contributed to the growth of Border business over the past 25 years, but there is still work to be done.</p> <p>  Brexit will be a game changer.  What Brexit has done is to highlight many needs which exist in the Border area as well as causing problems in the future.  Small rural businesses have already been affected, especially in Ireland.  The drastic fall in sterling after the referendum and the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, which has dominated our landscape since the vote in June 2016, is not good for business.  Coupled with the lack of a Government in Northern Ireland, it is evident that Border businesses are suffering.  While the Irish Government has put in place measures to support rural business, the same opportunities do not exist for businesses in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now focus on what has been the local authority response to Brexit.  In particular, given the absence of a Government in Northern Ireland, local authorities along the Border felt it necessary to articulate and lobby for the needs of the 1 million constituents of the Border region.  The report, Brexit and the Border Corridor on the island of Ireland: Risks, Opportunities and Issues to Consider, was commissioned by the 11 local authorities which make up the Border corridor.  The East Border Region facilitated the report.  Copies of the report can be made available to members of the committee.  The report clearly identified that the economy of the Border region currently lags behind the economies of both Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It also outlines that the Border will be most detrimentally affected as a result of Brexit, that regional disparities exist along the Border and that areas most reliant on agriculture will suffer most.  Also of note is that some farmers in Northern Ireland who receive 87% single farm payment are currently better off due to the decline in sterling because they receive their money in euro.  The question is where this money will come from in the future.  Some of the groups represented here today responded to a consultation by Westminster on a future UK prosperity fund to compensate for the lack of EU funding.  Despite our efforts, the report hardly recognised the need to fund any cross-Border activity.</p> <p>  Mr. Dan O'Brien, chief economist in the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, stated at a Brexit event in Dublin on 4 December 2018 that "whilst employment growth over all in Ireland is good, employment in the border region has faltered" since June 2016.  That is a reflection of the damage Brexit has already done.  Business in the region is less confident and more reluctant to expand as the future is so uncertain.  Current developments at Westminster have compounded the problem.  One can ask what local authorities can do.  Local authorities on both sides of the Border have a duty of care to the citizens of the Border region.  Local elected members in Northern Ireland are the only political voice at present.  Border local authorities want to work with both Governments to develop and propose creative solutions for Border management post Brexit.  We want to be part of the solution, not the problem.</p> <p>  Local authorities have an excellent track record and have been working on a cross-Border basis for more than 40 years.  It is a long time in one way but in another way it is not very long in terms of cross-Border co-operation.  That is despite the political problems at a national level.</p><p>To assist rural communities and business it is essential to address the structural weaknesses in the Border region.  Intervention clearly is needed now.  The report, Brexit and the Border Corridor, highlighted that.  There is a requirement for upgrading infrastructure, both transport and broadband, as this would assist connectivity in the region.  We also need ongoing business support measures to assist business prepare for and deal with the impact.  Again, the Government is doing a great deal of work with businesses in the South, but in the North there is not so much.  However, InterTradeIreland is in Northern Ireland.  We need to focus on relevant skills levels in the region as well.</p><p> A Brexit transition programme along the lines of the EU Territorial Co-operation programme, INTERREG, would assist the Border region to start to adapt to the challenges of Brexit.  This needs to be broad-based as Brexit will impact on every sector.</p><p> In respect of the continuation of EU funding programmes to assist the communities, Northern Ireland is not at a stage where it can do without the intervention.  We have progressed by a long way, but work still needs to be done.</p><p> Mitigating risks, taking opportunities, or both, will mean by necessity defending some of what is in place, for example, the funding streams, but it will also mean that some things will have to change.  The Border corridor, with its peripheral position, already lags behind, and we need to break the past patterns.  New policy, new thinking and new methods of co-operation and partnership between local authorities and central government will be important as we cannot do it on our own, and this will be essential for Border management in the wake of Brexit. </p><p> The success of any future regime for the management of the Border will be judged not only on how well it answers the political and economic dilemmas caused to the region by Brexit, but also how far it allows the current level of co-dependence across Border areas to continue.  Any solution must be bottom up, that is, coming from the people, needs-based, and driven and delivered locally.  I thank the members and witnesses for listening.</p></speech>

The Northern Ireland Local Government Association, NILGA, is the only functioning cross-party political body in Northern Ireland at present.  Throughout the hiatus in regional government at Stormont, NILGA has sought to build consensus and represent all of Northern Ireland's main political parties at local government level in Westminster, Dublin and Brussels.</p> <p>  Northern Ireland's councils have built a strong track record in delivering economic growth and fostering peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  The Border corridor in particular will be the region most affected by Brexit and its outworkings, and we are working intently to prepare our councils and to attempt to minimise any negative effects for local areas.</p> <p>  Brexit is a major concern for our councils.  We are all too familiar with the risks we are facing, namely, the unbinding of our close ties with our neighbours on an economic and social level which will widen the gap between our communities and impinge on our way of life.  Different rules and regulations are creating havoc for business, the environment and ordinary people which will create difficult conditions for our small businesses and tourists, resulting in a downturn in our economies.  There will be pressure on our agriculture, health, manufacturing and hospitality sectors.  In this difficult situation we find ourselves in, our communities and councils, however, will find ways to continue our strong tradition of co-operation.  We are feeling optimistic about the future of cross-Border co-operation following recent meetings with the regional assemblies in Brussels and follow-up meetings at home, and we are planning future collaborative work together.  This will include sharing information and tools to ensure local authorities North and South are prepared for Brexit.  We are embedding entrepreneurialism in our local authorities and investigating joint opportunities for training and development.  We are building regional relationships to improve cross-Border development and regeneration.</p> <p>  In economic policy terms, the emergence of city and growth deals can be a real game changer for Northern Ireland.  NILGA's paper of May 2018 highlights the interconnectedness of our economies, in particular the links with the national development plan and the cross-Border linkages with the Derry and Newry areas.  Indeed in the hinterland of the Derry city region, 40% of the population lives in Donegal.  It goes without saying that investment in one jurisdiction will reap benefits for the entire region, whether that be investment in jobs, broadband, education or infrastructure.  This is what we must focus on to ensure growth of the entire island.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for their attention, and my colleague, Ms Lisa O&rsquo;Kane, will address any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

The Rural Community Network is an NGO, a voluntary and community organisation with 250 member groups across Northern Ireland.  Our main areas of interest are rural and community development.</p> <p>  In terms of the issues the committee is addressing today, many Border communities are on the periphery of both jurisdictions and citizens need to be better connected to opportunity, either locally or in major towns and cities.  Many of these communities are still recovering from the legacy of the conflict.  Broadband connectivity and a decent road network are a prerequisite to encourage young people to remain in, or return to, these rural communities.  The closure of public services can lead to a vicious circle where young people and young families see no future in those communities, leading to further decline.</p> <p>  Government, North and South needs to put in place policies and programmes that sustain North-South networking and co-operation.  Brexit and the absence of a functioning assembly and Executive risks regressing into back-to-back development, which will further marginalise Border communities.</p> <p>  The 2014-2020 Northern Ireland rural development programme is worth up to &pound;623 million.  Some &pound;70 million in the current programme is allocated to the LEADER programme.  The EU rural development programme has been a key policy driver as well as providing a ring-fenced funding pot that can only be spent on development of rural communities.  As of now, it is unclear what replaces the rural development programme post Brexit.</p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement identified the PEACE programme, INTERREG and LEADER II and their successor programmes as areas of potential North South co-operation.  The UK-EU withdrawal agreement recognises the need to protect the 1998 agreement "in all its parts".  It states that both Governments will honour their commitments to the PEACE and INTERREG funding programmes and that the possibilities for future support will be examined favourably.  It is of concern to Rural Community Network and other rural stakeholders that specific reference to the LEADER programme was omitted from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, DAERA, has established a Brexit rural society working group which has produced an issues paper.  In the view of RCN, however, Northern Ireland has barely started discussing what a future policy or programme for rural development post Brexit will look like.  Our concern is that rural development is very far down the agenda among the myriad other issues affected by Brexit, and none of this is helped the absence of a functioning assembly.</p> <p>  In spite of the problems, there are opportunities.  Agriculture and rural development are devolved matters and a functioning assembly could shape any future rural development policy to rural communities and reduce bureaucracy.  The Northern Ireland Executive has committed significant matching funding from the Northern Ireland block grant in previous programme periods.  It will not be beginning from a standing start, therefore, in funding a successor rural development programme.  Any new programmes must complement the LEADER programme in the Border counties, both North and South, to enable learning, sharing and important co-operation projects to continue. </p></speech>

It is a predominantly rural area with few large settlements, and small businesses are the backbone of the economy.  It is recognised that Brexit represents the greatest challenge to cross-Border co-operation since the Troubles.  Joint studies between ICBAN and Queen's University have identified uncertainties already impacting on the lives of Border citizens and businesses and that the most important community consideration is protecting the hard-won peace.</p> <p>  No one knows what Brexit will bring, but on the understanding it will create change, I will make some comments on supporting and sustaining communities and small businesses in the area post Brexit.  There is a continuing need to ensure free movement of people, goods and services.  In the rural community context this includes ensuring access to health and education services.  Brexit has challenged communication in the area.  Therefore, it is vitally important to prioritise North-South and cross-Border co-operation regardless of Brexit outcomes and, in so doing, to help work against any drift to back-to-back development again.  For example, in reference to the national development plan and the planning framework and in the absence of a regional development strategy review in Northern Ireland, cognisance should be taken of the fact that, through local development plans, Northern Ireland councils are reaching out to their neighbours.</p> <p>  Connectivity infrastructure is critical to enabling access to services.  This includes both digital communications and roads-based transportation.  Delivering on the national broadband plan ambitions is critical for rural Border communities.  As active commentators on the subject, we encourage an alternative solution to be found if the national broadband plan cannot be advanced further to delivery in its current format.</p> <p>  Strategic road corridors are vital for transportation access and movement.  It is vital and would be helpful if both Governments formally recommitted to the long-planned N2-A5 Dublin to Derry dual carriageway project.  The importance of the A4-N16 Sligo to Ballygawley and Belfast route is important for east-west navigation and needs support from both Governments.</p> <p>  There are many successful examples where Government has helped to spur on a renewed regional economy.  The central Border region would benefit from such bespoke intervention to complement local leadership and initiatives being taken there.</p> <p>  While national Government attention is focused on Brexit, the delivery of local services must continue to be a priority.  Local authorities from both sides of the Border must be supported to engage through community planning with its focus on the economic and social elements of well-being.</p> <p>  Continued direct interventions into promoting co-operation are needed, through the delivery of PEACE, INTERREG and LEADER funds in arrangements between the UK and EU or, in the absence of these, ensuring they are directly replaced.  These supports have been vital for communities and businesses of the region.  They should include provision for the softer people-to-people and community-based initiatives, to help maintain good relations, alongside infrastructure supports.  There should also be support for the revitalisation of Border towns and villages which have been in persistent decline.</p> <p>  Government, telecoms providers and the regulator must ensure that inadvertent roaming charges are not reintroduced, which would disenfranchise Border region communities as a consequence of the UK planning to leave the digital Single Market.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee.  Normally members of the committee speak first, but I have another meeting to attend at 10.30 a.m.  I hope to meet the witnesses in the audiovisual room later.</p> <p>  I welcome the delegation.  I pay tribute to local councillors right across the Border region, the management of local authorities and the managers of the programmes on their efforts.  I smiled when Ms Arthurs referred to the INTERREG programme starting in 1990.  I remember an MEP talking about it in the Leinster region in a very strange accent and we thought he was talking about Easter eggs.  That was in the late 1980s when the programme was being introduced and we were made aware of the great benefits it would bring to the Border region.  There is no doubt that the impact of the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, in addition to what local authorities have been doing, has been enormous.</p> <p>  The Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been looking at having the witnesses appear at the committee again to discuss this issue.  It is clear everybody is making a concerted effort and has made sure the additional moneys available to the Border region are best spent.  I am a former member of a Border region local authority and was a local public representative for 25 years.  The additional funding in rural Border regions, particularly in my area of Louth, which I can speak for specifically - I am sure other members will speak for their own area - has been very beneficial to peace, prosperity and the sense of co-operation.  Despite the fact that management was always engaging throughout the Troubles, too many people, including councillors, had their backs to each other.  It has changed dramatically in my lifetime as a result of EU intervention and the PEACE programme moneys.  We are in a huge vacuum at present.</p> <p>  I am coming to my question.  In the context of Brexit, what can be done collectively in terms of the duty of care, the bottom-up approach and new policies from Government to ensure that, in a more extreme situation than we have ever found ourselves in, there is a specific programme?  Dr. Soares referred to 15%.  The reality is when one is in a vacuum, one cannot plan.  We have been told some of the programmes will be available until 2020.</p> <p>  I will finish on this point.  Ms Gina McIntyre attended a committee meeting and spoke about extraterritorial programmes and programmes available between non-EU and EU countries.  There are examples of those across Europe.  Is action needed to have somebody within the EU programmes address the issue?  What was happening in each of these particular bodies was lauded down the years in Europe.  This is the most important point I will make this morning.  The European Commission, the Commissioner at the time, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, and Colin Wolfe stated what was happening in the Border region was unique in Europe.  They talked about 130 cross-territorial regions where this type of co-operation was not happening but it was happening in our region.  Our region has benefited hugely from it.</p> <p>  I will leave it there.  I have another meeting to attend so I will meet the witnesses later.  What can be done by politicians to ensure either a new or enhanced programme delivers from Carlingford Lough to the tip of Donegal to ensure the region continues to prosper, because it will take a backward step if Brexit happens?  That is the key question.  Money speaks languages but the communities have suffered badly and continue to suffer.  Despite the money that came in through the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, it has still not filtered down into communities, not only in the Border region but also in the more deprived areas of Belfast or Derry.  How can we ensure that happens?</p></speech>

I hope they will not mind if I mention Councillor Aidan Campbell, who is from the same constituency as me.  I am delighted to have all the witnesses here this morning.  It is a milestone day for us nationally as a European country.  The witnesses could not be here on a more appropriate day to keep the Border region firmly on the agenda.</p><p>As somebody who is from Cavan-Monaghan, every day I see the positive influence from PEACE and INTERREG funding, cross-Border co-operation, and the difference that has made to towns such as Castleblayney, Clones, Belturbet and Ballyconnell which were war-torn, everybody wanted to leave and where people were afraid to live.  Thankfully, the next generation of young people will not remember that.</p><p> I am concerned following the witnesses' presentations that there is a risk of all that unravelling.  They have all mentioned the non-functioning of the Assembly in Stormont.  Brexit looms large.  Our Government is focused on Brexit, as it has to be.  That leaves the Border region in a vacuum.  Where does that leave the witnesses' organisations?  Who is flying their flag?  They are right to be here to fly the flag for a focused, co-ordinated task force that encompasses everything they are doing, with a significant focus on the Border region, on both sides of the Border, in Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Sligo, Tyrone, Armagh and Fermanagh.  There needs to be fast action because there is a risk in what has been happening since 2016 of all that good work unravelling.  We do not want to go back to times where towns and villages were almost ghost towns, which they were 20 years ago.  I am glad to have the witnesses here this morning to make the case that there is a need for urgency from the Government.  It has to come from here.  The Government has a job to do in flying the flag for the country in Europe but there has to be a focus on this.</p><p> The A5 and M3 motorway currently stop at Meath.  We need to look at such infrastructure.  Witnesses from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann attended a meeting of this committee where we talked about the fact that we have no rail line.  There seems to be a focus on the Dublin-Galway line and south of that.  We are the forgotten half of the country.  We have to bring back the focus to that area and to the need for the infrastructure about which the witnesses have talked here this morning, including the roads, rail and broadband.  As Ms Arthurs said, that will ensure the connectivity is present and that the relationship stays strong.  Following on from what my colleague has suggested, while we have a lot of information from the witnesses' presentations, what tangible measures would the witnesses like to see us, as a committee, bring forward that will benefit all of what they are doing and make sure they are on top of the agenda nationally for the Border region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anthony Soares" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018121200002#F00200"><p>I will address what can be done collectively to ensure there is a specific programme post Brexit that will address the needs of communities in the Border region, including by this committee, Government and Departments.  Ms Arthurs and other witnesses have alluded to it.  It entails listening to the people and communities of the Border region who live and work there.  I will give a specific example, which I can use as an opportunity to plug a project which is not EU-funded.  It has alternative funding from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Community Relations Council in Northern Ireland and most recently the reconciliation funds from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, for which we are very grateful.  Those funds are for a new common chapter project which is working with community groups from both sides of the Border.  They have come up with their vision of what they want for co-operation, how we go about co-operating and what kinds of issues with co-operation they would like to see addressed.  They are about to link up with community groups in Scotland, England and Wales because they are conscious not just of the North-South element but of the east-west one too.  That would fit in with the Good Friday Agreement.  If we are to respect all parts of the Good Friday Agreement in Brexit, since both the EU and UK Government have said they will protect it, it is not just about the institutions in Northern Ireland but also the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and the island of Ireland as a whole and Great Britain.  Perhaps the committee will invite members of those community groups to present their draft common chapter to this committee.  That might help.</p> <p>  With regard to the 15% that I mentioned, the Centre for Cross Border Studies, in two consultation responses to the current PEACE and INTERREG programmes, with specific reference to PEACE, noted the need to ring-fence at least 15% of that fund for cross-Border co-operation.  We were afraid that because that programme, although it is a European territorial co-operation programme, has a derogation allowing projects funded from that to be in just one jurisdiction that, for very good reasons, many of those funds would be then spent in one jurisdiction and not support cross-Border co-operation.  We are very concerned that we have ring-fencing for the part of the future PEACE PLUS programme that is a continuation of the current PEACE programme.  INTERREG is truly cross-Border and we are unfortunately talking about a future PEACE PLUS programme where the INTERREG element will have lost part of what it currently contains, which is a connection between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland in one INTERREG programme, and a connection between Wales and Ireland.  Mr. Campbell and others have referred to the lack of definition about where LEADER fits into the future of this.  Committee members can promote the voices of people in the region, support them in what they are trying to do with their vision for co-operation, and help us to pay close attention to what is coming with the future PEACE PLUS programme.  Ms Arthurs also alluded to paying close attention to the UK Government's proposed UK shared prosperity fund and the fact that it, as a replacement for EU structural funds, seems to ignore that structural funds fund cross-Border co-operation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.965" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pamela Arthurs" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018121200002#F00300"><p>If we are to be serious about assisting the Border, we have to do more.  It has to be more strategic and has to involve the Irish Government, at the highest levels, working in conjunction with Northern Ireland.  It could involve working with the Secretary of State to say that we need to be strategic and focus on the Border area.  If one looks at the INTERREG programmes, PEACE PLUS proposes &euro;250 million in total.  It is nothing for the extant needs.  There needs to be a strategic intervention.  If EU funding is taken out of cross-Border activity, no one will fund it.  There is a small amount of money from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and that is all.  It has never been taken seriously.  We have been always working against the tide with regard to cross-Border co-operation.  We have been lauded across Europe, as the Deputy said, but we have not been lauded at home and the Border corridor lags behind.  Our young people have been leaving.</p> <p>  This is perhaps an opportunity to properly focus and take a strategic approach to address the needs.  We did something similar in the past so this is not new.  The first two INTERREG programmes were centralised.  All the decisions were made in Dublin and Belfast.  People here were deciding what our needs were.  There should be a bottom-up approach to requirements.  For the INTERREG III programme, all our members said they wanted to make decisions.  We did that at local level.  We set up an action team involving Dublin and Belfast.</p><p>We had a government then.   It was from our two finance Ministers in Belfast and Dublin and relevant people along the Border who could speak for the Border.  The elected members there have a mandate and they have the only mandate in Northern Ireland at the moment.  As such, it is not reinventing the wheel.  It can be done but it needs the Governments to say at the highest levels that they recognise our worry that notwithstanding all the talk about the Border, we will be left to fend for ourselves after it is sorted in whatever way.  There is something that can be done which is tangible and will make a difference but it needs to start now.  So many businesses have closed, in particular on this side of the Border.  These are small and micro businesses including, for example, companies in the mushroom industry.  They are going now.  We need to look at this but there is no point if we do not do so on a cross-Border basis.  Cross-Border is not easy but it makes sense.</p></speech>

We see change happening and we anticipate further challenges along the way.  To that, we must add the fact that the Border region had pre-existing issues before Brexit which have yet to be addressed.  Ms Arthurs is absolutely right as are Deputies Smyth and Breathnach.  There is a need for a high-level intervention in the cross-Border region.  INTERREG, PEACE and LEADER have all been very important and we do not want to see them end.  However, they have been sticking-plaster solutions on an area and issue which is huge.  It needs that sustainable prosperity plan for once and for all.  We did not get that after the 1998 agreement and we did not see that direct delivery after peace.  We have not built on that which is why the challenges remain.  While there is a need for a task force, when we ask the Governments for it, we are told, "We need to see local leadership.  It has to be self-help and bottom-up."  We are evidence of the fact that is happening.  Our seminar later will detail the projects we are implementing.  We are taking the local initiative and doing what we can.  The national development plan prioritises support for the north-west and east Border areas.  That is brilliant.  It is good to see that happening in the Border region.  However, to make a personal pitch, those of us in the central Border region note that it does not feature to the same extent in national plans.  There must be a resolution to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.968" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018121200002#G00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions this morning.  I am very conscious in particular of the work of ICBAN in my region in Leitrim where cross-Border work has been taking place for many years.  It has had a huge impact and been very positive for many communities and various sectors, including for local authorities, health services and all of those areas which have benefitted.  I think of this from the perspective of the Border region which I know so well.  In Pettigo half of premises are boarded up.  I go right around from there to Kiltyclogher and Swanlinbar.  If one drove through Swanlinbar this morning, one would see that there is not much in it.  It is the same if one crosses the Border and goes to Kinawley.  There is not much there either.  The Border was drawn along county boundaries, which in a lot of cases meant simply a ditch or a drain somewhere.  It is not a natural border such as one finds between two countries like the massive river between France and Germany or a mountain range somewhere else.  It is a very unnatural border.  The natural thing to happen is to have it all the one.  For that reason, there has been a particular impact on the communities that live there.</p> <p>  The real problem is the sense of stagnation which Brexit has deepened.  Stagnation has been present in many parts of rural Ireland on both sides of the Border for many years, but it has been particularly the case in the Border region.  People who want to take risks and have an idea they want to bring forward face and have faced for the past number of years a lack of support from the traditional providers of finance like banks while the Government has, because of Brexit, backed away considerably.  They come to people like the witnesses but whatever help they can provide has, again, been smothered by Brexit.  That is the reality.  We have to overcome that sense of stagnation.  How do we move that forward?  How do we change that mindset?  While the funding which has come through the years has been very welcome and made a huge difference, it has never been enough.  I take Mr. Campbell's point about a sticking plaster.  It has been always just enough to manage.  Every couple of months some project was rolled out and the idea was that it looked good.  To make a seismic shift and to change gear requires a major investment and major ideas and a total change as to where we are at.</p> <p>  Until Brexit is sorted out, we will not be in a position to resolve that.  That is the reality.  Let us be honest here.  Brexit has totally destroyed the potential that was there.  The fact that the assembly in the North is not operating is certainly a huge problem.  There is no point denying or hiding from that.  It has to be sorted out.  However, both Governments, which are guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement from which all of this flows, have a responsibility to do what it takes to make that seismic shift and to change gear.  Brexit really sharpens the mind and focus as to where the problems are and what needs to be done.  We need some plan with a budget to say what will happen over five years, not 40 years, for these communities.  Four out of five young people in places like Swanlinbar and Kinawley on both sides of the Border have had to emigrate for the past 50 years.  That has been the answer to their problems and it will continue to be unless we change things.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses again and I acknowledge the presentation they intend to make later.  I do not have any questions for them really.  It is important on the day that is in it, given what is happening internationally, that we are here to look at the part of the world and the communities which will be most impacted by Brexit.  We must send a strong message from the committee that both Governments must step up to the mark with solutions.  I am guilty of it myself, but we are all talking about the problem.  Finding the solutions is difficult but we have to engage to make it happen.</p></speech>

I am sorry I am late but I was at another meeting.  The uncertainty caused by Brexit allied to the non-operation of the executive in Northern Ireland are two significant issues which the witnesses have highlighted and crystallised for us this morning.  They have given us a wake-up call on the real impact of Brexit.  However, Deputy Martin Kenny is right that until that matter is finalised, everyone is in a bit of a vacuum.  One is hazarding guesses.  While the Governments are focused on the resolution associated with Brexit, everything else will stand still.  We have a lost decade also on foot of the economic downturn that affected this island and countries across the world.  It was especially severe within this island.</p> <p>  I was aware of the INTERREG funding in the region.  I come from the midlands but a lot of the towns referred to this morning are only up the road and I could reach them within an hour.  I was struck by the point a witness made that LEADER funding may well be falling between the cracks, which is an issue that must be highlighted and grasped.  At minimum, there is a necessity to ring-fence funding for cross-Border projects.  As an agriculture spokesman, I saw the immediate impact of the Brexit vote two years ago on the mushroom industry and other parts of the sector.  It was significant and some of the farmers involved were almost wiped out.  Deputy Kenny and I were involved with a number of them and we saw the impact it had.  We have a huge export base in the mushroom industry and if one looks further afield, one of the areas about which we are worried involves cheddar cheese.  We have a huge volume of that moving across the Border.</p><p> I come from a rural area and what has resonated most with me this morning is what has been said about the impact of rural depopulation and decline.  There is an epidemic in that regard across the island.  Do the witnesses know of any specific measures that are required to deal with the rampant decline of small towns, villages and communities across the Border region?  The situation is symptomatic of what is occurring across the island.  There is a challenge with outward migration.  People are gravitating to towns.  The situation becomes self-fulfilling because big industry, such as those in the pharmaceutical or healthcare areas, gravitate towards colleges.  That is great for the towns concerned.  Dundalk has done well in that regard, which is a tremendous achievement.  That is wonderful, but given the challenge of dealing with the threats posed by Brexit, can the witnesses outline any specific policy measures or resources that are required to stem the tide?  That is important because areas are nothing without people and people will not be there unless we provide gainful employment for them as close as possible to those areas.  One cannot have an industry in every town.  It is like people arguing the case for having a small hospital in every town.  That is a nonsensical approach.  The point was made about connectivity and broadband which allow people to operate small businesses from their homes.  Such infrastructure could allow people to create two or three jobs per business and although they are small in number they are critical to the survival and sustainability of rural communities.</p></speech>

He asked a specific question about the measures that are required to halt the decline in small rural towns and villages.  Ms O'Kane has indicated that she would like to speak.  All the witnesses will have an opportunity to contribute and to summarise as we are approaching the end of the meeting.  I invite Ms O'Kane to speak first.</p></speech>

We heard today and we hear everywhere we go about the real desire to maintain cross-Border collaboration.  We now need the full commitment from the Governments and the EU.  There is a history, tradition and spirit of co-operation but a sticking plaster approach has been taken.  In the main, the co-operation has been driven by funding.  With the emergence of city deals in most of the councils in the North of Ireland and the very clear cross-Border links with the regional, spatial and economic strategies the regional assemblies are driving, somebody needs to take a step back and to say that if we work together at this level and put in funding from the Governments on both sides of the Border there could be better complementarity that would address many of the infrastructural issues that have been raised by Mr. Aidan Campbell and some members this morning.  The economic hinterlands of all of the councils in Northern Ireland extend across the Border and we all have shared objectives on economic growth.  There needs to be something at that level and the co-operation needs to be mainstreamed.  It cannot just be piecemeal.</p></speech>

I agree with many of the points made by members this morning.  We were asked what needs to be done to address rural depopulation.  As Deputy Penrose indicated, connectivity is crucial to halt rural depopulation.  Investment is required in road infrastructure, broadband and the type of connectivity that allows businesses to develop and thrive.  The M1, which is close to me previously stopped in Dungannon and was extended as a dual carriageway to the Ballygawley roundabout, which is about 20 miles of roadway.  The villages and businesses within a 15 mile radius of the road have increased in the past 15 to 20 years because they are more attractive as commuter towns for people working in Portadown, Craigavon and in the city.  Opening up rural communities to an opportunity to connect is crucial.  The businesses in those areas have grown.  The promotion of and investment in connectivity is most important.</p> <p>  One specific thing the committee could do in the context of the LEADER programme is to write to officials in the Department, or even to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, in Westminster to ask about their future plans for a rural development programme.  We do not have an equivalent committee currently in the North.  As a neighbouring jurisdiction, Ireland has an interest in terms of development co-operation.  The rural development programme in the Republic will go through change as the Common Agricultural Policy changes.  It would be a practical step to ask what the plans are for rural development post Brexit.</p></speech>

Brexit is affecting every sector.  If we are serious about the Border, the Government must look at the 11 local authorities along the Border as they have the political mandate to take a strategic approach and come up with their priorities in terms of what interventions are required.</p> <p>  A major company that is based in Newry is First Derivatives.  It has 1,000 employees.  It was set up by a local indigenous business man who had faith in the Border area.  He could have taken that business anywhere.  It has offices across the world.  Local people are prepared to invest in their local communities.  The Government could recognise their work along the Border.  First Derivatives has not received any funding.  Perhaps it did not need it, but there might be other entrepreneurial individuals along the Border who would stay in the region if there was some incentive to do so.  We must be serious about the issue.  Looking at one sector or taking a piecemeal approach has not worked.  The local authorities are there and they are ready to step up to the mark to say what they require.  There will be competing interests, but that is the same everywhere and we are big enough to work out where the priorities are.  Mr. Shane Campbell identified the Irish Central Border area as having problems with connectivity and the situation is better in the East Border Region in that regard.  The requirements are different and we will compete with each other but at the end of the day the common view is the same in terms of promoting cross-Border economic development, as that benefits the people of the Border region and will hopefully keep our young people there.  We will not succeed if we continue to take a sticking plaster approach.</p></speech>

Regardless of what happens, there is a pre-existing problem that we must recognise and deal with.</p></speech>

It is about giving them the tools and the opportunities.  Broadband is critical in terms of how it can open up rural life.  The delivery of the national broadband plan has to be key.  We cannot afford to sit on it for another six years.  Otherwise, Ireland will lose its place.  It is the same North of the Border and the opportunities there for the delivery of those schemes.  It is not too late to look at something between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  If the national broadband plan cannot be delivered or advanced, a new solution must be found to give people opportunities because that is where the future is going.  The 21st century has taken us into new areas of technology and creativity.  There are things people can do on a small device and they need the means and opportunity to be able to deliver on that.</p> <p>  I advocate for a strategic support for the Border region but that must come from the Government.  The committee could use its influence to help promote that agenda.</p><p>We are providing the local leadership that has to be a key part of the delivery, as Ms Arthurs has detailed.  Organisations like NILGA and those represented by Mr. Aidan Campbell, Dr. Soares and myself constitute a consortium of cross-Border interests, local authorities and communities.  We are all passionate about our areas.  We want to do something for those areas.  We are not asking the Government to do everything.  We are asking the Government to help us by giving us a leg-up.  We will certainly do our bit.</p></speech>

In 2014, we published a draft solidarity charter for the economic revitalisation of the Irish Border development corridor.  Much of the work that is needed has been already done.  The Border region needs to be examined strategically.  It is not just about the negatives - it is also about the potential that exists, which cannot be grasped unless people are given the tools they need.  I refer to tools like transport and infrastructure connectivity and links between policy makers on either side of the Border.  As Deputy Martin Kenny has said, the UK Government needs to step up to the plate as the co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  We do not have an Assembly or an Executive.  The cross-Border networks, which are led by local authorities, are evidence of the willingness in Northern Ireland to engage with the opportunities presented by policies being developed on the other side of the Border.  Those networks have to be given the tools and the freedom they need.  In the absence of an Executive or an Assembly, the UK Government has to step up to the mark as co-guarantor of strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement, as well as strands 1 and 3.</p></speech>

The problem in the past is that it has been bitty.  I often think it is almost like research and development is the buzzword nowadays.  We have an awful lot of research.  Many organisations, including those represented at today's meeting, have come up with methods to resolve issues and sort stuff out.  I suggest that such efforts almost need to be commercialised.  There is a need for deep pockets and access to resources if someone is to take on this and drive it forward.  We have the ideas to solve much of this stuff, but the problem arises in bringing those solutions to a level where they will have an impact.  Brexit has sharpened the focus on the piece that is missing in this regard.  Perhaps it has created an opportunity for us to see this for what it is.  Rather than continuing to muddle along as we were doing, we now know what the problem is.  We need to work with the witnesses to come up with a plan.  Those of us who have met people on the ground in the Border region can tell the two Governments that we understand what the problems are and that we know there are solutions.  Resources are needed to solve the problems in question.  Both Governments have an opportunity to move this to a different place. The leadership that is provided by the local authorities, particularly through the organisations represented at today's meeting, will be vital as we seek to make all of these things happen.</p></speech>

To assist us today, I am pleased to welcome: from the National Museum of Ireland, Ms Lynn Scarff, director, and Ms Maeve Sikora; from the Local Authority Museums Network, Mr. Liam Bradley and Ms Judith McCarthy; from the Irish Museums Association, Mr. William Blair and Ms Gina O'Kelly; and from the Heritage Council, Mr. Michael Starrett and Ms Beatrice Kelly.  I thank the witnesses for being here.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any opening statements made to the committee may be published on its website after this meeting.

I am the curator of Monaghan County Museum and the chair of the Local Authority Museums Network.  Ms Judith McCarthy, curator of Donegal County Museum and deputy chair of the network is with me today.</p> <p>  The Local Authority Museums Network, LAMN, represents the 12 local authority museums across the State which all play a vital role in the social, cultural and economic life of Ireland&rsquo;s regions.  The LAMN&rsquo;s membership currently comprises of Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Louth, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Limerick, Monaghan, Tipperary and Waterford.  We are a national professional network of collections based designated cultural institutions that advocate for and promote the diverse archaeological and historical richness of our museums for the enjoyment and engagement of the communities we serve.</p> <p>  Members of the LAMN strive to be at the heart of those communities.  During the recent Ireland 2016 commemorative programme, the LAMN worked with its partners in local government including heritage, libraries, arts and archives, to successfully facilitate a national discussion through a diverse programme of exhibitions and events about not only what the Rising was and when it happened but most importantly, why it happened and who were the people from their own localities who were involved.  In tandem with this, we also explored the story of World War One and the thousands of Irish men who fought and died in the British army as well as the many Irish women who served in the nursing corps.  This work will continue throughout the remainder of the decade of commemorations and into the future.</p> <p>  The LAMN recently hosted a major conference, held in Louth County Museum, Dundalk, entitled "Do Borders Matter? The Role of Museums and Heritage in Crossing the Line".  This event, which was jointly supported by the Heritage Council and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade investigated the challenges that Brexit will present to the entire cultural sector.  We are continually working with our partners in Northern Ireland to plan and prepare for the challenges and opportunities that a UK outside of Europe will bring.  It is the strength of our respective collections that help us as local authority organisations to cross borders, both figurative and literal, and bring together communities through a common interest, their shared history and heritage.</p> <p>  Collectively the local authority museums serve a population of more than 2 million people, attracting more than half a million direct visitors each year with a far reaching impact in schools, communities and voluntary organisations across the country.  We also play a significant role as engines of local and regional tourism, working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to support the cultural identity and image of Ireland to overseas visitors.  Through this work, the local authority museums have helped to instil a sense of local pride of place.  We have been in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills as we prepare for the requirements of the new junior certificate history cycle as well as advocating for the reinstatement of history as a core subject on the curriculum.</p> <p>  The LAMN plays a vital role in preserving the archaeological heritage of the country as well.  The members of the LAMN are designated museums under section 19 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, and section 68(2) of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997.  Under this legislation, each museum is legally entitled to retain archaeological objects on behalf of the State, which are deemed to be of predominantly local rather than national interest.  We also liaise on an ongoing basis with the National Monuments Service to ensure the ongoing preservation of archaeological sites and monuments in our regions.</p> <p>  The members of the LAMN strive to achieve best standards across all areas of museum work.  The museum standards programme for Ireland, MSPI, operates under the auspices of the Heritage Council and sets out to raise standards of care across Irish museums and galleries.  The programme aims to benchmark and promote professional standards in collections care and to recognise the achievement of those standards within the Irish museum sector.  The LAMN cares for diverse collections of thousands of artefacts and all of our members are involved in the MSPI.</p> <p>  Creative Ireland has become one of the key drivers of creativity in Ireland and through our various local authorities we are actively involved in the committees which are managing this national initiative at the local level.</p> <p>  As we look to the future, we advocate for a review in current national funding for regional museums.  Rather than small directed amounts for once off projects, a larger fund which encouraged partnership with other organisations both regional and national and the further use of new technologies would benefit a much greater sector of society.  Along with the National Museum of Ireland, we are also investigating the possibility of making representation to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to review the current fund available under the mobility of collections scheme, which provides aid for regional museums wishing to take objects on loan from one of the major national cultural institutions.</p> <p>  We are 12 local authority museums in the State, the first opening in 1974 and the latest in 2012.  We hope in years to come to see that number grow.  We will be investigating how we can progress this and a number of other objectives through 2019 as we consult with a wide range of organisations including the Heritage Council, the Irish Museums Association and the National Museum of Ireland to develop our new strategic plan.</p> <p>  Local authority museums also support the many smaller community run and privately owned museums in their areas.  This greater network of museums, working together, helps to preserve the history and heritage which exists between the lines in history books, those unknown people, places and events, which have shaped the history, heritage and culture of our villages, towns and cities.</p> <p>  The key strength of regional museums is that we are a safe space where people from different economic, social, cultural and religious backgrounds can come together in their own communities and using our collections as a catalyst, investigate their own history and heritage and that of their neighbours.  By doing this, we are not only looking at yesterday but today and tomorrow as well, when we help new communities to integrate into Irish society and aid them to interweave their stories and beliefs into the cultural tapestry of the country.</p></speech>

To give some context, the National Museum of Ireland is Ireland&rsquo;s largest national cultural institution with four public sites &ndash; three in Dublin, the Natural History Museum, the Museum of Archaeology and the Museum of Decorative Arts and History and one in Castlebar, County Mayo, the Museum of Country Life.</p><p>The National Museum of Ireland, NMI, additionally manages a 20,000 m sq. Collections Resource Centre in Swords, which houses our collection ensuring it is available for research and scholarship.  NMI collects, conserves and interprets the largest holdings of portable heritage in Ireland - more than 4 million artefacts and specimens - and welcomes more than one million visitors per annum.  Visitor numbers have doubled since 2004 and continue to grow despite a significant reduction of 40% in budget between 2004 and 2016.  A &euro;1.42 million increase in budget allocation over 2017 and 2018 has initiated the process of readdressing this prolonged period of deficit.  We welcome the continued focus of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan, to increasing funding in arts, culture and heritage sector and, equally, the opportunity to engage with committee members today on this aspect of the museum's work, which is very important. <br/><br/>Under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014, the National Museum of Ireland is the State's repository for archaeological objects and cares for them on behalf of the State.  There are currently 168 staff employed across all of our sites.  NMI has a national remit to work with the 12 local authority museums that are designated as places of deposit for archaeological objects of local importance.  This is supported through an assigned designated local museum liaison, our head keeper of the Irish antiquities division, Maeve Sikora, who accompanies me today.<br/><br/>I will now provide some insight into the types of collaborations we have with local and regional museums.  We have a rich and dynamic relationship with the network of regional and local museums, upon which we are eager to build.  This is an opportune time to present to the joint Oireachtas committee as our recently published Master Vision reinforces the museum's commitment to local and regional museums stating as a key objective, &quot;The proactive development of regional partnerships to deliver a truly national service.&quot;  Collaboration is a core value of the NMI and it is supported at a strategic level by the NMI board.  Collaborations with local and regional museums through collections loans, exhibitions, education and outreach programmes are a priority and crucial to achieving our ambition of a truly national service.  The key areas underpinning these collaborations include a legislative role, which falls under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, whereby the director of the National Museum of Ireland can designate a museum as a place of deposit for archaeological objects of local importance.  All archaeological objects found that have no known owner are State property and finders are obliged to report their discoveries to the National Museum or to a designated museum.  The National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 additionally outlines the manner in which the NMI facilitates collection loans and enables the director of the NMI to place an object in the care of a designated museum.<br/><br/><b></b>Beyond the legislative role there is significant activity across collections and operations.  The National Museum of Ireland facilitates loan requests to local and regional museums from the national collection, permanent and temporary.  Attached to my opening statement there is an Appendix which lists some of the loans distributed across the museum network.  The museum also provides advice, support and collaboration on issues of conservation, security, collection management and care, exhibition and interpretation at an individual level and, crucially, through regular network meetings with the local museums network group.  We also programme events and outreach.  We facilitate talks, lectures and research by key staff members across local and regional museums.  There are numerous benefits to the this relationship across all parties involved.  The network of local and regional museums and the NMI's collaboration with same is critically important to the delivery of the vision of the NMI.  Over the years, staff of the NMI have been heavily involved in the setting up of local authority museums.  It is through these relationships, at institutional, network and individual levels, that the NMI can ensure the national collection reaches a wider audience, that local and regional communities are informed of the statutory role of the NMI in relation to archaeological finds, that NMI is enabled to connect more with a wider audience enabling their participation and feedback on our programme and that we grow awareness of the richness and importance of Ireland's cultural heritage. <br/><br/>The establishment of the museums standards programme for Ireland, MSPI, which is managed by our colleagues in the Heritage Council is a crucially important step in enabling best practice standards across museums in Ireland.  While advocating for these standards across the sector and the resources required to support them, the NMI is itself in the process of MSPI accreditation.  It is important to emphasise that our relationship also brings invaluable professional support to NMI and the local authority museums network, LAMN.  For example, many members will be aware of the recent Tullydonnell Hoard find this summer in Donegal, which involved a rapid and close collaboration between the NMI team and Donegal County Museum.  In many ways, it is an excellent example of the importance of these trusted and professional relationships and the reason it is important to grow and cherish these networks.  There will be an exhibition of the Tullydonnell Hoard in Donegal County Museum, hopefully, in autumn 2019.  It is through the network and these relationships that this function is carried out.<br/><br/>Some examples of activity over the last 12 months include the Cloosmore medieval ring brooch on temporary loan to M&uacute;saem Chorca Dhuibhne 2018; the temporary loan of objects related to policing in Ireland to Monaghan County Museum 2017-2018; 13 Viking objects from recent excavations at Beamish &amp;amp; Crawford site at Cork Public Museum 2018; the collection of High Crosses on loan to St Mary&rsquo;s Medieval Mile Museum, Kilkenny and, by way of example of our educational programmes, the delivery of local archive and heritage projects through the iCAN project, which is a local archive project supported by the National Museum of Ireland and Galway County Council, supported by Creative Ireland.  Other examples of temporary loans include the de Burgo-O&rsquo;Malley Chalice to St Patrick&rsquo;s Church in Newport for its centenary celebrations in September 2018. <br/><br/>There are some challenges and we have made key learnings along the way.  Timelines can present an issue.  The NMI is significantly under resourced across its curatorial and conservation departments.  We have six full-time members of staff in conservation and five full-time curators in our antiquities department.  These staff, along with our registration department, are crucial to the process in terms of loans.  We currently require a minimum notice period of 12 months for loans.  This is to allow us to fulfil the significant amount of practice from a selection, condition checking, conservation, recording and mount making-design point of view and also to complete the administrative paperwork that is required for a collection loan.  We understand that this timescale can present a problem for local museums who may not have clarity on budgets within the prerequisite time of a 12 month timeframe and this is something we wish to work on more.<br/><br/>From a resource perspective, the safeguarding of the objects in the care of the National Museum of Ireland is the key responsibility of collections staff.  Low staffing levels, particularly within our conservation and curatorial departments, can create a bottleneck. However, the availability of increased budget to facilitate a collection loan from conservation costs to security costs would be a way to address this difficult problem.  In regard to the types of artefacts requested, there is a public expectation that a number of the significant objects of the national collection will be on permanent display in the National Museum of Ireland.  Some examples include the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Broighter Hoard and our internationally renowned bog bodies.  Considering the visitor numbers and the level of expectation for displays at the National Museum, it is generally the policy that objects that are on permanent exhibition are seldom placed on an outward loan.  In these cases - this is the crucial element of the relationship with the local museums and special interest groups - NMI seeks to provide a talk, lecture or event on the object in local area. For example, as part of the 150 year anniversary of the Ardagh Chalice, our former director, Raghnall &Oacute; Floinn, delivered a lecture in Ardagh to mark the occasion.  We do receive ongoing requests.  A notable exception of a short term loan is the Derrynaflan Hoard to Tipperary County Museum.<br/><br/>Having recently had a number of discussions with our colleagues in the local and regional museums we have identified some areas as potential opportunities and enablers of greater collaboration in our network.  Increased communication is critical.  Regular communication between the National Museum of Ireland and the Local Area Museums Network, particularly at the level of director and the management team, is critical.Mr. Bradley mentioned the joint strategic plan.  This joint thinking around strategic planning and partnership at an early stage enables us to ensure it is factored into annual business plans and, crucially, budgets.  Investigation and delivery of joint initiatives and events, including co-curated exhibitions, education and event programmes, as well as early consultation on potential travelling exhibitions, means we can directly link in with national and local community interests and concerns.</p><p>As mentioned by Mr. Bradley, the investigation of opportunities that may increase the mobility grant or similar grants and ensure there is a greater resource available to enable the costly process of collection loans would have a significant impact.</p><p> As outlined in the appendices provided to the committee, there is a strong collaborative relationship and significant activity between the NMI and the network of local and regional museums.  We will continue to drive and support that relationship.  An increase in staff and budgets across institutions would enable greater and more strategic activity.  However, the strength of these relationships is primarily driven by the commitment of those here today, the dedication of the staff involved and continued open and regular communication.</p></speech>

In my capacity as chair of the Irish Museums Association, IMA, it is a pleasure and a privilege to address the committee on behalf of the sector.  I am accompanied by Ms Gina O&rsquo;Kelly, the IMA&rsquo;s director of operations.  My day job is director of collections with National Museums Northern Ireland, which incorporates the Ulster Museum, the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and the Ulster American Folk Park.<br/><br/>Many present will be familiar with the work of the Irish Museums Association, but I will briefly introduce the context for this presentation.  An all-island organisation, the IMA is dedicated to the development of the museum sector.  We provide a platform for museum professionals on both sides of the Border to work together with the aim of gathering and sharing expertise, promoting standards of excellence, encouraging collaborative practice, identifying areas of concern and opportunities for the museum community and advocating the valuable contribution of museums to our society.  Most importantly, we provide a collective voice for the museum sector through our 12-member board of directors and more than 300 members who represent the wide breadth of museums, ranging from small, community-led voluntary organisations to national cultural institutions.  We also work in partnership with many collection-based organisations - many but not all from the cultural heritage sector - to provide a programme that advises on, encourages and supports long-term sustainable care and interpretation of our cultural heritage in line with the Heritage Council's museums standards programme for Ireland and the Northern Ireland Museums Council accreditation scheme in the UK.  We provide continued professional development and networking opportunities, advocate for museums on a national and international level and carry out valuable research.<br/><br/>Although the IMA is there to support museums, we are not about maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  We also challenge and lead conversations about how museums need to change to be more relevant and engage more people.  Building stronger networks should be part of this forward momentum of change.  It is about building a stronger and more coherent and sustainable sector.<br/><br/>Constructive partnerships are at the heart of museum practice.  By pooling resources through the sharing of skills and expertise, museums have been able to deliver strategic value and provide enriched programmes and visitor experiences.  This was never more evident than during this decade of commemorations, which continues to involve great pride and buy-in at a grassroots level and in which regional and rural museums have had a key leadership role.  Not only are they critically interpreting their histories through their collections and providing further contextual understanding of the events surrounding this decade, they are also enabling access to expertise, research and education.  They are enhancing opportunities for public engagement and highlighting aspects within museum practice often overlooked by the public.<br/><br/>Cross-Border collaborations in museums have had a major impact in terms of celebrating diversity and exploring our shared histories by providing safe spaces to discuss and explore contested narratives.  The IMA's recent &quot;Bridge over Brexit&quot; research with Ulster University highlighted the value of an extended and diverse museum network.  It facilitates diverse conversations and supports and assesses existing relationships and initiatives within the museum sector.  It explores the potential implications and lines of communication to prepare for the changes ahead and advocates the role of the museum and the broader cultural sector in fostering relationships between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland though the expertise of museums, the leadership and world-leading research of which across a range of core themes will be vital to the Brexit discussion.  It is in this context we wish to take this opportunity to highlight the landscape in which many of our members from regional and rural museums work.<br/><br/>There are approximately 178 museums in Ireland, of which 141 have a regional or rural remit.  Many work in isolation and without the supports available to those in urban environments.  With the loss of the museum officer role within the Heritage Council, volunteer and community-led museums increasingly look to the IMA for guidance.  Cognisant of the limited capacity under which we function, we do this towards the goal of the museum sector working together as a whole.  Facilitating links between our national and regional cultural institutions and grassroots museums is key to how we work, particularly in terms of supporting the increasingly divergent roles the contemporary museum is expected to play in our society.<br/><br/>In 2016, we published a survey of museums in Ireland carried out in collaboration with University College Dublin.  The first iteration of its kind in over a decade, the findings highlighted that major strides had been taken to improve the services provided by our museums to the communities they serve, particularly in the areas of education and access.  However, it also highlighted the opportunity for enhanced support of community and independent museums, including a review of funding initiatives and the development of a national strategy regarding the specific needs of regional and rural museums.  This would recognise the key role they play in developing a local sense of identity and community, promoting social cohesion and inclusivity, their contribution to well-being, life-long learning and their contribution to rural development and tourism.<br/><br/>Museums are safe spaces to explore and discuss what really matters and where we are going.  At their best, museums are a place to celebrate diversity and to explore our shared history. The value of an extended and diverse museum network is that it helps to facilitate diverse and important conversations across the island as a whole.<br/><br/>I wish to conclude by commending on the importance accorded to our cultural heritage in recent Government and agency strategies and plans, including Heritage 2030, Culture 2025, Creative Ireland and Project Ireland 2040.  I thank the committee for inviting us to be here today. The Irish Museums Association looks forward to working with the Government to continue to enable a fluid dialogue around museum practice in the coming years.</p></speech>

Ms Kelly will deliver the bulk of our presentation.  This is the third occasion in recent times that such interest has been shown by the committee in the work of the Heritage Council on behalf of the sector.  I very much welcome that interest and hope it will continue in the years to come.  When Ms Kelly and I previously appeared before the committee we specifically addressed natural heritage.  More recently, I addressed the committee on the council's new strategic plan, Heritage at the Heart.  On that occasion I was accompanied by Marie Bourke, a member of our board who is again present today.  In that plan, the Heritage Council emphasises a broad view of heritage.  The section entitled "Why Heritage Counts" makes very clear that heritage is the foundation of culture and the steady pulse of contemporary Ireland.  It encompasses not only narrow definitions such as buildings, monuments and museum pieces, but also the distinctive landscapes, native wildlife, woodlands, literature, folklore and crafts, all elements which we touched on previously with the committee.</p> <p>  Tangible and intangible, personal and collective, heritage is at the heart of Irish society.  Ms Kelly will make that clear in terms of the work we do in support of the museum standards programme.</p><p>I ask Ms Kelly to pick up that thread.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1001" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Beatrice Kelly" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the museums standards programme for Ireland.  As members have gathered, it is an initiative of An Chomhairle Oidhreachta and the overarching aim is to support museums, including galleries, in telling their stories and caring for their collections through a targeted training programme and an accreditation scheme.</p> <p>  It is a voluntary scheme and there are currently 64 sites taking part in the programme.  We started with about 14 in 2007.  These range from small voluntary museums in rural areas to national institutions here in Dublin.  There is no regulatory basis or national policy for museums in general in Ireland.  We have legislation for national institutions but not for museums.  This voluntary and supportive approach taken by the MSPI is a bottom up, demand-led initiative which allows the application of international standards to museums of all types across Ireland.  We have participants from Allihies Copper Mine Museum to the National Gallery of Ireland and into Northern Ireland with the Museum of Free Derry.</p> <p>  The standards programme has resulted in much higher standards of collection care, visitor services and more robust museum management across all participating museums and in turn this has spurred others to want to join in.  These sites received more than 6.5 million visits in 2018, at a conservative estimate using published figures from F&aacute;ilte Ireland as well as the participants so it is a sizable number.</p> <p>  I mention what the programme actually does for the museums and collections.  Joining the programme has allowed a lot of the smaller and community based museums in particular, to take part in a network of their peers, to receive mentoring and free training - the Heritage Council covers the costs - and to raise professional standards in the services they offer to their visitors and the care of their collections.  As museums become accredited they in turn become mentors to their local area or to their area of interest.  For example, Muckross House has been mentoring Allihies Copper Mine Museum on some of its paper based collection, Knock Folk Museum in Mayo has mentored the Michael Davitt Museum on a number of aspects and Tipperary County Museum has been mentoring Athy Heritage Centre and Museum so there is a great criss-crossing taking place.</p> <p>  In the past ten years, the council itself has put on more than 70 training workshops, giving institutions access to workshops free of charge on subjects relating to collection care, education, exhibition, museum governance and management and visitor services.  In addition, the council offers bursaries to museum staff and volunteers to take part by distance learning in the University of Ulster&rsquo;s postgraduate diploma in museum practice.  This benefits those in remote areas in particular and we have had participants in this from M&uacute;saem Chorca Dhuibhne, from Allihies Copper Mine Museum and Athy Heritage Centre and Museum as well as others.</p> <p>  In the past two years, the Heritage Council was in the position to offer a grant scheme, totalling about &euro;45,000 aimed at collection care within the museum standards programme institutions.  These grants allowed institutions to carry out specific conservation work on specific objects or to improve display or storage facilities.  Sadly, we are not certain at the time of writing or speaking whether the council will be in a position to continue this next year.</p> <p>  As a result of the standards programme, there are now hubs of museums expertise throughout the country.  The levels of visitor service, interpretation and collection care have been raised beyond recognition.  This work has been achieved by a single co-ordinator for the programme, Ms Leslie Ann Hayden who is with us today, helped by an advisory group, a panel of assessors and the oversight of the Heritage Council itself.  The annual running costs are in the region of &euro;115,000 per annum.  This level of funding has been maintained by the council despite the financial crisis in 2008 and the knock on effects on our annual budget.  The council has invested in the region of &euro;1,265,000 into this programme since 2008.</p> <p>  There are constraints.  The ability to recruit more participants is limited by the small budgetary resources of the council and the programme is at capacity.  Additional funding would allow the council to cope with a higher number of participants.  For example, an additional person to work alongside the programme co-ordinator would facilitate a public call for new entrants and would potentially allow the doubling of the annual intake of new institutions, which currently stands at only two per annum.  The post of museums and archives officer at the council has been vacant for more than six years.  This vacancy also limits our capacity to provide a public service in this area.  Should sanction be given for this post to be filled, a wider range of advisory services could be provided to local and regional museums in particular, including those which are not currently in the programme.</p> <p>  The programme has had a significant impact in strengthening museums, particularly local and regional museums and in improving visitor experiences.  The council would like to extend the MSPI to more museums across the country, while also supporting institutions which are not yet in a position to do so.  We require additional resources to do so.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure and a privilege to hear about their work and to listen to their belief in what they do, and I believe in what they do.  I was at the European Parliament with my colleague about a month ago for the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 and it was interesting to hear about the number of countries where their wonderful heritage and religious sites are being desecrated.  In one country it was mentioned that such a site had been turned into a supermarket without the knowledge of the people.  When coming away I felt we had a better sense of preservation and at least we had a conversation about it.  I agree with Ms Kelly and Mr. Starrett that the arts, culture and heritage play such an enormous role in who and what we are, and they are above politics.  The theatre is the one place the truth can be found out and it is also the one place within the arts, culture and heritage in which the truth can be explained and highlighted in a way that is beautiful, balanced, majestic and artistic.  Sometimes people around here think there are no votes in the arts and that this is the wrong committee to be on, but it is the right committee to be on because the arts is the greatest sense of expression of the self.</p> <p>  I was interested in what the witnesses said about North-South in terms of the arts and culture. We should consider what people such as Seamus Heaney did for culture and language North and South.  People like James Clarence Mangan, Thomas Moore or any of the great artists from North or South or Palestine and the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra never thought of who and what they were, they just thought of the arts, culture and heritage.</p> <p>  What does the Local Authority Museums Network think of the National Museum of Ireland?  The witnesses from the Local Authority Museums Network looked awfully sad up there.  Does the Local Authority Museums Network have issues it would like the National Museum of Ireland to address or get involved in?  Will the witnesses from the Local Authority Museums Network mention one or two things it would like to do together with the National Museum of Ireland or that they are doing together?</p> <p>  Everything is now under the canopy of "culture" and that term has to be used.  Can the National Museum of Ireland tell me what the Government and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is doing or not doing to help it?  I do not mean this question in an accusative way but what are gaps the National Museum of Ireland would like to see filled?  In the Heritage Council, one of the gaps is the issue of a vacancy it has not been able to fill.</p> <p>  Will somebody tell me why the wonderful Michael Davitt Museum in Straide is not open?  We talk about that every time I pass by.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses talk about the lack of legislation generally within the museum structures?  Sometimes I feel the museums are better off without it and that they should get on with it themselves because their rapport is excellent.</p> <p>  Please feel free to answer me generally.  It is important for us to hear about the museums' great work and we are really a conduit to where the power is.  Do not leave without telling us what is needed or where the gaps are.  There were many speeches but I need to know what we can do to highlight these issues for the museums, the route we need to go down to help them get what they feel is necessary and then we might be listened to.  I also refer to the co-operation and synergy between the museums even though I hate the word synergy.</p></speech>

I am involved in museums because of the many tours of the National Museum of Ireland on which I was taken.  It always seemed to me that this monolith was a place to be revered and respected, and it is.  As mentioned by Ms Scarff, there are strong personal connections and relationships between the national and local museums such that it is not Monaghan County Museum or Donegal County Museum contacting the National Museum of Ireland but Liam or Judith contacting Lynn or Maeve.  This is key.  The museum sector in Ireland is small and we all tend to know each other well, which is a positive in helping to break down the barrier of a large national collection.</p> <p>  The LAMN relationship with the National Museum has grown in recent years.  As a network, we were not focused enough on reaching out to other national institutions.  We were doing it individually but not as a network.  We have done a lot of work in recent years and more recently with Ms Scarff and Ms Sikora in developing that relationship.  Where we are now is a lot more healthy.  We are definitely in a stronger place strategically as well on both sides of the island.  We look forward to having a much bigger relationship which does not just involve us seeking or returning loans.</p> <p>  On what we are doing together, we are looking at a Famine project as potential work for the next couple of years, in respect of which there is a huge story to tell nationally and regionally.  We have discussed the idea but funding may be an issue.  The will exists to do work in this area.  We believe the national and regional story in this regard is important.  The mobility grant was mentioned.  It is important, if we are to progress the move of objects from the National Museum to regional museums, that the mobility project is reviewed.  It is a costly process.  As mentioned by Ms Scarff, planning is a challenge for local authority museums.  As our resources are limited, we tend to plan on the basis of a year to a year and a half.  In light of the lead-in for loan requests, it can be challenging to get in on time and to address issues around availability and conservation.  The mobility grant is key.  We need more to do more.</p> <p>  On the new strategy, the master plan for the National Museum is finished.  We are coming to the end of our current strategy and we will be reviewing the next one.  The strong relationship we enjoy with the National Museum and the other national cultural institutions means we look forward to a more combined approach as we go forward.</p></speech>

The Senator will note from the discussion thus far that there is a significant amount of resource involved in collections loans, delivering programmes, and developing educational events or temporary exhibitions.  We need the resources and budget to increase our staff, especially at conservation and curatorial levels and to enable us to bring in expertise.  From the point of view of the Local Authority Museums Network, LAMN, appendix 2, attached to the opening statement, sets out the level of engagement of NMI staff throughout the country from the point of view of archaeological digs and engagement with people.  This type of interaction takes time.  It is a very small team delivering on a legislative role, which is also required to deliver on the role of a national museum.  I acknowledge that there has been growth in the past two years but we need more and we need it to be sustainable.  Also, many of us are hampered by year-to-year budgets.  The ability to plan strategically on a 12 month cycle is difficult.  The commitment of Project Ireland 2040 on the capital side, in terms of the opportunities it will provide, has been a very interesting experience for the National Museum.  There is great opportunity to consider what those kinds of commitments might look like if stretched beyond a year.  This would allow organisations such as the Local Authority Museums Network, the National Museum of Ireland and the Heritage Council to plan at a scale that perhaps we have not been able to in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1008" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Starrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#F00500"><p>I will ask Ms Kelly to pick up on the specifics of the questions.  It is important to hear two directors of cultural institutions say the same thing.  I agree with Ms Scarff that it has become very difficult to get a commitment to invest in people.  Ms Kelly referred earlier to the vacancy in the Heritage Council.  Investment in people has been very stringent in a number of sectors, perhaps for good reasons.  It has had a very detrimental effect in this sector.  Often recruitment will be sanctioned but will be no funds to pay additional staff.  There is a real issue for members and Departments to overcome.  We need money to invest in the fabric of our society.  Getting revenue funding to invest in people, educational programmes and the non-building fabric of this country remains difficult.  In terms of how the committee can help, it could work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance to realise that investing in people is not costly in the long run.  It brings benefits.</p> <p>  Ms Kelly mentioned that the council may not be able to run a grants programme.  The board still has not finalised its budget for next year.  This relates to a number of issues.  From the Heritage Council's funding point of view, as referenced on the previous occasion we met the committee, since the crash and the 65% cut in its funding, the council has been dependent on receipt of money mid-year from the environment fund.  Other heritage services are also dependent on that fund which is made up of the plastic bag tax.  That funding has been diminishing and, as a result, we are supporting fewer meaningful programmes.  This year we had anticipated a &euro;750,000 allocation from the fund, which is approximately half what we got ten years ago, but I understand we are now to receive only &euro;150,000.  This shortfall has implications for the council in 2019 as well.  This reliance on the environment fund for heritage services funding mid-year by not only the Heritage Council but the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Monuments Service needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

My first question is to Ms Scarff.  My boyfriend passed on to me an article from last weekend's <i>Financial Times</i>.  It states: &quot;As collections cannot be dissociated from the historic crime of colonialism, whether actually looted or not, there is just one appropriate course of action, the authors insist: restitution, the return of works to their rightful owners.&quot;  This is very much an issue for our local networks as well.  The repatriation of what can be identified as stolen treasures or loot can only begin with the national conversation and with the national display of those collections.  Ms Scarff said that the National Museum of Ireland is a State repository.</p><p>Should we be a repository of collections associated with colonialism and which will always be the heritage of indigenous people around the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1013" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Scarff" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#G00200"><p>The article in the <i>Financial Times</i>was very interesting.  I read it myself at the weekend.  In his statement of nearly two weeks ago, President Macron was speaking in particular about French collections in relation to Africa and their return.  There is a great deal of conversation right now among museums.  We recently had a conference in Belfast with colleagues in the Museums Association and there was conversation on this topic there.  Repatriation is a constant conversation that is happening within museums and the cultural sector.  It is a very current conversation.  The National Museum of Ireland&rsquo;s ethnographical collection is comprised of 11,000 objects which were mainly acquired between 1760 and 1914.  For the most part, the collection reflects Irish exploration of the world around that time.  What is interesting for the museum is that we are coming to the final stages of a publication on that collection.  What is particularly interesting around the question of repatriation is the extent to which the wider community is aware of what a museum holds in its collection, in particular in relation to ethnographic material.  As such, publications like this and the digitisation of the collections is crucial.  While this is not a collection or area the National Museum currently collects in, it is a collection from our past and it is our responsibility to conserve and look after it.<br/><br/>The repatriation of those objects is an ongoing debate and discussion, and the return of that property and the response to that is usually dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Usually, that is from one cultural sector, generally museum to museum.  For example, the National Museum permanently repatriated two toi moko tattooed Maori heads to New Zealand in 1990 and entered into conversations on the collection that remained here.  I emphasise that there is a criticality in ensuring that information is out there and is accessible and that we are open to conversations and ongoing discussion around it.  We also loan many items from the collection on a permanent or temporary basis.  A loan of three artefacts is currently at the Royal Academy in London as part of an Oceania exhibition.  We have loaned a whaler's hat and a bentwood visor to the Anchorage Museum and we have made another loan to the Vancouver Art Gallery.  It is something we are very engaged in and it is an important conversation to have.  The National Museum of Ireland has a role to play in that conversation.<br/><br/>On the way here, I met Ms Maeve Sikora, Keeper of Irish Antiquities, whose office is beside an exhibition we are holding currently on Roger Casement.  The collection is the collection he assembled during his travels, in particular in Peru and around South America.  It has been a wonderful opportunity for us to tell the story of this individual and his work to tell of the plight of people at that time.  One has to think about the nuances of this conversation and how these objects, depending on where they are, can offer opportunities for cultural dialogue and new research projects.  On the Senator's point, it is crucial that communication happens and is open.  As such, publication and more resources to digitise those collections, care for them and get that message out are important.</p></speech>

On storage, the 2040 plan has been mentioned a lot.  Is there space within the plan for a national storage site or where are we at with Swords?  That question is open to anyone.  Is it fit for purpose and are any of our collections at permanent risk because of Swords?</p></speech>

The care of the collection is the most important element of the work of the National Museum.  I reassure everyone in the room that the safeguarding of that is the most important work we do.  Developments around Swords are part of ongoing conversations between the museum and our Department and the Office of Public Works, OPW.  It is an important piece of our work and we will ensure we arrive at a solution for the collection which is sustainable.  Crucially, the solution not only will be sustainable for the collection but also will provide an opportunity for a space and platform for local museums and other regional centres to engage with the collection.  There are two elements to this.  It is about safeguarding and security, but it is also about access and people having an opportunity to engage with the collection.</p></speech>

The way we think about, work with and use our collections must be underpinned by a strong ethical framework which takes into account the issues the Senator highlights.  The Irish Museums Association is working with European colleagues through the Network of European Museum Organisations, NEMO, around the development of a code of ethics, which is very timely.  A code is required to provide a strong reference point and framework for the consideration of some of the complex issues around the collections we have.  There is also a need for an audit of our collections across Ireland to understand what we hold, establish a strong baseline of what is there, understand what issues and opportunities the objects present, and how we can strengthen and consolidate collections.  There is also a need to deal with issues which may arise from a better understanding of what we hold.</p></speech>

Senator Warfield asked a very pertinent question.  We have already mentioned the museum standards programme which the entire Local Authority Museum Network has been involved in for many years.  I began working in museums nearly 20 years ago and we have gone from pilot studies all the way through.  A core part of that is care of collections.  It has certainly benefited all of the local authority museums in going to respective councils to make the case for additional funding not only for storage but for collection care.  It is that part of the story people do not see that often.  We do not get the opportunity to bring them in to see that key part of the work that puts an object on display.  One can never have enough storage.  We are collecting institutions and collect more objects.  We have collections policies in place to help us choose what we want, but collections management is key to what museums do.  It is the main part.  We have mentioned access to collections, which is another part.  We are working on storage with a lot of museums, including our colleagues here from Carlow and Tipperary.</p><p>The idea of getting access to the stores is such an integral part of whole offering of a museum.  We do all the other programmes but the key part we want people to remember consciously is that museums are collections-based institutions.  Museums are unique in that sense.  They have collections that will be stored for this and future generations.  I wanted to make that point in this context.  There can never be enough funding for storage.  We will always need more.  There are always backlogs in the registration and management of the collections, but thanks to the museums standards programme, many museums are ensuring they bring those standards up to specification.</p></speech>

I want to make it clear that I am not necessarily lobbying for legislation on this but there is a void or a lack of policy framework around museums in general.  Any of us could literally set ourselves up as museums if we were to so choose.  The definition of a museum takes into account the educational side, the collecting side, the care side and the research side.  That is such long-term care for the public good.  If there was a policy framework, it could possibly be developed through some of the initiatives the Government has introduced such as Heritage 2030 and even Culture 2025.  There are areas where we could have a definition of a museum that is recognised on a State basis rather than our necessarily needing more legislation.</p></speech>

Ms Kelly mentioned research, and research for us is one of the key areas we are examining in terms of needing to know what we are dealing with.  There are huge discrepancies even in simple matters such as stating the number of museums there are in the country.  On the matter of the definition of a museum, we would work very closely with our colleagues from the International Council of Museums.  It has a very set definition of museums, which is the one we would adopt.  That would go a large part towards us being able to define what a museum is before we are even able to give a completely accurate definition of how many museums there are in the country.</p></speech>

We carried out a survey two years ago and collected information from the museum sector.  The first key resource they were seeking was capacity.  That was essentially staff, expertise and volunteers.  Time was an issue that was very much raised.  Most of our museums in Ireland are staffed by fewer than ten paid employees.  I have the relevant figures, which are set out in one of the documents I circulated when we forwarded our presentation.  More than 40% of museums and very dependent on voluntary and unpaid labour and 16.7% of museums have no paid employees, relying entirely on volunteers to run their museums.  The second part of the survey examined funding and fundraising support.  Unfortunately, many museums will not be able to apply for many of the initiatives, which have been of great benefit in recent years in particular, because of capacity issues and also long-term considerations.  For example, when there is an initiative such as touring exhibition initiative, which realistically a museum will have to propose and present within a series of six months or less at times, such an initiative will not work for some of the smaller museums.  Another major issue for the sector was storage and building space.  That comes down to examining initiatives and resources that will be provided to some of the smaller museums, in particular, which can focus on research, conservation, collection care and consolidating the collections they have.  That would be a very important step forward in supporting those smaller museums.</p></speech>

I must contradict Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell because I know Mr. Liam Bradley personally and he is a very charismatic curator in the Monaghan County Museum and feels passionately about the work he does in it.  One only has to walk through the door of the museum to know that this work is a vocation.  I compliment him on the work he does for Monaghan County Council and for the entire county in saving, protecting and ensuring our heritage is there for years to come.  I also compliment Ms Savina Donohoe who does similar work as the curator of the Ballyjamesduff museum.  Much work has been done on the decade of commemorations.  It has been tricky work but the museums have all managed to do it in a very sensitive way that has been very inclusive.  I have noted that in any of the events I attended.  I compliment the representatives on their work.</p> <p>  I have a few questions specific to issues raised in the presentations, and all the representatives may want to comment on them.  My first question relates to history as a core subject and the demise or lack of appreciation there seems to be for its importance in the curriculum.  One of the representatives of the National Museum, or all the representatives, might wish to comment on that.  It is a very important issue and this is the place to discuss it.  There is an opportunity here today to ensure that taking history off the curriculum does not become the way forward.</p> <p>  Mr. Bradley referred specifically to the Creative Ireland programme and the benefits it has brought to local authorities and local authority museums.  Will he specify the elements of the programme that have been particularly helpful to our local museums and perhaps how it could be improved upon?</p> <p>  I advise Ms Scarff of the National Museum that I have had the pleasure of visiting the centre in Swords and obviously the National Museum next door to us here in the Oireachtas.  Will she give us an insight into the museum's amazing visitor numbers, which have doubled in the period since 2004, perhaps with the availability of fewer resources?  Most people would think the National Museum would not have the capacity to achieve that based on the funding it has received in that period.  Will Ms Scarff comment on how that has been achieved?  It is certainly to be recognised and lauded.</p> <p>  Most of the representatives commented on the issue of funds in terms of mobility with respect to the loaning of objects or artefacts.  I sense there is a great deal of work to be done to improve that.  Perhaps they could inform us as to how we could do that better.</p> <p>  Regarding Brexit, the representatives are here on a very historic day, as mad as it may seem in terms of what is happening.  We had a meeting of the Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development this morning which was focused on the impact of Brexit on the Border region.  Since June 2016, people have been talking about what will happen in the event of Brexit.  As a Deputy representing a Border area, I believe Brexit has already had a substantial impact since the day of the Brexit referendum.  Will Mr. Blair or Ms O'Kelly comment on the challenges they have noted that Brexit has posed and those it most certainly will present in the future?</p> <p>  Mr. Starrett or Ms Kelly might comment on the loss of a museum officer and how we might be able to help in that respect.  From the presentations of Ms Scarff and Mr. Bradley, it is obvious a museum officer is an important role and link between the Heritage Council and the museum's work.  Will Mr. Starrett indicate if there is a heritage officer in every local authority at this stage?  Those are specific questions to which I hope to receive specific answers.</p></speech>

There is not a heritage officer within every local authority.  There are currently 28, which is fairly near the full complement.  I am sure in the fullness of time those which do not have one will see the sense of having one.</p></speech>

It is not a given that local authorities must have a heritage officer but, rather, the enthusiasm for the post must be within the authority in the first place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1040" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Starrett" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#J00200"><p>As Ms Kelly mentioned, it is something which the authority must want to do.  The scheme started as a pilot project with three officers in 1999.  Its value was very quickly recognised.  The chair of the local authority heritage officer network, Ms Shirley Clerkin, made a very animated presentation to the committee approximately one month ago.  One of the very supportive steps identified by the committee was moving heritage services within local authorities to the next level by trying to secure funding and encourage people to develop an assistant post to heritage officers.  As members are aware, heritage services within each local authority comprise one person with responsibility for a significant amount of work.  Heritage officers have great enthusiasm for their work, but if local authorities want to develop heritage services, the officers must be encouraged and supported because they are stretched, as members know.  The Heritage Council continues to provide 25% funding for heritage officer posts through local authorities.  In spite of our precarious financial situation, we consider it very valuable to do so as it means that we can keep the network of officers tight and working together and provide the sort of training for them to which Ms Kelly alluded in terms of the museum standards programme.  There are some gaps to fill but there has been tremendous progress within the local authorities over the past 18 years and our partnership with them is central to that.</p> <p>  Ms Kelly may wish to address the specific vacancy to which Deputy Smyth referred.  The filling of the post is complicated by employment control frameworks and getting sanction for recruitment.  The post in the council has been vacant for six years.  Last week, we recruited a wildlife officer to fill a post vacant for five years.  We have a small number of staff and trying to operate without that level of skill and expertise to animate and share with people creates a significant amount of stress.  I pay tribute to Ms Kelly who has borne much of that burden for the Heritage Council in the absence of a museums officer.</p></speech>

We work quite closely with third level academics to produce research.  We produced a report earlier this year on the impact of Brexit on the museum sector entitled Bridge over Brexit.  Its is still functioning.<br/><br/>We recently had the pleasure of having Mr. Bradley form part of a panel at a session in Belfast with an audience of 700 at which some of the impacts of Brexit were discussed.  Obviously, it will have an impact across the board.  We are considering the impact on funding.  Many museums in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland apply for EU funding, and when a museum needs a partner, it is natural for it to look to a museum on the other side of the Border because of our shared history, cultural markers and identity<i>.</i>Brexit will cause issues in terms of storage.  We have heard anecdotal information of collections or part thereof being moved to Dublin, particularly in the corporate collections and independent museums sectors.  There is no denying that it will have a huge impact, although we are unsure what that will entail.  One of the aims of this project was to identify those issues and to support and acknowledge some of the cross-Border partnerships that have existed and what they have meant for our community in terms of social inclusion, peace and reconciliation.  Of course, Mr. Blair has significant expertise in this area.<br/><br/>One of our recommendations was that museums audit themselves.  That will be key.  We have made guidelines available for museums to do so and see where Brexit will impact on them.  It will impact on some museums more than on others but it will have a significant impact, especially in the Border counties, not only on funding but also on staff, resources and skills, which is one of the areas on which the Irish Museums Association aims to work.  It supports the museum standards programme for Ireland accreditation by providing training and upskilling and facilitating the exchange of information.  We work very closely with our partners in providing those services.  Further training needs to be made available to some of our staff to deal with mobility of collections.</p></speech>

There is a very strong network of museums within Ireland and there has been a lot of very positive and impactful collaboration between national, regional and local museums.  Those bonds are very strong and the term "bridge over Brexit" reflects our determination that those bonds cannot be broken.  Whatever disruption that Brexit may bring, the sector here is very coherent and clear in its commitment to maintaining our networks and very strong relationships and continuing to build on those into the future.  We will seek to mitigate the adverse impact of Brexit as much as possible.  The work we have done has opened that conversation.  We have started thinking deeply about Brexit and how we can ensure we are in a position genuinely to mitigate possible adverse impacts and build positively into the future.  That is what we have committed ourselves to do through the work we have done.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening statement, local authority regional museums recognised the significant opportunity offered by the 2016 programme for museums, archives, arts organisations and libraries to tackle the question not just of "what" but also "why" and to delve into that and engender discussion and debate.  Community buy-in was the basis of that project and Deputy Smyth knows very well from her first-hand experience how well it went.  People felt involved in the 2016 programme which led to Creative Ireland.</p> <p>  Creative Ireland was initially perceived locally and within local authorities as quite nebulous in terms of what it was, what it meant and how it could be nailed down.  It was not directly focused on 2016 but had a far broader aspect in regard to what is creativity, which led to the discussion around what is culture.  The significant initial benefit was funding, which was helpful in a local context.  Various culture groups in each local authority benefited from the extra funding which enabled them to carry out specific projects to take each organisation out of the museum, archive, library or arts focus and to work together.  In my experience, it has been of significant local benefit, for the arts officer, librarian, myself and the heritage officer who addressed the committee last month to meet discuss what we will do collectively on a year-to-year basis.  One can often become busy working in a silo and not look outside.</p></speech>

The collaboration of the cultural teams and their presentations raise the profile of the cultural sector with the public, the local authority officials and elected representatives.</p> <p>  Like the 2016 programme, Creative Ireland is a national programme such that one can meet representatives of other councils and ascertain what they are doing similarly or differently and the outcome of that.</p><p>It is a way of growing the expertise.  It goes back to the point raised by the previous speaker.  One can be too busy and it really forces a person to take a national view.  In a way, that is what is bringing us here today, the aspect of looking at the bigger picture and, rather than doing a lot in a little area, one does much more in a much bigger sphere.</p><p> Originally, the perception of the initiative was that it was focused on the arts as opposed to focused on heritage and culture.  That was a perception.  It was never a written policy, but what we found from our surveys was that it was arts focused.  In the few years since then, we have seen how that has changed and people actually understand there is a cultural and heritage aspect.  It is up to us as culture teams to challenge the perception, and we have done that locally.  That message has started to get across to people now, that creativity can be anything.  It does not have to be painting a picture or something visually artistic.  It can be something in heritage and it can be something in museums or in archives.  One can be creative in so many different ways.  The improvement needs to come from a local level.  I will address the point on loaning items.</p></speech>

How can we improve the procedures for loaning items?  We attended a seminar in the National Gallery of Ireland two years ago on lending objects to national institutions and national institutions lending objects to the greater community.  A point that was raised time and again was personal relationships and building up such relationships.  I cannot emphasise enough that one can be so busy doing work that one does not realise that another person 20, 30 or 100 miles down the road is doing the same work.  We are such a small country, there is no real reason we cannot know exactly what everybody else is doing in a very general sense.  Those personal relationships which can be seen today are one major step in how we can improve, and funding is another area where we can improve.  I will now defer to Ms McCarthy who will answer the question on history </p></speech>

I feel the review is so important that we very much need to look at the decision that was taken to take history off the list of core subjects in the curriculum.  I am going to say something very controversial.  I think it was a really daft decision.  I do not know where it came from.  I speak a lot to schools and to young people, and a person could go to school and not study history at all because there are schools where, because of the subject choices that students are making even at junior level, the school will not allocate resources to history.  A person can go through school and not learn anything more than what he or she learned in primary school, which as we all know we forget as we get older.</p></speech>

One does not appreciate history when one is younger.  It is vitally important to us as individuals, communities and a nation that we understand our history.  We cannot do that if we have taken it out of our schools, which we have to all intents and purposes.  The number of students who are studying history to leaving certificate level is getting smaller and smaller.  It seems to me sometimes that we have thrown the baby out with the bathwater.  While I acknowledge that STEM subjects are very important, science, technology, maths and all of those------</p></speech>

We seem to have focused on STEM and forgotten about our history, culture and the arts.  I know we are bringing arts back into it.  It is, as Mr. Bradley was saying, the idea of creativity.  Sometimes when we talk about creativity we focus on the arts, but it is much more than that.  It is all about our culture.  We need to refocus.  Reviewing the fact that history is no longer a core subject is the beginning of that.  It is very important.  I talk to children all the time and it is one of the things that I am always saying to them.  We have to understand where we are coming from.  We have to understand our history.  If we do not know that, then how can we move forward into the future and how can we make better decisions about where we are going?  I wonder, if we had a better understanding of our history, whether Brexit would have happened at all.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Smyth for her questions.  First I will address her question on visitor numbers.  Visitor numbers increased at a time when resources were dropping, which is a statement to the team that existed in the National Museum of Ireland prior to my time.  As many members know, I am a recent appointee in the role of director.  It is the people with whom I work day to day, such as my colleague, Ms Sikora, and my colleagues in the Public Gallery who continued to deliver programming during a period of serious constraints.  To address the other question around history, the increasing number of visitors tells us that there is a significant desire and interest among audiences for the kinds of experiences that we provide in our museum and it demonstrates that what is crucial for us as organisations is to think about our relevance to that.</p> <p>  I will answer the Deputy's history question from a personal perspective.  I, too, share the view that history is a crucial subject, but I also think that as we move forward in education and people are thinking of ways that there can be a trans-disciplinary approach to learning, our museums and cultural spaces can be the platforms by which we do that.  Unfortunately, what tends to happen in these kinds of scenarios is that there is very siloed thinking where there is a delivery and a formal education subject that is delivered by the Department of Education and Skills or education experts without including a more rounded, broader, non-formal learning environment, such as museums, art spaces, cultural spaces and local museums.  If we think about the kind of learning environment that many of our young children are in today, that learning ecosystem is diverse.  It involves local museums, local sports clubs, community groups, art galleries and formal education.  There is a real onus on us as people who are working in this sector to think about that ecosystem of learning and how we mutually support that.  National initiatives can offer that opportunity.  Mr. Bradley spoke very eloquently about the opportunities that were afforded by things like Creative Ireland to bring disparate groups of people together to take a unified approach to something.  When we are faced with issues like this around history, it is worth thinking about that meeting of formal and non-formal learning and reflecting back the fact that visitor numbers are growing, not only in the National Museum of Ireland but across all our museum spaces.  The interest is growing and it behoves us to think about how we support that more.</p></speech>

Perhaps we do not have the cross-disciplinary curriculum between the arts, history and geography, which are intrinsically linked.  It is very important for any future decision-making that might be on the subject of history.  History as a subject is very interesting and we have to look at how we are teaching it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1063" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Scarff" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#K01600"><p>The Deputy makes a very valid point.  In terms of our education programme, we welcome 420,000 participants a year across all of our sites.  That is a significant number and our visitors, who range over all ages, are people who are desperately interested in getting involved.  That speaks to the idea that at primary level, one has that wonderful crossover of subjects by the nature of the classroom setting.  That is difficult to employ further at second level because of the manner in which the constraints work.  Museums are cultural spaces.  I am not working in the Department of Education and Skills and can view the museum as a cultural space.  As a museum, we have an opportunity to offer a non-formal learning space and a place of lifelong learning.  Whether one had the opportunity to study history at leaving certificate level, one feels in awe when one walks into the museum in Kildare Street and sees the Prosperous Crozier, which just came into the museum.  Those kinds of experiences are crucial.  Funding and resourcing and reflecting on joined-up thinking is the opportunity that is there for us all.</p></speech>

As a former history teacher, I will defend how we teach history.  The issue is how we value it rather than the teaching.  Most teachers are genuinely enthusiastic about it and often the issue is about the way the curriculum and timetable are set out.  If one is teaching history first thing on a Monday morning or last thing on a Friday, it is very difficult to motivate students.  Teachers sometimes do not have the resources to visit sites, which is one of the constraints and the reason sometimes students visit sites only when they are in transition year.  In some cases they have not studied the subject for their junior certificate or have been in the classroom but did not take part in it and have no intention of taking it as a subject in the leaving certificate.  Teachers try to motivate them but sometimes the subjects have been already decided on by the mother and father.  Some subjects are not valued as much as others.  That is part of the reason history is not a compulsory subject.</p><p>I have a number of questions but I will not ask all of them.  One of the ideas behind bringing the witnesses here today is to ask them to lay out the challenges for us so we can pass them on to the Department on behalf of the witnesses and the people who have elected us.  We will try to be the conduit for the witnesses in overcoming the issues they have.  </p><p>My father was in the National Museum for too long.  He escaped.  He took early retirement because of bureaucracy.  He continues working to this day.  At the time, things were a lot worse in the National Museum in terms of our collection and how we kept some material.  He said, even at that time, material went missing from the national collection.  He cannot prove it because there was not a full record.  There are 4 million pieces in the collection and 17,000 will be in one production soon.  It is welcome in particular for people who are students.  It is true for all museums.  Digitisation means people do not have to visit museums to look at items.  More and more often people are using computers to view collections and then they visit and see them <i>in situ</i>.  Is it a big challenge to get material on site for the National Museum and for smaller museums?</p><p>During the run-up to the centenary events of 1916, I was involved with the Richmond Barracks projects.  I was on the board.  One of the projects we managed to encourage Dublin City Council to do was a full-day event where the library service encouraged local people to bring their heirlooms.  They scanned them if that was possible and photographed and recorded them.  They did not want to add to the collection because they were not in a position to purchase or guarantee an object but at least they know what is around locally as a result.  It was a very useful event and was hugely oversubscribed.  Families wanted there to be a record if, God forbid, there was a fire and the object was destroyed.  I encourage people to do the same when they come to me with materials such as old election posters or, in one case, every communication written on Rizla paper from a H-Block prisoner to his mother.  It is still in a plastic bag in the attic despite me requesting them to scan them.  I do not want to read them.  I do not care what is in them but they could be there for future generations of his family.  I try to encourage people but there is a fear, which we discussed with a group last week, that when a person gives material to a collection it is the last the person will see of it.  I ask the witnesses consider that issue.</p><p>With regard to the point made by Senator Warfield, we have material that in this politically correct era should not be on display in Ireland and should be repatriated.  It would be a huge loss to our national collections if we were to repatriate everything of dubious background.  For instance, we have mummies.  Logically, mummies should not be in a museum.  We should not be staring at bodies of any type in a museum. To where do we send them?  Who is the family?  Perhaps we should look at creating faithful copies.  Sometimes that is what one sees in a museum because of the dangers of light and everything else so the original is kept in a more secure place.  More and more, it is possible for that to be done.  Rather than sharing with or loaning to local museums, the national collection should replicate objects.  I do not know how many copies of the Sam Maguire cup are floating around but I definitely do not think the real one gets traipsed around every GAA club in Dublin or Kerry when the team wins.  I understand it is costly.  </p><p>One of the issues that was mentioned concerned Roger Casement.  The British hold a lot of material that does not belong to them.  When Roger Casement was arrested, they took a big case that belonged to him and kept it.  It was not used.  That includes the diaries, which belong to the Casement family.  They were not used in the court case.  They are not legal documents.  There is much material like that.  Of late, the English have been very good at giving permanent loans.  The former mayor of Dublin, Cr&iacute;ona N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh asked for the Fianna &Eacute;ireann flag from the national collection in England and the ambassador here managed to secure it on permanent loan.  It is in the museum under City Hall.  That type of collaboration occurs and there should be much more of it so material that belongs in an Irish collection is in an Irish collection.  </p><p>Some of my questions are for the representatives of the smaller museums in particular.  I have discouraged some groups around the country from setting up museums.  Sometimes they clash with me.  I discourage it on the basis that they need staff, a building, insurance and security.  Rather than creating a new museum, it might be more appropriate to mark a site and encourage the local museum, local council museum or the National Museum to have a specific collection.  Do the witnesses agree?  There are costs associated and they are increasing as we protect material.  Restoration costs are also high.  I was at the museum when the decade of centenaries was being discussed before this and the last Government was in office.  I am the longest serving member of the decades of commemorations committee since 2005.  I have been around too long.  I was there when they were discussing the Asgard and the huge costs associated.  It is one of the projects on which I must congratulate the museum.  As an exhibition I could not envisage it but it works.  </p><p>They are probably the only questions I have for now.  I do not understand why the State does not invest a lot more in our museums and cultural institutions, especially national and local ones where there is no entry charge.  It is commented upon by most tourists when they are told entry to these institutions is free.</p><p>In other countries, one has to pay a sometimes substantial amount to visit national collections.  The State does not invest to the degree it should, given how central our museums and cultural institutions are to our tourism, apart from how important they are to us.  This committee, from what I have heard since I became Chairman, has enthusiastic supporters of increasing funding for cultural institutions.  If there were any questions in my ramblings, the witnesses can address them.</p></speech>

The National Museum of Ireland is currently working on it.  We are entering into the second phase of an inventory project and following on from that there will be the digitisation of the collection.  I sometimes think there is not much knowledge of the extent of resources needed to digitise a collection.  People often think it is merely a photograph.  As the Chairman would be aware, by the time the data and metadata are recorded so an item can be accessible for all, wherever they are, significant resources are needed.  Our national collection is outstanding and includes some of the best collections globally, in certain areas, and should be accessible from anywhere in the world.  The areas with which we struggle most in terms of digitisation - this may sound like a broken record - is capacity, resources and having the right kind of people and expertise within the team of the National Museum on a sustainable basis.  Digitisation of collections often comes to us through a capital allocation which presents difficulties relating to staffing and resources, as the committee has heard.  I thank the Chairman for asking that question to bring it to the committee's notice.<br/><br/>The Chairman mentioned people in local communities and objects they have.  One of the most successful projects on which we have been working recently, which I mentioned in my opening statement, is the Irish Community Archive Network, iCAN, project, which is supported by Creative Ireland.  The website where people can upload those experiences is <i>www.ouririshheritage.org</i>.  Our keeper, Ms Sikora, her colleagues and many of our colleagues in the National Museum of Ireland regularly answer questions from the public who say that a relative donated an item and we are able to find it.  The chair of our board recently came with her family to see a duck that they donated to the Natural History Museum.  It is important for people to know that when those objects are donated to our collection, we take great care of them.  We will respond to those kinds of requests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1067" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Blair" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22018121200002#M00300"><p>The Chairman raised a number of important issues.  Museums always have a particular set of fixed costs relating to their collections because of the associated long-term duty of care.  We have to think hard about sustainability and what a coherent, strong, sustainable museum sector for Ireland is, and to build with that in mind.  It is challenging for existing museums to be responsive to some of the issues that arise at a local level regarding how they work with other groups on addressing some of the issues that come forward and where local communities feel that something needs to be addressed.  We should ask the community sector to help us to unlock the potential within our collections.  We hold these collections for society.  They are not our collections except in the broadest sense.  Unlocking that potential is a great opportunity for museums.  Museums are changing and it is important to recognise that and to think more carefully about their role and purpose in society, and the social and economic impact they can make.  Museums, at their best, are on that agenda, in building social cohesion, supporting local economic development etc.  These are all within the power of museums to contribute.</p> <p>  Part of the process of unlocking potential is placing access to collections front and centre, thinking carefully about our audiences, being responsive to audience needs and how our audience is changing.  Museums also have to change.  We have to think, act and behave differently to be fully responsive to the way in which society is changing and to make sure we are in tune with the broader social trends, and that we retain our relevance.  Museums are, at their best, relevant institutions where we can explore all sorts of issues that really matter.  They are very future-focused institutions.  They are part of the creative industries and they are creative institutions.  That is the argument we should make with regard to our importance to society as we move forward.  It is not simply about looking to the past but understanding it as a touch-point to our present and to what kind of future we can create.</p></speech>

Maybe two thirds of those are outside the national cultural institutions and local authority museums.  Some join as organisations and some as individuals.  Many smaller museums join the Irish Museums Association on an individual level purely because it is more cost-effective for them to do that.  We are happy for them to do so.  That is not to say we do not engage with more collection-based organisations around the country.  The Chairman raised museums that are struggling.  A significant issue when we are talking with collection-based institutions or organisations is fully explaining the remit of a museum and the difference between a permanent exhibition and a museum, with the many roles they need to take on.  We are sometimes in a position where we dissuade people.</p> <p>  It is important that we consolidate what we have.  One of our biggest collections of transport material is run entirely by volunteers in Howth.  One of our biggest maritime collections is held in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and is entirely run by volunteers.  Two weeks ago, I had a four-day expertise and knowledge-sharing course on museum basics with a group of 20 people from maritime collections across the country.  I think only one of those was a member of the association.  The rest are not necessarily members but it does not mean we are not engaging with them.  There is not necessarily a need to create more museums but to consolidate what we have, recognise the role they play and their contribution.</p></speech>

There is always a challenge working with people to get them to give their objects or images which are important to the family.  It is sometimes a long-term discussion with family members.</p><p>A number of years can pass before they come back and give an answer one way or the other.  The answer may be "No" or it may be "Yes".  Sometimes an item is bequeathed to us after someone has passed away because we spoke to that person a decade previously and he or she considered the matter thereafter.  This long process is worthwhile.  The regional museums that participate in the local authority museum network are aware of the collections that are out there.  We know who has certain items in attics and basements.  While the costs involved can be prohibitive at times, we would like the network of local authority museums to grow so that they become county museums.  Obviously, there are many museums with various focuses.  County museums are unique because they tell the stories of their regions.  As their remit is not confined to specific collections, they are much more open and much more able to take in everything and anything.  We take in things from County Monaghan and things that have very tenuous links to the county but are part of the county's story nonetheless.  We believe there is a need for more local authority museums.  It is something that we will be looking at in our own plan.  We will consider how we can advocate for that with other local authorities.  We have spoken to a number of local authorities that have looked into this.  We will continue to support them.  I believe that if we do not maintain our efforts, collections and stories will be lost.</p><p> The museum in County Monaghan has a number of replicas of objects relating to the county that are in the national museum.  There are ways around the difficulties that can arise in this regard.  While it can be costly to do replicas, there are benefits when children and others can come in and see them.  The Tydavnet sun discs, which were discovered in County Monaghan, are the emblem of the national museum.  People are very aware of them because they are the largest gold discs in the country.  They want to see them.  If they are unable to see them in Dublin, they can see replicas of them in Monaghan.  If we cannot get an exact object, there are ways around that.  I ask my colleague, Ms McCarthy, to respond to the questions that were asked about digitisation in the context of the regional museums.</p></speech>

Digitisation is very important for us, but it is a challenge.  There is no doubt financial and human resourcing challenges arise in this context.  Our museum, which has a collection of approximately 7,000 objects, has four staff who have very specific roles and responsibilities.  Unfortunately, digitisation is not one of our duties.  We are busy engaging with the public on exhibitions and outreach work and caring for our collections.  Digitisation has resource implications.  This is more often seen in the archive and library sectors.  The National Archives of Ireland have done amazing work to digitise some of their collections, such as the military archives.  The work that has been done to digitise materials has been particularly evident during the decade of centenaries.  Funding has been provided for that.  We would like to see more work being done in the smaller museums.  I am speaking from my own perspective when I say we do not have the resources to do this work at the moment.  We do some work on an ad hoc basis, for example when we have a temporary exhibition.  At the moment, we have an exhibition looking at the emigration of women from Donegal.  When people bring things like photographs and letters into us, we scan that material and retain the copies in our collection while returning the original items to their owners.  It is done on an exhibition by exhibition basis.  We are certainly not doing it on any sort of coherent basis.</p></speech>

Digitisation brings with it responsibilities in the area of digital preservation, which is a significant expense and headache.  It requires long-term planning.  We all need to consider this issue, which extends beyond the cultural sector.  That is a discussion for another day.  Research from Europeana has shown that digitisation deepens existing links with objects and things, but does not widen audiences.  This brings us back to the point that was made earlier about the value that people place on items.  If people do not know that a collection is available online, they will not find it or look for it.  Education is the key to making people curious.  Denying people their right to their history is a form of denial of human rights.  That is how we should be looking at this.  It is clear from looking at the difficulties we have had in this country when people have been denied their pasts that we need to look at the collective basis of what we are now possibly replicating by denying.</p></speech>

One of the very first pieces of research undertaken by the Heritage Council involved looking at the state of collections in Ireland.  It ran a pilot scheme in three counties.  Things were so bad that the pilot scheme stopped.  The museum standards programme was born out of that.  The programme has made a tremendous difference over the past 20 years, particularly in the member institutions ranging from the smallest to the largest.  It is worth bearing in mind that things were very bad.  We have come a long way.  As the need to emphasise the value of collections is more fully understood, I plead with the State to focus on private collections that are deteriorating without any care or attention.  Over the next decade, if the State in its wisdom can find a way to resolve some of the issues with its existing collections, perhaps it can also find a way to encourage people to come forward with their private collections.  If those people are guided appropriately, they can do much of the conservation.  This will enable us to make accessible a plethora of really important information about the society in which we live.  I share entirely the Chairman's view on the information on Roger Casement that is held by the British.  May I suggest, somewhat mischievously, that the general data protection regulation, GDPR, could be invoked in this respect before the UK leaves the EU?  All of the information in question is personal data and therefore belongs to the family.  Why not invoke something under the GDPR?  We would never know what we might get.</p></speech>

We carry out many of the statutory roles for which the national museum is responsible.  When something is found in any part of the country, we go there to investigate.  In my experience, our relationships with the curators who are designated under the National Cultural Institutions Act and the National Monuments Act to work on behalf of the museum to protect this heritage are critically important.  The staff in the counties that have this invaluable facility, as Donegal did this summer, always find that it is a really positive experience.  Speaking personally and on behalf of the museum, I would love to see local authorities investing in designating museums for every county.</p></speech>

We were talking to the Minister about some amendments we wanted to make.  Regardless of whether one is pro-choice or pro-life, one will agree that this is a profound matter.  I wanted to be in the Seanad when the Minister was considering certain amendments.

The point really is the one all of the witnesses are making.  Funding is terribly important.  Having people to run things is as important as the building itself.  The preservation of the building can happen only if people are there to open the door and bring in schools and art centres.  Mr. Starrett made the very good point that we are great at building places and decking them out.  We did it with theatres all over the country but we forgot that people have to run them.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO of the NTA.  I understand  the committee wishes to focus on the core bus corridor project which is part of the BusConnects Dublin programme.</p> <p>  In terms of background, the overall framework for transport provision to meet the needs of the region over the next two decades is set out in the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2016-2035, which was approved by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2016.  The strategy outlines the various networks to be developed - heavy rail, light rail, bus, road, cycling and pedestrian networks, together with supporting measures, including park and ride provision, information provision, integration and demand management measures.  The core bus corridor project is outlined in that strategy.</p> <p>  BusConnects Dublin, which was launched last year, aims to overhaul the current bus system in the Dublin region by: building a network of new bus corridors on the busiest bus routes to make bus journeys faster, predictable and reliable; completely redesigning the network of bus routes to provide a more efficient network, connecting more places and carrying more passengers; developing a state-of-the-art ticketing system using credit and debit cards or mobile phones to link with payment accounts and making payment much more convenient; implementing a cashless payment system to vastly speed up passenger boarding times; revamping the fare system to provide a simpler fare structure, allowing seamless movement between different transport services without financial penalty; providing a number of supporting park and ride facilities; rolling out new bus stops with better signage and information and increasing the provision of additional bus shelters; and transitioning to a new bus fleet using low emission vehicle technologies.  BusConnects Dublin is a programme of integrated actions which, together, will deliver a bus system that will enable more people to travel by bus than ever before, and allow bus commuting to become a viable and attractive choice for employees, students, shoppers and visitors.</p> <p>  Regarding the impact of congestion on bus travel, from the perspective of public transport, congestion is a major problem.  On the busiest bus routes, bus lanes are in place for only less than one third of the corridor.  This means that for most of the journey buses are competing for space with general traffic and so are also affected by the increasing levels of congestion.  As a result, whereas bus journeys should be fast, reliable and predictable, the increasing impact of congestion is undermining that objective.  Additional buses are being added to the system simply to compensate for delays in journey times.</p> <p>  The bus system is important because, simply put, it is the main component of the solution to address our current congestion problem and to meet our future transport needs.  As Dublin is a low density city there are few areas with the size and concentration of population for rail-based public transport.  This means that for most corridors in Dublin bus travel represents the optimum form of public transport.</p> <p>  Dublin Bus carried 137 million passengers in 2017.  When combined with Bus &Eacute;ireann commuter services in the Dublin region, 143 million passengers were carried on State operated bus services in the Dublin area, compared with 38 million on Luas and 33 million passengers on the DART and rail commuter services.</p> <p>  Overall, the core bus corridor project envisages the provision of about 230 km of bus lanes on 16 of the busiest bus corridors in Dublin, which we refer to as &ldquo;radial core bus corridors&rdquo;.  These corridors are shown in a map appended to my statement.</p> <p>  Our objective is to provide a continuous bus lane in each direction as well as maintaining two general traffic lanes.  In addition, we also want to provide a dedicated cycle track on each side of the road, providing safe cycling facilities, segregated from other vehicular traffic.  The standard layout also includes footpaths for pedestrians and supporting elements such as pedestrian crossings at all key road crossing points, and bus shelters for waiting passengers.  However, this standard layout is difficult to achieve in practice and there are a number of challenges we face in trying to implement this target layout.  Difficult decisions will have to be made and some locations will require more changes than others.  Some of the likely impacts that will arise from the core bus corridor project are set out in the following sections.</p> <p>  In terms of traffic movement, by creating more priority for buses and cycling, there will be changes to how traffic currently moves around the streets.  Some roads may become one-way, new bus-only sections will be introduced and in some places general traffic will have to take new routes in and out of the city.</p> <p>  Regarding acquisition of parts of gardens, because there is so little unused space along these busy roads, it will often not be possible to accommodate the bus lanes and cycle lanes in the width available.  To achieve the required space it will be necessary, in places, to acquire parts of front gardens and land in front of commercial properties to allow the bus and cycle lanes to be provided.  This would require rebuilding new garden walls a short distance back from the existing road boundary.</p> <p>  In terms of the reduction of on-street parking, because the roads we are widening travel through residential and business areas there will be a need to reduce the amount of on-street parking to accommodate the new layout. Regarding the removal of trees, as with the need to remove some parts of front gardens and footpaths, there will be also a need to remove trees along some of the corridors.</p> <p>  In terms of mitigation, every feasible option will be looked at to minimise the disruption to people, their properties and the wider local community.  Where there is simply no viable alternative, and where we know we have to remove trees, portions of gardens or parking, we will ensure appropriate mitigation measures are put in place, wherever practicable.</p><p>One of the benefits of the core bus corridor project is that it will improve cycling infrastructure.  The major bus corridors across Dublin city are also the main cycling arteries.  The widening of these roads for bus lanes provides an opportunity to transform cycling infrastructure at the same time.  Our objective on each of the 16 radial corridors is to provide high-quality cycling facilities that are segregated from the bus lanes and general traffic lanes as far as feasible.  We calculate that more than 200 km of cycle tracks or lanes will be built, or current lanes improved upon.  A better cycling network is good for all transport users.  It avoids cyclists sharing bus lanes with buses and removes many of the conflicts between buses and cyclists.  This initiative is the foundation of the overall cycle network that has been planned for the greater Dublin area.<br/><br/>The core bus corridor project will help people to get home more quickly by improving journey times and creating certainty and confidence in the bus system.  Improvements in current journey times on key bus corridors will make bus travel more attractive, improve the efficiency of services and give people reliability in knowing exactly how long their journeys will take.  On average, bus journey times will be reduced by up to 40% or 50%.  In the absence of BusConnects, journey times will continue to get worse and commuters will spend more time travelling to and from work each day.<br/><br/>We have all heard recent reports suggesting that Ireland is performing poorly in comparison to our European partners when it comes to reducing carbon emissions and meeting climate change targets.  The transport sector is the largest fuel consumer in the economy - it consumes 33% of fuel - and has the largest share of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions - 35%.  It is vital that we move more people from cars onto sustainable transport, which is a key component in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and addressing congestion with all of its adverse environmental impacts.<br/><br/>The core bus corridor project will support the economy and jobs.  A well-functioning public transport system is a basic requirement for any metropolitan area that aspires to provide plenty of good employment opportunities for its people into the future.  Dublin has some great bus, rail and tram services.  If it is to maintain its capacity as a city, a region and a capital and continue to attract the best jobs and the best employers, we urgently need to do more.  By improving the overall public transport offering, these proposals will make commutes shorter and more reliable, and will therefore make Dublin a more attractive location for employers.  They will also make it easier for people to get out and enjoy the city and all it has to offer, which is good news for businesses in the city centre and beyond.<br/><br/>Public consultation is being undertaken in three phases.  The first phase of consultation, which relates to four corridors, commenced on 14 November last and will continue until February of next year.  The second phase of consultation will commence in January and the third phase of consultation will begin in February.  All property owners who are potentially affected by the proposals will be notified by post in advance of the public consultation.  A one-to-one meeting will be offered with each of them.  The NTA is establishing a community forum for each corridor to give representatives of residents' associations, community groups, public representatives and interested groups an opportunity to get informed and engaged during the public consultation process.  A series of public information meetings will be held in venues along the corridors.  Written submissions and observations on the corridors involved in the first phase may be made online at <i>www.busconnects.ie</i>, by post to the core bus corridor project at the NTA's offices or by email to <i>cbc@busconnects.ie</i>.  <br/><br/>hat concludes my introductory statement.  I will answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

Many Deputies and Senators who are not members of this committee, particularly those from Dublin city, are interested in this significant issue.  I know there are transport issues in Limerick as well.  As I said at the beginning, I will call members of the committee first and non-members from a list thereafter.  I am including Deputy Shortall as a member of the committee because she has informed us that she is an official substitute.  The first member I will call is Deputy Rock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-12a.1121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018121200002#C00300"><p>Ms Graham, Mr. Creegan and I have seen a lot of each other over recent months.  I have seen more of them than I have of my family.  Perhaps that illustrates the scale of their ambition to transform transport in Dublin city and across the country.  There is no question about the fact that the broad scale and scope of these ambitious plans is to be lauded.  I want to state from the outset that I believe the idea of trying to anticipate the challenges, demands and needs of public transport right across Dublin city is to be lauded.  A number of challenges arise in this context.  Some of them are general and relate to the process and some of them are more local.</p> <p>  I will start with the general concerns and problems I have.  Why has it been decided that the process of consultation should be staggered?  Why is there consultation on the routes, in the first instance, followed by consultation on the core bus corridors?  The consultation on the corridors has been divided into three phases.  As Ms Graham has said, the first phase of consultation on the corridors began in November and ended in February.  The second phase will begin in January and end in March.  The third phase will begin in February and end in April.  This puts public representatives in a difficult position.  In effect, we have to decide, debate and work with constituents in an information vacuum.  We do not know the exact scale of the plans for the core bus corridors from Ballymun to the city centre, or from Finglas to Phibsborough.  We are expected to adjudicate and make arguments on the corridor from Swords to the city centre, which passes through Santry village, in a vacuum of information.  I suggest at this early stage that we should extend the deadline for the first phase so that people can make their adjudications, observations and decisions in a cohesive and holistic way.  I would appreciate it if the NTA would consider that.</p> <p>  I reiterate that I would like to know why the corridor consultation is going ahead when we do not know what the revised routes will be.  It is obvious the routes which were proposed in the draft plan a few months ago solicited an unprecedented volume of feedback.  I understand that approximately 30,000 pieces of feedback were received.  I assume this will naturally lead to some revisions of the draft plans.  When I met representatives of Dublin Bus yesterday, they certainly left me under no illusion that there will be revisions to the draft plans.  If there are revisions to the draft plans, it would seem fair to posit that they will potentially have knock-on effects on the core bus corridors.  We are adjudicating and giving feedback in a vacuum, based on an old draft route plan.  We are not privy to, and do not have access to, the current draft route plan.  When will the current plan be released?  Will it be released in time for the current consultation deadline, as it stands?</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the consultation meetings themselves.  Last night, Deputy Shortall hosted a meeting of more than 20 residents' associations.  It was suggested very clearly at that meeting that the consultation meeting which is due to take place on 8 January should be split into a Swords consultation and a separate and distinct Santry consultation.  It is clear there are many interested bodies in Santry.  It was suggested that the issues being faced outside and inside the M50 on this 12 km bus corridor route are potentially somewhat separate and distinct.  From the perspective of how NTA officials, public representatives and residents will spend their time, it would be beneficial to split the consultation into two meetings.  I would appreciate the witnesses' feedback on that.</p> <p>  As we know, it is planned that the bus corridor between Swords and the city centre will be considered at a meeting on 8 January next.  I would be curious to know whether it is intended at this stage that any additional meetings will take place.  A number of residents' associations intend to put questions to the NTA, just as I am doing right now.  I think it would be useful and beneficial to have a second round of consultation before the date in question.</p> <p>  What are the terms of reference for the consultations?  Last night, a number of residents expressed concern about the lack of published terms of reference for these consultations.  I understand the NTA intends to publish them and is working on them now.  I would appreciate it if we could get a date for that. </p></speech>

Has the NTA placed those submissions into broad categories like accessibility to routes or corridors, electric vehicles or disabilities?  If so, does it intend to make that information available to us?  Are any changes planned on foot of the submissions?  Ms Graham did not say a lot about the written submissions.  Perhaps we could get a brief update on that.  Does the NTA intend to make many changes?</p><p> Deputy Rock referred to the terms of reference for the consultation process.  I would be also interested in seeing them.  It is a very contentious issue for the residents with gardens who are directly affected.  Have those residents been identified?  I know Ms Graham has said she will be in touch with them, but have they been notified or has there been any engagement whatsoever with these residents? I am sure they are very anxious at this stage.</p><p> I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Dessie Ellis.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Graham for her presentation.  It is interesting that the three Deputies representing Dublin North-West are in attendance.  That is a measure of the importance of this issue to the residents of the Dublin North-West constituency.  That is the case because Dublin North-West is the only constituency in the greater Dublin area that is entirely dependent on buses.  We are very familiar with buses, and down through the years the bus services have been honed time and again to suit local need.  It is true to say that the constituency of Dublin North-West has an excellent bus service.  We need more buses during the morning peak period but apart from that, it is an excellent service and it provides fantastic access to various parts of the city, and the residential areas also are very well served.  That is really important because there is a very large older population and there are many people with disabilities as well in that constituency.  There is very good access in all respects.</p><p>With any major project, there are winners and losers.  When it comes to the Dublin North-West constituency, there would be more losers than winners under these proposals.  That is not what it was supposed to be about.  It is supposed to be about improving bus services and journey times for everybody.</p><p>We know from the analysis on this and from Ms Graham's presentation today that the big problem in the greater Dublin area as regards public transport is traffic congestion.  I do not know why the NTA is not dealing with that issue in a more radical way.  Why do the routes have to change?  I cannot understand that from the point of view of the north west part of the city, because the routes are very good at present.  What is needed is greater priority to be given to those routes and more road space to be provided for buses.  Has Ms Graham considered in any detail the possibility of restricting traffic while maintaining the existing bus routes, which are very popular?  I wonder why the NTA has not taken that approach.  </p><p>When the NTA came out with proposals on the network, as others have said, there was a huge reaction to it.  That is mainly because what is being proposed would result in a poorer service than what people enjoy at present.  That is not something people will accept.  People expected to see an outcome from that first round of consultation on the network before the NTA would get into the business of looking at the corridors.  The decisions in relation to the network will dictate where the corridors will go.  The NTA has not done that and has not come back to the public with a response on the proposed changes to the network and that is why this is being seen as a fait accompli.  The NTA is not listening to what the 30,000 people have said and is ploughing ahead with the original plan.  That does not inspire the people to have confidence in the consultative process being meaningful.  Will Ms Graham explain why she has not completed the first round before going into the detail of proposed bus corridors?  At present all buses going down the Swords Road and the Drumcondra Road serve O'Connell Street.  Perhaps they should not all serve O'Connell Street but under the NTA plans none of the them will serve O'Connell Street any longer.  That will have serious implications for shoppers and for people who want to get into the area around O'Connell Street.  It will also have implications for the business community on the north side of the city, which is struggling.  If the NTA is going to bring about a situation where people have poorer access to those shopping areas in the north side of the city, I do not see how that is a win for anybody?  As part of the proposed plan it runs all the buses down Gardiner Street and away from the city centre.  Now the NTA is consulting about having a corridor down Gardiner Street.  Does that mean the NTA is assuming the Gardiner Street network changes are going ahead?  Does Ms Graham understand that people are concerned about this as they think it is a <i>fait accompli.  </i>We need an explanation as to why the NTA did not wait until members of the public have the outcome of the first round of the consultation process.</p><p>Another issue is the forum for discussing the issues.  There are many different local issues affecting people along the entire route of the corridor.  It seems to be entirely unwieldy and ineffective to try to have one forum for the long corridor such as the Swords corridor.  The request is to split the corridor and have one forum for the route within the M50 and another forum for the area outside of the M50.  I hope Ms Graham might accede to those requests.  The other concern is about what these forums are about.  Are they a way of going through the motions of giving people a platform or are they actually going to mean something in terms of people having an input which can have an impact on the proposed changes.  We would like to know more about the role of the forum and its terms of reference  Will it be possible for people who engage in those forums to effect any change or is it just about the detail of a proposal that has been already set in stone?</p><p>I now wish to raise a concern that was brought to my attention today by the Dublin Cycling Campaign who are extremely critical of the cycling proposals.  The Dublin Cycling Campaign are alleging that those proposals do not meet any of the international standards in respect of safe cycling.  They are looking for a meeting with Ms Graham, which seems absolutely reasonable.  If there is to be an investment in providing new cycling facilities - they are desperately needed in the city as cycling is a very precarious activity at present, which should not be the case - we should be doing everything we possibly can to make cycling easier and safer for people.  The regular cyclists who are involved in the campaign are saying that the standards the NTA are using are not acceptable.  They are looking to meet Ms Graham separately.  They have been told they can engage with the NTA only through the forums.  That strikes me as not acceptable.  If the standards the NTA are using are not up to scratch, surely that is an issue that should be dealt with from the very start.  I appeal to Ms Graham to agree to an early meeting with the Dublin Cycling Campaign.</p></speech>

I wish to follow up on Deputy Shortall's comment on cycling.  There is real concern among the cycling community who are starting to look at some of the details.  Their fear is that they will be forgotten about.  I will give examples.  The cycle route from Malahide Road into town, the Clongriffin and the Santry detours are all benefits but when one is coming to the key point and heading down hill into Fairview on to the main road, the cyclists have to divert off the main road and cross a multilane highway and take a detour route.  I do not think cyclists will do that and I do not think they should have to.  The solution to tight pinch points is always to remove the cyclist.</p><p> I will give a second more local example from my constituency, an area I know well, the Rathmines main street.  As was revealed yesterday from the latest draft drawings we have seen, when one is coming into town, near the Tesco store and the Garda station, it is expected that cyclists would literally go around the houses, around the schools and take a 2.1 km detour to get to the George Bernard Shaw pub, which people might know.  We always go by pub directions.  I measured it this morning on Google Earth.  The direct route is 1 km.  If anyone knows the Rathmines main street, it is the cycling super highway in this city.  The thought that we would remove cyclists from Rathmines main street beggars belief.  That has been mentioned at various stages of the consultation process.  I cannot believe the approach that is being taken.</p><p> There are numerous others examples of concerns from cyclists.  We did a good design on the existing Clontarf cycle route in terms of how we dealt with it and issues such as bus shelters and junctions and there seems to be different solutions in each of the four designs in those regards.  That is one concern I want to raise.</p><p> My last point relates to the general level of urban design.  I am very supportive of the BusConnects project.  The NTA say there will be an opportunity to improve urban design, tree plantation and the greening of streets but none of the designs that have emerged to date has that element within the design.  This should be an opportunity to create beautiful streets, not multi-lane highways, which I fear is the direction in which the NTA is going.  It is all about having as many lanes as one can in either direction but that does not necessarily make for good streets.  I am concerned that has not been identified in the design so far.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Kevin Humphreys or rather Senator Kevin Humphreys.  I am promoting him again.</p></speech>

Lengthening a route for a cyclist will only discourage more cyclists and put them off the road and not necessarily increase the number of people using bikes.</p> <p>  The first maps for the corridors came out in June and July.  The bus routes were next and now we are back to the corridors.  We had a press release from Dublin Bus to which Deputy Shortall referred.  It said the routes are not connected to the corridors and involve a separate consultation process.  There is no point in putting a corridor where there will not be a bus route.  They are interconnected.  We need to see the outcome from the consultation on the routes before we say for definite where corridors will be and how they will operate.</p> <p>  Deputy Rock mentioned the corridors and public forums.  For example, on the Bray to the city centre route, there problems on different sections of the route similar to what is happening on the north side and that must be taken into consideration.  As a committee and as public representatives, we need to have much more information on community forums.  Will there be independent chairs?  We must have that level of information.  It is required in order to build up trust in the community.  We need to be able to tell people that there are independent chairs, for example.  I could envisage three or four different community forums being required on very long corridors.  They could meet on a monthly basis as a super group to look at the entire corridor, but they must be broken down into smaller sections.</p> <p>  Design is another issue of concern.  I accept we need to get more from the bus network in the city and therefore we need improvements.  However, they must be interconnected and related.  Issues of urban design and street design must be paramount.  I was recently involved in a consultation process concerning Cambridge Road in Ringsend which potentially has a bus corridor at one end and a cycle route at the other end, yet we are looking at only a very narrow stretch of 1.5 km.  We are told that the bus corridor is the responsibility of BusConnects and that the NTA has responsibility for the cycle network.  There appears to be a lack of joined-up thinking, especially in terms of small sections of development where one does not know exactly what will happen.</p> <p>  Are sustainable drainage systems, SuDS, being taken into account?  What level of consultation has been had in that regard?  Trees act as carbon sinks and absorb particles emitted by diesel engines.  Has the NTA commissioned studies on the roads and streets that are affected?  What is planted along the routes will have a significant effect on how quickly particles are absorbed, as airflow is an interrelated factor.</p> <p>  The big issue for many is when people will know.  I was in contact with many people who were about to sell their homes or had gone sale agreed but are now in limbo.  Families were moving to properties to suit the size of the family but they are now frozen and can do nothing due to their location on a potential corridor with the possibility that their gardens will be gone and they cannot move on.  The NTA has said people will know when the letters are issued but that is still at the beginning of a consultation process.  If the NTA is truly consulting on the corridor there might be changes even though people have received a letter.  Everybody who is on a corridor must be given a clear understanding as to the start date and the markers in between.  The NTA witnesses must make a commitment to the effect that the NTA has the resources to take on such a major project.  There are bus corridors, routes and the MetroLink, which are all significant infrastructural projects.  What are the resources of the NTA in regard to those projects?  I am concerned about MetroLink and the bus corridors in Ranelagh, Rathmines and Milltown.  Each one will have a major impact on the other.  What level of joined-up thinking is there in regard to them?</p> <p>  Mr. Creegan mentioned the cost of what I describe as the elephant in the room but a lot more information is needed.  Why has congestion tolling not been discussed?  If cars are part of the problem and we are investing significantly in public transport, why are we not also considering congestion tolling, or at least having a consultation about it?  It is in operation and has worked well in other cities.  What is the position in that regard?</p> <p>  Residents on the Lower Kimmage Road, Nutley Lane, Terenure and other places on the south side and the north side have lost confidence in the process due to the lack of information in the early stages.  Not many of their questions were answered.  There is a need to provide a much more detailed engagement.  Community forums are fine but there is also a need to meet the residents on certain roads that are impacted, for example, Lower Kimmage Road or Nutley Lane.  They will have far more detailed questions than someone discussing the entire route.</p> <p>  There is an information deficit.  I still come across rows of houses where people do not have an understanding that there is a possibility of a bus route on the road.  When residents or an auctioneer acting on their behalf contact the NTA office they are told it is an indicative line.  There is no clarity.  An example of that is the 16 route from Ringsend to the city centre which has an indicative line on Pigeon House Road.  An indicative line means that 90 odd families do not know whether they should be engaging in the process.  Auctioneers now highlight the fact of there being an indicative line if a house comes up for sale but there is no plan or detail.  That is a major issue of concern.  I will not ask any more questions at this stage as I am aware Deputy Ellis is waiting to contribute.</p></speech>

My questions are not, unfortunately, about Dublin.  I want to speak about the issues facing bus services in Limerick city, in particular the 304 and 304A which serve the Dooradoyle-Raheen to Castletroy areas, which are two largely populated areas.  Each morning, including at off-peak times, these buses arrive between 15 and 23 minutes late.  There is a similar time issue in the evenings.  There are many people working or living in the city centre who have to travel to the other side of the city for work or other reasons.  The real time app does not co-ordinate with the arrival time of the buses.  I have been told by people who use these services on a daily basis that when they check the app it states a bus will arrive in two or three minutes but it might not arrive for half an hour.  There is a time lapse between the information provided in the app and the arrival of buses.</p> <p>  In regard to the leap card, there are only a few locations at which people can top them up, such that unless one is from Limerick one would not know the places to go.  There is no information for tourists or people visiting the city from other cities around Ireland on where they can top-up their leap cards.  I was speaking to a man recently who told me the journey from the city centre, where he lives, to Troy Studios, Castletroy, where he works, took more than 40 minutes, yet a private bus operator on the route appears to be able to complete the journey in less time.  Another issue is the lack of policing of cars parked at bus stops, which I accept may be an issue for the council rather than the NTA.  Also, on Sundays and bank holidays services are not as frequent as advertised.  This service is not reliable.  Listening to the discussion today on BusConnects and the consultation around it, I am jealous.</p></speech>

Corbally in Limerick has a large population.  The bus service from Corbally to Crescent Shopping Centre, which serviced five or six schools, was withdrawn without consultation and it has not been replaced.  I accept the witnesses might not be able to answer my questions today but I would appreciate it if they could.  Limerick is the third largest city.  We need a plan and consultation on services.</p></speech>

BusConnects will impact hugely on the Swords, Finglas, Glasnevin and Ballymun to the city centre bus routes.  While there are some complaints about services in these areas, in general they are good.  The lack of feedback from the consultations concerns me.  Like many other people, I made a number of submissions, but I have had no feedback.  </p> <p>  The process has moved now to the corridors.  I refer the witnesses to the metro north project, on which there were many meetings between the NTA and residents regarding the three proposed routes.  We are continually told that metro north is progressing and that consultation in that regard will commence towards the end of this year or early next year.  We are now faced with BusConnects on top of metro north.  To my mind, it would have been wiser to complete the metro north project first as it will impact hugely on what is being proposed in terms of BusConnects.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the houses and gardens that will be affected and the likely repercussions at Hart's Corner where the Finglas-Glasnevin and Ballymun routes to the city centre meet.  It is proposed to compulsorily acquire gardens.  What will happen if people dig in their heels?  I do not know how, if the NTA meets resistance, and it will, what is proposed can be progressed.  In the case of metro north, much of the route will be underground.  While this will cause some disruption it will be nothing like the disruption that will be caused by what is proposed in terms of the BusConnects corridors.  We are moving ahead with the ambitious BusConnects project and, thus, moving in the direction of privatisation of Dublin Bus, with 10% of routes already withdrawn and more in the pipeline.</p> <p>  I will give an example.  The 17A service was recently privatised.  I have been hearing complaint after complaint about it, which I expected.  It was inevitable that when services were privatised there would be problems.  It is happening already in regard to the privatised 220 and 17A services, yet we are continuing with the BusConnects corridors.  I believe it would have been wiser to get metro north over the line before implementing BusConnects.  In January, there will be another series of debates on metro north.  Coupled with that debate, we will have another round of consultation on BusConnects.  This process is a mess.  We all want improved bus services.  I believe in a proper public transport system but I am confused at the manner in which we are going about achieving it.  I am not convinced BusConnects will work.  I am hearing too many complaints about it.  We are opening debates on every front and that is a problem.  We should have dealt first with metro north and then moved to BusConnects and dealt with it route by route.  To my mind, the manner in which we are going about all of this is problematic.   </p></speech>

Employees of Go-Ahead are also workers.  There are two Go-Ahead routes operating in my own area.  It is still at an early phase and if, after six months, there are still issues, they should be raised then.</p> <p>  I have a problem with the Minister's lack of input.  He stands by and has no input or ideas particularly regarding the big gap that will exist between 2018 and 2027.  The BusConnects corridors will not be completed until 2027, the same time that metro north will be finished.  I would like to see intervention measures between now and then and I ask the NTA witnesses their view on that.</p> <p>  I have said to the NTA privately, and I will say it publically, that all these corridors have to be done.  I will echo what Senator Humphreys has said and ask the NTA to advise the committee on the NTA's human resource capacity.  Does the NTA have the number of staff it needs because, if it does not, that is a matter for the Oireachtas.  This should be pushed through if there are enough engineers, administrators, designers and all the rest available but, if the NTA does not have the staff available to it, then the Oireachtas urgently needs to look at giving assistance.  The NTA is taking on a lot.</p> <p>  Phase 2 of BusConnects absolutely has to happen.  We had disagreements on phase 1 and we look forward to the NTA coming back with a second iteration on that in the spring.</p> <p>  I have said to a number of my colleagues that if we were putting Luas trams rather than bus corridors along those 16 spines there would be a much bigger public buy-in and people would be willing to wear and accept being discommoded in the significant way they are going to be discommoded.  We need to sell the bus corridors project as Luas on rubber wheels and it has to be of the highest standard from the design phase.  I have strongly proposed the use of what the NTA calls articulated buses and what Dubs call bendy buses which allow multiple access points.  The NTA is resistant to that because those buses involve a lot of standing room and questions arise as to how far a passenger should be allowed to stand for a full journey.  At the moment, if a passenger is travelling on the Luas from Sandyford, he or she is standing from start to finish in some cases.  That is a decision for the commuter.  These long-length buses should look like a tram, have all the technology the trams have, stop at bus stops with all the technology and show where people need to connect, etc.  I push the NTA to look at that.  Those buses were introduced in Belfast recently and faced some of the challenges that will face us.  A first class bus system would be a significant selling point for people.</p> <p>  Our bus corridors and boxes are not policed and, if they were, it would encourage people to switch from cars to buses and would grow confidence in bus corridors.  That does not have to be done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is under different jurisdiction in other countries and that could be looked at as an option.  This is where the Minister lets us down.  I do not think he loses sleep at night worrying about traffic congestion in Dublin.  There are some public representatives who spend a lot of time thinking about how can we do this and that and, in fairness, the NTA listens.  What do we do between now and the time the first corridor is delivered?  Traffic congestion is growing.  An Taisce suggested this morning that the NTA did not look at the idea of a corridor on the M50 going from interchange to interchange.</p> <p>  My final, serious question relates to two areas in my constituency.  The 175 route has been introduced to essentially connect the green and red Luas lines.  My ultimate ambition would be to see a tramline do that.  There is sufficient road width and possibilities for very clever landscaping along almost entire sections of the roads that lead from the red Luas line to the green Luas line in Dundrum where there could be a dedicated and segregated bus corridor.  Is the core corridor design piece the only show in town for the next decade, or is there a possibility to add to that, or can local authorities do it if they feel there is a demand?  Must it be NTA led and will there be funding for other possible corridor projects that come up and are feasible in the interim period?</p></speech>

We are talking about the bus corridors specifically, which are important, but it is inevitable that we also raise points about BusConnects in general and some of the issues pertaining to the NTA.  I want to pick up on the point about privatisation because I questioned the Minister on that issue this morning.  It is true to say that more privatisation is pending because Bus &Eacute;ireann has been told its services on three more routes will be put out to tender.  The reality is that, in the last round, even though Bus &Eacute;ireann underbid Go-Ahead by &euro;3 million, it did not get the contract.  It seems the system is rigged in favour of private companies.</p> <p>  I have received lots of reports from bus workers that it is impossible for those workers to stay working in Go-Ahead for a long time because the starting salary and top rates of pay are between &euro;10,000 and &euro;14,000 less than Bus &Eacute;ireann workers are paid.</p></speech>

I am sure nobody is suggesting we do not.</p> <p>  I met Mr. Creegan at a public meeting in Blanchardstown where a lot of people came up to him and he probably had his ears burned off with people repeating the same things to him, mainly to do with the loss of local routes.  The pattern in all areas seems to be to create a giant corridor and a super route.  The problem is the number of routes feeding into the super route and therefore people feel, when they arrive at a hub in, say, the centre of Blanchardstown, which is one of the busiest shopping areas in the whole country, they are competing with people in neighbouring districts for the same buses.  That is why it has proven unpopular.  It has nothing to do with people not appreciating public transport.  The changes to routes Nos. 70 and 38 mean that a passenger has to get two buses when he or she previously had to get only one.</p><p>What it boils down to is we need investment to increase public transport and not just rejig what we currently have.  </p><p> A question was raised about metro north.  People's gardens will be cut across as a result of this project.  We all want to see bus lanes but there is a massive shortage of light rail.  There is a plan for Finglas but what about Blanchardstown?  We are talking about a large conurbation with 100,000 people relying on buses alone.  It cannot work for an area that is 10 km outside the city.  It is too far.  There are too many obstacles in the way, such as traffic lights and so on.  We have people suffering because they spend an hour and 20 minutes trying to get home from work.  Their quality of life is affected by it.  I would not have a problem with BusConnects if it was implemented in addition to what we already have, but I do not agree with taking away routes and rejigging them in this way.  Public consultation is going on with regard to the bus corridors.  I am sure people have been informed by the National Transport Authority.  It is a CPO process.  What happens if people refuse to cede their territory or space which they feel is important.  How will the issue of noise as a result of buses being closer to people's homes be addressed?  Will there be insulation or noise abatement measures?  I assume it will be an issue.  It is not just about ceding one's flower beds, for example, but about noise which can affect people's quality of life.  </p></speech>

When more than one, two or three people are involved, we cannot do land acquisition by agreement and have to use the compulsory purchase order process.  Our intention is to deal with people fairly and properly during the procedure.  We started to meet people.  For the first four corridors, 343 people were potentially affected.  We wrote to each of them in advance and invited them to contact us for a one-to-one meeting.  We have had about 40 meetings so far with people.  We are waiting for the remainder to contact us and we will meet them.</p> <p>  Noise abatement is something we will get into at the next stage of design.  We are really at the first step of concept design.  Later we have to do what used to be called an environmental impact statement, EIS.  It is now called an environmental impact assessment report.  In that, we will have to assess the noise impacts and the air quality impacts on all property.  If mitigation measures, of whatever type, are needed, we will do them.  It is far too early at this stage to say where we are affecting people to the point where we need to implement those measures.</p> <p>  The local routes in Blanchardstown was a theme that came up.  We got a lot of feedback from the consultation on the bus services.   It is taking us a lot of time to go through them.  A bag of 30,000 submissions is not a small one to go through.  We are working our way through it.  We will be redesigning the network to try to address most of the issues.  We will not be able to address them all but we are absolutely confident we can address many of them and still keep a better bus system.  Our only objective in doing it was to try to get a better bus system overall for people.  It will be a number of months before we finish the process and have something to go back out to consultation with and get people's feedback.  At that stage, we will not have solved everybody's problem but we would be disappointed if we had not solved a lot of them.  </p></speech>

I have said many times in the committee room that we do not consider the tendering of the bus services as privatisation of the services.  The routes remain managed by the NTA, a State agency.  It is a tendering of a service.  The State operators, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, are entitled to bid for the individual tenders.  The routes are controlled by us and the fares are managed by us.  There is no change other than the operator may change when we tender the services.</p></speech>

The money that accrues to Bus &Eacute;ireann, for example from bus fares, goes back to the State coffers.  That is what happens to any profit or surplus.  The money that accrues to the private company running the new routes accrues to the shareholders.  That is the difference.  It is a huge difference.  Workers' pay and conditions are the other difference.  Please do not insult us by suggesting there is no-----</p></speech>

A number of Deputies have asked why there was a staggered consultation.  The reason is we are undertaking quite a significant consultation on all 16 corridors.  We want to be in a position as an organisation to respond and be available for individual property owners.  That is the reason we staggered it and started with four corridors.  If we are talking about the potential number of property owners that could be impacted - up to 1,500 - we want to be in a position to organise one-to-one meetings as we have indicated.  That is the reason for the staggered consultation.</p> <p>  A number of Deputies asked why we were doing the corridor consultation without having completed the network consultation.  The corridors being proposed are needed.  The improvements in those corridors are needed no matter what network is being operated.  They are the 16 main corridors-----</p></speech>

Many bus services run down Gardiner Street, including Bus &Eacute;ireann services, so in the revised network design, we will look at whether the A spine should go down O'Connell Street with some other bus services on Gardiner Street or if it should stay the same.  We do not know yet.  We are certain that both O'Connell Street and Gardiner Street will be busy with buses.  While O'Connell Street effectively has bus priority by exclusion of cars, Gardiner Street does not, and we need to improve it.  We need bus priority on Gardiner Street for the current system and whatever system we have in the future.  That is why we put forward this.  It does not presuppose which route the current bus service will run down.</p> <p>  I have had the request about splitting the consultation from others.  There is a logic to that and we will consider it.  There is also a logic to keeping it together and managing it as a single corridor.  Will the committee give us the opportunity to consider it?  Resources to manage it are an issue.  If we had only one corridor to handle, it would be simple but we have 16 corridors around the city.  Starting to split them up in twos and getting requests to split them into threes makes it very-----</p></speech>

Senator Humphreys made a sensible suggestion about having two committees, which for the sake of this could be one from outside and one from inside the M50, which come together to consider the macro issues.  That would require more resources but seems useful.  As Senator Humphreys said, it is a matter for the Oireachtas if the NTA wants to request more resources.  There is an open door.  We want to get this right, not to be cheap.</p></speech>

We want to meet the need.  If that requires us to split, we will not deny that.  The Deputy asked if there were any plans for a second meeting.  The short answer is "yes".  This is not intended to be a one-off meeting.  We did not set a date for the second meeting because the idea was that at the first meeting, there would be a discussion of how frequently we would meet and when the next meeting would be.</p> <p>  Terms of reference were raised.  They are very short, being half a page of bullet points.  We are happy to circulate them to the committee.  The essence of them is to facilitate a two-way dialogue process.  It allows us to provide information more directly to people who are directly affected by the proposals and to answer people's queries.  Just as importantly, it allows people to give feedback and suggestions.  I am not blindly saying we will follow all the suggestions we will get.  I think Deputy Shortall asked if the proposals are cast in stone and if we are not for changing.  They are not cast in stone.  If there are good ideas and ways to do it better, we are in the market to do so.  There is a very difficult set of proposals in various places and if people have better ideas to make it better, we will change it.</p></speech>

There was a suggestion that there were more winners than losers with regard to traffic congestion.  We are discussing the bus corridors here, which is a matter of trying to provide more space for public transport and improving current services.  While existing services are provided primarily by Bus &Eacute;ireann along that corridor, their operating times are challenged as the road gets more congested.  This is a plan for ensuring that we have better reliability of journey times on those corridors and to avoid increasing congestion and journey times because they will get longer if we do not put in place this bus priority.</p></speech>

This is our proposal for dealing with congestion on bus corridors.  They are needed no matter what network of services are operated.  These main radial corridors into the city are the ones that will be used no matter what network of services we put in place.  That is our initial draft response, which is out for consultation, about how to manage growing congestion for our bus services.</p></speech>

All that we have put out are concept designs.  It is the first step in a long process before we end up with a final route where everything is honed to the nth degree.  With regard to the standard we are using, we produce the National Cycle Manual, which I think cycling groups would recognise is a solid, well thought-through standard.  We will apply that to the detailed design we do on all these corridors.  As we evolve through the design process, people will see most of the issues we are identifying now being resolved.  When we are trying to do 230km of design, it is concept level only and the final engineering details in their fine-tuned form will get them right at the next stage.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan mentioned junctions and bus stops.  Those both fall into that category.  It is at the next stage we get the details of junctions to be as good as they can be.  Details of bus stops are more difficult because there are two solutions and we sometimes do not have the space for the perfect solution, which is to bring the cycle route around the back of the bus stop, which I know most people would favour.  If we have the space, we try to deal with it, and if we do not have the space, we cannot.  We will fine tune that at the next stage.</p></speech>

The fear from the cycling community is that the concept seems to be that when we come to difficult pinch points, the first response is to remove cyclists from the road.  Yesterday, a cycling website released the initial drafts for Rathmines Road.  Peak morning cycling numbers on the road are 1,650 or so, with approximately 1,300 cars and vans.  Buses may have large numbers but compared to cars, cycling is the much bigger mode, yet the first response in getting this four-lane solution in everywhere is to narrow the footpaths in Rathmines and remove the cyclists in a way that is unworkable.  The concern is that the first concept design is to take out cyclists.</p></speech>

We are not commenting on anything that people might have seen anywhere at this stage.  To take the previous example the Deputy mentioned, in Fairview, we looked at many options to put in a continuous cycle route along the Malahide Road to Fairview.  We believe there are disadvantages to all the other options and the one we put forward is to reroute that section through the quiet roads of Marino, with a toucan crossing at Fairview to reconnect to the cycle route, and it is a reasonable solution.  Another solution we looked at was to further widen the road, which would have meant we would have to go further into people's properties on one side of the road, removing the opportunity to park in driveways, which they all currently do.</p><p>In widening these roads, we have tried to preserve the opportunity to park a car in the driveway in so far as we can, if that is what people were doing beforehand.  This is a consultation, however.  If people think we have got it wrong and that we should go with another solution, they need to tell us what alternative they would like and we will consider it and perhaps go in that direction, but we did not take these decisions lightly.  A lot of work went into making these decisions before we came up with what we put out there.</p></speech>

Surely that is something that should be addressed from the start separately with representatives of the cycling community, rather than them having to go along to each of the consultative forums and make the case there.  This is an overarching issue on the design standard.  Can that be resolved between the NTA and the cycling community?</p></speech>

We have put out only concept designs and people are interrogating them as if they are detailed designs.  On the engagement with one of the cycling groups, as recently as today we responded to them saying that, at the end of the consultation period, we are happy to start meeting with them because we will be then going into the design phase.  In the meantime, however, they should put in their submission, identifying their issues.  We have committed to starting an engagement at the end of the consultation process and if there are details that need to be changed we will take them on board at that stage.

In all of the four corridor plans we have published, those corridors require upgrading no matter what bus network is put in place because they are all the vital routes on the north side and they need to be done.  When we publish the south side corridor plans, we can discuss Nutley Lane at that stage but we have not published it yet.</p> <p>  We have answered about the community forums and independent chairs.</p> <p>  On sustainable drainage systems, SuDS, we will be of course taking that into account during the design stage.  I repeat my phrase that it is concept only and we have not gone into it yet.  We know that people have been affected by our publication of plans but the reality is that we can publish them only as we get them to a certain stage and all 16 corridor plans will be published by mid February, which is less than two months away.  At that stage the details will be out there and people can form their views based on whether they are affected or not.</p></speech>

As we dedicate more space to the bus lanes in the city centre, it will have the same net effect as applying congestion charges because there will be less space available to cars and therefore fewer cars will be going into the city centre.</p> <p>  On the Pigeon House Road, the Senator mentioned that it is only an indicative line, and that is correct.  That corridor plan will be published in mid February and the full details for that Ringsend corridor will be available at that stage.</p></speech>

Can I confirm that we have the same understanding of the compulsory purchase order as the NTA?  My understanding is that letters have gone out on the north side.  The NTA has offered the meetings and it will cover people's costs on whatever experts or legal advice will be needed under the CPO structure.  Once the letters have gone out, the NTA is entitled to survey the property and surveyors enter the property to ensure the design and the work can be carried out prior to an agreement being made on the financial settlement.  Are we all of the same understanding on that CPO process or have I got the NTA's thinking wrong in any manner there?  We need absolute clarity on this because this is the level of detailed question that every member-----</p></speech>

We covered that in saying the corridors we have out for consultation are required no matter what network of services is put in place because they are the main and most busy radial corridors into the city centre.</p> <p>  We covered the CPO powers, and the other issue the Deputy raised was that the whole thing is a mess and confusing and he questioned whether we would start one project and then continue with the others.  We make no apology for bringing forward all of these projects together because the city needs them and congestion is growing.  We need to move on all aspects of our public transport system - metro, bus and rail - and there is an urgency about delivering these projects for the city.  While I know it is difficult for communities when a lot of consultation is going on at the same time or even on a staggered basis, we need to bring forward these projects and start delivering them because there is a timeline in terms of planning and construction before we will actually see these improvements.  We are ambitious to get these projects moving and get them to a point of an agreed planning permission and then we will move into construction.  That is what we are proposing to do.</p> <p>  On the Go-Ahead services that have commenced operation, we agree that there have been a few teething issues that have resulted in some complaints but we believe they will work themselves out.  There are issues related to changing operator as well as service timetables and these are beginning to calm down now and the services are operating well.  Something else that has particularly impacted on the 17A is congestion.</p><p>The commencement of that service at a time when there was a big build-up of congestion, particularly in the lead up to Christmas, has caused difficulties for running times.  We will make any amendments that need to be made to improve reliability with Go-Ahead Ireland.  The services will certainly bed down and we need to give them at least a number of weeks and months of operation before making a judgment on them.</p></speech>

I am sure that number would be even more.  With its potential impact, why have we not completed that process but jumped to this instead?  I know we must improve standards and do things but it is in the programme for Government to build metro north.  Why have we not concentrated efforts to get this over the line before looking at the routes or corridors we are discussing today?  I agree with Deputy Shortall in many ways.  The routes in general have worked very well but the areas of congestion are the problem, for example, the likes of Hart's Corner.  The concentration should have been on such locations in order to get solutions.  At that stage we could look even more at improving corridors.  The ordinary routes should have seen more examination.  Many of them should have been left alone as they were hard fought for by communities.  Now there is uproar over them.  I could go through the list in my area, and I have already outlined this to Mr. Creegan.  What is happening with metro north and why have we not pushed on even more with it?</p></speech>

I am sorry I am late and I did not hear the other exchanges.  I will speak to BusConnects and the issues we are having.  I engaged with Mr. Creegan on the Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and the proposal to have it as the transport hub.  In Dublin 15 one can see the gridlock now because of the Christmas shopping period but there is planning for a potential transport hub there.  The upgrade of the exchange has been mentioned.  Some of the infrastructure proposals around bus lanes are welcome as they will address congestion matters and the connectivity of our bus network.  The route issue is being parked while other elements are being progressed but in many ways these are intertwined.</p> <p>  Are there plans for alternative bus lanes aside from those that have been mentioned?  If a spinal bus network is being planned, which is what is outlined, with very little mention of other bus lane development, what are the plans for alternative bus lanes in village areas outside the spinal routes?  What is the capital plan for those?  If the route system committed to is be amended, there must be capital expenditure to address congestion issues where there are existing radial routes connecting with towns.  Will there be a future phase of this bus corridor process in addition to what has been announced?  This is linked to the spinal proposals from the route system but if there are no provisions for any additional bus lanes, it may potentially undermine the route system.</p> <p>  As Deputy Ellis mentioned, the changes to routes have caused significant concern across communities.  One of the designers, Jarrett Walker and Associates, indicated that minor changes to the route system would collapse the plan as designed.  Has Mr. Walker been sidelined in the route system design and, if so, who is redesigning the route?</p></speech>

How can those remarks be squared with what has been agreed?  The public has concerns that while this project continues to plough on, the route issues will not be addressed.  Will the witnesses answer those questions?</p> <p>  There are significant issues with parking in the Dublin suburbs for people using BusConnects, train and Luas stations.  What plans are in place to increase parking capacity in peripheral areas and where we want people to use this BusConnects route network?  Are the difficulties being addressed with companies over which the NTA has jurisdiction, specifically Irish Rail, with regard to the increasing fees?  We are trying to encourage people to use public transport and next door there is a meeting of the climate change committee, whose members are blue in the face trying to encourage people to use public transport.  People are being ripped off by Irish Rail and other entities increasing their parking fees and discouraging the use of public transport.  The NTA must come on board and encourage people to use the parking capacity.  It is currently discouraging that use.</p> <p>  I also ask about growth projections.  I can speak only for west Dublin about the BusConnects plan.  Even with the bus lane system, much of what BusConnects contains does not future-proof the bus network.  Many areas will see a large growth in population over the next five to ten years.  What planning is being done to ensure the bus network can be amended and infrastructure put in place to take into account the national planning framework and future population changes?  There has been some concern about this.</p><p>There will be decreased transport connectivity in areas where there will be huge population growth in the next three to five years.</p></speech>

Mr. Creegan spoke about the need to reduce the number of people travelling in cars to and from the city.  The provision of a park and ride facility somewhere along the M1 would be of huge benefit.  While that does not form part of the BusConnects project, could such a facility be linked to the provision of new bus services?</p></speech>

We have not done a lot of work on them because until such time as the bus lanes have been put in place to ensure people can travel quickly from those parking sites, they will not work.  We will work on them in the not too distant future because once we have done the investment in the bus lanes we will want to maximise what they can achieve.</p> <p>  On the congestion issues at Blanchardstown Shopping Centre and how BusConnects will work there - an issue that has arisen again and again in the consultations - the proposals we published provide for continuous bus lanes for the bus in and out of that hub.  While there will be congestion in Blanchardstown town centre, the bus will get in and out of it via a bus lane because it should be free of traffic, assuming it is enforced properly.  The plans for those bus lanes are in the published document.</p></speech>

On the question of whether there are plans for other bus lanes and future phases, these are not the only corridors that should have bus lanes on them.  There needs to be more in Dublin.  Deputy Lahart asked about urban bus corridors.  We do want to provide urban corridors and they are part of the transport strategy but as we have to start somewhere we are staring with the radial routes into the city centre.  When that work is completed we will see what else can be added.</p> <p>  On the bus network redesign, the submissions and the level of change, the comment made at the time was that up to 15% was easy to accommodate but above 15% the concept of the system began to unravel.  Our job is to work through the submissions received and to identify the changes that address the issues raised.  We are not looking at a percentage; we are looking at how we address the issues raised.  Whatever that number comes out at, so be it.    </p> <p>  On growth projections and what planning is being made to allow for future growth, BusConnects is at the heart of growth.  We are trying to put in place the infrastructure and, ultimately, improved services with which people are happy, that can be scaled up to cater for additional growth areas, which I know exist in Dublin 15.</p></speech>

There are capacity constraints on car parks on the rail and Luas lines.  It is not easy to increase that capacity, particularly within the city but where we can, working with TII and Irish Rail, we will put in additional capacity.  On car parking fees, it is a requirement generally to have a fee because without a fee parking tends to be used for other parking-----</p></speech>

In the intervening period, Fingal County Council, supported by the NTA, will develop a bus based park and ride site close to the location.  The service to be provided, the route and so on have yet to be decided but a bus based park and ride facility is being developed.  We can route bus services through the Dublin port tunnel, which means this corridor will not be like others that have a slow journey into the city centre.  I cannot say how soon it will be up and running but in fairness to the council it is proceeding as vigorously as it can.</p></speech>

The roads on the approach to the city are very narrow and it takes a significant amount of time to get through Gardiner Street.  The tunnel is regularly congested at particular times of the day.  I have previously raised the issue of congestion at the barriers caused by the failure of the system to recognise toll tags and so on.  This is also a problem at the East Link.  Increasingly, there is need for the barriers there to be manned to enable people to get through because mechanisms are not functioning properly.  I do not expect the witnesses to be able to respond on that issue today but I would welcome a written response on it.</p></speech>

Earlier, we had a discussion on the routes.  The NTA is revising those routes and I expect we will have a future discussion on the new routes.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that I have engaged many times with the NTA in the past year.  I look forward to inviting it for one more round of discussions when it publishes the revisions.</p> <p>  I want now to focus on the contentious point of the four proposed bus corridor routes, which is what we are here to talk about today.  Mr. Creegan kindly met the Chairman, myself and a few other committee members.  During that meeting he flagged that he understood this issue would be the crucial, crunch point of the bus corridor project.  It has been the main focus since the initial report was launched in June 2018.</p><p>It regards the proposal to make the road through Santry village one way for vehicular traffic, with a two-way bus lane.  Obviously, this poses grave concerns for residents and employers in Santry, as well as the Omni Park shopping centre which registers 2.9 million car movements in and 2.9 million out per year.  The centre is responsible for approximately 1,850 jobs.</p></speech>

It would also lead to potential rat runs into Lorcan Road, Shanrath, etc. This is of grave concern for many residents in the constituency.  Is there a plan B? Although these are called continuous bus corridors, CBCs, would it be possible to suspend its continuous nature for the relevant stretch of road, a mere 200 m to 300 m, which is all that would be required?  Have projections been made regarding the outcome if the continuous bus corridor was suspended for that stretch?  If not, can such traffic projection be carried out?  We are talking about a 12 km bus corridor but this short 200 m to 300 m stretch is causing all of the anxiety regarding the bus corridor.  Public representatives, residents, and those in the NTA need to think outside the box on this issue.  We can resolve it.  Does the NTA have any proposals at this stage or has it previously examined alternatives?  Have traffic projections been carried out regarding the outcome if that bus corridor were to be suspended?  As I mentioned, the restriction of the current 5.8 million annual car movements in Omni Park shopping centre would lead to a loss of jobs.  The shopping centre has compiled a submission to the NTA and I have met engineers who have proposed several alternatives.</p> <p>  The proposal would lead to additional car movements.   Many local journeys from areas such as Shanliss, where I live, and Shanowen would treble in length as a consequence of the proposed change to a one-way system.  That would obviously run entirely counter to what Ms Graham mentioned in her opening statement with regard to reducing carbon emissions and would undercut one of the key principles of the BusConnects campaign, which is to reduce carbon emissions and make more people use public transport.  This proposal would inadvertently increase carbon emissions along the bus corridor, which does not seem to run in line with the principles Ms Graham set down.  What are her thoughts in that regard?</p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that, as Mr. Creegan rightly predicted, the Santry village issue is proving the key bone of contention with regard to the bus corridors.  I am not in the business of being against things for the sake of it but I do flag concerns.  I delivered my November submissions to the NTA office.  It is 12 December and my submissions for December, which I have before me, are already substantial.  Many people are rightly very exercised about this issue.  It will affect their lives, commutes, houses, house prices, and the journeys they have made for many years.  I hope the NTA has a plan B in mind.  I ask Ms Graham or Mr. Creegan to respond to my questions on the traffic impacts if the continuous bus corridor were to be suspended for that 200 m or 300 m stretch.</p></speech>

We are now in a similar situation in regard to the proposal for the Swords corridor and its impact on the Swords Road between Shantalla bridge and Omni Park shopping centre.  Those of us who live in or represent those living in the area know this will not work.  There is a unanimous view among all residents' associations in the area that the proposals will not work because the impact on the movement of traffic will be so great that there will be only losers.  There are no winners in what is being proposed for people living in the greater Whitehall, Santry and Beaumont areas.</p> <p>  The impacts would be enormous.  There are impacts on business in terms of cars exiting Omni Park shopping centre being able to turn only left.  It is currently chaotic there at weekends.  There are long tailbacks to exit the shopping centre where there are currently the options to turn left or right or to go straight on.   If there is no option but to turn left, it will cause chaos in the area.  The Swords Road is mentioned every day on "AA Roadwatch".  There is no doubt about that.  I listen out for it every morning on "Morning Ireland".  It features every morning because of the difficulties in access there.  If the NTA is proposing to divert a significant amount of other traffic down that road to try to access the Santry bypass it will add enormously to current traffic chaos in the area.  </p> <p>  There is a grave concern among residents living in the Shanrath, Shanvarna and Lorcan areas which would undoubtedly be used as rat runs.  Many people trying to avoid the traffic jams on the Santry bypass would undoubtedly drive down the Swords Road and take a left turn into Lorcan to use it as a rat run to Shantalla bridge.  There is no way of stopping that other than completely banning traffic within that estate, which is not possible.  In regard to residents of Santry west, those who currently drive down Shanowen Road and take a right turn into town would not be able to do so under these plans.  All of those motorists would be forced back west onto Collins Avenue, which is currently chaotic because of the growth of DCU.  Traffic is currently almost at a standstill.  If these proposals are proceeded with, it will cause further chaos.  That will not work.</p> <p>  There are several small businesses along the relevant stretch of the Swords Road.  The NTA is proposing not only to restrict the traffic passing those businesses but also to take away almost all of the on-street parking.  That would kill those businesses.</p> <p>  We must revisit this proposal.  We cannot proceed with it as currently envisaged.  A very short stretch of the overall corridor is causing the difficulties locally and that must be revisited.  There are alternatives which could be considered.  Creating a one-way system on that short stretch of the Swords Road will bung up the rest of the greater Whitehall, Santry and Beaumont area.  That decision must be revisited.</p> <p>  Residents are concerned and they do not wish to engage in a talking shop.  They want to know that if they study the figures, get involved in the process and attend the community forum they can have an impact on the decision.  That does not mean tinkering with the current proposals but, rather, that the NTA is prepared to consider a radical change from what is currently on the cards.</p><p>People find it very difficult to understand how the officials have come up with these proposals when they know the impact they are likely to have.  Local people know these proposals will probably cause absolute chaos and make people prisoners in their own homes.  That is why questions have been asked about the underlying studies that have been done on the current base traffic figures.  Has the NTA modelled the impact of a one-way system on that stretch of the Swords Road?  Can we have access to those figures?  If a solution can be found that involves the removal of the current proposal, I think it will be possible to reach agreement on this corridor.  As things stand, it is just not a runner.</p></speech>

It has related predominantly to the first phase.  All of the phases are equally important because each of them will have an impact on the city.  I ask the Chairman to facilitate similar meetings of this committee when the second and third phases are up and running to ensure all parts of the city are treated in the same way.</p> <p>  I have two questions for the NTA.  One of them was asked earlier and partially answered.  The projects that have been undertaken are very important for Dublin city and the sustainability of transport in the city.  Have extra resources been provided?  What level of extra resources is the NTA looking for?  When did it ask for those resources to be given to it?</p> <p>  My second question for the NTA relates to studies and models.  When efforts are made to improve public transport and cycling infrastructure, there is always a kickback from motorists and traders.  It is suggested that motorists will not be able to come into the city to spend money and there will be a substantial loss of business as a result.  I am aware of an old DIT study which found that people who travel on public transport or cycle stay in Dublin city centre for longer periods and spend more money.  The original perception was that one needed to have a car to come into the city centre in order for the city centre to work.  I wonder whether any modern studies on spending power and additional businesses are available.  It is always said that there will be a reduction in the business of a shopping centre when a change like this is made, but the opposite can be the case.  I wonder whether the NTA has accessed the studies that have been done which show the impact on business - whether business is lost or gained - when public transport and cycling infrastructure is improved.  That is all.</p></speech>

The question of Santry has been raised by members and substitute members today.  If it is necessary for the committee to go to Santry to consider that matter, we should do so.  It will probably be resolved by looking at maps and getting another solution.  It is essential that we look at other options at this stage.  Does Deputy Ellis want to say anything?</p></speech>

There is absolutely no doubt the proposal for dealing with this major problem will be very contentious.  If it goes ahead, areas like Lorcan Drive and Shanrath Road will end up as rat-runs.  That is just the first problem.  Hart's Corner will be probably an even bigger problem to solve.  That is why I am saying we should have addressed all of these possibilities to see what could be done before we went down the road of going through massive consultation.  We should have looked at what could be worked on and implemented.  We should have looked at the effects on the running of buses of this approach when it is up and running.  We should have concentrated on the bottlenecks.  I think we are running into major problems because of our failure to take this approach to the matter.  This is only the start of it.  We will continue to run into problems.</p> <p>  The metro north proposal was on the table before this process began.  There had been a great deal of consultation on that proposal.  The possibility of park and ride up at the M50, which has been mentioned, was part of the metro north proposal.  What was the procedure in terms of talking to the various Departments?  Did we not say it would be far better to push forward with metro north and finish it at an earlier date than to go down this road?  The proposal to which I refer would take approximately 70,000 cars a week off the road across the city and across the country.  People would be coming in not just from Ballymun and the whole area right down along this route, but from every area.  This proposal would affect the whole city.  I think we have jumped from one scheme onto another scheme.  We should have concentrated-----</p></speech>

We know how difficult Santry is.  There is a problem for the bus system in Santry.  It takes a long time for buses to get through the Santry area.  We did a great deal of work to examine what the best thing to do might be.  We struggled to come up with a better solution than the solution we are proposing.  We do not underestimate the challenges.  We do not have a plan B sitting in our pocket.  We have thought about whether we could add lane capacity on the section of road from Coolock Lane roundabout down to Shantalla Bridge.  It is possible that we could add a third lane there.  If we could put extra traffic onto that link, it would ease the pressure on it.  However, that would not address the fact that if this proposal goes ahead, there will be a one-way system through Santry.</p> <p>  We would love to have another solution.  The Deputies said there are alternatives.  If there is an alternative that enables us to get the bus system working reasonably well through there - it does not have to be perfect - while preserving what people want, we would love to explore it.  A great deal of genuine effort went into examining the various options.  We looked at what we would need to do to fit in a fourth lane.  None of the options was very palatable.  The only thing we have in our back pocket is the possibility of a third lane southbound on the Santry bypass between Coolock Lane and Shantalla Bridge.  We have not done a design, so we will have to check whether it is technically possible.  We will have to get TII to say it is okay with it, but it still might not be enough.  When we were doing this work, we were very conscious of the Omni Park shopping centre.  Members will notice that it will be possible to access the shopping centre from all the routes that are currently used to access it.  There will be an issue with leaving the shopping centre.  The entrance to the centre will remain the same, but people will have to turn left when leaving it.  I know there is congestion at the Omni Park shopping centre at the moment.  I think it would work better if cars had to turn left when leaving the centre.  That is a small point.  It is cold comfort to the shopping centre.  The junction would perform slightly better if those leaving the centre had to turn left. </p> <p>  One of the Deputies spoke about making the consultative forum useful.  If people can bring to it ideas that work, it will be up to us to develop them.  If we can get an alternative that does most of what we are trying to do now, it will be great if it works.  We would love to do it.  I think that is probably all I can say on that matter.</p> <p>  Some traffic modelling was done a couple of years ago, but not enough was done to be able to provide it in a useable format.  Our intention on all of the corridors is to do traffic modelling at the next stage.  We are putting our hands up and saying these interventions will cause extra traffic congestion on other routes.  That is just the reality.  We do not need a model to tell us that.  We know it will be the reality.  We will do detailed transport modelling at the next stage of the process.  We will issue it to whoever wants it.  There will be no difficulty with that.  We do not have it at this stage.</p></speech>

That is the second reality.  While MetroLink north is important, it is a corridor that covers only about 5% of the Dublin area.  The catchment area is roughly 5%.  There are a lot of potential users but one still has 90% to 95% of Dublin that need something better rather than having to wait ten years for MetroLink to be finished and to start at that point.  Our view is that MetroLink needs to proceed but BusConnects also needs to proceed.</p></speech>

The proposals we are putting forward are to deal with the growing congestion in the city.  It is about trying to encourage more people to use public transport as part of their journeys and giving priority to public transport and sustainable transport.  That means the space is not available for car users.  That possibly increases journey times for those that use their cars but we have to start giving priority to the bus where we possibly can.  We always said it would be challenging and would cause impacts locally but the aim is to try to improve sustainable transport and bus priority.  We would not propose something that would make it worse for buses.  What we are about is making it better for buses and bus users and encouraging more people to use buses and means of transport other than the car.</p></speech>

That is the case regardless of the time of day, be it 6 a.m. or 10 p.m.  I travel frequently at both of those times.  Is there a possibility of creating additional lanes from the airport going north where there is significant congestion?  Traffic is bumper to bumper.</p></speech>
