    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Fitzmaurice.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p> <p>  In the first session of today's meeting, we will examine regulations and verification systems of online sales of pets.  In the second session we will resume our examination of canine welfare, including artificial canine insemination, canine fertility clinics, ear cropping and microchipping.  The committee will hear from representatives of Fido and Dogs.ie in the first session and representatives from the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine in the second session.</p> <p>  On 28 February, legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings was removed.  However, it is still good practice to use face coverings, particularly in crowded areas.  The service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks when moving around the campus and in close proximity to others.  While the easing of restrictions removed the general requirement of for 2 metre physical distancing, public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important that everybody in the parliamentary community continues to be respectful of other people's space.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurance in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when they are contributing.<br/><br/>In the first session today, we are joined from Dogs.ie by Mr. Paul Savage, founder, and Dr. Finbarr Heslin, chief executive officer, and from Fido by Mr. Timothy McMullen, chief operations officer<i>.</i>I welcome the witnesses and invite them to make their opening statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Savage" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#B00200"><p>It is my pleasure and honour to be here today to speak with members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the topic of the post-enactment scrutiny of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the subsequent Microchipping of Dogs Regulations, MODR, 2015, and the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019 with regards to activities around regulations and verification systems of online sales of pets, specifically pet dogs.<br/><br/>I am the founder of Dogs.ie, an online classified ads marketplace.  We specialise in listings for dogs for sale and dogs for stud.  Dogs.ie has been online since 2008 and was set up to cater for the Irish people&rsquo;s great love of pet dogs.  It is estimated that our island is home to over 450,000 pet dogs, while there are also nine native Irish breeds of dogs that are recognised around the world for their beauty and excellent character.  Dogs rank as the number one pet in Irish households.<br/><br/>Since our foundation, the way Irish people have looked for pet dogs has undergone fundamental changes, including advertising moving primarily online.  Meanwhile, more recently, pet ownership numbers have also increased substantially since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020.  Last month, February 2022, approximately 2,000 dogs and puppies were listed for sale on our site.  These advertisements are from private individuals, registered sellers of pets and registered breeding establishments.  Approximately 250,000 people visit our site each month.  They are generally looking to get general information on owning a dog, find a new pet dog, sell their dog or find a new sire or dam for their next litter.<br/><br/>In order to sell on our platform, all advertisements for dogs for sale are required to contain certain information, as per the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019.  This includes the date of birth, country of birth and microchip number, which has to be registered with one of the four approved dog identification databases, namely, Animark, Fido, the Irish Kennel Club and MicroDogID.  Advertisements must also include any relevant registrations or licence number, such as a registered seller ID from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or a registered breeding establishment licence number from one of the 31 local authorities.<br/><br/>At Dogs.ie, we pride ourselves in bringing a high level of trust and transparency to online pet sales.  We have some additional systems and rules that go beyond the legal requirement.  For example, all users are verified by SMS and only one phone number can be linked to a single account.  While it is possible to import dogs with cropped ears or doges that have been declawed, we do not accept these ads.  Puppies have to be at least seven weeks old before they can be advertised for sale on our site.  We limit certain payment methods from being used, such as virtual and prepaid credit cards and one-time credit card numbers.  For registered breeding establishments, we also include the number of breeding bitches included on their licence, helping to share the scale of these operations.<br/><br/>Beyond these measures, since 2020, we have been working closely together with Fido on ways to provide more transparency and trust in the information presented in our ads.  This work is largely based on a publication from Four Paws, entitled the Model Solution.  Four Paws is a global animal welfare organisation based in Austria.  One of its initiatives is to ensure that the owner of the dog is actually the person selling the dog, and that the details match the information contained on the microchip certificate.  This is where the Europetnet&rsquo;s Veripet<b><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></b>system comes into play.  It works as follows.  Users enter the microchip number of the dog they would like to sell.  They also add in a unique owner PIN that is printed on each certificate.  The Europetnet&rsquo;s Veripet<b></b>system checks to see if the details match and if they do, it then sends the user a one-time passcode to the registered email address or phone number on the certificate in order to confirm ownership.  The Veripet<b><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></b>system can also send back information about the dog.  Currently, we use this system to collect data on the sex of the dog, which avoids microchips being used for other dogs.  Finally, the Veripet<b><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font></b>system also provides a verification link for potential buyers to see certain information about the dog.  This link is added into the advertisement automatically and goes to the identification and registration database.  It should be noted, in relation to data protection and information about a dog, that its breed, date of birth, sex and colouring, are not relevant in a GDPR setting.  Since September 2021, when we launched this, over 5,000 of these verifications have been done.  This is approximately 35% of the dogs listed for sale.<br/><br/>On our site, we have three types of sellers, private individual sellers, registered sellers and registered breeding establishments.  Private individual sellers are people who sell fewer than six dogs a year.  Registered sellers are people who are registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They sell six or more dogs per calendar year, but have fewer than six breeding bitches.  Their registered seller ID is included in the ad.  There are approximately 1,400 individuals, charities and businesses currently registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and over 950 of them have an account with Dogs.ie.  Registered breeding establishments are those that are licensed by their local authority and have six or more breeding bitches.  Their number if the registered breeding establishment and the maximum number of breeding bitches as per the breeding establishment's licence are s included in the ad.  There are approximately 120 registered breeding establishments in Ireland, approximately 80 of which have an account with Dogs.ie.  <br/><br/>We also offer a free dog buying contract template to make sure all the right information is captured and exchanged when a dog is sold.  Trust, safety and transparency are paramount to us at Dogs.ie.  We want to make selling and buying dogs online safer for everyone.  Helping sellers to stay in compliance with their legal obligations is a critical component of this.  Each ad is carefully reviewed before being published on our platform.  Furthermore, we believe strongly in helping our pet rescues and charities around the country.  To assist in the fantastic work these organisations do, we offer support for rehoming charities, providing free accounts for them to advertise dogs for which they need assistance finding new homes.  With one in four households in Ireland estimated to be owners of dogs, we believe we can play a small role in helping the people of this island with their pets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finbarr Heslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak on the topic of verification systems used in online sales of pets, namely, pet dogs, subsequent to the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019.  Fido is one of four databases approved by the Minister under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 for the registration and storage of the details of dogs, their owners and the identifying microchips of those dogs in Ireland.  Fido&rsquo;s work in this area predates the 2015 regulations by over a decade, and in almost 20 years of work, we have registered and stored the details of almost 1 million pets.</p> <p>  MODR 2015 is viewed across Europe as an excellent example of how mandatory identification and registration can be legislated for.  Several components of the regulations have made it a robust statute.  The absence of self-certification, the requirement of the database to time-stamp each transaction and record the details of the person entering the details, the requirement for photo ID and proof of address, and the fact that most data are veterinary certified have all contributed to high-quality data being collected.  Every year, thousands of dogs are reunited with their owners when they get lost because of microchips.</p> <p>  Fido has always worked extensively with animal welfare groups and charities.  As far back as 2013, we wrote the IT code for a system to provide for independent verification of advertised pets, as we were aware of the massive issues associated with the illegal puppy trade.  In the intervening years, and especially during Covid, these problems have got worse, with the cost of pups making puppy production incredibly lucrative.  Our verification system was presented to the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group, IPAAG, as far back as 2016, but none of the online advertising platforms introduced the system.  After the Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations were introduced in 2019, the major online pet advertiser withdrew from the market.  Since then, Fido has collaborated with the current main online pet marketplace, Dogs.ie, to introduce the verification system.  As Mr. Savage said, it went live in November 2021.</p> <p>  Ireland is in a unique position in that we are the first country in Europe to have a statutory requirement for verification of the details of a dog being advertised for sale or supply.  There are several requirements now for advertising animals, but Fido's sole competency in this area is the verification of the microchip number, as Regulation 8(c) states that in the case of a dog, the unique code of the microchip implanted into the animal must be shown.</p><p>When the regulations were introduced, many advertisers simply put in fake microchip numbers, adding no improved traceability or transparency to the ads and doing little to improve consumer protection.  The Fido PetSAFE system had been developed to overcome this practice.</p><p> Anyone who has purchased anything online will most likely have used a two-step authentication system to pay for it.  This is where the purchaser's bank sends a verification link to the mobile phone number associated with the credit card account used to ensure that no fraud is being committed.  Veripet is a similar technology.  With the Veripet application programming interface, API, only the registered owner of a dog is allowed to advertise the dog for sale.  The registered owner's details have been independently verified and his or her proof of identity and proof of address have been seen, in most cases by a veterinary surgeon, and certified in the database.  When placing an advertisement on a participating classified ad site, the seller will need to provide the dog's microchip number along with his or her mobile phone number or email address.  The Veripet API will then carry out an automatic check with the pet registration database that the details match.  If they do, a one-time code will be sent to the registered owner of the dog and that code will need to be added to the advertisement in order for it to go live.</p><p> As for the detailed steps of how the technical system works, the pet owner or breeder registers the dog on a Department-approved database.  The pet owner visits a classified ad site, enters the microchip ID for the dog into the relevant field on the classified ad site, the microchip number for the dog is checked against the information on the database, and a one-time passcode is sent to the telephone number of the pet owner on the database.  The IT system developed by Fido has now been integrated into Europetnet to give a federated system across Europe.  This will go live in Switzerland in the coming months, with France, Norway and the UK also looking to implement it on the basis of its success in Ireland.</p><p> We have been presented with many reasons not to introduce this system by advertisers, but the technical solution provided by Fido has been extensively trialled live in the marketplace and is proven to work, with several thousand ads having now been verified.  GDPR concerns are dealt with at the advertisement platform level, which allows for the independently verified details stored on the database to be released to the new owner if there are problems with the pup and the new owner cannot contact the vendor.</p><p> Since implementation of the system, some issues have arisen.  First, there is little or no recognition by the public of the difference between a verified ad and a non-verified ad.  Second, no prominence is given to verified ads on sites, and there is little explanation of what this verification means and how it improves customer protection.  Third, Fido is the only database using this system, and that invariably leads to rogue breeders using other databases as it is easier to get their dogs posted on ad sites.  Fourth, some quality-of-data issues have been observed.  If the person registering the pup's details initially enters incorrect data such as an incorrect mobile phone number, the owner cannot receive the one-time passcode to allow the ad to be posted.  Fifth, other verification systems for non-Veripet verification are not robust.  They are subject to fraud, altered certs, old certs, reused certs and fake certs.  Sixth, other databases are not on board, and there appears to be no incentive to be on board the system.  In reality, there is no advantage to Fido in being on board.  Seventh, if there are different "levels" of verification available to prospective advertisers, the rogue producers will always gravitate to the easiest and least robust system.</p><p> It is not possible for an unregistered owner to advertise an animal on a marketplace that allows only ads that are verified through the system.  What we have found is that rogue breeders and those who want to circumvent the system will register their animals on a database that does not have the same controls in place.  Manual verification of these animals by the online advertiser is not robust and is easily circumvented by using old certs, falsified certs, previous owners' certs or other means.</p><p> The simplest solution is that advertisement sites publish only ads with microchips verified to the same level as Veripet, whether that is a voluntary code of practice decision or a legally mandated one.  Nothing in the current regulations compels the databases to provide this verification.  If, however, the online platforms did not allow non-verified ads to be posted, it would compel databases that are not on board to join the system because their clients, who will not be able to sell pets without proper verification, will demand that.  Manual authentication and verification is simply not robust enough to provide the verification that the spirit of the regulations sought.</p><p> The Veripet system works, and all adverts for dogs in Ireland should be verified through it, or through an authentication system with comparable levels of security, probity and transparency.  This will give consumers the protection they deserve when completing what can be expensive purchases.  We are always available to the committee to elaborate on any points about the system that may be unclear.  Again, I thank the committee members for their time.  Because of time pressures, we have kept much of the technical detail out of this presentation, but API documentation and further technical specifications are available should any member require them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#C00200"><p>Sorry, Mr. Heslin.  I did not realise there were two opening statements.  I printed off only one before I came down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#C00300"><p>I thank both witnesses.  Mr. Heslin summed up the issue at the end in his points about Fido and the database.  Fido is trying to do the right thing, but if this is not legally mandated, its competitors will not comply and then unscrupulous breeders will be driven to those databases.  Does Mr. Heslin think the review of the microchip legislation needs to mandate that all the online sale platforms and all the databases that hold microchip numbers be uniform in what they are obliged to do?  If Mr. Heslin wishes to answer that question first, then I will come back in with some of my other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finbarr Heslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#C00400"><p>As I said, we have been working on this since 2013.  We were constantly producing code that allowed some form of verification and we used to present it to what was at that point the biggest marketplace in operation, and there was always a reason they did not want to implement it.  When the regulations came in there was even an argument as to whether or not an online platform was subject to these regulations at all.  We saw the laughable situation whereby microchip numbers that had been just pulled out of the air were used to facilitate the advertisement of pets.  There was no consumer protection in this.  With the Veripet system, it is now proven that there is a system that is instant and that works.  It is now being used across Europe, in much more complicated marketplaces than Ireland's, so the short answer to the Senator's question is "absolutely".  I do not know if there will be a voluntary code of practice that will compel enough of the databases to do this correctly and to the same level.  As for all the arguments against using a system, the coding is there, it is not difficult, it is not dear and very little needs to be done on the other end.  We have given this code to Europetnet, which is a non-governmental body based in Brussels, for roll-out across Europe, so there is nothing for Fido in this.  We just want to do the right thing.  The statistics to which Mr. Savage has alluded, with verification of 35% of dogs advertised, tell their own story.  That means that nothing in these regulations has contributed to an improved consumer protection for the 65% of people who have bought dogs via ads since November.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#C00500"><p>As for the 65%, one of the problems is that the Minister's response when we bring this up - and I have brought it up in the Seanad - is that the public need to do their homework and their research if they are going to buy a pup rather than going to a rescue.  The problem, however, is that they cannot do their research because they do not know what a proper microchip number or a proper dog breeding establishment, DBE, number looks like.  Even if they have the proper DBE number, they then have to try to find out information from the local authority, and not all the information is given.  My argument, therefore, is that buyers cannot do their homework if the online platforms do not do their homework.  In fairness to Dogs.ie, it is doing that in conjunction with Fido.</p> <p>  Other points have been made to us.  This probably has to be brought in across the board for the four different databases.  What information is contained on a Fido microchip?  Would Fido have any objection to increasing the amount of information on the microchips, whether the colouring, sex or age of the dog or where the dog was bred, if that information is available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finbarr Heslin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022033000002#C00600"><p>To be clear, a microchip is an inert piece of hardware and has only one piece of information on it, that is, a world-unique 15-digit code.</p><p>It is worthless to have that in a dog unless it is registered.<br/><br/>As to the details the Senator is looking for, we are mandated under the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 to register, store and verify 13 different pieces of information associated with that ownership - the dog's colour, date of birth, sex, breed, markings, etc.  If Mr. Savage decided in the morning that <i>Dogs.ie</i>was going to integrate totally with our system, the owner would only have to type in the microchip number and verify it.  The system would then write the ad detailing from the independently verified details what dog was for sale.<br/><br/>A point that is often missed in this debate is that the quality of the data on databases is important.  In Ireland, we have predominantly chosen to use veterinary certified data.  As a vet, if I falsify data on the registered database, I could lose my licence.  That is a price I am not willing to pay, and few people are.  In the UK, owners can register data and there is no imperative to do it properly and give the dog's future owners any protection.  If the ad is run through our system, it means that a vet somewhere has certified that he or she has seen proof of ownership, a picture ID and a bill recording the address.  This was always the problem in the old days - a dog being picked up at the back of a pub car park and a mobile number that would ring out after the transaction had been finished.  That cannot happen.  If there is a contention subsequent to the purchase of the dog, the details on the database can be released to the new owner.  That is the GDPR consent for publication.  Those details have been certified by a vet under the regulations.  If there is anything wrong with those, the vet is the one who has to answer why.  It has been difficult to circumvent the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015 because it is so robust.  This is one of the things we can bolt onto it to provide massive consumer protection and improvement in animal welfare, given that we will have good data.<br/><br/>What saddens many people involved in animal welfare - the Senator has campaigned on this matter - is that it is actually easy to get this right, to legislate or regulate, or to agree a voluntary code of practice among online platforms.  Our disappointment is that there is not public awareness of what verification involves and means.  Our verified ads do not even get prominence on <i>dogs.ie</i>.  We get a little tick.  Someone would need to go looking.  We all know that, when it comes to the purchase of a pup, emotion trumps any form of will to do due diligence.  As soon as someone sees the picture or the puppy, he or she is sold.</p></speech>

A concern raised by one of the animal welfare organisations was that some microchip databases require people to phone in, which can delay reunification with the dog.  If someone could go online and verify the details, though, the dog would be reunited with its owner much more quickly.</p></speech>

Ireland has chosen to have a number of independent databases.  This meets competition requirements.  Computer systems are so advanced now that a centralised portal would be very quick and easy.  We coded a centralised system and presented it to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the other databases last year.  However, we cannot make the other databases tie into it.  Obviously, they have concerns.  Were the Department to host a centralised system, though, we have already written the coding that would be plugged into the four databases.  This would provide the centralised look-up that the Senator is suggesting.  That system is in place in many other countries and there is little impediment, other than desire, to introducing it in Ireland.</p></speech>

We heard about the issues around that recently.  I had a quick look around the site.  In one ad, there were 100 breeding bitches.  Does <i>Dogs.ie</i>only accept ads from a registered breeding establishment that caps the number of breeding bitches or does it accept ads from anyone?</p></speech>

If the local authorities deem that they are correct and operating within the law, we are happy to publish their ads.  We include the number of breeding bitches because just seeing the licence number does not give someone an idea of the scale.  That is why we have pushed registered breeding establishments to share a little about their size and what they do.  That has been helpful for people, as it gives them a better idea.</p></speech>

It is a great improvement on what is on some other sites.  From a marketing point of view, though, would it not be better if <i>Dogs.ie</i>was able to pitch itself as only hosting pre-verified ads from someone with a maximum number of breeding bitches and about dogs that, due to the health and behavioural issues that affect artificially bred breeds, can only breed naturally?

It is down to the quality of inspections, ensuring that socialisation plans are being adhered to, the cleanliness of the facilities, etc.  Breeding establishments are regularly inspected to retain their licences.  Inspectors can also turn up unannounced.  I would encourage local authorities to spend more time on ensuring that all of these elements are being adhered to.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for Fido.  Mr. Heslin says the simple solution is to only have sites that publish with microchips.  Following on from what Senator Boylan said, would his preference be for a voluntary code database or a legally mandated one?  Which would Fido prefer?  I imagine it is a legally mandated one.</p></speech>

I am not sure if members are aware of IPAAG but it is basically a group of interested parties in pet advertisement.  That has been in existence since the middle of the last decade.  Repeatedly, we will go to the members with solutions, they work and they are not introduced.  There is always an excuse.  Even when the regulations were printed in 2019, we were hit with the excuse that they did not apply to online platforms.  They hid behind the Facebook excuse that they were not the advertisers but just facilitating display of an advertisement.  If we could have a magic wish, we would definitely want it to be legally mandated.</p> <p>  I am sure members are aware that there are many different forms of two-step authentication.  This is one that works particularly well in Ireland because we have such good mobile phone penetration and the original regulations made contact details a requirement.  We use that as our template and it works very well.  Another database or online platform may come up with a different form of two-step authentication.  Two-step authentication is the minimum we should be looking for here.  There should be traceability and some independent verification, so that when an ad comes up with a chip, there is a background store of details associated with that person.  That way, if they disappear off the face of the earth, we can still track them down and they can be held to account if there is a consumer protection or animal welfare problem.</p></speech>

That is impressive.  Do all four approved dog identification databases work on Fido's system?  Why are there so many databases?</p></speech>

It would have been incredibly difficult under GDPR to contact those people and we may not have been able to do it.  A set of incredibly extensive criteria was printed by the Department and if a database adhered to those conditions, it was approved.  Historically, the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Kennel Club would have stored data and then there would have been two independent databases, which have been in existence for 20 years.  We were the ones who knew how to store data associated with microchips.  The centralised database is a slight red herring insofar as we do not need a centralised database; we just need systems to talk to each other.  That is what API platforms are.  If the Minister decided there was a requirement for a centralised portal, we would not need to reinvent the wheel.  We would just need those four databases to talk to each other and that is incredibly easy and basic now with API systems.</p></speech>

We are doing this because we have a welfare bent and because we have always interfaced very well with the welfare community.  The Deputy would have to ask the others why they are not doing that.  We are the first in Europe to have done this and we have proved that it works.  It will be rolled out in Europe.</p></speech>

There is definitely an easier way to advertise a dog.  It does not confer any consumer protection on the potential purchaser.  We have had that forever, since we were buying dogs out of the boot of a car or in a pub.  That has always been the way.  You ring up the mobile number a week later when the puppy is in a vet's with parvovirus and it is disconnected.  That has always been the problem.  What is hugely important about this regulation is that the microchipping of dogs regulation is a very good statute.  However, many people have criticised its implementation and control.  Sale and supply is by far the most important critical control point in pet ownership and this is the easy solution.  If the chip is registered correctly and the details are certified by a vet on a database, which is already mandated under the previous regulations, it means every single ad is a potential policeman looking at the data and making sure people have done their job.  It can make sure the vet certified it correctly, the pup was produced properly and that when somebody buys that pup, they are getting what they think they are getting.  If there are any problems subsequent to that, people will at least be able to know who sold them the pup.</p></speech>

The VeriPet system is impressive.  It has been used 5,000 times since September 2021 and that accounts for 35% of the dogs listed for sale.  Why has its usage been limited in this way?

Generally, the vet gets to choose which registry they are affiliated with and, of course, only pedigree dogs can be registered with the IKC.  It is a little bit of a numbers game with regard to how many people are registering with different ones.  It is just not available to the other registries.  If someone picked a registry that is not on the system, which is all the other ones besides Fido, then we cannot access that verification system.</p></speech>

Data quality is something we see questions about.  For example, when the birth date of the pup is unknown or not listed, that microchip could technically be used for lots of animals of different ages.  This comes back to quality of data, accessibility of those data and being able to verify them independently.  That is not just for ourselves, but also to let the public verify that a dog is in fact black and white and male and born on this date.  These things should also be verified by people when they go to see the puppy.</p></speech>

The European project is rolling out now and it is entirely up to the other databases if and when they want to join that.  Currently, if you were to advise a potential future owner of a dog that they should be getting a dog that is verifiable and whose ownership is verifiable, and if they wanted it verified through the VeriPet system, it would have to be on Fido.</p></speech>

The act of microchipping any pet was always a veterinary surgeon act.  In other words, it was only allowed to be done by veterinary professionals - veterinary surgeons or nurses.  The 2015 regulations provided for lay implantation as a third category.  A lay implanter can physically implant a microchip, only in a dog, and register it with one of the authorised databases.  Lay implanters are lay by definition.  They may not have as much to lose by not registering correctly.  If I were to register something incorrectly, it is an act of certification under my control and I could lose my licence to practice.  A lay implanter could implant 1,000 pups, register them in maybe not the best manner and head to Australia but we would never have any control over that data.</p></speech>

I will come back to the lay implanters for a minute.  Mr. Heslin is in this business and knows it.  My question is addressed to all three witnesses.  Can those who have concerns about lay implanters share those concerns?  Do they have concerns about data?  Are they concerned about abuses of the system?  They might share with us their take on this aspect of the matter.</p></speech>

If an owner is involved in the production, identification and sale of pups, there are loads of reasons he or she will not want to do that honestly.  The comeback can range from Revenue to welfare.  Across Europe, there are over 100 million pets in the Europetnet system.  We know that in countries which predominantly use a system of veterinary certification, the quality of the data is better.  Unfortunately, members will have seen reports of the horrendous situation in Dublin where there was a decapitated dog.</p></speech>

If we cannot trace the owner, we should be able to the microchip back to the vet who implanted the chip.  When we go outside of veterinary certification, we lose a little bit of that control.  I totally understand the rationale behind the introduction of this system.  Charities may not have had the finances to pay a vet to implant a microchip.</p></speech>

I think they would recognise that their choice of lay implanters has caused problems at times.  There are some who they would much prefer had never been registered as lay implanters.  The thing about databases and chips is that issues will always come to light.  As Senator Boylan has said, when one buys a dog, having seen the chip advertised, one will pick up the dog and bring it to the vet along with the certificate, but when the vet checks it he might discover it is not the right chip or certificate.  Things will always come to surface.  Most of these animals, regardless of where they are produced, end up in what we refer to as their forever home with people who want to look after them.  In certain situations, we forget that chips exist for the most part to ensure that if one's dog gets away but turns up in a pound or a vets' surgery, somebody will ring one and ask one to collect the dog.</p></speech>

We hold those advertisements back to decrease the likelihood that a person will sell a dog before eight weeks.  We actively block bad actors on our system.  In the last 12 months, we have probably blocked 700 bad credit cards from people who we do not want to use our website.  The public never gets to see the advertisements that we block because of this safeguard that is in place.

I used to be a consultant vet to the Irish Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals.  We found in the last century that we rarely had problems proving cruelty or neglect, but we had massive problems proving ownership.  When chips started to become ubiquitous in the 1990s, we tried to provide better and more responsible ownership by being able to make sure that people were identifiable as the owners.  It is a limited company.  We have been registering animals since 2004.  Between 2004 and 2015, it was entirely voluntary on the part of the owner.  The bonus for the owner was that if animals got lost and the chips were scanned in a pound or at a veterinary practice, we provided the IT to make sure the details of the owner were released to whoever had the dog.  As I tried to point out earlier, we effect reunifications with thousands of animals every year based on this small piece of hardware carried between their shoulder blades.</p></speech>

If people do not do their job, the person who sold them the chip has to inform the database or the court about whom he or she sold it to.  Our channel is veterinary practitioners.

Very few people are carrying a microchip scanner with them, so if people find a dog, they tend to have to bring it to either a vet or a pound.  There is a process by which the data pertaining to that chip would be released to them.  That is done free of charge.  We are obliged under the regulations to provide a 24-hour service, which we do.  If somebody rings our call centre and the chip is not registered with us, we will know where it is registered.  The regulations require that the information in the four databases is also transmitted to the central European database, which is how we know where the data are and who we need to talk to to effect a reunification.</p></speech>

It is not all companies that are involved.  Some are government bodies.  It depends on the legislation in each European country.  There are different models.  It is a government database in France, which is a member of Europetnet.  In Ireland, the four registered databases approved by the Department have to be a member of Europetnet.  There are a number of individual, private databases in Germany.  Each country has different legislation underpinning mandatory chipping.  Europetnet is usually the central clearing system.  It is important that Europetnet does not store GDPR-sensitive data.  It just tells us where data are stored.  Anybody, including a member of the public, can log on to Europetnet and put in a chip number, and it will tell them where it is stored.  It does not give any details of ownership, but tells people which database they should be in contact with.</p></speech>

Is there a British affiliation to that database?  Is it still in place?  Does Fido operate on an all-Ireland basis?  How does the Irish market work?

It chose to go down a completely different path, with a much more liberal attitude, where there is self-registration and breeders can register.  Nineteen different databases operate in the UK.  There is not joined-up thinking at all.  Integration with Europe by the UK even before Brexit was always a problem.</p> <p>  Going back to a point I made earlier, every chip is traceable for a manufacturer.  If an English dog ended up in Ireland and was registered on a database there that was not integrated into the European system, we would be able to trace it from the manufacturer to where it was distributed.  We would also be able to track down the owner that way.</p></speech>

He said that he does not see a need for a single database.  As Mr. Heslin is probably aware, our committee deals with many issues pertaining to the tracking of animals and databases.  It primarily relates to foodstuffs, but also to racing horses and so on.  It would be hard to imagine a scenario with four different companies operating separate databases for any of them.  I know Fido has a particular interest and a system that appears to work well.  Is Mr. Heslin aware of any analysis that has assessed and compared those governmental, streamlined systems with the liberal approach that appears to be adopted in Britain and the halfway house that we might be described as having?</p></speech>

The control point from the perspective of welfare and probity of data is more about who is certifying, rather than where they are certifying.  There are many data across Europe that indicate veterinary certification, whether by veterinary surgeons or nurses, creates a better system than non-veterinary certification.  My point about the four databases here and whether a central database might be a better system is that there are many data on those four databases, which can communicate efficiently with the central database provided by the Government.  If, as we proposed last year, we coded for a centralised system, where all four would have a firewall, but there would be traceability across databases, there is a difficulty in that it should be independently hosted.  We would see the Department as being the best host.  We do not want to host it because, as the Deputy says, we have a vested interest.  I am sure some of our competitors in the market would not be happy if we hosted a system that had some insight into their data.  If we had a magic wish, a centralised API hosted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would solve all the problems.</p> <p>  Regarding relationships between individual databases and their clients, Mr. Savage referred to the Irish Kennel Club, which has a certain parish that it is integrated with, while we are integrated with the veterinary side.</p><p>I am not sure we need to reinvent the wheel.  We just need to get the four wheels talking to each other, as it were.</p></speech>

I turn quickly to Mr. Savage to get a better sense of how this works.  We have learned a lot already in the session.  What responsibility does his company have when things go wrong?  If I were to purchase an animal off his site and it then transpired that rather than the 700 bad actors he identified last year there were actually 701, and let us say one got through the net and I experienced a difficulty because of that, where does Mr. Savage see his responsibility in that regard?  What obligation is there on him to recompense me for any losses or injuries?</p></speech>

What generally happens is we will work with the customer to figure out what the issue has been.  It might just be getting back in contact with somebody.  For example, people just forget the telephone number or delete the message and are not able to do that, so we can facilitate that.  We will verify the customer at least has the microchip number or the microchip certificate.  That would be the first one.  If it is a case where it is a little more serious, we direct the customer to the ISPCA - we have a great relationship with it - or to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provide other information we can share with the authorities.  We have done that a number of times in the past year.</p></speech>

The person buying does not pay a fee.  He or she gets in contact, gets the contact details or sends a message through the website.  There are different methods of contact.  Under each ad there is a list of tips we give people for when they go to see the dog.  We update those regularly when we get feedback from customers.  That transaction then happens off the platform.  We do not take a deposit or something like that because situations might change and somebody does not want to sell that pet anymore, for example.</p></speech>

Again, let us say I am a buyer who sees an animal on Mr. Savage's website and make contact.  I buy the animal and take possession of it but then it transpires it was stolen and garda&iacute; come and take it away.  As far as Mr. Savage is concerned, that is not a matter for him but for the Garda or others.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The microchip certificate shows the name of the owner and has the details of the dog.  We encourage people to get the certificate as part of the transaction because they need it.  It is a dog and a certificate.  I believe, and we could check this with Mr. Heslin, that it would be impossible to get a certificate or you would have to steal the dog and the certificate at the same time, which would probably be a little bit difficult.  In the case that a dog is stolen, there is a flag on the databases.  That dog's microchip details are then locked and flagged, and if it gets scanned, it will show it is either lost or stolen, so there is extra information available.  You can call up the microchip databases and mark your dog as stolen or lost.</p></speech>

In Mr. Savage's experience as a facilitator of sales, is there a distinction to be made between the four databases and would there be a benefit to having the single database we discussed?</p></speech>

Having multiple places where you can go has historically been good for the consumer, so to my mind there are only benefits there.  A federated system that holds all the information and where we could talk to one or check the source of data would make our lives easier.  It already exists in a lot of respects, for example, where the date can be seen on the Europetnet and which database a dog is registered on can be seen.  That is part of our checks before the dog is listed for sale.  You are not allowed legally to list a dog for sale unless it has been microchipped and registered.  The registration is the second important part there.  We see that federated information is already available, is mandated and works very well.</p></speech>

Different methods were used to ensure the perpetrators were caught.  That was down to the Garda investigations.  It would be possible for the microchip registry to see the data before us if a dog of a certain breed in a certain age group turned up.  When we look at the data, if a microchip is in the person's name and he or she is registered and has all the information that shows he or she is the legitimate owner, it would be very hard to take action, but that would not be the case if it was clear it was a stolen dog and the person then produced a microchip.</p></speech>

This means that witnesses have full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on an issue.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside the proceedings held by the committee, of any matter arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to utterances of members participating online in this committee meeting when their participation is within the parliamentary precincts.  </p> <p>  I welcome Ms. Vivienne Duggan, president, and Ms Niamh Muldoon, registrar and CEO, Veterinary Council of Ireland, VCI; and Mr. Martin Blake, Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Patricia Reilly, deputy chief veterinary officer and head of animal welfare division, and Dr. Mary McCarthy, principal officer from the same division, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I thank them for coming.  </p> <p>  Both groups have extensive opening statements.  We expect a vote in the D&aacute;il around 8 p.m. so if they keep their opening remarks as tight as possible it would be much appreciated.

The VCI is a statutory body set up under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, and is under the aegis of the Minister of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine.  The principal function of the council is to regulate the practise of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in the Republic of Ireland in the interest of animal health and welfare and in the interest of veterinary public health.  The functions of the council include protection of the public through the supervision of veterinary education, the maintenance of the register of veterinary practitioners and veterinary nurses, the registration of veterinary premises, and through disciplinary action in cases of professional misconduct. </p> <p>  On ear cropping, the Veterinary Council has no authority or role in the oversight of canine welfare matters relating to this abhorrent and regrettable practice by non-registered persons, and this may be a matter more relevant to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p> <p>  Our submission to the committee makes reference to section 16 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which provides that a person shall not carry out or permit another person to carry out, on an animal, an operation or procedure which involves interference with, or the removal of, the sensitive tissue or the bone structure of the animal unless they are carried out for the purposes of veterinary treatment or unless they are procedures listed in regulations, that is, for long-term welfare or animal management benefits, control or reproduction or identification purposes.</p> <p>  It is not permissible even for a vet to perform ear cropping for aesthetic purposes.  If a veterinary practitioner performs ear cropping, he or she is committing an offence under the Act and may leave themselves open to prosecution and-or to disciplinary action before the VCI&rsquo;s fitness to practise committee. </p> <p>  Veterinary practitioners take an oath to join the register of veterinary practitioners in Ireland to act in the best interests of animal welfare and frequently advocate for animals throughout their careers.  Any act such as canine ear cropping would be liable to a finding of professional misconduct and-or disciplinary sanction if undertaken by a vet.  The veterinary council has never received a complaint relating to the involvement of any veterinary practitioner in commissioning such acts on an animal for aesthetic purposes in living history. </p> <p>  With regard to non-registered lay persons performing ear cropping, this is a matter on which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may wish to comment. </p> <p>  The council is the statutory body responsible for regulating the practise of veterinary medicine in the State.  The practise of veterinary medicine may only be carried out by a veterinary practitioner, suitably qualified and registered with the VCI, with some limited exceptions allowable in respect of research or such projects, authorised or licensed by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA. </p> <p>  Pursuant to section 106 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, as amended, the practice of veterinary medicine must only be undertaken from a premises for which a certificate of suitability has been issued by the VCI, a state premises, a premises such as a farm where care and treatment is being delivered to an animal under the care of a veterinary practitioner or from an exempted premises.  </p> <p>  The VCI maintains registers of veterinary practitioners, veterinary nurses and veterinary practice premises for which a certificate of suitability has been issued, following inspection by the council.</p> <p>  Section 53 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005 sets out that the practise of veterinary medicine includes diagnosing disease, injury, pain, deformity, defect or state of health of an animal, identifying and carrying out treatment, whether surgical or medical in nature, or any such matters, performing a surgical procedure on an animal, giving advice on the above and furnishing certificates on these.  For the avoidance of doubt, any invasive procedures, involving the entry to a body cavity, are acts of veterinary medicine confined to those persons qualified and eligible to practise veterinary medicine in Ireland, on the Register of Veterinary Practitioners, pursuant to section 53.  If an unauthorised or unqualified person carries out an act of veterinary medicine, he or she has committed an offence, contrary to the public interest and will be liable to prosecution by the VCI before the District Court.  Section 54, as amended, sets out offences in the practise of veterinary medicine or use of the title, which states that &ldquo;a person, other than a veterinary practitioner, shall not, do or perform any act, matter or thing, the doing or performance of which forms part of the practice of veterinary medicine&rdquo;. </p> <p>The term "veterinary" is protected and may only be used by those persons qualified, insured or indemnified, and authorised to practise veterinary medicine in the State. </p> <p>  Some of the services offered by canine fertility clinics, including artificial insemination, could constitute the practise of veterinary medicine.  Canine fertility clinics offering services such as taking blood samples, artificial insemination, semen analysis and diagnostic testing, without such services being delivered by a registered veterinary practitioner operating from a premises the subject of a certificate of suitability could be committing an offence and be liable to prosecution.  The veterinary council is the body tasked with acting in the interest of animal health and welfare and public health to ensure that services proffered in the delivery of veterinary care and treatment to animals are of a minimum standard, based on educational qualifications and continued professional development and competence, on which members of the public and animal owners can safely rely.</p><p>The Veterinary Council initiated nine authorised officer investigations in 2021, into matters requiring investigation in the public interest.  The Veterinary Council also initiated three sets of District Court proceedings in relation to matters regarding the practice of veterinary medicine, and the practice of veterinary medicine at or from an uncertified practice premises.  The Veterinary Council is active in its role of supervising the practice of veterinary medicine and veterinary nursing in Ireland, including the initiation of investigation and legal proceedings where required.</p><p> It should be noted that some aspects of artificial insemination in greyhounds may be carried out by non-veterinarians, subject to licence and veterinary oversight.  This is provided for by the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005, as amended.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the licensing and enforcement of these regulations.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine may be better placed to speak to these regulations.</p><p> On canine artificial insemination and fertility clinics, the Veterinary Council currently has a number of investigations under way under Part 10 of the Veterinary Practice Act 2005.  These investigations are being carried out by authorised officers appointed by the council.  The investigations were initiated by the Veterinary Council in 2020 following concerns raised to the council about services that may infringe on the practice of veterinary medicine.  These investigations are under way with a report anticipated in early course.  Accordingly, the Veterinary Council can make no comment on any specific matters under consideration or investigation.</p><p> The Veterinary Council collaborates with other agencies and, as required, can investigate any matter in tandem with other authorities or agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We highlight that the Veterinary Council will always act in the best interests of animal health and welfare and public health in a reasonable and proportionate manner, discharging our duties as required through investigation or prosecution as appropriate in the public interest. </p><p> Statutory Instrument No. 63 of 2015, pursuant to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, introduced a legal requirement for all dogs from March 2016 in Ireland to have a microchip.  The regulations set out requirements to have dogs microchipped and registered with dog identification databases, and confirm that those authorised to insert microchips are vets, veterinary nurses and other suitably trained persons.</p><p> The Veterinary Council will continue to work to ensure that the high standards expected and enjoyed in the veterinary industry are upheld, and that the quality of veterinary care in Ireland is provided by those persons suitably qualified and authorised to deliver such services in the best interests of animal health and welfare, and the public interest.  The Veterinary Council will continue to be proactive in its investigation and prosecution, where necessary, of any matters contrary to the interests of animal health and welfare, and the public interest.  I thank the Chairman and the members for the invitation to address the committee today.  The president of the Veterinary Council, Vivienne Duggan, and I are happy to address any questions the committee may have. </p></speech>

I am joined here this evening by my colleagues Dr. Patricia Reilly, deputy chief veterinary officer and current acting head of the Department's animal welfare division, and Dr. Mary McCarthy, principal officer in the animal health division.</p> <p>  The 2013 Act was introduced after much public and stakeholder consultation, and with the legislative expertise of many members of this committee, present and past.  The Act updated and consolidated legislation, modernising it in line with the knowledge and understanding of animal welfare.  It provided a regulatory framework for the welfare of all animals and assigned a science-specific responsibility for animal welfare policy to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It has provided a strong basis for many positive developments.  As our understanding of the welfare needs of animals expands, the legislative framework continues to accommodate the development of strategies and actions to further enhance animal welfare.</p> <p>  The Department has a strong history of supporting the welfare of animals.  Animal welfare has never been in a more important place in terms of policy, resources and practical implementation than it is now.  The 2013 Act enables the Department to regulate and support animal welfare through concrete tangible measures.   The Department has in excess of 200 authorised officers carrying out welfare inspections in every county, and they are out on the ground every day providing advice and support to the keepers of animals.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as inspectors from the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, are also authorised under the 2013 Act.</p> <p>  The 2013 Act ensures that in addition to being able to offer their advice and expertise, authorised officers have the legal basis to issue improvement notices and compliance notices, which in the majority of cases are very effective.  People are rarely intentionally cruel or neglectful, and most animal welfare risks can be resolved before they become critical.  Where necessary, however, legal sanctions are imposed and prosecutions are taken when other efforts to ensure compliance have failed or there is a blatant disregard for an animal's welfare.  More than 100 successful prosecutions on behalf of the Minister have been taken to date under the 2013 Act, of which 72 relate to dogs.  A number of other investigations are ongoing.</p> <p>  Last year, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, launched Working Together for Animal Welfare - Ireland&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025.  Ireland&rsquo;s first stand-alone animal welfare strategy is a living, action-focused document, responding to priorities raised by stakeholders during extensive dialogue and consultations, and reflecting the significant animal welfare commitments in the programme for Government.  Real progress has already been made.  Delivering on the strategy and in response to the programme for Government commitment to advance initiatives on responsible pet ownership, the Minister has established a new advisory council on companion animal welfare.  Independent members with a range of expertise and experience have been appointed.  The council is up and running and will advise on policy matters and, where appropriate, issue guidelines and recommendations in relation to companion animals.</p> <p>  The strategy acknowledges that animal welfare is a complex and evolving concept, which can mean different things to different people.  Perspectives on animal welfare are influenced by both science and values, which explains why there are often diverging views in society and sometimes between scientists.  This council, therefore, is a critical stakeholder grouping which will assist the Department in prioritising and advancing policy initiatives relating to companion animals.</p> <p>  Other key actions of the strategy include the establishment of the first chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD's School of Veterinary Medicine; financial and policy support for excellent research that focuses on the "one health, one welfare" approach; and the development of initiatives to promote responsible animal and pet ownership, including through education.  The Minister has also refreshed and renewed the membership of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC.  Since its establishment 20 years ago, the FAWAC has produced 17 detailed guidance documents and codes of practice.  It has also revised and expanded the early warning system, relaunching as the farmer and animal welfare network, which takes a "one health, one welfare" approach, acknowledging and emphasising the relationship between the well-being of people and animals.</p> <p>  The Department acknowledges the valuable work done by animal welfare organisations, and our officials work closely with many of them every day.  Since 2002, the Department has financially supported eligible NGOs.  What started as a modest scheme has grown exponentially, with record assistance of almost &euro;3.8 million awarded by the Minister to 98 animal welfare organisations last December.  Of this, almost &euro;2.7 million went to 68 organisations directly supporting canine welfare.  The Department is on track to meet the programme for Government commitment to double funding within two years, subject to the availability of Exchequer funding.  The Department&rsquo;s animal welfare grants support inspection, control, rescue and rehoming activities.   The Act has enabled the Minister to appoint as authorised officers under the Act a number of employees of certain animal welfare organisations, who have assisted with inspection and enforcement activities.  Nine of them are officers of the ISPCA, and five are officers of the DSPCA.  The Department liaises with other Government Departments and State bodies that have responsibilities relating to the control of animals, as well as with many stakeholder groups contributing to animal welfare initiatives.</p> <p>  I will turn to the specific topics that the committee asked the Department to provide information on, beginning with the topic of canine fertility clinics and artificial insemination.  Many of the services offered by these clinics constitute the practice of veterinary medicine.  The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the statutory body responsible for regulating the practice of veterinary medicine in the State, as indicated by Ms Muldoon.  There is no legal requirement to approve or register canine germinal product establishments, and the Department does not maintain a list of canine fertility clinics.  The Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 introduced a regulatory framework around the practice of artificial insemination in the greyhound industry and prescribed that the practice is licensed and subject to veterinary oversight.  R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is responsible for these regulations and enforcement is carried out by the Irish Coursing Club.</p><p>Ear cropping is an unnecessary and painful mutilation that is already illegal in Ireland under section 16 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  Experts are united in their opposition to this practice.  There are no welfare benefits and many lifelong consequences for the animals, who frequently suffer permanent discomfort and recurrent infections.  This mutilation also has long-term detrimental effects on a dog&rsquo;s behaviour and ability to communicate.  Reports from animal welfare charities on the numbers of dogs with cropped ears being seized and surrendered suggest that, notwithstanding its illegality, the practice may be growing in Ireland and ownership of such a dog seems to be a status symbol in certain circles.<br/><br/>A number of challenges face us.  There is no law against owning a dog with cropped ears and the burden of proof in relation to where mutilation took place and who carried out the procedure is often difficult to establish.  In practice, authorised officers have no legal basis to seize dogs or otherwise sanction those in possession of such animals unless the owner admits to carrying out the procedure or having someone carry out the procedure on his or her behalf.<br/><br/>The Department, therefore, believes it is now necessary to revisit this legislation to support more effective investigation and enforcement and reduce the demand for dogs with cropped ears.On that basis, the Department is currently in the process of drafting legislation, which will be brought forward by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in the coming months.<br/><br/>The Department has responsibility for the Microchipping of Dogs Regulations 2015.  The primary policy objectives of this legislation were to protect the welfare of all dogs, assist in uniting stray dogs with their owners, act as a deterrent for those who abandon dogs and assist in identifying marauding dogs.  All dogs more than 12 weeks old must be microchipped and the possession, movement, sale or supply of unchipped dogs is an offence.  This helps ensure the security and improves the chance of the safe return of a dog that is stolen.  The system is effective in helping to reunite stray or lost dogs with their owners and is recognised among EU member states as an excellent model.<br/><br/>Data indicate a high level of compliance, with almost 600,000 dogs microchipped since 2017.  Database operators inform us that from their knowledge, all major breeders in Ireland are compliant.  Among the conditions of funding for recipients of the Department&rsquo;s animal welfare grants, animal welfare organisations must ensure all rescued and rehomed dogs are microchipped.<br/><br/>The four approved database operators are required to provide details of the microchip data they hold to Europetnet, a Europe-wide umbrella group of associations that register owner information for microchipped pets.  Europetnet is easy to use and the microchipping regulations can be enforced by any officer authorised under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, including officers of the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dog wardens, members of local authority veterinary services, customs agents and officers of the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.<br/><br/>I re-emphasise that the Department operates a confidential, dedicated animal welfare helpline, through which members of the public can report concerns about the welfare of any animal by phone or email. The helpline can be contacted at a call save number, which I have provided in my submission, or by email at <i>animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie.</i>The Department received 881 reports in 2021, and 268 have been received so far this year.  Each report is followed up by a Department official or an ISPCA or DSPCA authorised officer.<br/><br/>By way of further background, I have provided an attachment for the committee summarising many of the animal welfare initiatives that have taken place since the implementation of the Act.  I hope I have given committee a good overview of the Department&rsquo;s responsibilities, commitments and actions in implementing the Animal Health and Welfare Act, particularly in respect of dogs.  My colleagues and I will be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

Both of their reports were very comprehensive and extensive.  I thought they might have had an executive summary.  We have already read them but it is great to have.  I will start by saying I found Mr. Blake's briefing note especially helpful.  So much has been achieved.  I feel that is important to acknowledge.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge, of course, the absolute commitment of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in terms of the stand-alone Working Together for Animal Welfare: Ireland&rsquo;s Animal Welfare Strategy 2021-2025 document.  It is something I do not think we have given enough attention to in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge his absolute commitment and personal interest in it, which is to be welcomed.  I wish to put that on the record.</p> <p>  I will take the witnesses through one or two comments and questions.  I will start with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Rather than criss-crossing, the witnesses might be able to share the questions or do whatever they think is appropriate.  I thank them again for their detailed submissions.</p> <p>  Mr. Blake said that perspectives on animal welfare are influenced by both science and values.  I thought that was interesting because it puts two different perspectives on it.  I am not asking Mr. Blake to comment but I thought it was well put.  I want to acknowledge that.  He might comment at some later stage because, again, I am only going to deal with issues he raised in his submission today rather than go off on a tangent.  He talked about the chair in animal welfare and veterinary ethics at UCD&rsquo;s school of veterinary medicine.  At some point, it would be helpful for the committee to have an update on that.  Someone might send us in something because that is exciting and has great potential.  The Department may perhaps forward details at some point.</p> <p>  I am a little bit concerned about a number of issues here.  Mr. Blake said, "There is no legal requirement to approve or register canine germinal product establishments, and the Department does not maintain a list of canine fertility clinics."  I am somewhat shocked and surprised by that.  Mr. Blake might share his view on it.  Would he like that to change?  Does he have a strong recommendation on that?  I am somewhat surprised by that statement.  That is news to me.  He might comment on that.</p> <p>  Mr. Blake said the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations 2005 introduced a regulatory framework around the practice in the greyhound industry and that the practice is licensed and subject to veterinary oversight.  That is somewhat different.  We have two different regimes operating here, both with dogs.  He also said the regulation and enforcement is carried out by the Irish Coursing Club.  I am not sure if that is right or appropriate.  This is only a question.  I have no hard views on it.  I am somewhat surprised.  Is that the appropriate body for enforcing and monitoring this?  Does Mr. Blake have a particular view?  He might have no view, and that is fair enough.</p> <p>  Moving on, Mr. Blake noted reports from animal welfare charities on the numbers of dogs with cropped ears being seized and surrendered and the issue of illegality.  I know he cannot comment on specific cases but that is of concern.  Somebody is carrying out these practices.  Who is investigating them?  What sanctions are in place?  I know it is very hard to prove and all of that.  There may be a particular cohort of people who want to parade these dogs out in the streets.  Again, however, it is concerning.  Mr. Blake said the Minister may be bringing forward some legislation or regulation.  As chief veterinary officer, what would Mr. Blake's view be in addressing that?  He said the Department believes it is now necessary to revisit this legislation to support more effective investigation and enforcement in the area of cropped ears.  Mr. Blake might tease out what he is thinking there.</p> <p>  Mr. Blake concluded by saying that the Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline.  That is marvellous but I do not think enough people know about it.  I go to animal shows throughout the country.  We need to have a campaign.  I would like Mr. Blake to take that back to the officials in his Department to see how we can open a campaign with regard to this.  I do not know if people know about it.</p> <p>  I have been contacted about people keeping tropical and exotic animals such as parrots or reptiles in their gardens, which causes all sorts of problems.  When people try to talk about it, however, they are told not to in no uncertain terms, in unpleasant language, and are basically threatened with violence.  They are told that if they want to keep living next door to the owner of these animals, they must keep quiet.  That is not good enough.  People ask whether the confidential contact number is really confidential.  They ask if these guys can get at them or get their name under a freedom of information, FOI, request.  I am aware of one particular case where a person was told that he or she could be identified through an FOI request.  There is, therefore, much fear and intimidation around all this illegal or unmanaged activity.  It might not be all illegal but it is uncontrolled.  There are issues for animal welfare, nuisance behaviour and the residential amenities of people.  How do we safeguard that?  These are just issues Mr. Blake raised.</p> <p>  What is most alarming is that the Department received 881 complaint reports in 2021.  We now know that 268 complaints have been received in the first quarter of the year so far.  That is a considerable increase in only three months.  I would like Mr. Blake to comment on that.  As I said, he may not have a comment on all these issues.</p> <p>  I will move on to the Veterinary Council of Ireland.  Ms Muldoon said the Veterinary Council initiated nine authorised officer investigations in 2021 into matters requiring investigation in the public interest and three sets of District Court proceedings.</p><p>What is happening?  They are a long time going.  What is the outcome of any of these?  Are these all ongoing investigations?  I want to hear what sanctions are in place.  We hear about investigations but we do not always hear the outcomes or, more important, the sanctions.  If they are live cases, clearly Mr. Blake cannot comment on them.  </p><p> It should be noted that some aspects of the artificial insemination in greyhounds, which is an area of real concern, may be carried out by non-veterinarians.  I presume the Veterinary Council has a very strong view on that; I would like the committee to hear that view.  There are issues around licensing and veterinary oversight.  People genuinely have concerns about this practice.  Do we need to beef or tidy up the legislation?  What are Mr. Blake&rsquo;s views?</p><p> I know I am asking many questions, but on fertility clinics and canine artificial insemination, the Veterinary Council currently has about ten investigations under way.  Again, these were under way in 2020, but this is 2022.  They are still under way &ndash; or are they not?  Mr. Blake identified that these were happening in 2020 and it is 2022 and he is not in a position to comment on them.  I respect that.  However, that says there is a problem.  If an investigation lasts two years, the likelihood of being successful in that investigation would be slightly hampered I would have thought, by just the time delays.  That concludes my commentary.</p><p> The issue, as I said, of regulating artificial insemination in animals, who is doing it and how it is managed, controlled and how all of that is accounted for is an area of serious concern and I do not have the answers.  I would like to hear what Mr. Blake thinks would be important in terms of beefing up the legislation in that regard.</p></speech>

The Senator might let me know if there is something I forget.  He started off on the lack of need for registration of canine germinal products on premises.  The difference here is this applies to many of the farm animal species.  That has come through either historical or EU legislation.  The practice of artificial insemination in dogs does not have the same history and it is only becoming an issue that is actually hitting the public&rsquo;s and Department&rsquo;s attention in recent times.</p> <p>  As the Senator said, back in 2005 it was known and practised in the greyhound industry.  Legislative arrangements were put in place to control the use of artificial insemination in greyhounds.  This is an industry sport and it is run by a State body so it was important back then to ensure that there were parameters put around the use of artificial insemination in greyhounds.  I am afraid I cannot speak from that space myself, but I am assuming that was the reason that was put in place back at the time.</p></speech>

It is clearly banned in our Animal Health and Welfare Act and our subsequent statutory instruments.  As I said, it now appears from reports from our animal welfare charities that there are increasing numbers of these turning up in society.  In the context of control, I understand we had one successful prosecution some time back.  The difficulty is that unless one actually finds someone doing that, it is well-nigh impossible to actually build a case with sufficient evidence to prove it.  We do not have any ability to actually seize a dog whose ears have been cropped.  It is an issue in the context of trying to get that balance right in relation to the welfare of the animal.  Notwithstanding it might have gone through some pain and suffering with its ears being cropped, but the animal did no harm.  As I said, we are looking within the Department at policy initiatives we might take, supported by our legal services division, as to what extra we might do.  The Minister has committed to bring forward some proposals on that later this year to try to address that lacuna.</p> <p>  In the context of the animal welfare line, we try to use every opportunity, be it in response to any announcement we have, grants we issue or responses to press queries or parliamentary questions on animal welfare, to promote the availability and knowledge of this helpline.  On the pattern, I do not think a trend can be drawn in the pattern so far this year because there will often be more reports in the winter than in the middle of the summer.

He made a few comments.  First, we had nine authorised officers investigations last year.  Where do they go and what happens to those investigations?  If and when a matter of concern is brought to the attention of the Veterinary Council, invariably, if it is credible, we will initiate an authorised officers investigation.  Those investigations are reported to the council.  If there is a matter to be followed up, that might lead to District Court proceedings, which is exactly what happened.  There would have been authorised officer investigations prior to the three sets of District Court proceedings initiated by the Veterinary Council.  Often, our authorised officer investigations will conclude that there is no matter of concern or evidence of any wrongdoing as such.  From time to time, there are matters of concern, and in that case, the Veterinary Council will take action, such as the three District Court prosecutions initiated last year.</p> <p>  Are all those matters concluded?  Yes, they are.  In two of those matters, the prosecution was success and a fine was imposed by the District Court.  In the third matter, the individual entered a guilty plea and ultimately mended their hand in relation to operating from a premise that had been certified by the Veterinary Council.  In that instance, the court accepted a donation to an animal welfare charity in lieu of a fine being imposed by the court.  Those are three instances where authorised officers investigations were carried through to decisive action by the Veterinary Council in the public interest and in the interest of animal health and welfare that lead to an outcome, be that a fine or conviction.</p></speech>

The person had been found guilty of an indictable offence and on that basis was removed from the Veterinary Council register.  That was one vet.</p> <p>  We have suspended a number of individuals.  There were a handful of vets suspended both in 2020 and 2021.  All of those matters arise against vets where there has been a finding of professional misconduct, they travel through our own disciplinary procedures and a sanction would then be imposed by the Veterinary Council based on a finding of professional misconduct.  That would then be overseen by the High Court because that is dealing with the constitutional rights of an individual to earn a livelihood and to protect reputation and good name.  In the instances that I am talking about, that have been investigated by an authorised officer and then led to a District Court prosecution, there was one vet who was the subject of one of those prosecutions, which was related to operating from a veterinary practice premises that had not been certified by the Veterinary Council and the other matters were against individuals who were straying into the practice of veterinary medicine without being qualified, eligible or insured to do so.  </p> <p>  There are two very separate wings.  One is in relation to non-qualified vets straying into the practice of veterinary medicine or nursing, and the other wing is where a complaint, a fitness to practise inquiry and ultimately a sanction is imposed against registered members.  There are about 1,100 veterinary nurses and some 3,200 vets registered with us who would go through our own disciplinary proceedings.</p><p>Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I have one last question, which is open to anybody on the panel who would like to respond.  In regard to the fertility clinics and artificial insemination, do we need tighter controls around that area and, if so, what would the witnesses recommend?</p> <p>  Dr. Duggan indicated there needs to be a review of some of these practices.

The natural breeding is run by breeders and that does not need veterinary intervention, but where there is a problem or where things need to be more applied than the natural cover, the vet is called in.  As set out in the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, where any practice is invasive or interferes with sensitive tissue or requires a vet to diagnose a state of disease, which includes fertility, that is where the vet should come in in the best interests of animal welfare.</p></speech>

The VCI has stated the practice of ear cropping by unregistered laypersons is more relevant to the Department.  What measures has the Department put in place to bring the practice and extent of illegal ear cropping to the attention of the public?  We have all seen animals, in particular dogs, that have had their ears cropped.  Senator Boyhan mentioned the need for a campaign.  The practice appears to be widespread.</p></speech>

I can say with certainty that the Department has not received any report alleging cruelty or concerning the welfare of an animal in regard to ear cropping.  We have an animal welfare helpline.  We have not received any such report.  The information we have comes from the animal welfare charities in regard to the number of dogs they see.  I am aware of one incident in respect of which we have supported an investigation and carried forward a prosecution.  There may have been more in the past, but I cannot recall offhand.  The aforementioned case was in regard to a person who had admitted to having cropped the ears off a dog, in respect of which the case was taken before the courts.</p> <p>  On the basis of what was discussed earlier, there are a number of issues that are coming into the public consciousness that we will need to respond to.  We are committed to responding to them.  The Minister will bring forward legislation on a number of these types of issues later this year.</p></speech>

It comprises a number of independent experts.  It is an ongoing council, which has terms of reference but no specific timeline.  That does not mean it is open-ended.  The council has had two meetings to date.  Its focus at this point is on the broad area of responsible pet ownership.  One of the topics that has come up for discussion under responsible pet ownership is a communications campaign in very general terms about exactly that.  Specifically, ear cropping has been discussed because the Minister is particularly interested in responding to this need.  The council will not conclude its discussion by a particular date but it will have outputs over the course of the coming year and for as long as it is in place.</p></speech>

We are not in every county in the country, but every veterinary practice premises in the country is inspected before a certificate of suitability is issued.  Before a practice can open, it is inspected by one of our assessors.  During the lifetime of that licence, the certificate of suitability being a four-year lifespan, there will be a further inspection.  If and when matters of concern are notified to us, we will initiate an authorised officer investigation.  We can legally enter any premises.  There are wide-ranging powers available to our authorised officers, which include the power to enter and inspect in pursuit of any particular investigation.</p></speech>

Ms Muldoon made an important distinction between those who are carrying out the practice of artificial insemination who are not qualified and veterinary practices.  She mentioned there were District Court proceedings, two of which were in regard to non-veterinary practices.  In February, a parliamentary question was tabled to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about concerns around surgical artificial insemination.  The Department responded that it was not aware of any animal welfare issues regarding surgical artificial insemination.  That is on the public record as recently as 15 February this year.  I am glad we are all in the same room now and we are very much aware of the issues around the growth of these fertility clinics.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Veterinary Council of Ireland in regard to the practice of surgical artificial insemination.  Regardless of whether it is carried out by a vet, is it a practice we need to consider banning by way of following the British model?  It is an invasive procedure.  Tim Kirby, a practising vet, appeared before the committee.  He told us that, for the veterinary practitioner, the priority is to act in the best interests of animal welfare because there are risks that come with general anaesthetic and so on.  Do we need to move to the British model and ban the practice of surgical artificial insemination?</p></speech>

Part of the problem with these canine fertility clinics, and anyone can go on Facebook and see this, is that people are running them out of the back of suburban gardens.  They advertise either frozen semen or stud activities but there is no register for stud dogs.  We are missing 50% of the picture with regard to puppy breeding and breeding in the companion dog world.</p></speech>

For example, in the past we registered bulls but we do not anymore.  We do not register stallions.  We need a consistent policy approach to things.  We registered bulls in the past because we wanted to make sure people were breeding appropriate bulls.  There are a lot of uncastrated dogs in the countryside.  They will breed and those pups will come up for sale.</p></speech>

We heard in the previous session about the lay implantation of microchips and that the quality of data from microchips that are vet-verified is much better in jurisdictions that make that compulsory.  Would the VCI have any objection to taking on that workload for the other three databases, if the law stated implantation had to be vet-verified?  It could be done by a veterinary nurse either, just not by a layperson.</p></speech>

The VCI has no direct role in the database relating to microchip information.  I am not sure it is necessarily an area where we could agree to take on more work, purely because we have no role in that database.</p></speech>

That way, it can stand over the implanting of the microchip and who is carrying it out.  Maybe this is a matter for the Department.  The microchipping laws are up for review.  Is that something the Department would take on board?</p></speech>

Farmers identify 2.5 million calves and 1 million sheep every year.  They are self-identified and these are animals in the food chain.  It is just a matter of policy coherence across these things.  If we prescribe it for one species, why not for another?  All these things come into the conversation regarding the cost-benefit.  We have to ask if the benefit outweighs the cost of us needing us to step outside policy coherence for a particular activity.</p></speech>

The Minister's advice to somebody going to buy a puppy is to do their homework, check if it came from a puppy farm and check that it is not stolen, but the public cannot do that.  That is what we heard in the earlier session.  The pilot scheme by Fido and <i>Dogs.ie </i>has a pre-verified system but the other three databases do not.  As vets are not doing the implantations for them, large-scale dog breeding establishments are moving to those other databases because they know they will not be under the same scrutiny.  Agriculture and animals that go into the food chain are very well-regulated.  We are identifying lacunas in the area of companion animals.  We are telling the public to do their homework but they cannot.</p></speech>

I was not around when the microchipping regulations were being conceived.  There would have been input from the Houses as well.  We might need to tease this out but I expect that part of the motivation behind expanding the ability to microchip would have been compliance.  If breeders or others are allowed to microchip, the owner does not have to bring the dog to the vet to be microchipped.  They can do that but it is easier if they can buy a dog that has been microchipped already.  It may well have been about compliance in the early days.  However, I take the point that it is worth considering.</p></speech>

If someone changes it, we will do that.  The greyhound industry was under some scrutiny last year and it has responded very significantly to a lot of the issues.  I do not have direct involvement with the greyhound industry but I am aware it has improved its traceability system and its response on animal welfare, devoting significantly more resources to that area.  One of the debates on microchipping was whether we should have a central database or use the databases that were there.  One of the issues that comes up is whether the State should be putting private industries out of business.  These were existing databases.  The policy decision was not to displace the private industry but to work with it and put systems and security in place around it.  The policy effect is that, if we have a microchip number, we can find where it is and who issued it.</p></speech>

We get information back from the databases on the numbers they register or microchip on a yearly basis.  We have a similar process in place for horses.  In that case, we did not have anyone else co-ordinating that information.  At the moment, for dogs that is co-ordinated through Europetnet, but for horses there was no private industry bringing that together, so the Department put an overarching system in place.  Again, it is one of those policy decisions.  It is a question of the benefit that will accrue versus the cost of doing it.</p><p>The Senator asked who does the microchipping.  I am not sure we have had any complaints about any problems with any lay microchipping data.  It has not been reported to us.  The database owners are required to train and authorise these people to do the microchipping.  If they are not doing the business, the database owners can get rid of them.</p></speech>

Mr. Blake says the Department has not had any reports.  That case went all the way to the courts.  What is the process?  The Veterinary Council of Ireland has outlined clearly it does spot checks, carries out investigations and those investigations are followed through.  Where is the enforcement by the Department?  The dogs in the case in Tallaght were microchipped.  Who follows up on who microchipped the dogs?  I will not name the database for which the microchip was done.  Surely that is traceable all the way back?  It should not just be about the person who is selling the dogs and has an illegal puppy farm in his or her apartment.  Who is enforcing the microchip laws by going all the way back up the chain?  Somebody implanted the microchip and registered it on this database.</p></speech>

If I bought a microchip, decided to implant it in a dog, then a vet scanned it, that microchip is not registered to anyone, so surely there is an illegal act if somebody is registering that microchip?

That is true.  It is not that we have not endeavoured to ensure their implementation.  We have acknowledged we can do better on that legislation and we are looking at it at the moment.  When it was put in place, it was a significant step forward from what was there before, which was nothing.  This provided a mechanism by which potential purchasers could check something.  We understand that one Act will not close all the loopholes, but it gives a reference point.  We are working on that to improve it.</p></speech>

We have heard that the microchipping legislation in Ireland is better than in other jurisdictions.  One can have the best of legislation, but if it is not enforced, then it is not worth the paper it is written on.  To give the example of online sales again, many of the animal welfare organisations will state they are dedicating the time of their volunteers to go through online sales and report advertisements that are not in compliance with the online sale and supply of pets regulations.  They have to do it a number of times before the advertisement is taken down, and by the time the advertisement is taken down, the dog is gone.  They report those, but not a single enforcement case has been taken for any breach of the online sale regulations.  They say they report hundreds of advertisements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#A00200"><p>I will begin with a few notes on public health arrangements.  The proceedings of our Oireachtas committees will be conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the opportunity to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to wear masks, preferably of medical grade, over the mouth and nose.  They should continue to sanitise and wash their hands properly and often and to avail of sanitisers outside and inside the committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend the meeting.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members, as they are aware, participating remotely must do so from within the Leinster House complex..  No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  Today we will discuss the general scheme of the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022, which was recently referred to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation, Deputy Robert Troy.  The Bill aims to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, and to avoid the expense and time associated with litigation.  Due to the proposed expansion of the board's new remit and statutory functions to be conferred on it to resolve personal injury claims, the general scheme also provides for changing the name to the personal injuries resolution board.  Subject to the views of members I anticipate the committee may need to consult more interested parties on this matter ahead of preparing a report on the matter.  I am pleased we are able to consider the matter today and I welcome officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I welcome Mr. John Newham, assistant secretary in the commerce, competition and consumer division, Mr. John Maher, principal officer in the company law enforcement and personal injuries policy unit and Ms Anne Barrett, assistant principal officer in the company law enforcement and personal injuries policy unit.</p> <p>  Before we start, I want to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction I may give.</p> <p>  The opening statement of the Department has been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. John Newham to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is good to see the committee members in the flesh.  My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the scheme and to assist in any way we can.  The general scheme progresses commitments in the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance reform to enhance and reform PIAB.</p> <p>  Under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019, the board assesses claims for compensation arising from personal injuries following road traffic, workplace, or public liability accidents.  The board is not a court.  It does not make judgment on the issue of liability but assesses claims with reference to the personal injuries guidelines.  The board provides a service which assesses claims in a timely and cost-effective way.</p> <p>  There were approximately 21,000 applications for assessment in 2021.  Successive reports on the national claims information database by the Central Bank highlight the savings in both cost and time of settling through the board.  The most recent report published in November 2021 finds that average legal costs associated with settling motor claims through litigation were &euro;16,064 compared to average legal costs under the board of only &euro;841.  The time taken to resolve claims through litigation is on average 4.2 years while claims settled through the board average 2.3 years.</p> <p>  The policy objective of the general scheme is to amend the legislation to facilitate an increase in the number of personal injury claims that may be resolved through the board.  Encouraging greater use of PIAB will deliver cost savings in the personal injury claims environment and together with the implementation of the action plan for insurance reform will contribute to reductions in insurance premiums.</p> <p>  The general scheme consists of seven chapters and 27 heads of Bill.  Given the time limitation, I will summarise the key heads.  Chapter 1 provides standard provisions for the short Title of the Bill, commencement, and interpretation.  Chapter 2 provides that claimants provide their PPSN to the board when making an application.  This is intended to assist the prevention of fraud and identity theft and ensure accuracy in relation to payment.</p> <p>  Chapter 3 provides for mediation, which will be a new function for the board.  Mediation facilitated by the board will be a confidential and voluntary process between parties.  It is intended to facilitate an increase in the number of claims which can be settled without recourse to litigation, which is more expensive and takes longer.  Mediation has been used by the Residential Tenancies Board, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman as a way for parties to come to an agreed resolution.  The heads are modelled on existing legislation in respect of these bodies.</p> <p>  An agreement reached in mediation is binding on the parties.  Where both parties agree, the board will issue an order to pay and this will have the same standing as if it were a judgment of court, with the result that the personal injury claim is settled.  It is not open to either party to reopen the personal injury claim following a successful mediation.  Any failure to fulfil the order to pay can be pursued as a debt recovery case.  Mediation will not affect the timeline for the assessment of a claim.  The board will still be obliged to assess claims within nine months of the respondent's consent to assessment.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 contains amendments to some discretionary powers provided in section 17 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act.  Heads 15 and 16 will allow the board to assess injuries of a psychological nature and to retain cases where, based on the medical evidence, the prognosis cannot be determined within the statutory timelines.  The board has indicated these amendments could facilitate a 15% to 20% increase in the number of claims resolved through the board.</p> <p>  Chapter 5 deals with fee-making powers.  The board is funded through fees for its services, largely levied on insurance companies.  As the chief executive is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, it is considered appropriate that the board be empowered to propose and impose fees, albeit with the consent of the Minister.</p> <p>  Heads 20 and 21 set out that the board may apply an additional charge on a respondent who does not pay the respondent fee and for recovery of late payments.  These heads are intended to encourage compliance with the Act.</p> <p>  Chapter 6 and head 22 amend the Act to provide that where a respondent accepts the board's assessment but a claimant rejects it and the case proceeds to court and the court's award does not exceed the board's assessment, then the court will hold the claimant liable for the respondent's costs.  It provides that this will be the default position unless the court determines that holding this position would result in an injustice.  This is intended to enhance the board's principal function, which is to assess personal injury claims without the need for litigation and its associated costs.</p> <p>  Chapter 7 proposes a number of new functions for the board.  It enables the board to collect and publish information relating to personal injury claims, including information under the personal injuries guidelines.  It also enables the board to conduct and commission research and to raise awareness and communicate the benefits of its services.</p> <p>  Head 27 provides that the board may disclose information to any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if that information may relate to the commission of an offence other than an offence under the Act.</p><p> Finally, as the general scheme proposes to place an increased emphasis on the resolution of claims through an amended personal injuries framework which includes mediation, it is proposed to rename the board as the Personal Injuries Resolution Board.  My colleagues and I are happy to discuss the scheme in more detail with the committee.</p></speech>

I agree with the Chairman that it is much better to meet in person than remotely now that we have the chance.</p> <p>  On head 4 and the data protection impact assessment, will people need upskilling to handle the data?  Is it envisaged that it will be pretty much in line with what is done at the moment?  Will there be a change in the type or increase in the amount of data that will be handled?  If so, will additional supports and resources be required to make sure the board has the necessary skills?  This work is a highly complex area.  Do the skills already exist?  Will the Department need additional skills?  Will it need to upskill its personnel?  If so, has that been factored into future work plans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00400"><p>That is an internal matter for the board, but the answer is an obvious yes.  They will need to ensure they have the skills and awareness around this area and, indeed, further areas.  There is mediation as well.  There is going to have to be planning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00500"><p>There are going to be resource implications.  I am just trying to get a handle on what resources exist currently.  Will they be beefed up or is it the intention to buy in some of that expertise?  Perhaps we can tease that out.  Anything to do with data protection is extremely important in every area, but especially in this area.  Data protection will be absolutely essential in this area and it is important the necessary skills would be in place.  I would prefer if the skills were not brought in on a temporary basis or outsourced in some way, shape or form but that, given the sensitive nature of data protection, they would be very much in-house, which obviously will probably require a high level of upskilling for personnel if those skills are not available or if they exist but need to be enhanced.</p> <p>  On head 8, it has been stated, "Over 30% of claims enter expensive and lengthy litigation, not only affecting the individuals but the overall insurance environment."  Will Mr. Newham talk me through the impact on the overall insurance environment and the difficulties caused by this lengthy litigation?  What we would be looking at is the impact on the user at the very end of this process.  What are the implications for the insurance market and how does it affect ordinary people trying to get insurance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00600"><p>The original concept behind the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was to facilitate an alternative process for the resolution of claims.  At that time the framework was very much dependent on the judgment of the courts in individual cases.  To answer the Deputy's question, this Bill is trying to introduce more predictability, and removing the volatility in terms of awards should have a downstream impact on insurance premiums, the insurance sector and for claimants.  When claimants go to PIAB, they will have a much clearer understanding of what level of awards are likely with reference to the personal injuries guidelines.</p> <p>  I will hand over the more detailed questions on the impact of percentages to my colleague, Mr. Maher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00700"><p>We know from the Central Bank's data over a number of years that the cost of settling a claim through PIAB is significantly less expensive than through litigation.  We also know that the cost of claims has a 40% to 50% impact on premiums.  Therefore, we can see already in the data that are coming out of PIAB that the personal injuries guidelines have reduced the awards by about 40% and there should be a consequent reduction in premiums.  That is the expectation.  If we take, for example, the cost of taking a claim through litigation, in terms of the award, there is very little difference between the PIAB award and what you get if you settle outside of PIAB.  The difference is the cost of litigation.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure more of those cases are settled through PIAB, which should then mean the cost of claims is lower, the cost of litigation is lower and, therefore, that should help premiums.  That is where we are coming from.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00800"><p>Obviously that will take a little time to filter through.  The effect would not be immediate but the hope would be that the reduction in the overall costs would reduce the cost to the insurance company and the costs to the individual seeking insurance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B00900"><p>Exactly.  If there is a reduction in the cost of a claim, that has a big impact.</p> <p>  On the data protection question, to supplement what Mr. Newham has said, PIAB already has a data protection code in place.  The staff of PIAB receive regular training and briefing on data protection in the claims handling process, and PIAB would compile a significant number of data protection impact assessments regarding their work, so there is a well-established data protection process in place.  In developing the general scheme, the Department will also work with the Data Protection Commission, DPC, and the Department of Social Protection to ensure data protection safeguards are in place.  The Deputy's point is well noted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#B01000"><p>What I was trying to get at was whether additional skills would be required.  With the area of data protection, it is probably every day of the week.  New skills probably need to be acquired every morning.</p> <p>  I want to touch briefly on the issue of mediation.  I am a big fan of mediation.  When it works, it works really well.  Head 8 refers to the benefits, which are extensive, and head 11 refers to staff and resources.  If it were a requirement in the morning to deliver on the resource capacity, what additional resources would be required?</p> <p>  In the heads it is stated that administrative tasks can be undertaken by existing personnel or what is referred to as external delivery partners, and in head 11 it is stated the organisation may be in a position to appoint external mediators.  I understand the concept of external mediators in the event that an organisation is overwhelmed and it is necessary to buy in additional resources.  However, there is a very clear benefit to having in-house mediators because they will build up that experience.  There is no guarantee when dealing with an outside company about what you will get.  Some mediators work in the area of relationships and they are not necessarily going to be the same people who could mediate a case like the one the witnesses are talking about, notwithstanding the fact they may have great skills.  There may not be the option, if outsourcing, to designate those skills specifically.  My concern is around the creation and retention of an organisational memory with regard to mediation.  It is a long time since I was involved in any mediation but I know the more you do, the better you get, the more you build up your knowledge and the better your outcomes.  The witnesses know themselves, when the mediation is finished, and while I know it is confidential, if people chat about it in any way, shape or form, they are not going to find that somebody else was perceived to have done better.</p> <p>  In terms of the resources that exist and that are needed and the reference to potentially outsourcing mediation or buying in additional resources, is that more in case of an emergency or would it be the intention that they would be the mainstay of the mediation?  I would have a difficulty with the second situation, but only from the reason of building up organisational knowledge.  Politically speaking, the witnesses probably know I would be opposed to outsourcing in any event, but that is not the reason.  It is to do with the depth and the capacity to build up that organisational knowledge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#C00100"><p>To confirm, the intention is for PIAB staff to be the mediators.  This is about allowing for those exceptional circumstances, maybe at the start, in respect of managing the workload and as part of the upskilling.  PIAB has informed us that that is its intention.  It is also important to the parties involved in the mediation process to have trust in the mediator.  If he or she is a PIAB official as opposed to someone in-sourced, that can have an impact.  To confirm, that is the intention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#C00200"><p>That is great.  I think having that in house would be hugely beneficial.  The capacity exists to create a knowledge base and a skills base that will only assist the process.  The more you do it, the quicker you will get at it.  That is not to rush people through the process.  There is the confidence the mediator will have as well.  That is really welcome.  I thank Mr. Newham for that.</p> <p>  My final question is about head 9.  Does the board have an idea yet as to how the rules will be set?  Will they be based on international best practice within the EU that is applicable here or will there be a separate process - say, through dialogue?  How will the rules be set, and what will inform the setting of the rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#C00300"><p>In the first instance, that would be a matter for the board.  We have a Mediation Act and, to a large degree, the general scheme is modelled on provisions in that Act.</p> <p>  As for additional leave, we have the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC; the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FPSO; and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  They have very well established mediation functions, so we expect that the rules will be very similar to the rules that exist for those types of bodies.  We think it will be important that the rules are clear and transparent and that when people decide to use mediation they will know what to expect, there will be no surprises, etc.  That is how we expect this to be done.  The rule-making power is to ensure that both parties are aware from the outset of how they can expect their cases to be dealt with.  That is the answer to that question.</p></speech>

Mr. Maher mentioned the WRC.  The manner in which some hearings, not specifically mediation, are conducted in the WRC has changed because of the Zalewski judgment.  Will that have any impact here?  I do not see that it would.</p></speech>

The Deputy will know that in mediation there is the agreement of the parties.  It is just facilitated by PIAB.</p></speech>

I did not think it would have an impact but I wanted to double-check.  I thank Mr. Maher for that.</p> <p>  My time is nearly up and I have to speak in the D&aacute;il.  That is why I have to leave.

Research by the Central Bank has reflected that legal fees now account for one third of payouts, whereas legal fees in cases of claims resolved by PIAB account for one-fortietth of those decided in court.  Over five years to 2018, legal fees in only one sector, motor insurance, totalled &euro;500 million, as we are aware.  Mr. Newham has stated that the intent of the mediation process is to increase the number of claims that can be settled without litigation and the costs involved.  Notwithstanding that, concerns have been raised with me that the mediation process this Bill proposes to introduce would often result in a dragging out of the process and, naturally enough, significantly enhanced legal fees.  Will Mr. Newham respond to that?</p></speech>

This refers back to one of Deputy O'Reilly's questions.  The personal injuries guidelines do not just reduce the level of awards.  One of the side effects of that reduction has been that a lot of the caseload has been moved from the higher courts into the lower courts, which in itself reduces the legal costs, so things are moving all the time and it is therefore difficult to compare one with the other.  Certainly, in respect of the mediation we do not envisage any significant increase in legal costs.  Mediation is voluntary.  It is down to the parties themselves to agree.  I would therefore counter what Senator Crowe says by saying there should be a win-win situation to this.</p></speech>

I am not fully clear myself as to whether this would involve a Circuit Court award or a High Court award or on the significant cost differences in that regard.  A number of businesses have contacted me to tell me there are issues here.  I am concerned that the legal costs still seem to be at a significant level.  That is an issue, as far as I am concerned.</p> <p>  This is again my own reasoning.  Is there any reason PIAB could not operate more or less like the Land Values Reference Committee does when local authorities or public utilities such as the ESB acquire lands or rights for the provision of vital infrastructure?  The farmer would be entitled to compensation in such a case.  The level of compensation, in the absence of default, would be determined by the competent authority, whether it is the real estate equivalent of PIAB or the Land Values Reference Committee.  My understanding, however, is that there is no mediation, arbitration or judicial review, and that process seems to work well without the need to go to mediation, if the witnesses see where I am coming from.</p></speech>

The claimant is claiming that somebody, through an action or whatever else, has caused him or her harm, which moves it into different territory.  I think it arose in the feedback from the public consultation that sometimes that conversation between the claimant and the respondent can resolve a lot of the matters, although maybe not all matters, so I would not necessarily compare the two.</p> <p>  As for the question about costs and the different costs associated with the courts, I do not know if Mr. Maher has more information on that.</p></speech>

It is not a court.  That is the first point.<br/><br/>The second important point is that you do not need legal representation <i>per se</i>to use PIAB.  That is the choice of the claimant.  In respect of legal costs, even if a claimant did use legal representation in mediation, mediation is so much quicker than litigation, so even if it were there it would be less.  What we are trying to do is bring those cases that drag on into litigation and so forth into the PIAB process where they can be resolved in a speedy manner.</p><p>Mediation plus assessment will do that.  </p><p> On the point on what happens when mediation breaks down, if mediation breaks down and the respondent agrees to go to an assessment that is what happens.  People cannot just use mediation as a means of getting out of an assessment.  That is another important point.  The WRC, the RTB and the FSPO show this model works and is successful.  In the RTB, about 30% of claims are resolved through mediation and in the FSPO the figure is about 20%.  It is a viable means of reducing costs and having a speedy resolution.</p></speech>

If mediation goes on and on and does not come to an end, am I correct in saying that it stops at that stage and PIAB makes a determination?</p> <p>  I understand that in mediation both parties can bring legal representation to the table.  Is there an assessment of the cost of such legal representation and the impact it could have on premiums?  What mechanisms are in place to ensure that savings resulting in the use of PIAB are effective in reducing premiums?  What the evidence around that?  </p> <p>  How long does it take PIAB to issue findings in cases?  Does it typically go to the nine-month limit or is it a limit and not a target?  What is the estimate of the number of cases that might proceed to mediation versus determinations made directly by PIAB?  Does Mr. Maher have any idea what happens in such cases?  If PIAB makes a determination that would not be agreed by parties, could mediation then take place within the nine-month statutory limit?  </p> <p>  In the statement, reference was made to heads 15 and 16 which allow the board to assess injuries of a psychological nature and to retain cases where, based on medical evidence, a prognosis cannot be determined within the statutory timelines.  What exactly does "retaining cases" mean?  Does that mean that no award is made, a certain amount is held or the case is revisited at another time?  What is the mechanism for that?</p> <p>  We have heard about cases where insurance companies have settled out of court early in the process.  We have heard reports of substantial increases in premiums for businesses.  Do the witnesses know how frequently that happens?  It is there a way that this can be reduced or prevented?</p></speech>

I will group his questions as best I can.  If I have not responded to any question, I ask him to prompt me.  On mediation and how it can be done, we envisage it will be done quickly.  Its purpose is to get two parties into a room, thrash out the issues and try to resolve them.  It is envisaged that the process would not drag on for months and months.  Head 8 also provides that the board may abandon an attempt to resolve an issue via mediation.  If the board can see that there is deadlock or gridlock, it can decide that the process is not working and the claim will proceed to assessment.</p> <p>  On the cost element, as I said to Senator Crowe it is a much quicker process.  Even if people have legal representation, the costs should not be piling up in the same way as they would if people went into the High Court.</p> <p>  On reductions in premiums, there is a very clear correlation between compensation costs for claims and the cost of premiums.  We would assume that if they are dealt with through the PIAB process rather than going to litigation, they will be cheaper.  There should be a knock-on effect.  Similarly, the big game changer is personal injury guidelines.  Now the awards people receive from PIAB should be exactly the same as they would get if they went to court because both are using the same guidelines.  There should be no real differential between what people would expect to get through PIAB, a process which can be completed quickly, or what they can expect to get if they go all the way to the High Court.  We think that will have a dramatic impact on costs, but it will take time to bed in.</p> <p>  On what it means when PIAB retains a case, it means the case will not receive an authorisation to proceed to litigation, therefore people will have to stay with the PIAB process.  The point of this is that if medical evidence is not available to PIAB to assess a case, that same evidence will not be available to a court to assess the case.  Therefore, it makes more sense to keep a case within the PIAB process for a period of time for the injury to settle and, therefore, the claim can be settled through PIAB.  Again, it is about keeping cases out of the litigation process.  On heads 15 and 16, they are currently discretionary provisions.  We expect that where PIAB has the power to retain those cases, it will lead to an increase in such cases.  Have I missed any questions?  The Deputy asked many.</p></speech>

There may be some injuries, a lack of income or whatever else.  I asked about where insurance companies settle cases early out of court, which very often results in an increase in premiums to a business.  Have such cases been examined?  Can it be mandatory that companies have to go to PIAB?  How frequently does this happen?</p></speech>

Of the remaining 50%, all cases that are litigated in the personal injury sphere, bar medical negligence, have to go through PIAB.  Due to the constitutional right to access to justice, the PIAB process is a consent-based model.  If a respondent states that an injury never happened on a premises, he or she is free to reject it.  Similarly, if claimants feel the process has not worked for them, they are also free to reject it and proceed to litigation.  That is because of the constitutional right to access the courts.  PIAB, in a sense, is a kind of temporary or limited block on that, but nonetheless it is a block.  The right to go to court has to be maintained.</p> <p>  On the cost of the claims settled outside of the PIAB process or which do not go to litigation, they are on a par with the costs of the litigation route.  As I recall, there is no massive difference.  I can come back to the Deputy in writing on that.</p></speech>

It is important that PIAB becomes more mainstream.  As was outlined, cases are settled in half the time and at one-twentieth of the legal costs of other routes.</p> <p>  I read reports in yesterday's newspapers that the number of cases being accepted in the PIAB process fell recently from over 50% to 37%.  That is a considerable fall.  It is reported to reflect the new quantums.  It would seem that people are testing the system and moving away from PIAB in the short term.  Can anything be done to arrest that, even in terms of information and trying to promote a better knowledge of what is happening?  </p> <p>  I note that larger cases seem to leave PIAB.  In terms of the total costs, 80% of the costs awarded happen through litigation rather than the PIAB route.</p><p>What is behind this?  Does it reflect some deviation from the quantum by the courts, so that people feel the gamble of going the court route is justified?  In regard to the system whereby when an award is no greater than in the courts, the person pays the costs.  Does that only apply if the case goes to full litigation?  Most of these cases seem to be settled on the steps of the court.  Do people have a free bet?  They can go to the steps of the court and if they are not doing well, they just settle and this section does not get tripped.  Does the Department track what PIAB would have awarded versus what the court settlement was?  Do we have that information?  Is it possible during mediation to deviate from the quantum?  Could mediation become a way of undermining the quantum?  Considerable effort has gone into creating some sort of standardisation.</p></speech>

I will try to answer some of those questions and then defer to my colleague Mr. Maher.  Over the past few years, the statistics have changed radically because of Covid-19, which has had an impact on accidents and so forth due to lower economic and social activity.  However, in regard to what the Deputy is referring to, there is a chilling effect at the moment with regard to the legal challenges that have been brought in respect of the personal injuries guidelines.  When those legal challenges are resolved that will bring clarity in terms of the veracity of the system.  As a result, depending on what the judgments are, we would expect that to have an impact.</p> <p>  On the point Deputy Bruton makes about large cases, on which I will defer to Mr. Maher shortly, the personal injury guidelines acknowledge that particularly severe cases require a different approach.  Often with larger cases, the issue of liability is paramount.  That requires a judgment and the courts are the best place to adjudicate in such matters.</p> <p>  In regard to the question on full litigation and whether that will have an impact on matters being resolved on the steps of the court, I think it will have an impact in terms of the respondent being better enabled to predict what the outcome of a judgment would be in the court because the legislation is clear in that respect.  It would, therefore, have some impact but it is more to do with the positions of the parties and the arguments that they engage with on the steps of the court.</p> <p>  In regard to the statistics between court settlement and those of PIAB, we have statistics but it depends on the court, the level of the court and the availability of statistics concerning court judgments.  Obviously, where the District Court makes a judgment, the statistics are less available to us.  My colleague Mr. Maher might also comment on that.  </p> <p>  The final question was on mediation.  Would the Deputy mind repeating it?</p></speech>

Obviously, mediation may involve some agreement on potentially other costs but as regards those costs, such as, potentially, legal representation in a mediation process, it is up to the parties to decide on that.  Compared with the litigation process, that would be much lower.</p></speech>

I will work backwards.  Mr. Newham set out the mediation piece.  Mediation is a closed box between the parties to agree whatever the issues are, with PIAB facilitating the resolution of issues.  No matter what we do, keeping it in the PIAB process will reduce costs.  It is going to be cheaper.  In terms of the larger claims, 70% of claims made to PIAB are in the motor sphere and of those, about 80% would be back- and neck-type of injuries that would have relatively speedy recovery times.  The awards reflect that.</p> <p>  The public liability is around 17% and the employer liability around 13% of the claims.  They would be the ones where there might be more serious injuries.  They would be reflected in the quantum.  As Mr. Newham said, sometimes there may be issues around liability and that is why the cases may proceed to a court and have a higher cost.  What we see at an aggregate level in the NCID are differentials between the cases that are settled pre-PIAB, immediately after PIAB and in litigation.  It shows very clearly that the PIAB and the cases immediately after PIAB are far cheaper that those that go all the way.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about the free bet and cases settling on the steps of the court, the parties have a right at any time in the process to resolve the matter themselves and settle.  Nothing can be done about that because that is a matter for the parties to agree.  Claims can be withdrawn from PIAB.  What we need to see in the coming years is cultural change.  We need to see respondents settling through PIAB.  We need to see consistency between what the courts are doing and what PIAB is doing.  We do not yet have the guidelines and the mediation in place and the courts are not yet making judgments on the guidelines because to a large extent the claims before the courts were instituted before the commencement of the guidelines.  There is, therefore, a time lag in terms of what we are seeing between the PIAB process and what is in the courts.  Mr. Newham referred to a chilling effect.  We think that when those legal challenges are concluded, we will have greater certainty in the injuries and claims environment.  That should contribute to lower costs. </p></speech>

Mr. Maher stated that the longer we keep people in PIAB, the better it is in terms of reducing costs to the Exchequer in terms of insurance.  I ask the witnesses to expand on two statements they made.  The issue relates to payouts for individuals.  If someone has an accident in a place of employment, as we heard today, the individual who is taking the claim does not need to worry about a reduced cost because it is done using the same system as the court uses.  The way we will reduce costs is in terms of legal fees.  To take the case of a person who owns a premises on which an accident happens, we have seen cases in the courts where the amount of money people have been awarded seems ridiculous.  For example, someone who falls and bruises a thumb can get thousands of euro.</p><p>I am referring to what occurs if PIAB assesses payouts in the same way as the courts.  A person in mediation could feel the claimant is getting away with more than he or she deserves, perhaps because he or she has a doctor's certificate or claims it is necessary to be out of work for three months or another period.  The person in mediation could feel it is unfair but could not really go to court because he or she would know that doing so would incur legal fees.  Therefore, whatever the agreement with PIAB, it would be very hard for a court payout to be lower &mdash; unless, of course, the case was won in court, which would be even tougher.<b></b>While it might be less for the person who owns the premises, he or she would still feel very aggrieved if the amount of money someone got was quite high.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#F00200"><p>To unpack that a little, when we hear of court cases where the awards hit the headlines in the newspapers &mdash; quite often, they hit them because they are exceptional &mdash; we should note that any judgments made by the courts currently are in respect of the old system, which relates to the book of quantum.  They are not in respect of the personal injuries guidelines.  This is part of the rationale supporting the introduction of the personal injuries guidelines.  However, the Senator is right about one matter.  It depends on whether the respondent is insured and whether he is representing himself or the insurance company is stepping into the role of respondent, which adds a different dimension.  I say that because if the owner of the business is the respondent, the issue of liability might be more important to him or her.  In a mediation process, the owner can engage with the claimant and have a discussion, whereas, currently, through an assessment process, it is all offsite, with PIAB making the assessment.  The alternative is to proceed to litigation, which is through the lawyers.  There is a counterargument in that situation because mediation does allow what I describe.  If an owner in the circumstances in question rejects liability, a judgment is called for.  There is only one person who can make a judgment, namely a judge.  If the individual is insured, the insurance company will be taking other matters into consideration.  It will be looking at the calculator and making a call on the risk associated with proceeding to litigation.</p></speech>

My point is that it could sometimes be frustrating for people if they felt someone was getting too much and they could not really do more about it because it would cost more.</p> <p>  Mr. Newham used a very good phrase in implying the process under discussion is to be an alternative process to solve claims.  For a long time, there has been an alternative process to solve the claims in that if someone fell in a pub, the pub owner would invite the individual to talk and offer a certain amount of money.  That happens quite a lot.  Do the delegates expect hoteliers, restaurateurs and pub owners, in whose premises accidents of the kind in question happen quite regularly, to consider the process we are discussing as opposed to offering a certain amount of money?  Do they believe the process will help a lot of people in the industry, especially in rural Ireland?  I am from Tipperary and note that there are pubs in small villages that do not have insurance at all because they cannot afford it.  Does Mr. Newham believe the process will help in reducing the cost of insurance and opening things up for small family-run pubs and other places in rural areas that just do not have the money?  All they need is one accident for their business to be gone.</p></speech>

The cases the Senator referred to never get to PIAB because they are resolved beforehand.  In effect, the owner mediates with the claimant and they come to a resolution.  There should not be a change in that regard.  In fact, all of this is just recognising that talking is good.  It supports that but I do not believe it will have an impact on what the Senator was referring to.</p> <p>  On supporting smaller companies, outcomes are much more predictable now.  If a company enters mediation, it is able to assess what the award might be under the personal injuries guidelines.  Assuming it is notionally accepting liability in some way, it does not really need the lawyers.  In those circumstances, the cost is radically reduced by comparison with the cost of litigation.  The process should assist in that sense.</p></speech>

Across various parts of government, there are reforms under way.  Legislation such as the perjury Act has been enacted.  There is work ongoing on the duty of care and occupier liability.  These are very important parts of the puzzle, of which PIAB is one piece.  There is no magic bullet that will solve all the problems regarding the availability and cost of insurance, but, taken together, the measures will have a positive impact.

The legislation is timely.  We are all aware of the significant problems that have existed in the insurance industry, particularly those faced by small and medium-sized businesses.  Runaway insurance claims and personal injuries claims, in particular, have become a scourge in business.  Anything that can be a bulwark against them has to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Let me make a couple of points.  There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that nearly seven out of ten personal injuries claims go straight to the courts, bypassing PIAB.  This raises a question over the attachment of conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder to personal injuries claims.  Doing so leads to a much higher payout in the courts.  From a legal-fees perspective, there is good reason for going to the courts, particularly if one can get into the Circuit Court or High Court.  In the Circuit Court and High Court, fees can range between 30% and 60% of the final award.  Legal people probably try to push claimants to go to courts if they can at all.  The delegates say the mediation process they are highlighting is mandatory, but if I go through a mediation process with PIAB for four months and my legal team tells me it has a good chance of exceeding what I believe PIAB will offer, although the team believes it might not exceed it by more than &euro;500 or &euro;1,000, there is a very good reason for going to court: the claimant would not face costs.  Have the delegates considered examining historical awards where the settlement in the court was only marginally ahead of the PIAB recommendation?  I refer to examining where court costs were being awarded against the insurance company so as to determine whether we need a far larger quantum.  In other words, if I had a personal injury claim of &euro;10,000 and attracted &euro;10,000 in legal costs, should the personal-injury assessment by the courts not have been &euro;20,000, which is what it would have cost to finish out the claim?  Maybe the delegates would like to comment on that.</p> <p>  My next question is on the confidentiality of PIAB mediation.  If one engages in a seven-month or eight-month process with PIAB and more or less knows what one will be offered and it is then decided to take the case to the courts, is there any danger that the information would be in the court domain or potentially available to anybody interacting with the case?</p><p>In other words, they may know if they can get a claim above that amount in the courts; I am not saying that they are able to speak to people but it creates an obvious question.</p><p> My third question relates to recurrent claimants who have been a significant feature in personal injury cases in this country, particularly against local authorities.  Has PIAB any function or mandate to start looking at how people can be so accident-prone and how families can keep receiving recurring payments over periods of years?  I ask that our guests might address those questions, please.</p></speech>

I will, again, ask Mr. Maher to deal with that.</p> <p>  To explain, mediation will be voluntary process, and is not, as the Deputy mentioned, mandatory.  We are proposing that it is voluntary as it has to be so.</p> <p>  PIAB needs to market itself because when one looks at the statistics and the level of awards being made by the courts even under the old system, which is the key thing, the claims did not end up much better.  Certain professions ended up better but the claims themselves did not and often the claimants had to wait much longer, 4.2 years on average.  Even under the old system, the PIAB process, on average, was much more effective in these terms.  That is why under the legislation there are provisions around PIAB conducting research and getting out there more.</p> <p>  The Personal Injuries Guidelines are the step change because the level of discretion under the old system has been narrowed under these guidelines and it is a great deal tighter.  I would certainly expect and I cannot see how there would be any difference under the Personal Injuries Guidelines between PIAB assessments, an outcome of mediation, and if a case went to full litigation.  I will leave the other questions for Mr. Maher to answer.</p></speech>

On the question of mediation, the general scheme provides that it is confidential and that there only very limited circumstances as to when the details of that can be disclosed.  It would not be the case that one would be going into court saying that a person had said this or that, as it would not work that way.</p> <p>  On the other question on the uplift and the need to beat the award by a certain amount, we certainly looked at that.  Three main issues arose.  First, what kind of percentage would this be?  Would it be 10%, 20% or 30%, as there is a type of arbitrary aspect to that?  The second and more fundamental issue is that the court is, by its constitution, independent and has to decide what that is.  We cannot put in an artificial bar to say that a court can only do this because then one would be effectively setting a bar and all anyone could do then was to go over the bar and we looked at the issue in that respect.  The third part on the repeat claimants is that we are providing within the Act that PIAB, where it sees fraud or suspected fraud, can report that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  PIAB, again, is an administrative process and is not an investigative body and it is limited in that way.</p> <p>  If someone feels that this person keeps coming around and knocking on the door and falling down the stairs, they can challenge that and the respondent does not have to go along with the PIAB process, and can say that they will see that person in court.</p></speech>

How is this process going to change that?</p></speech>

It is that cultural change then to say, no, and that it will not settle outside of the court, and is using PIAB for the purpose intended by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  On head No. 22, and I am aware that others have raised this concern also, but on the fundamental and constitutional right of access to justice and to the courts, this head seems like an interference with the running of the court in some way in its directing a judge with respect to a costs order, if the ruling is the same as the PIAB ruling.  I raise that concern and seek greater clarification from the officials on that issue, please. </p> <p>  My main question relates to the mediation service and it is important to understand precisely how it will work.  First, how separate will the mediation service be from the rest of the assessment work within the personal injuries resolution board?  The proposed legislation speaks about officials within PIAB working in mediation but it is not clear how distinct or, indeed, how interconnected both the assessment service and the mediation service will be.  </p> <p>  Second, I am thinking about the person who is taking the claim and while, with good reason, there is a very significant concern about fraud and those who are taking repeated claims, on the other side of that we need to ensure that we fully protect those who are coming forward and have a legitimate injury.  What protections are they afforded in the mediation process and what supports are they given?  I see here that they are allowed to be accompanied by somebody, or perhaps a legal adviser, and I am just wondering if we are getting back then into the whole realm of additional costs.  This is important in understanding what supports are going to be there for the person bringing the claim and in understanding the mediation process because ultimately we may need to hardwire some of those supports into the legislation.</p> <p>  My apologies but I am conscious that I need to throw all of these questions, listen to our guests' replies and run to the Chamber then.  I very much welcome head No. 24, in respect of data collection, but I want to understand what type of data collection the legislation refers to.  Our guests spoke earlier about a lack of oversight in respect of awards being made in the District Court.  We know a little bit about what is happening in the Circuit Court but does the data collection extend to that?  Unless we fully understand what is happening in the courts we cannot properly compare with what is happening through this new personal injuries resolution board.  I thank our guests.</p></speech>

On her first point, on head No. 22 in respect of the courts, we modelled this on existing legislation, namely, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  While it is, for want of a better description, refining the discretion available to the court, the court still has the power to state that in the proceedings, the costs are going to be awarded because the court feels that an injustice may have been done.  The court is still free to make that decision and it is provided for in the general scheme.</p> <p> On the separation of functions, the Senator is 100% correct, in that there has to be clear water between the mediation process and the assessment process.  That is something that PIAB will take forward in how that will work and be configured within the organisation.  It would not make sense if one was mediating on a case and that one would then go in and assess the same case, for example.</p><p>Therefore, there will be a very clear distinction between the mediation function that is undertaken and the assessment.  Again, that is something we can work out with PIAB.  The Senator is right there needs to be separation.</p><p> PIAB is a very rich source of data.  It is really important for it to make the data publicly available.  It has data on the types of accidents and the types of injuries.  It can be very useful to get regular data on that to understand what the most common types of injuries are and how they are happening.  Are they happening at night or in certain premises etc.?  That information can help with risk reduction.</p><p> PIAB has data that is almost complementary to what is in the NCID on claims, settlements, length of time etc.  Again, it is about PIAB using those data and publishing them regularly, thereby increasing information and transparency in the claims environment.  Again, we think that will help.</p><p> The Senator had one other question which I do not recall.</p></speech>

Picking up on mediation, I also asked about the supports available to those making a claim because it is really important.  My concern is that somebody will feel forced into mediation.  While, of course, they have the right to opt out, ultimately there is a power imbalance there for individuals engaged in mediation with an insurance company.  My concern is that the person making the claim will be at a disadvantage.  I want to understand what supports are available to that individual.  What do we need to hardwire into the legislation to ensure those supports are there?</p></speech>

It will be set out very clearly.  Even the existing Act provides that PIAB can advise people of the claims environment.  Therefore, PIAB can provide advice and guidance.</p> <p>  In terms of what type of representation they may have particularly if they are vulnerable, the legislation provides for treatment of vulnerable people, children etc.  That is built into that process.  As the Senator has said, they are free to have legal representation or whatever type of representation they may feel is necessary.  The Senator has raised a good point and we can reflect on that as we progress the legislation.</p></speech>

I have been reading up on this for quite a while and it seems positive overall.  We all know the amount of money wasted on legal fees in general.  This seems to be a step in the right direction.</p> <p>  Is the mediation legally binding without having solicitors in the room?  I know there are two types of mediation.  There can be mediation where the parties agree on everything but it comes to nothing because it is not legally binding and there can be legally binding mediation.  Will the mediation that PIAB is offering without either party bringing their solicitor into the room be legally binding if there is an agreement?  </p> <p>  Why has the Government not given PIAB full adjudication powers?  I ask the officials to tell me more about the court discretion regarding costs in litigation being tightened.</p></speech>

The type of law that it deals with also has a role to play.  Essentially, it is dealing with personal injuries which legally is normally a matter for tort, which is court-made law.  Unlike the WRC which deals with employment law and which is generally statutorily based, it would be a body dealing with court-made law which creates a problem.  There are also constitutional concerns relating to the right of access to the courts and, of course, the primacy of the courts in the administration of justice.</p></speech>

It is to encourage claimants to realise that they will not necessarily be better off going to court and in fact could be considerably worse off.  They need to ask whether it is worth taking that bet.  It also provides certainty to the respondent in believing that the claimant will not beat that award.  We think it should impact on costs by encouraging greater use of the PIAB model.  That is the intention of the provision.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I do not have it.  The scale of PIAB awards can go from zero to &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  The higher limit would be in very exceptional circumstances.  In addition, the award levels comprise general damages and special damages.  The general damages are what PIAB assesses using the guidelines and the special damages would be things like loss of income etc.  That might give the Deputy a flavour of it.  I can revert in writing with the detail.</p></speech>

Does that have to go to court?  Is there a cut-off point?  How is that determined?</p></speech>

The Deputy must forgive me; I am not an expert on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J00300"><p>My question really is related to PIAB's role and the limits that might apply to it.  If someone is involved in a car accident and has a catastrophic injury which might yield an amount in the millions, is PIAB ruled out in circumstances like that?  Does it just go to court?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J00400"><p>The difference between the guidelines and the book of quantum is that the guidelines are certainly more prescriptive, especially with lower level injuries.  However, the new guidelines did not diverge from the book of quantum with regard to catastrophic injuries.  That has not necessarily changed.  The guidelines literally go into every type of injury, every part of the body.  There is a significant itemisation of the various injuries there.</p> <p>  As for catastrophic injuries, PIAB can certainly deal with those cases but it might be at a level where judgment is required and that is where the case becomes more complicated.  With catastrophic injuries, there can also be a number of injuries interplaying with each other.  That is where PIAB can decide that a case is far too complicated for it and requires more medical assessments and a judgment to be made of the interplay of all these injuries and the long-term prognosis.  Such cases tend not to be within the PIAB fold because of their complexity.  The current legislation allows for PIAB to withdraw from cases of that nature.</p></speech>

I take it that the issue of periodic payment orders, PPOs, will be treated in a similar fashion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J00700"><p>The first payment was approved by a court in February 2019.  Periodic payment orders are obviously linked to insurance claims as well.  I want to know whether the officials have looked at the possibility of PIAB being involved in them.  Similar to what Mr. Newham just said, would they be too complex for PIAB?  Would they have to be dealt with by the courts?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.331" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J00800"><p>Every case would be dependent on the circumstances and its individual characteristics.  On PIAB having a role in the PPOs, no, that is not something we have been looking at.  That work is under way in the Department of Justice.  We do not really know what the outcome is.</p></speech>

In the initial statement, Mr. Newham said that heads 15 and 16 will allow the board to assess injuries of a psychological nature and retain cases.  Is there a time limit by which cases can be retained?  Could this be indefinite?  Could the officials tell us more about how that might work?  Would somebody receive an interim payment and perhaps over a number of years if an injury developed, for example, if someone developed epilepsy as a result of a brain injury?  Is that the kind of thing we are talking about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.333" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Maher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J01000"><p>Under the Act, PIAB has nine months to make the assessment.  In exceptional circumstances, that can be extended by six months and with the agreement of parties, it can be extended further.  The timeframes are pretty prescriptive.  If I understand the Deputy's question correctly, if PIAB makes an award in 2022 and the injury deteriorates further in 2025, the Deputy is asking if it can be reopened.  As far as I am aware, it does not work that way.  PIAB makes an assessment based on the circumstances of the claim at that specific point in time.  It does make the award in special damages, though, which take account of other factors.  It may be factored in there.  I would not be 100% sure on that operational part of it, to be honest with the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J01100"><p>Mr. Maher referred to six months.  That is 15 months overall by which the whole matter has to be finalised.  It was stated earlier that cases might be retained where, based on medical evidence, the prognosis cannot be interpreted within the statutory timelines.  We are adding six months on to the nine months that are already provided.  I understand the issue where a payment is made and the claim is extinguished and cannot be revisited.  We probably need more clarity on this particular issue.  In some instances, medical conditions can arise much later.  I am talking about epilepsy and conditions like that.  They can get worse.  Without medical evidence at the time, as it says in the guidelines, if it cannot be determined within the statutory timelines, that might need to be revisited.</p></speech>

There is an important balance to be struck between the right of access to a court and the public interest in settling claims through PIAB where that long-term prognosis is yet to be arrived at.  That is something we will have to take very carefully into consideration when drafting the Bill.  Similarly, it is something the Oireachtas will have a view on ultimately.</p></speech>

Do we have an established book of quantum at this stage that is agreed by all parties, by PIAB and the courts?  I know we have injury guidelines but I think there is still work being done on the book of quantum.  That brings me on to a point I already made.  Where we have the attachment of other conditions, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, how is PIAB going to manage that rather than have the case brought back into the courts where people might feel they will get a far more subjective hearing and potentially do better?</p> <p>  I know I am slightly digressing, but it was mentioned that the Department is progressing the owner-occupier legislation which has been called for.  We need to see that along with the duty of care.  It is all part of where we are going.  We in the Regional Group did work on top of what Senators had done previously to get the perjury legislation amended but we need the whole package now.</p> <p>  In respect of what Senator Garvey outlined on restricting advertising colloquially known as ambulance chasing, is PIAB going to highlight that point also?  I am aware of one legal firm in Dublin that still has a rotating sign calling for people to come in if they have been personally injured.  Are we going to see an end to that kind of culture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Newham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022033000002#J01400"><p>Just in terms of the book of quantum, yes, personal injuries guidelines are in effect.  Any assessments being made by PIAB currently are based on the new personal injury guidelines.  The book of quantum is still relevant for those cases that have already entered into the courts.  That is the distinction.  As time goes on, we would expect the book of quantum to feature less.</p> <p>  In terms of psychological claims, initially the legislation enabled PIAB not to deal with psychological claims.  Largely the rationale was that they are so complicated but PIAB is confident that it can deal with that complexity.  That is why we are introducing provisions to deal with psychological claims. </p> <p>  Owner-occupier liability and duty of care is with the Department of Justice.  I know good progress is being made.  The Department reported on it as part of the recent annual assessment of the action plan for insurance reform.  Mr. Maher might comment on where that is at if he can recall.  </p> <p>  On ambulance chasing, it is not a role for PIAB.  I am not sure where exactly the role is but it will be somewhere in the Department of Justice space.  I can get back to the Deputy on what actions are being taken in that regard.</p></speech>

There is a good reason.</p><p>When the PIAB was established it would not have had the experience in these types of cases, but it is in place for 18 years now and it has acquired a lot of experience in those types of claims.  More importantly, they are set out in the personal injury guidelines now so the PIAB has a clear framework and reference point to make assessments.</p><p> On the occupiers liability and duty of care, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, gave an update on that in the context of the Justice Plan 2022, which was published on Tuesday.  As I understand it, work is at an advanced stage on matters relating to codification of things such as common sense in personal injury cases and provisions regarding the voluntary assumption of risk.  As Mr. Newham said, the Department will be progressing that as quickly as possible because it is recognised in the action plan for insurance that it is an important piece of the jigsaw that has yet to be put in place.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Newham, Mr. Maher and Ms Barrett for attending the meeting.  We obviously will consider this matter further as we progress so we will probably invite more stakeholders to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  That concludes the business in public session for today.

I am fully aware that I did not attend the European Council last week because I was a close contact of quite a number of people before I went and was concerned that I might test positive or develop symptoms while abroad.  However, I was at the General Affairs Council, which prepares the European Council.</p><p>I am very glad to have the opportunity to engage with committee members today regarding supporting Ukraine.  We now find ourselves nearly five weeks into the conflict.  The situation is of huge concern.  There are dire and unimaginable human consequences arising out of this illegal, unprovoked and unjustifiable large-scale invasion and war on Ukraine.  What we are seeing is, quite simply, incredible, except that we see it with our own eyes.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s support for Ukraine is unwavering.  As the Taoiseach said in his conversation with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, this reflects our close co-operation and support.  I know we are all looking forward to hearing from President Zelenskyy next week and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for inviting him to address both Houses of the Oireachtas, which is a singular honour and responsibility for us in our response to the situation.  </p><p>At this point it is worth recalling that Irish relations with Ukraine had started to develop last year to a greater degree than previously with the opening of our embassy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, visited Kyiv last summer to open the embassy and establish a diplomatic presence.  There was great interest and excitement within the Department and diplomatic community about this engagement and increasing engagement with Ukraine.  I had conversations with Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Dmytro Kuleba, in December.  Even by then, there was huge concern as to what was about to unfold.</p><p>The focus of the engagement with the committee today will be what can be done to support Ukraine in an EU context, but of course it is also worth mentioning the United Nations.  Since the early days of the conflict, Ireland has been active and vocal in our support for Ukraine on the Security Council and in General Assembly meetings.  We have urged others to join us in condemning Russia&rsquo;s illegal, unprovoked and unjustified invasion and war in Ukraine, and we call on Russia to immediately withdraw its forces from the entire territory of Ukraine and to implement an immediate ceasefire.At this point, it might be worth remembering our ambassador and deputy permanent representative, Mr. Jim Kelly, who died suddenly and was to the fore in many engagements at the Security Council.  </p><p>Turning now to the EU, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership, which was made clear by the Taoiseach and has been gratefully received in Ukraine and many EU nations.  EU leaders acted quickly earlier this month and invited the European Commission to submit an opinion on Ukraine's application to become a member.  Even this procedure has been fast-tracked.  EU leaders reiterated that at the European Council last week.  Ireland has come together with a grouping of other member states that are similarly strongly supportive of Ukraine&rsquo;s application, with a view to providing political and practical assistance to support Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective.  </p><p>In terms of funding, Ireland has contributed in full to the European Peace Facility&rsquo;s &euro;1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine.  Our total share, which is <i>pro rata</i>, is &euro;22 million, will go towards non-lethal elements.  The EU has also agreed to provide an emergency macro-financial assistance operation of &euro;1.2 billion in the form of loans to foster stability in Ukraine.  This is already being disbursed. </p><p>Ireland is supportive of the widest possible sanctions on Russia and Belarus, including on the energy sector, as a concrete demonstration of our solidarity with Ukraine and to maintain the strongest possible pressure on the Kremlin.  We are, of course, mindful of the need to maintain European unity.  The unity and determination of the EU took Russia by surprise and we must continue to hold a united and firm line on this.  I am pleased that we are doing that.  We and other member states have asked the European Commission to produce an impact assessment, looking at the effects of all the sanctions introduced to date on Russia and the EU.</p><p>On a humanitarian level, Ireland has responded quickly to the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  An initial humanitarian package of &euro;10 million announced by the Taoiseach on the day of the invasion has since been doubled to &euro;20 million.  The humanitarian package of Irish Aid funding has been channelled to the UN, the Red Cross and civil society in general as they deliver life-saving help to Ukrainians affected by the conflict.  Some &euro;5 million of this funding will support UNHCR&rsquo;s refugee response, while a further &euro;6 million has been allocated to the Red Cross to support the critical role it is playing.  The International Committee of the Red Cross operates in active conflict areas, negotiating humanitarian access and safe passage, repairing critical infrastructure and ensuring the availability of life-saving care.  Of our funding, &euro;4 million will allow UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA to protect and provide vital medical care to vulnerable groups, whether they choose to leave or remain in their country.</p><p>Irish NGOs are also mobilising and partnering with local NGOs in the region.  Irish Aid will also support their efforts through a dedicated fund of &euro;2 million launched by the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy, last week.  The EU, through the European Commission, has also made &euro;550 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance available.  The EU civil protection mechanism has also delivered almost &euro;300 million worth of in-kind assistance. </p><p>We are encouraging all our partners, including UN agencies and the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, to mobilise the resources we provide by way of core funding to respond to the crisis in Ukraine and support host countries.  CERF has provided more than &euro;55 million to date, and Ireland is the tenth largest donor.</p><p> I will now touch on the recent General Affairs Council and the European Council, on which I am more than happy to answer questions.  I represented Ireland at a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels last week.  Our main item of discussion was preparation for the European Council meeting of 24 and 25 March.  Other topics discussed included the revision of a regulation on the statute and funding of European political parties and foundations, the Conference on the Future of Europe, the European semester process for 2022 and an update on proposals for a regulation on the adoption of unilateral enforcement measures under the EU-UK withdrawal agreement.</p><p> At the European Council meeting, the main item of discussion was the situation in Ukraine.  Constructive discussions were held with US President Biden, in attendance physically, and the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskyy, present online.  Leaders discussed Russia's military aggression against Ukraine, including the safety of the civilian population, help for refugees and support to the Ukrainian Government, and set out a number of conclusions that reiterated our support for Ukraine.</p><p> The European Council endorsed the strategic compass as part of its focus on security and defence issues.  Leaders also had a lengthy discussion on options to mitigate the impact of energy price increases.  On economic issues, leaders called for work to be taken forward on building a more robust economic base and reaffirmed the importance of realising the full potential of the Single Market.  As for external relations, preparation was made for the EU-China Summit, which takes place this week.  The political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also discussed.</p><p> Bheinn s&aacute;sta ceisteanna a th&oacute;g&aacute;il &oacute; bhaill an choiste.</p></speech>

I know that many other wider EU matters were addressed at the General Affairs Council and the European Council, but I think we are all agreed that the biggest issue impacting all of Europe, particularly the EU, at present is Russia's ongoing brutal war in Ukraine.  At what stage does the EU think it will be in a position to evaluate the impact sanctions have had on Russia and whether they are playing as major a role as perhaps had been expected?  I appreciate that it might be a little premature to get a fair idea of that, but was it discussed?</p> <p>  As for Ukraine's accession to the EU, while the Minister of State mentioned Ireland's support alongside that of other member states, the question is what tangible support measures can be given.  The committee had a lengthy discussion with the Ukrainian ambassador a fortnight ago as to how Ukraine can achieve the Copenhagen criteria and the supports it would need in peacetime, let alone when the country is being bombed from a height by Russia.  In that regard, the Minister of State mentioned that Ireland is contributing a considerable amount to the European package, but we have decided not to contribute to the purchase of lethal or military equipment or aid.  Is that sustainable in the long term, particularly when it comes to the notion of solidarity within the European Union?  At some stage will other states in the European Union as well as the Ukrainian Government look to Ireland and think we are helping only 99% and that we could go further?</p> <p>  Finally, while welcoming the expulsion yesterday of four Russian diplomats from the Russian Embassy, on Orwell Road, in my constituency, I hope those will be the first of many expulsions.  What plans may the Government have taken already to expel the Russian ambassador?  That is long overdue.  I fully accept the reasons the Taoiseach has given for the expulsion of those four diplomats, but I think many of us have been calling for the expulsion of many more.  We see that other EU member states have expelled diplomats in much greater numbers from their Russian embassies.</p></speech>

There is now a wide commitment to eliminate our dependence on certain energy sources, particularly oil.  Sanctions in that case have been implemented really quickly.  The first few rounds of sanctions were done over a few days; that normally takes months.  A lot of work has been ongoing for a considerable period between the European Union and the United States in particular, working together.  A lot of technical work has to go on in respect of sanctions to get the correct names of companies etc.  Obviously, it all has to be legally watertight.  With other EU member states, we have asked the Commission to produce an impact assessment of the effect of sanctions not only on Russia but also on us.  There are questions and answers on the Commission's website, which will help companies understand their obligations.  The Commission will publish further information in due course.  There will be ongoing discussions on the mitigation of the effect of sanctions on EU member states to help preserve our unity because it is a fact that some countries are worse affected than others by the sanctions.  Some member states have significant trading relationships with Russia.  Things have changed, however.  I was talking to one colleague from one country - I will not say which country - that has a significant trading relationship with Russia.  Before Christmas, the country was very worried about sanctions in respect of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT.  Someone said to me that such sanctions would be the country's Brexit, such is SWIFT's impact there, if they were to go ahead.  After Christmas, however, and in the run-up to the war, that attitude had changed completely because people realised there was a very important moral principle at stake and a very important reality that if serious action were not taken, this could continue.  Therefore, I think there has been a change of focus in that some of these measures are viewed as simply necessary.</p><p>As for support for Ukraine's accession to the EU and measures needed to join the European Union, the most important thing we could have done in recent weeks was to send a signal of support and not a signal that could end in disappointment in Ukraine.  It was therefore really important for European leaders to have made the statement they made.  The Taoiseach was one of the first to voice support for EU membership for Ukraine.  If there were any ifs or buts to that, I think it would have sent a really negative message into Ukraine and maybe disheartened people because that is what they are fighting for.  We therefore thought it very important to state that we support absolutely Ukraine's accession.  That is long-standing Irish foreign policy and European policy.  The practicalities of that take a little time.  It will not happen overnight.  However, the Commission has now been asked in double-quick time to provide an assessment in respect of various countries, Ukraine in particular, of the applicant states' preparedness for accession.  Obviously, as Deputy Richmond mentioned, there are criteria in that regard.  The process takes time.  In the past it has taken years.  I do not think it will take that long in this case.  I maintain that the most important thing is that that positive signal is sent and that people are positive about this.  The people of Ukraine are part of the European family.  They are one of us.  They need and want to be in the European Union, and we certainly will not stand in their way.  In fairness to Ukraine, over time it had already made progress before the war on aligning with EU standards, and it is defending European Union values at the moment.  We will continue to support that and we will work as closely as possible but, obviously, the immediate priority is the humanitarian situation there and to try to get this war ended.</p><p>As for the European peace facility, it is not for me to answer the question of whether our position is sustainable.  That is for other observers to analyse and see whether we are right or wrong.  Even to have joined the European peace facility was a major step for the Irish Government.  Before this happened, some people would have questioned whether we would have vetoed this.  Of course, no Irish Government ever would in this context - let us be absolutely clear on that.  It was a very big step for us to take.  Even though we are providing non-lethal equipment to try to be true to our tradition of military neutrality and not being a part of military alliances, the help we are providing through the European peace facility is exactly <i>pro rata</i>with that provided by every other country.  We are also providing the defensive equipment Ukrainians need.  It has been a major step and a major help and has been acknowledged as such.  Whether that will change in the future is ultimately a matter for the Irish people.  We will leave it with the people in due course and will continue to give the practical help we are giving at present.</p><p>As for the Russian officials, each country has taken an independent decision as to what to do in this case.  The Government is advised by the Garda and the Defence Forces, and there is co-ordination and sharing of information around the European Union.  That is obvious.  We have taken a proportionate and appropriate decision, which has to be legally watertight under international law and the Vienna Convention.</p><p>Clearly, there were huge concerns with these particular individuals.  As I understand it, no government in the EU has expelled an ambassador.  It may happen in the future; I cannot predict these things.  It is considered that there is value in keeping lines of communication open, however flawed those lines of communication are, let us be honest.  The ambassador has not exactly given us much to go on in the past few months in making commitments that simply were not factual.  We have to maintain our presence in Moscow as well.  There are Irish citizens in Russia and they need help and support.  We also have interests to protect.  We have taken the decision.  It is a difficult balance to strike.  Early on, when this first became an issue, as a Government, we said we would rather do things in co-ordination with other EU member states.  That is what has happened.  It does have more impact.  It certainly makes a bigger splash.  I am glad there has not been criticism of the move to expel Russian diplomats, whereas there was in 2018, when we were accused of breaching neutrality.  The country has come a bit of a way since then.  It was the right decision.  These are difficult balancing acts; there is nothing easy in any of this.  The decision taken yesterday was balanced, proportionate and within the law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022033000002#D00200"><p>I have a few quick questions and will follow up on some of the points made by my colleagues.  Regarding the impact of sanctions, Commissioner McGuinness said some time ago that the sanctions were having a crippling effect and the Russian economy was close to collapse.  We saw a 30% fall in the rouble and the protracted closure of the stock exchange.  I am interested in the Minister of State's assessment of the real impact.  Are the sanctions that have been put in place to date having that type of impact, or was the Commissioner's statement a little bit of hyperbole in terms of talking about the Russian economy being close to collapse without impacting on oil and gas payments?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the issue of the diplomats.  For a long time, there were very reliable security briefings for Government regarding the activities of a hugely disproportionate number of diplomats that are in Ireland for a country of our size.  I certainly welcome the action that was taken yesterday.  The Minister of State talked about it being a proportionate action, almost linked to taking a cross-European expulsion action in respect of Ukraine alone.  I am asking a more fundamental question.  Is it time, now, that we look at why a country of our size has 33 diplomats registered, given the security information we have that many of them are not complying with the diplomatic requirements under the Vienna Convention?  Is it the appropriate time to actually determine that the scale of the embassy representation in Ireland should be proportionate to the genuine expectation of diplomatic relations between our countries? </p> <p>  My final question relates to humanitarian aid.  I warmly welcome the explanation that the Minister of State has given for the &euro;20 million of humanitarian relief that has been channelled through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Food Programme.  My question is one that I am trying to develop a view on.  One of the things we want to do is to signal to countries that look to Europe for support and are being drawn, as it were, into the orbit of Russia, that we want to support the core activities of those governments.  I am thinking, in particular, of Moldova, which is very vulnerable.  It is surrounded, obviously, by Ukraine.  Our humanitarian relief seems to be going through agencies, which is very welcome.  However, as far as I am aware, none is going to the Moldovan Government itself, as an act of solidarity with it and a political signal, too.  Is it time for us to be also supporting the Moldovan Government directly not only to help in the humanitarian crisis that it is trying to deal with, but also as a political signal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022033000002#D00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will answer them in reverse order.  The Deputy is correct that we have given support to agencies that are working in Moldova.  There is a genuine interest from the Government in helping Moldova more generally.  There is comprehensive support from Government.  Before Christmas, I met the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration, Nicu Popescu.  It was just a general "get-to-know-you" session.  Moldova has a very new, pro-European government.  As the Deputy said, they need practical help and also signals that we are with them.  Moldova is experiencing a very difficult economic situation.  Incredible support for Moldova has been provided through the EU.  We will continue to provide support.  The support that has been provided has been initial support.  Moldova has been landed with a crisis that is much greater than ours in dealing with the Ukrainian people who are there.  We have given significant support to agencies on the ground there that are doing work.  That is within the decision that has been taken.  We are absolutely open to directly helping the Moldovan Government.  There is no question about that.  I have made a commitment to the Moldovan Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration and I have discussed it with the Taoiseach as well.  He is very interested in giving much more support to Moldova and in sending that signal.  We are very cognisant of the Moldovan community in Ireland, which is of great benefit to Ireland.  Many young working people have left Moldova.  We need to help Moldova as much as we can, and we are very interested in doing that.  There are many issues, not least the fact that there is a presence of Russian troops in part of the country, which is very difficult.  We are cognisant of that.  Indeed, I had a meeting in December with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, representative for Transnistria.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on diplomats, there are 19 Russian diplomats and 11 administrators in Ireland.  Four from that pool have been told to leave.  There are not 29 diplomats, as such.  I remind him that we brought in special planning legislation in the past year or two to directly ensure that the Russian embassy could not proceed with the planning for a particularly large building that it had planned on the site for national security reasons.  A diplomat was also expelled in 2018.  To be fair to the Government, the Russian embassy has been clearly on our radar over the past number of years.  This is not the first expulsion.  We had to bring in special planning legislation.  The embassy is very much on our radar.  In this particular case, an assessment has been made that the four people who are being expelled are not doing the work of diplomacy.  They are doing other work and they cannot remain in the country.  That is the assessment.  There is no doubt that this issue will continue to be looked at on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  We have six people in Moscow in total.  That is a very small embassy for us.  Those people are doing essential work in difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that sanctions are having a significant impact.  The sanctions target the Russian financial, energy, technology, defence and transport sectors.  We have seen a significant reduction in manufacturing capacity in Russia because of that.  Let us not forget that sanctions have also been introduced in Belarus.  It is also important to remember that the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, which are occupied by Russia, have also been subject to sanctions.  They have also been suffering because of this.  The media has also been suffering.  It is fair to say that it is not clear that the sanctions have resulted in a major shift in Russian actions.  We have seen that.  However, the economic impact has been dramatic.  We have seen the Russian rouble fluctuate.  There is no doubt that the continuing purchase of natural gas and oil is having an impact there, because they are not sanctioned.</p><p>Inflation in Russia, however, is at a high level and that is starting to have a major impact.  Unfortunately, it is affecting food prices and availability for ordinary people in Russia and that is Putin's fault.  The closure of EU airspace has had a dramatic effect.  People who even want to fly from Russia and Belarus to Kaliningrad, which is a Russian exclave, find it difficult.  It is hard to get to because they cannot fly over Lithuania, for example.  The Russian elite has also been badly impacted and we have seen some of them crying tears on television because of the unavailability of cleaners and other servants they are used to having, but they will just have to get used to this situation.  They will have to try to put pressure on, and continue to put pressure on, Putin to end this war.</p><p> Overall, the sanctions are having a major impact on Russia.  They will of course have an impact on us as well.  Nothing done in the context of Putin's actions will be cost free.  Discussions are taking place at the EU level regarding how to mitigate the effects on us.  Whatever the impact is on us, however, it is nothing like the cost being borne by the Ukrainian people.  The reason for these measures must never be forgotten: they exist because of Putin's war on Ukraine.  The war is having so many negative effects that it must end, and these sanctions are the weapon of choice of the EU and the western world.  We seek not to escalate things militarily, but to put as much economic pressure on Russia as is possible.</p></speech>

In the preliminary stages, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said an examination of the diplomatic staff would be undertaken, I think he used the term "operatives".  I thought that was interesting.</p> <p>  Turning to the wider issue, there has been extensive commentary regarding why Russia has such a major diplomatic presence in Ireland.  One suggestion made was that, on some level, we are possibly a clearing house for espionage and industrial espionage operations across Europe, including the use of operatives who are termed "illegals".  It is fantastic stuff and I suppose everyone who has read a book by Frederick Forsyth now believes they are experts.  A wider issue is that we are one of the technology capitals of the world and our fear in this context relates to cyberattacks and hybrid threats.  What discussions has the Government had about this aspect?  Equally, what discussions have there been at the EU Council level and beyond regarding co-operation and being prepared for such eventualities?</p> <p>  Moving on to the sanctions, they are hurting and that is what we wanted them to do.  There is always the fear, though, that war economies seem to be able to survive much longer than we might anticipate.  The sanctions should be able to bite as much as is possible to force Putin to rethink continuing this war.  When Ambassador Gerasko appeared before this committee, she spoke about a list that had been given to the Department of Foreign Affairs of businesses still dealing with Russia.  I understand the complications in the context of the interconnectivity of the world economy, and it takes time to even explore all the machinations in the IFSC, but could we get an update regarding this aspect?</p> <p>  To address another topic, let us forget the rights and wrongs of being non-aligned and the issue of neutrality.  We saw what happened in the context of President Joe Biden's utterances at the weekend.  Fears have been expressed about moving the EU in the direction of being a military alliance, even by some people who have a greater interest in this happening than I do.  The worry about doing that now or even of putting the possibility of it happening on the agenda, is that it might become a difficulty in negotiations between President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian representatives and the Russians.  I refer to talk of neutrality.</p></speech>

Let me put it this way.  Certain people would now like to see greater movement on military co-operation and even Ireland moving away from being non-aligned.  Whatever people's views in that regard, however, my difficulty and fear is that a line would be sold which states the EU is moving solidly towards being a military alliance and that perception then becomes part of a negotiating gambit in the talks between the Ukrainians and Russians.  I refer to this aspect as being something that could be used in that context.  As the Minister of State said himself, it was vital that we indicated we are open to Ukraine joining the EU, and we do not want to do anything that could possibly be detrimental to such a development in future.</p></speech>

It is fair to say, however, that the context for such debate has completely changed.  When it was a case of wars consisting of cavalry battles in Crimea and Ukraine in earlier times, we could stand back and be neutral about such battles on the field.  The reality now, though, is that this war is having a global effect and impacting us all.  I think it is fair to say that if neutrality means not taking a side, then the Irish people, overwhelmingly, have taken a side.  Therefore, I do not think we are neutral in this context at all.  Where our neutrality, as traditionally meant, comes in, is that, constitutionally, we cannot join a European defence pact.  We cannot do that and we are not going to do that, unless the Irish people change their minds.  NATO does not require a constitutional referendum but joining it has a similar status in the minds of the Irish people.  This is a debate for another day-----</p></speech>

I mention it because of a fear that the whole conversation around the rapid reaction force, etc, might mean we would end up in a situation where the Russian negotiators say they are not only worried about Ukraine being a member of NATO but also about it joining the EU because of a sense that the organisation might seem to be moving towards being a military alliance.  Whatever happens in the future, I am just referring to the possibility of there being a way out of the war soon.</p></speech>

It is because we are democracies and concerned with freedom, human rights, economic progress and people doing well.

I will not name them here.  We should be firm and stand up for the EU.  It has, effectively, been the greatest peace project ever undertaken, and I am not going to attribute descriptions of it as being a military alliance.  Clearly, countries want to defend themselves.  When I meet my colleagues from the Baltic states and the countries right next door to Russia, defending their countries and being part of NATO, and the EU perhaps moving in that direction, or perhaps not, because there are different debates in different countries, this context is absolutely existential for those countries.  They could not exist without being members of these organisations because of what lies next door to them.  We have a different debate in this country.

Therefore, that is a strong list.  Other companies, which are not sanctioned, have also decided to pull out of Russia.  Many famous brand name companies, including Irish firms, have pulled out, even though they were not on the list of those sanctions and they were not legally required to do so.  Some companies have not done so, but I do not know of any Irish companies - although the Deputy will probably throw some names back at me - that have had the choice to stay and have done so.  The vast majority of companies I know of that have not been affected by the sanctions have pulled out of Russia.</p></speech>

What I will say is that the list is really a list of companies, entities and individuals that are sanctioned.  It is an extremely long list of those covered by all the various sanctions packages, and it will have changed week by week as those sanctions have been put in place.</p><p> The International Financial Services Centre is not exempt from sanctions.  If a company is sanctioned it cannot do business there.  To date, as of last Friday, the European Commission was notified by Ireland of the freezing of just under $1 billion or $919 million, and just over &euro;18 million, in the IFSC, but work continues to go on.  The Central Bank and the Minister for Finance deal with that directly.</p></speech>

The truth is the majority of businesses, whether banks, law firms or whatever, cannot do business with sanctioned companies because there could be consequences for them professionally.  They have been trying to extricate themselves over the last while from doing business with any Russian entity that might be sanctioned.  They will not risk that.  People are not seeking to get around this.  My experience is they want to comply.  Business cannot be done with any company that is sanctioned.  I expect that number to grow in the next while as work goes on.</p> <p>  On cyberattacks, we have seen a number of them famously in our country.  We had a cyberattack.  Addressing that will require much more investment here.  The Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and the Minister, Deputy McGrath, are taking a lead and working on that.  The whole issue of cyber defence is probably something we need to have a conversation about as a country.  It is associated with defence, but we may not associate it with defence because defence is associated with armies and weapons as such, but these are modern weapons in terms of disabling a country's health service, as happened to us.</p></speech>

That was effectively a new one.</p> <p>  In our discussion on neutrality and common defence, addressing the cyber threat will have to play a big role.  We will have to get real about that.  We could probably achieve a lot more by co-operating with other countries.  We could learn form them and work together but that will all have to be part of the debate on neutrality because cyber-warfare is warfare, just in a different form from that which we know warfare to be traditionally.</p></speech>

I recall he gave an interview, I think it was on the "Today with Claire Byrne" radio show one morning prior to the invasion and he was very downbeat and gloomy.  He had just come form various meetings throughout the European Union.  It was a chilling interview.  I do not think many of us realised that this was about to happen.  Certainly the sense the Minister of State got was that it was about to happen and all this came to pass.</p> <p>  On the strategic compass, which was agreed at the European Council meeting, obviously the French Presidency was very anxious to finalise this in the context of recent developments, including the position in Afghanistan, whereby the European Union could not get its citizens out of there following the US withdrawal of its troops, and cyber-attacks, which we discussed this morning.  I agree with the strategic compass and the moves by the European Union in regard to these matters.  Specifically on the rapid reaction force, what is Ireland's view of that?  Are we likely to participate in it?  If we do, will we participate on our own terms whereby we could have an opt-in and an opt-out.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s thinking on that as this matter evolves.  </p> <p>  My second question is on Ukraine's application for EU membership.  I agree that Ireland, in principle, supports enlargement and I agree with the Irish stance on Ukraine.  The Commission has been asked to report or to give an assessment on it.  When is that likely to be finalised?  When is the European Council likely to consider this further?  How urgent is that from the Commission&rsquo;s point of view.?  There is  opposition within the European Union by certain member states to Ukraine&rsquo;s membership.  I know the Minister of State has to be diplomatic but what is his understanding of the opposition to it.  I guess it is not talked about out loud.  Is it to do with the Balkan states and queue jumping, whereby states that have been in the queue for a long time feel they may be pushed down the list if Ukraine is fast-tracked or is it more to do with the strategic interests of various countries?  Insofar as he can, will the Minister of State outline what the opposition is to that or what the problems may be with regard to Ukraine&rsquo;s membership and getting agreement on it at the European Council and the European Parliament?  </p> <p>  My next question is on sanctions. The Minister of Sate said that Ireland supports energy being included in the sanctions.  There is a huge dependence by the European Union on imports of Russian oil, gas and coal.  I note there has been decisions made to decrease this dependence over the coming years from a strategic point of view.  How likely is it that energy will be included, or is it a question of decreasing our dependence and then including energy in the sanctions?  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s thinking on that.  Presumably there is fierce opposition again from certain member states to inlucidng energy.  Does the Minister of State think that is likely in the short or even the medium term?</p> <p>  I have a final question on the peace talks being chaired by Turkey, about which we heard a good deal on the news last night.  In the context of his experience on these matters, can we be hopeful about these peace talks and the various proposals put forward by Russia and Ukraine because that is the solution to all of this, to bring the war to an end.  Given the Minister of State&rsquo;s experience, does he think these peace talks being chaired by Turkey have a chance of succeeding?</p></speech>

Work on the strategic compass has been ongoing for a number of years and, to be fair, Ireland has had a big impact on drafting it and getting involved in the discussion.  To be clear, it is not a common European defence policy.  It is just to enable the EU to better anticipate threats, respond to crises and to deepen co-operation with partners.  In relation to any activity we take part in, such as the rapid deployment capacity, the triple lock applies.  Obviously, decisions will be taken on a case by case basis by Ireland in relation to that.  It is also important to remember that within the EU, even with the strategic compass, security and defence policy is a national competence.  This document and our own participation in the common security and defence policy does not overrule, prejudge or interfere with our own security and defence policy or that of any other member state.  It does not affect our traditional neutrality in any way.  It does not affect the triple lock.</p><p>In relation to my comments in January on the prospect of war, I will tell you honestly why I felt that was the case.  I was at the OSCE Ministerial Council meeting on 2 and 3 December in Stockholm and there were a number of things at that meeting that educated me about the situation.  There was a tension in the room, the likes of which I had never experienced in my life.  Minister Lavrov was there from Russia as well as Secrety of State Blinken and Minister Kuleba form Ukraine.  It was an extremely tense meeting. I also happened to have breakfast with the Ukrainian and Latvian foreign ministers the following morning and my eyes were opened at that point in early December.  We knew what was happening but I certainly came away from that meeting realising this was deadly serious and that anyone trying to play it down was not living in the world in which these people were living<b>.</b></p><p>That is what got me and my eyes were opened at that particular point and, unfortunately, for Ukraine, it has proved to be the case in the foresight of their leaders and neighbours.  They have certainly known the reality of Russian aggression.</p><p> I think it will be helpful if I can go briefly through the applications for membership.  These will go through a process with the Commission which we hope will be as quick as possible.  In the past it has taken years and these things are not rushed into.  In general, Irish policy is that we are very strong supporters of enlargement.  This year, we are beginning to celebrate the 50th anniversary of our membership.  The referendum took place on 10 May 1972 which we will be commemorating.  We joined the EU then on 1 January 1973.  We have seen the benefits of what we have received from the EU but we also see the benefits that we have brought to the EU because every country brings something to the table.  We are very strong that other countries should see the benefits of the social and economic progress that we have seen.  </p><p> There are different nuances around the table and while I will not mention individual countries, not everyone would share that view to the same degree as us but everybody wants to see peace and an expanded EU of countries that can be members of the EU.  The leaders have agreed in the Versailles Declaration on the position of Ukraine.  That was also a very significant moment and one that would not have been predicted before Christmas as these things are changing all of the time.  It was very important from our point of view that unity was achieved on the potential application for Ukraine.</p><p> We will certainly support the EU aspirations of Moldova and Georgia.  These countries have expressed their aspirations and have put in applications in the past while.  We will be urging their authorities to continue improvements and we note that the new government in Moldova is very positively disposed to the European identity which we want to encourage.  The Georgian Government also needs to work hard, particularly around the rule of law, an independent judiciary and good governance.</p><p> We have been very strong supporters of North Macedonia and its application for membership.  This country has done a serious amount of work to join the European Union.  Bulgaria has an issue with North Macedonia over the past number of years which has prevented progress on that file.  This concerns the issue of the language.  We have repeatedly asked these countries to deal with that issue bilaterally between themselves and we have given them the example of Northern Ireland where all sorts of intractable issues can be dealt with when parties just get together.  There has been progress and there has been a general election in Bulgaria where movement has taken place and we are certainly encouraging that.  We would hope that North Macedonia, in particular, can be moved on.  We are very strongly supportive of that country which has done so much to achieve this.  If Bulgaria can deal with and resolve this issue in a different way, that could happen, I hope, very quickly.</p><p> On Serbia, it is technically a frontrunner for EU accession but it needs to improve on reforms and respect for fundamental rights; it also needs to fully align with the common foreign policy of the European Union.  It has done that recently in votes at the UN but that has not always been the case.  It is making efforts from the point of view of the government but it needs to fully align with the EU&rsquo;s position on Russia.  It has not done this fully this time but pressure was applied at the UN and Serbia voted alongside us at the UN.  It does not have a sanctions regime in place, which is very significant for us, and for the people of Ukraine also.  We strongly encourage Serbia to continue in its reform path and to align with the European Union on all of these issues.</p><p> Montenegro is technically a frontrunner but there are difficulties and we will give whatever support we can to this country, as it moves on.  </p><p> Albania is similar to North Macedonia and it is tied in with that country.  The file will not move until the Bulgarian veto on North Macedonia is removed but once that happens I believe that Albania can move on very quickly and we will support that.</p><p> We wish the peace talks every success but one has to be sceptical about Russia.  We have seen it here on our own TV screens where Russia has said so much in the past which was not true.  It announced that it was leaving the Kyiv region but I understand that there were bombs there last night.  We take Russia&rsquo;s comments with a grain of salt and we judge on actions not on words.  We want peace and any talks can be positive.</p><p> Energy sanctions could happen but the key for the European Union is energy autonomy.  A great deal of work has been done to reduce the dependence on Russian oil and gas.  This, obviously, should have happened years ago but it is now happening.  The Commission published a document in March which outlined a plan to make us completely independent in a number of years.  A gas storage policy is being put in place and we are also looking at the joint purchase of gas in the same way that we did the vaccines.  In addition, in talking to colleagues around the European table, some of whom have also said publicly that they are scouring the world to try to find alternative supplies of gas, whether that is in Africa, Asia or indeed from the US.  We heard President Biden&rsquo;s announcement last week and a great deal of work is going on to eliminate that dependence on Russian oil and gas.  I do not know whether there will be sanctions in the meantime.  Ireland will support them if there is a proposal but it requires all of the member states to agree to that.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his relative frankness in the discussion on many of the issues that have been covered.

The statement on expansion would include Ukraine but obviously there are other countries at this time.  Ukraine&rsquo;s application is a different type of membership application and is in a different time for membership applications.  Different circumstances should, thefore, apply.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on leading out on that.</p> <p>  On some direct Ukraine issues, if this country&rsquo;s application had been with us before the invasion, it would have been asking the EU about rule of law issues in Poland and Hungary.  Given the extraordinarily generous response of Poland and Hungary to the situation, is there still an appetite to pursue the rule of law issues?</p> <p>  On the energy crisis, what positions are likely around the reduction of VAT to allow flexibility to member state governments to reduce VAT and taxation on energy prices?   We see in the last number of minutes the situation on Russian rubles where Germany has started a preliminary warning system of a potential disruption of energy.  The energy situation, unfortunately, is not going to improve soon.  What flexibility is going to be there for member states on that?  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Deputy Calleary is right in that the values of the European Union are what are important in any enlargement of the European Union and are key.  In the European Union one can basically vote for whoever one likes and say what one likes and there is respect for human rights.</p> <p>  It is interesting because when we joined 50 years ago there had to be a special Government decision to mandate that there would be equal pay between men and women.  The interesting thing about that, of course, is because it was the then Irish Commissioner, Patrick Hillery who went in and actually implemented that decision.  That was part of our change at that time and there have been ongoing changes since then.  All of these types of issues are still there with all of these applicant countries to ensure that they are fully aligned with European values.  Ukraine has shown that it is fully on board with European values.  It is a democracy which values a free media and we want to give it the strongest possible signal of support and to work with it on whatever issues are there.</p><p>Currently, the humanitarian crisis is the big issue.</p><p> The rule of law is still extremely important and it is why there is a process to join the European Union and ensure what we take for granted, such as an independent judiciary, a free media and democratic structures, are fully in place.  It means that when states are members of the European Union, they cannot backslide on such things.  One of the most important actions of every member state is that we submit to the European Commission every year for an examination of the state of the rule of law.  We then have a discussion at the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament also has a discussion.  Conferences are also organised on the different matters that arise.  Such discussions might include the digitalisation of the Courts Service or the reforms to the defamation laws that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is introducing.  We are working towards responding to some of those matters.  From an Irish perspective, we do not take umbrage when somebody points out a little thing here or there.  We try to do what is right and implement changes.</p><p> In the past couple of discussions about Hungary and Poland, I have been particularly conscious that Poland is now hosting over 2 million refugees from Ukraine.  It is doing incredible work.  Additionally, it has started to make some efforts around changes to its judiciary, although we will have to see the outcome of those efforts.  I acknowledge them nonetheless and I encourage Poland to continue that process, which is so important.  Ukraine wants what the European Union has and I believe Poland gets that.  That is the reality.</p><p> There are Article 7 procedures and the committee is aware of them and familiar with them.  They will continue.  It is difficult to get a concrete outcome from them but it is important to keep them on the table.  We fully support the rule of law budget mechanism recently approved by the court and we went to the court to support it.  I am very proud that Ireland did that.</p><p> There are serious issues in Hungary and there is no doubt about that.  It must engage constructively with the Commission.  Financial support can be withheld through the rule of law mechanism and we will see how that goes.  Both of those countries - Poland in particular but also Hungary - are on the front lines in helping people from Ukraine.  They need support for this but it does not take away from all other obligations to respect the rule of law.  That applies to each and every one of us.  Ireland will continue to be a very strong voice in that regard, watching progress, as we are in Poland, where it is happening to some extent.  We must ensure it happens and encourage the countries along that path.  We will keep doing that.</p><p> There are many things happening relating to energy prices.  I am not directly involved with the Government discussions on VAT with the Commission, which will be done through the Department of Finance.  They are ongoing and I hope the process will lead to a resolution that will be favourable to us.  However, we have introduced significant support here with the voucher or discount on the bills and the excise duty reduction.  That is significant in comparison to what the British have done, for example.  What is more important overall is getting that price down.  That will be done by sourcing gas from places other than Russia and trying to get a security of supply.  That is going on.  We must store more gas than we do now and have joint purchase of gas, which would give us more market power and, I hope, reduce the price.  It is also about moving to renewables because the European Union cannot continue as we are.  In heating our houses and putting on the lights, we are totally dependent on a major unfriendly power next to us.</p><p> The European Commission will come back in May with another report on the question of energy autonomy and prices.  We will see but there has already been significant work done on that which has brought outcomes.  The process will continue.</p></speech>

It was the wrong movement from our Government because keeping the door open with Russia is important.  Does the Minister of State expect to see any retaliation from the Russians on that?</p> <p>  I see the Minister of State wished Turkey well in the peace talks.  The Minister of State is a leader in Ireland, which is a neutral country.  Have we reached out to all other neutral nations to see if we could be part of a process of putting together some groups to negotiate in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia?</p> <p>  I said the last time the committee met that we need some kind of Covid-style response within the European Union to this crisis.  There are over 6 million people displaced, which is a significant number.  I would like to see more work being done by Europe and more help coming from the EU to Ireland.  We are talking about taking in 200,000 people but we have very limited resources.  I do not know if the Minister of State has seen the photographs on social media of the tent-style housing being put up at Gormanston Camp at this point.  There are 2 million refugees in Poland and it has not put up any tented villages.  There are 500,000 refugees in Hungary and it has no tented villages either.  I am very much against putting up any emergency tented villages to house our refugees, even temporarily.  It seems the Hungarians and Polish are doing this better than we are for once.</p> <p>  It seems we waited nearly five weeks before we took action on Russian diplomats and a couple of dogs in Europe had to bark first before we started taking action yesterday.  We waited for others to act and then we acted simultaneously.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on what retaliation might be expected from Russia.</p></speech>

If people believe the diplomats should not be expelled, that is fine.  They are being expelled because the evidence available to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government was that they were not doing diplomatic work but were doing other work that was not compatible with the law.  We had no option in those circumstances but to expel those personnel.  It is the simple reason and such decisions are taken in consultation with the Garda, the Defence Forces and other European Union member states when we have such information.  In truth, when that kind of information comes to the Government, there is no option but to say that these people must go.  They cannot remain in the country.  It is a very serious action and this involved many diplomats being expelled.  They need to go.</p> <p>  There is no justification whatever for retaliation.  Our staff in Moscow do the ordinary work of diplomats, which is reporting back to Dublin what is happening and dealing with Irish citizens who, when they contact an embassy, are often in extreme distress or difficulty for various reasons.  Our staff in Moscow are doing this under very difficult circumstances and they are not doing anything incompatible with their diplomatic status.  Ireland has done nothing wrong.  It has never invaded any country whereas Russia has in this case.  We do not have spies or anybody doing work on a non-diplomatic basis in Moscow.  We all know the form of Russia in this case so we will see what happens.  Our staff do tremendous work in Russia in very small numbers.  The embassy in Moscow is tiny.</p> <p>  I wish anybody involved in peace talks well.  Turkey is not a neutral country and it is a member of NATO.  It has been very difficult for French President Macron to be on the phone constantly with Mr. Putin and listening to what he comes out with.  He has done it in the interests of peace.  He has done it on behalf of all of us as France has the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the time being.  It is an important voice and such work is important.</p><p>We are actively involved in discussions at the UN Security Council.  We have been extremely clear.  Russia needs to leave Ukraine.  It needs to take its army and soldiers and go home and tell the people the truth of what it has done.  This is wrong and needs to end.  That is where our strong voice has come in.  To anybody who is working towards peace, we wish them well.  It is very difficult to trust Russia.  We only trust it in terms of what it actually does, not by what it says.  </p><p> In terms of a Covid-style response, I agree.  There has been an extraordinary response from the European Union, running into billions of euro so far.  The European Union has been taking steps in the last few weeks that were completely unimaginable before Christmas.  It has brought the EU together.  That is very welcome.  We have sent out a signal that we are democratic, we support democracy and we want Ukraine to be fully part of that European family.</p><p> In Poland, the Deputy said there are no tented villages.  It is the depths of winter there.  They are using gymnasiums and church halls.  Poland does not have a supply of houses it can magic up for millions of people.  When he was in Poland two weeks ago the Minister, Deputy Coveney, visited a gymnasium where people were sleeping.  That is the accommodation they have there.  We probably both know Gormanston better than anyone.  That would be used if necessary.  It is clearly not what we want to do but the numbers are very high.  The numbers we have taken in so far are nothing really, compared with other countries.  It is part of a wider response.</p><p> It is also very important to remember that this is a temporary protection directive.  The idea of this is to give people temporary protection.  Almost everybody who has left Ukraine wants to go back home.  Why would they not?  Until now, Ukraine was quite a successful country.  There are stories of Russian soldiers coming into villages and being shocked by the standard of living compared to what they have in Russia.  Ukraine wants to improve on that standard of living.  People want to go back when it is safe to do so, to rebuild their country.  We will help them.  We have limited resources, as does every country.  I was talking to my ministerial counterpart in Rome, Vincenzo Amendola, and I asked him where were the Ukrainian people going who are arriving in Italy.  There are a lot of church properties, gymnasiums, halls and so on being used there as well.  I was reminded in Italy that there is a still a huge flow of people coming across the Mediterranean in very difficult circumstances.  They are coming from all sorts of countries through north Africa.  That is a very difficult situation.  They do not have the same rights as Ukrainians.  They have the right to apply for international protection if they are entitled to that but the temporary protection directive is there for the people of Ukraine in these particularly difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

There is talk of illegals and running a degree of espionage or industrial espionage operations throughout Europe.  I am not expecting a comprehensive answer but is there any answer the Minister of State can give about that and the worries that exist around the Russian embassy at the minute?  I accept that it fits into some of our fears and worries as regards hybrid and cyber security.</p> <p>  When we had our meetings with the Moldovans, Georgians and Ukrainians, people got the idea of the Copenhagen criteria.  In fairness, the Minister of State has dealt with the significant issues, particularly in respect of rule of law.  We know the issues around Hungary.  Could there be a more straightforward roadmap and facilitation for them into the future?</p> <p>  On the question of Hungary and Poland, I assume on some level that Vladimir Putin has probably secured the future of the European Union and the whole idea of co-operation.  We probably had a very different interaction with the Polish ambassador than we would have had previously, given the work Poland is doing in dealing with the desperate refugee situation.  Has there been any movement from Poland since the invasion?  I would imagine it also recognises the necessity of Europe.  I am differentiating the Poles from Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  Even in respect of the latter, I assume there have been many conversations with him at a high level about the relationship with Vladimir Putin's Russia.  The Minister of State detailed a lot of information about the candidate countries seeking accession.  He spoke about Serbia.  Even individually, we here have had conversations with the likes of the Bosnian ambassador and others.  There is a belief that there are certain dangers in that part of the world and some of them have arisen, possibly due to Russian gamesmanship.  Has the conversation moved on?</p> <p>  On gas, people are seeking every source outside of Russia, which is absolutely necessary.  Am I correct in thinking there is a rationing deal across Europe such that if gas resources are depleted in the likes of Poland, everyone has to pony up?  At that stage, primacy would have to be given to electricity production so we could find ourselves not only with the difficulty of price but also a lack of supply.  I think everyone here is in absolute agreement that we need the European Union to come back with a positive result from the point of view of giving us some necessary levers on VAT.  The issue of supply is particularly concerning at this point.  I get that.  In the best-case scenario, we need to make maximum use of the renewables that are available to us.  However, we are not going to be able to do that straight away.</p></speech>

To be fair to them, they have fully lined up with decisions that have been taken by the European Union which have required unanimity.  They have done that.

Bosnia is always under active discussion, particularly at the Foreign Affairs Council and European Council.  I am meeting my Croatian counterpart in a couple of hours.  This will be on the agenda as well.  On gas, there is no proposal like the one the Deputy mentioned.  There is possible joint purchasing, storage mechanisms and increased storage and other routes for supply such as those President Biden announced last week.  Other countries are also involved there.</p><p>There is complete logic in that.  Something was put in the media at one point to the effect that we are already in a scenario where there are deals done and that if there was a shortage, it would mean there would be rationing.  The example given was Poland.  We would all have to pony up.</p></speech>

We do not want to cause any fears or runs.  I can speak to what I see happening, and I have spoken to people involved in it, which is that countries are buying up gas from other places and trying to ship it in.  There are pipelines as well that may be under-utilised from other parts of Eurasia that do not affect Russia.  There is a lot of work going on.  President Biden's announcement last week was very significant.  What we need to do is reduce our dependence and move on then to renewables as well.</p></speech>

It is based on the exchange rate between the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and us.  It operates drawing rights, which are known as a currency.  There can be slight variations, so it is estimated at &euro;2.4 billion.  That is the maximum that we can lend to the IMF.  There are three other sections dealing with grant contributions and not loans.  They are poverty reduction and growth trust, the catastrophe containment and relief trust, and other prescribed trusts.  There is a &euro;50 million limit for each of those grant schemes, but there is provision in the legislation for the possibility of other prescribed trusts in due course, if the need arises, with maximum grant commitments under this legislation of up to &euro;325 million, compared with &euro;2.4 billion of loan agreements with the IMF.</p></speech>

Is deas &iacute; a fheice&aacute;il anseo os comhair an chomhchoiste agus is deas &iacute; a chloisint ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge freisin.  Mar is eol di, t&aacute; Gaeltacht stairi&uacute;il ina contae f&eacute;in, Contae na M&iacute;, i R&aacute;th Chairn agus Baile Ghib.</p><p>T&aacute; daoine sa Ghaeltacht agus daoine le Gaeilge trasna na t&iacute;re ag lorg seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &oacute;n nGarda S&iacute;och&aacute;na san &aacute;ireamh.  T&aacute; a fhios againn go bhfuil deacrachta&iacute; ag an St&aacute;t seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il i st&aacute;isi&uacute;in Gharda sna Gaeltachta&iacute; trasna na t&iacute;re toisc nach bhfuil garda&iacute; ar f&aacute;il at&aacute; in ann freastal ar dhaoine tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid anseo ag pl&eacute; na h&aacute;bhair th&aacute;bhachtacha seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; sa r&aacute;iteas tosaigh a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn go bhfuil 466 iarratas&oacute;ir as os cionn 10,000 iarratas&oacute;ir a rinne iarratas chun dul isteach sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tar &eacute;is iarratas a dh&eacute;anamh faoin sruth Gaeilge.  Is figi&uacute;r maith agus figi&uacute;r ard &eacute; sin.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; dul chun cinn suntasach i gcompar&aacute;id le 2019.  An bhfuil an tAire s&aacute;sta go mbeidh ard&uacute; suntasach ar an l&iacute;on garda a bhfuil Gaeilge acu i ndiaidh an phr&oacute;isis de thoradh an fhigi&uacute;ir sin?  T&aacute; a fhios ag an Aire an c&eacute;atad&aacute;n at&aacute; leagtha amach sa phlean teanga do sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it, is &eacute; sin go mbeidh 20% d'earcaithe don St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s in ann freastal ar dhaoine tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge.  Is ceann de na ch&eacute;ad phr&oacute;isis earca&iacute;ochta mh&oacute;ra ar a mbeimid in ann s&uacute;il a choinne&aacute;il maidir leis an gc&eacute;atad&aacute;n at&aacute; earcaithe le Gaeilge &eacute; seo.  An bhfuil an tAire s&aacute;sta go mbeidh c&eacute;atad&aacute;n ard de gharda&iacute; le Gaeilge ag teacht amach &oacute;n bpr&oacute;iseas seo?</p></speech>

I work as closely as I can with them to support them in ensuring that they remain and that they can prosper and flourish.  As he outlined, the figures speak for themselves.  The fact that 466 people have applied under this new stream is fantastic considering the number applying in 2019 was 129.  With regard to the 20% target, in the light of the funding we have for 800 garda&iacute; this year alone, without knowing who will be able to complete or be successful in the process and become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 466 applicants in the context of 800 posts certainly gives us a very good chance and an opportunity to reach that 20% target.  I really hope that we will be in a position to do so but, without knowing who of the 10,000 who have applied will reach that stage, I cannot give the Senator a definitive answer.  Given the increase in the number applying this year, I certainly hope we will see an overall increase in Garda numbers.  There is a requirement in legislation for the Garda Commissioner to ensure, insofar as is practicable and possible, that garda&iacute; stationed in Gaeltacht areas are proficient in Irish.  This certainly helps in that regard.  There is also work under way with regard to stations in Gaeltacht service towns.  We are not just looking at the stations specifically within Gaeltacht areas, but also at those that provide services to those areas.  There is a long-term goal to ensure that stations in the Gaeltacht are fully bilingual and that those stations situated outside the Gaeltacht but that serve the area can also provide adequate bilingual services.  Increasing the numbers of garda&iacute; who are bilingual and making sure we continue to provide adequate education and training for those members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are not bilingual but who have a certain amount of Irish will certainly be helpful.  I am hopeful and positive.  These are really positive figures.  Again, notwithstanding the fact that we do not know who will make it through this process and be successful at the end, we are possibly in a situation to reach at least the target of 20% of new recruits being Irish speakers.</p></speech>

There certainly will not be a lower standard, such as the Senator mentioned, or anything like that depending on the language people speak.  We have asked that people be proficient in at least one language other than English.  We are not singling out Irish or any other language and creating a different process.  There is obviously a physical test that takes place in addition to an aptitude test and interview processes.  That interview stage has already started.  Everybody goes through the same process but we hope that the fact that we have three times as many people applying in Irish as the last time will, by its very nature, mean that more such people will be successful in the end.  It is very hard to say what the numbers might be but, again, the very fact that there has been such a significant increase in the number applying is a very positive start.  There will not be a separate process, however.</p></speech>

The 20% target is for 2030.  We hope to have another round as soon as possible after this round and we will open up the application process again in the coming years.  If we spread that figure of 466 - and I hope we will have a similar number if not an even higher one the next time - across the next number of competitions, it is to be hoped that, by 2030, we will meet that overall figure.  That is not to say we cannot reach it in this round.  It is absolutely possible.  We have funding for 800 recruits this year alone but it is very difficult to give the Senator a firm commitment that we will reach 20% immediately.  The target is to reach it by 2030.</p></speech>

There was a particular focus on diversity and we very much tried to ensure this time that different communities and groups were aware of the fact that this competition was open and that more women were going to apply.  That in itself applied also to our Irish community and Irish speakers.  This was due to the fact that we had a campaign over the past number of weeks to try to encourage people to think of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a career for them and asked people who had not, perhaps, put themselves forward or considered a career in the force before now to do so on this occasion.  That would include people within our Gaeltacht areas and those who are proficient in Irish.  We have seen a significant increase in other diverse communities applying, together with an increase in women applying and putting themselves forward.  This is due to the fact that we put a very significant focus on letting people know that this campaign was open and that we very much wanted people from every community across the country to apply.  Other than that, "I do not know" is the honest answer to the Deputy's question about why we have an increase in these numbers.  The fact that we placed this focus on letting people know about the campaign and asked people from other communities to come forward had, possibly, a very significant part to play.</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy&rsquo;s original question.  We do not know exactly and we do not have clarity from the people who applied as to why they did so, but perhaps the new strategy itself is a signal to members who are applying that there is a Gaeltacht strategy or an Irish-language strategy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with a real focus now, and that there is a plan for Irish speakers.  There has been communication - members of the force went on Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and on other radio stations as part of a communications campaign.  It is very hard to tell but there are a number of possible ways in which people were encouraged in which they may not have been before.</p> <p>  Within the Department, currently we have five members of our staff who are currently undertaking Irish-language courses.  These will finish shortly.  Since 2019, some 39 staff have been supported through the various courses, 24 of whom have progressed through multiple levels of training.  We are not as big a Department as some of the other large Departments so that is a good figure, but obviously we could improve on it.  </p> <p>  In our Irish-language scheme, we have published the official Irish version of the 1986, 1997 and 2001 consolidations of the rules of the superior courts.  We are making progress to ensure that work is done not just in our teams within the Department but also in the areas which we govern, in particular around the courts, and that translation work is done there.  The Department has a panel of officials who are always available to answer queries in Irish.  They are given specifically designated badges or are highlighted.</p> <p>  In respect of the other services that we provide through Irish, other than the rules of the courts which I have mentioned which have been translated recently, the fact that we do not provide services directly to the public means that we do not have a whole suite of teams that one, perhaps, might also find in other Departments.</p><p>It is about making sure that we can deal with the State agencies we work with directly in Irish and that we can respond in Irish.  We also want to ensure we can respond in Irish when dealing with the Oireachtas.  However, we may not have the same levels as other Departments that have that face-to-face element.</p></speech>

I would not call it a test but there is an interview process whereby, if somebody is selected who has Irish as a language, he or she will have to show he or she is proficient.  I am sure there are people who put down that they are proficient in Irish when they may not be, but it is important that if someone says they are proficient in a language, particularly if they could potentially be sent to a Gaeltacht area, they do have the language they say they have.  There will be an interview process.  Obviously not all 10,000 people who have applied will go through that interview process but those who are selected will be tested in the language, in the same way others will be tested in other languages as well.</p> <p>  Separate to that, while there is an onus on those who say they are proficient to make sure they are, there is a specific focus within the organisation on trying to improve everybody&rsquo;s proficiency in Irish as well.  That comes with the Irish-language strategy that was published recently.  There is an online resource available to people so they can, at every stage, try to improve, upskill and upgrade their language skills.</p></speech>

It is very important, not just for the garda&iacute; but for the Prison Service, the Court Service and all agencies that fall under the remit of the Department of Justice, that they clearly set out their Irish-language strategies and plans.  Earlier, I mentioned the 2030 target for the 20% of recruits.  In order to reach that, all our agencies need to make sure they are doing the work they need to do, not just to encourage more people into their organisations but to make sure that those who are there are supported.  There should be opportunities available at all times to those who, perhaps, did not consider Irish as a language or who are not proficient to improve their language skills.  That is set out in the Irish-language strategy, our plan within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  I reiterate what M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il said in his opening remarks.  As part of the consultation process with the Commissioner and the Policing Authority, when they were drafting the new regulations, in regard to the sergeant and inspector rank, the foundation training programme has those specific requirements I mentioned for recruits to learn and demonstrate their competency and proficiency in the Irish language.  That is there and it is part of making sure that those who say they can speak Irish will be able to speak it.  It is important to retain and maintain that as well.</p></speech>

The more people apply, the more people will go through the process and be successful at interview stage as well as subsequent stages, which will hopefully increase our overall numbers.</p> <p>  It is regrettable that there is a view or a sense that by changing the regulations, there was a downgrading.  That was certainly not the intention.  As regards where this came from, first, the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland set out a huge piece of reform which is under way, based on its initial report.  It specifically noted that diversity is vital in any organisation, but particularly in an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that needs to be innovative, adaptable and representative of the communities it supports.  The need to have Irish as a second language was seen as a barrier to many people when applying to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  Prior to the change in the regulation, the numbers were not increasing.  I am not sure whether people were encouraged to come forward just because it was a mandatory requirement.  The way people are encouraged to come forward, be it in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or other agency or organisation, is by engaging with them, making sure there is a clear plan and strategy, and supporting them in the development of their language.  I believe that is what we have tried to do here and what the Garda Commissioner is trying to do with the new Irish-language strategy.  During our campaigning in recent weeks since the beginning of the year, there were specific call-outs to people in Gaeltacht areas and beyond, encouraging them to come forward and to consider An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, more so than we have done before.  If people looked into it, they could see that there was a clear plan, that Irish speakers were being considered and that there was a clear strategy for them within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That in itself is very positive.</p> <p>  Making something mandatory does not necessarily mean you will get the outcome you want.  Going by the figures, we have seen some progress.  Obviously, until we see the numbers of those who get through the interview process and are successful in the end, that remains to be seen.  The fact that the number of applicants is 466, up from 129, is progress in itself and we want to build on that.</p></speech>

Tuigim gur cuireadh an pointe seo chun cinn mar gheall ar an teanga agus an &eacute;ags&uacute;lacht.  Nuair a cheist&iacute;omar na finn&eacute;ithe sna cruinnithe deiridh, n&iacute; raibh aon duine in ann aon fhianaise a chur ar f&aacute;il chun a r&aacute; gur &oacute;n bhfianaise sin a th&aacute;inig an t-eolas agus seo &eacute; an taighde a bhain leis.  Th&aacute;inig tuairim &oacute; &aacute;it &eacute;igin.  N&iacute; fheadar cad as ar th&aacute;inig s&eacute;.  N&iacute; raibh aon duine in ann rud breise a chur leis sin.  Ar cuireadh eolas breise ar f&aacute;il don Aire nuair a tugadh an moladh di, n&oacute; ar th&aacute;inig an moladh &oacute; tuairim &eacute;igin a bh&iacute; ag dul thart gan aon taighde bainteach l&eacute;i?  An f&eacute;idir leis an Aire &eacute; sin a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute;?</p> <p>  Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; ardaithe.  Mar a luaigh m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, rinneadh n&iacute;os m&oacute; f&oacute;gra&iacute;ochta agus rinneadh iarracht n&iacute;os m&oacute; chun daoine a mhealladh isteach.  Braithim gurb &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th ar thug Gaeilgeoir&iacute; breise tr&iacute;d an sruth Gaeilge seachas aon athr&uacute; maidir leis an teanga.  Gan dabht, n&iacute;l aon taighde agam chun &eacute; sin a chinnti&uacute; mar n&iacute;l aon eolas agam ar na figi&uacute;ir&iacute;, ach braithim gurb iad an fh&oacute;gra&iacute;ocht agus an t-eolas breise a mheall daoine isteach, agus ba iad na hiarrachta&iacute; sin ba ch&uacute;is leis seachas aon athr&uacute; maidir leis an teanga.  An bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a thabhairt ar aon taighde n&oacute; eolas breise a cuireadh ar f&aacute;il don Aire mar gheall ar an athr&uacute; sin?  Nuair a cheist&iacute;omar na finn&eacute;ithe sa choiste roimhe seo, n&iacute; raibh siad in ann aon eolas breise a chur ar f&aacute;il ach amh&aacute;in a r&aacute; go raibh an tuairim seo ann, go raibh an teanga ag cur isteach ar an &eacute;ags&uacute;lacht.  Is cos&uacute;il go raibh an tuairim ag dul timpeall agus nach raibh aon taighde ann chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt di.  </p></speech>

As the Deputy has said, I and others believe the increase in numbers has happened for a number of different reasons, including communications and outreach.  What was happening before clearly was not working, we were not seeing those numbers increase in the way we wanted and this requirement was preventing others from applying.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland engaged across the board with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Inspectorate, the Policing Authority, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and communities and tried to get a picture of the Garda, its work and its structures.  The Garda itself would have an idea of the composition of its membership but it also went out to other communities and asked them why the members of those communities were not applying.  This included under-represented communities, and what came back from many of them was they did not have Irish and the fact that Irish was mandatory was preventing them from applying.  Having it as a mandatory requirement did not discourage nor encourage Irish speakers from applying but it did discourage others from applying.  In trying to create a diverse police force and in trying to ensure the Garda represents and is reflective of the communities it represents, this was seen as a barrier.  It was as simple as some research from asking communities and garda&iacute; speaking to people.  That fed into what was highlighted in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p> <p>  We need to rethink how we engage with Gaeltacht areas and Irish speakers and we need to learn lessons from this recruitment campaign.  If possible, we need to try to understand why people have applied.  We will not understand that until we go through the overall process but progress is being made and it is to be hoped we can continue to make that progress.</p></speech>

The Deputy made a point about Letterkenny and this is a Garda station that will be a service station and a training station.  Those who are going to Letterkenny will have an opportunity to learn their essential policing skills and to make use of their Irish-language skills, which is welcome and the Deputy has been passionate about making sure that happens.  It is important those who are not fluent Irish speakers and who go into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na always have an opportunity to improve, learn and become Irish speakers where they are not at all, and that is where the Irish-language strategy comes into play.  It is about encouraging more people who can speak fluently, who can teach others and who can converse with the public, be it on the ground, in our communities, going to courts or in other areas.  There must be continuous ways in which people can improve, with online learning being an option, and that is something the Commissioner and the Garda are making available to people.  At the same time, you cannot beat face-to-face physical contact and conversation and it is important those options are available to people.</p> <p>  Thinking ahead, there is an option or an opportunity as we develop our community safety partnerships .  There are three pilots under way in Dublin inner city, Waterford and Longford, and this is about making sure communities feel safe and take charge of the policing and safety plans in their areas.  Where these expand beyond the pilot areas, members of the Gaeltacht areas would potentially be included in these community safety partnerships.  They could work closely with the Garda and other members of the group to make sure people in Gaeltacht areas are supported in the same way as everybody else through the Irish language.  It is about making sure it is incorporated into every aspect of the work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing and spreading it out into the community as well.</p></speech>

A very high level of Irish is required.  Clearly, there are others in the Garda who have not come through that stream and who have only conversational Irish.  The programme in Templemore also teaches basic Irish for day-to-day interactions.  The people who come in on the specialist Irish-language stream must face the entire process in Irish.

It is not a test but you have to demonstrate that you have proficiency.  With regard to the changes on the promotion side of things, the new regulations were informed by the Garda Inspectorate report from 2015 which recommended that a new process be put in place.  I appreciate the regulations represent a fundamental change from what was there before.  As the Chairman has said, candidates had to go through a particular test.  This is the first time a process has been held through the Public Appointments Service.  It is quite a departure from the previous system.  As part of the consultation with the Commissioner and the Policing Authority on drafting these new regulations, it was decided the foundation programme would include specific requirements for recruits to learn and to demonstrate their competency, as I have outlined.  They are required to complete the training that forms part of the programme.  It was agreed that a requirement for a separate proficiency test was essentially unnecessary.  The main focus is on candidates' skills and ability to carry out their work so, once they have demonstrated that they have Irish, the focus is on their ability to carry out their work and the specific skills and requirements they need for that particular promotion.  I appreciate it is a departure from what was there before but this was done in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, the Policing Authority and having regard to recommendations in the 2015 report, Changing Policing in Ireland.</p></speech>

This goes back to the original point that the more people we have in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who can speak Irish fluently or who are proficient in the language, the more such people will rise through the ranks having gone through that promotion process.  What came out of the process of developing the new regulations was the need to make sure that people were able to do the job.  It is not that the language issue is secondary.  It is still important but it needs to be balance with the overall need to be able to do the work.  The fact that competency and proficiency in the language is still required means that there is still a focus on it.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; tarlaithe agus n&iacute;l muid ag dul ar ais air ach d&uacute;irt An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na linn n&aacute;r lorg s&eacute; aon athr&uacute; ar an gcaighde&aacute;n.  D&uacute;irt an tSeirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; linn n&aacute;r lorg &iacute; &eacute;.  D&uacute;irt an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s P&oacute;il&iacute;neachta an rud c&eacute;anna.  N&iacute; raibh aon mhiontuairisc&iacute; de na cruinnithe ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn so f&oacute;s n&iacute;l a fhios againn c&eacute;n duine n&oacute; eagras as si&uacute;d a bh&iacute; ag d&eacute;anamh cainte faoi athruithe sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a lorg athr&uacute; &oacute; thaobh st&aacute;das na Gaeilge de n&aacute; athruithe eile ag an gc&eacute;im seo.  An &oacute;n Roinn f&eacute;in a th&aacute;inig an cinneadh?  Measaim go raibh an Garda Representative Association agus an Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors p&aacute;irteach sna comhr&aacute;ite freisin.  B'fh&eacute;idir go raibh daoine eile p&aacute;irteach ann ach n&iacute; raibh aon duine s&aacute;sta a r&aacute; gur lorg siadsan an t-athr&uacute; agus an f&aacute;th gur lorg siad &eacute; agus an fhianaise ar a mbuna&iacute;odh an cinneadh seo a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.  Is &eacute; sin an pr&iacute;omhrud nach raibh ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn go dt&iacute; seo.  Luaigh an tAire an Coimisi&uacute;n um Thodhcha&iacute; na P&oacute;il&iacute;neachta in &Eacute;irinn.  N&iacute;or luaigh aon duine go raibh fianaise n&oacute; eolas i dtuarasc&aacute;il an choimisi&uacute;in maidir le haon bhac ar dhaoine dul isteach sa Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na n&oacute; meon daoine faoi na harduithe c&eacute;ime seo.  Is ceist eile &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; cheist eile agam ina dhiaidh sin.</p></speech>

It did so based on the information that it was available to it at the time.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland highlighted a lack of diversity and a need to increase diversity within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The Garda itself, in reaching out to other communities, identified that one of the reasons people were not coming forward was because they had to have both languages, including the Irish language.  It is not just different communities but people with learning disabilities, dyslexia and other learning challenges who said this was a challenge for them.  There was not a specific ask through the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland or the Garda but taking all that information into account, a decision was taken to remove this requirement.  It was also decided that there would be a particular focus and emphasis on Irish in the next recruitment round in order to increase the numbers.  That is where the communication aspect came in and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na developed its new strategy.  It is based on the information we have.</p><p> To answer the previous question, it was clear that the Irish-language requirement did not actually increase the numbers applying or support people, but it did act as a barrier to other people applying, which I do not think any of us want to see happening.  We want to make sure everybody knows that they can apply and that they have an opportunity to become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was seen as a barrier in that regard.  The Department took that information on board and put forward these recommendations.</p></speech>

That we have seen an increase in this round is positive.  We need to see the numbers that come out of this and whether the actions we have taken have been successful.  We need to allow for the strategy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bed down and to see how successful that is.  Obviously, 2030 is not that far away.  It will not be long before we have another recruitment campaign.  From my own point of view, I think everything needs to be kept under consideration and nothing should be excluded, the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s suggestion included.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SC12022033000002#L00300"><p>Good afternoon, Chairperson and members.  My apologies in advance as I will relay my opening statement in English because my Irish is not strong enough.  I am joined today by my colleagues: Tony Canavan, CEO, Saolta Hospital Group; Cuim&iacute;n Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute;, head of the Irish-language service in the HSE; Mark Brennock, national director of communications; and Dr. Margaret Fitzgerald, specialist in public health, HSE national social inclusion office.</p> <p>  The HSE attended this committee in November 2021 and gave an update on our work to provide information and services in Irish and our implementation of our Irish-language strategy.  The HSE has some ground to make up in this area, as the committee is aware.  I regret the opportunities missed to adopt and implement a scheme under the previous Act.  We are renewing our commitment to work to meet our duties under the updated legislation from now on.  We want to use the good work done during the Covid-19 period as a platform for that improved service to Irish speakers.</p> <p>  In December, the committee asked that I attend to discuss videos produced by the HSE in 12 languages of migrant communities to encourage uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine.  The committee also asked to discuss generally the languages in which the HSE provides information to the public.  Let me first address the context of the videos for our migrant communities.  In the course of the pandemic, very clear at-risk groups emerged along with evidence of groups less likely to take up the vaccines.</p><p>We noted especially low vaccine uptake rates of 26% for nationals of EU 14-27 countries working in sector A, which includes agriculture, forestry and fishing.<br/><br/>In response, the HSE&rsquo;s social inclusion team worked on measures to ensure that Covid-19 advice and vaccine promotion messages were adapted for those communities representing lower uptake rate or higher levels of ICU admissions.  These programmes included creating videos in the languages spoken by at-risk communities who are unlikely to be served by traditional channels or information in English or Irish.<br/><br/>For this particular purpose, neither English- nor Irish-language versions of these videos were required.  There is an English-language version on the website to act as a reference, but this was not promoted or used as part of the campaign.  We are very proud of our partnership with Translate Ireland, which has worked with us to reach people that are not well served by our traditional communications campaigns.<br/><br/>Let me address the provision of services and information in the Irish language, focusing on our Covid-19 communications over the last two years.  Our mainstream communications campaign during the pandemic used a wide range of mass media channels to reach the public.  Both the English and Irish languages were included in our daily news and media interviews with HSE leaders; social media messages from the HSE; HSE Live, our Covid-19 phone information service; <i>hse.ie</i>, the main source of advice and information; advertising campaigns on TV, radio, newspapers, posters and cinemas; Google search advertising and digital advertising on websites and HSE booklets delivered to all households.<br/><br/>The Saolta hospital group has also carried out extensive Irish-language communications during Covid-19, including social media and news media communications and a dedicated section on its website, along with information sheets and walk-through videos for vaccination centres in Gaeltacht areas.<br/><br/>Members will already be aware that many of the above channels have seen a much greater proportion of Irish-language messaging, since the pandemic began, than our previous norms.  We have seen enhanced levels of Irish-language activity on social media and our Covid-19 television and radio adverts were produced in both languages and aired on television on TG4.<br/><br/>The HSE website, <i>hse.ie</i>, has been the main source of reliable information for the public and with the support of the HSE Irish-language service, 108 pages of Covid content are provided in Irish.  HSE Live, our phone support service, has Irish-speaking operatives to allow registration for the Covid-19 vaccine through Irish.<br/><br/>Substantial HSE information booklets on Covid-19 were produced bilingually and delivered to all households in Ireland in 2020 and again in 2021.  Our Covid-19 vaccine information booklets have been produced in English and in Irish from the outset of the programme, with updates to the text and translations being carried out each week since December 2020.  These booklets are all available on the HSE website and printed copies are also made available.<br/><br/>We have taken many opportunities to provide an unprecedented level of advertising and patient information through Irish during the pandemic and will extend this to other topics in line with the new legislation.  We also acknowledge, as discussed in our November attendance here, that some opportunities to advance our vision for the Irish language as detailed in our strategy have been missed during this period.<br/><br/>We have addressed the availability of our online applications connected to Covid-19, such as the vaccination portal and the systems used to book antigen tests, and to book a vaccine or Covid-19 test in Irish.  I am happy to say that all these systems are now available through Irish on <i>hse.ie</i>.<br/><br/>Our plans to improve and extend our public information in Irish include providing a high-quality user experience and up-to-date content on the HSE&rsquo;s website.  We have begun the process of developing a semi-automated process with a high-quality translation service to ensure accuracy.  The initial scope of this project is to enable the HSE website to be multilingual and to provide Covid-19 and Covid-19 vaccination information on <i>hse.ie</i>in Irish in the first place.  We aim to have this in place by the end of April.<br/><br/>Looking forward, we will ensure we meet the upcoming legislative requirements placed upon us by the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021.  This will include appointing a new senior manager to lead the process.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has told us it will be in touch with us with regard to the commencement of the new legislation and will run information sessions for public bodies.  We look forward to participating fully and to further improving the services we provide in Irish.</p></speech>

We were invited here, along with our colleagues in the HSE, to discuss the various languages through which the HSE and the Department of Health provide and advertise their services to the public, with particular reference to the Irish language.</p> <p>  This committee has examined our record on the provision of services through Irish in a detailed way in recent sessions which were attended by my colleagues.  I acknowledge the feedback we received on foot of those conversations and debates.  We have moved to correct mistakes which have occurred in the context of our response to the pandemic and to ensure that our services are available in Irish for those who require it.  I am happy to report that, as a Department, we have further strengthened our capacity to manage correspondence and to provide for services in Irish, for those who require or desire it.</p> <p>  Our efforts to incorporate Irish into our response to the Covid pandemic have been examined in detail by the committee during the most recent meeting between officials and this committee.  We have learned lessons and we have strengthened our capacity to ensure that the needs of Irish speakers are accommodated in our response to the pandemic.</p> <p>  With regard to digital Covid certificates, a bilingual online portal has been available since August 2021, where people can arrange for changes and corrections to their certificates, among other things.  We have seen a substantial take-up of this service, as Gaeilge, by members of the public since its launch, with thousands of citizen interactions with our service centre and online webchat.</p> <p>  With regard to public health notices and health promotion materials, I can confirm that the Department made every effort to fulfil the obligations of the Official Languages Act 2003 during an extremely challenging time for the Department.  All printed materials created by the Department were available bilingually at the same time.</p> <p>  The Department regularly posted public health advice across social channels in Irish and in English and statements from the Chief Medical Officer and deputy chief medical officer, outlining and reiterating the public health advice, were available bilingually on the Department&rsquo;s website soon after publication.  All printed advertisements placed in regional and national newspapers by the Department were also available bilingually.  The Department&rsquo;s press office continues to provide a service in Irish to Irish-language media.</p> <p>  In our commitment to health service improvement and to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms, we will have opportunities to refresh our approach to the delivery of services in Irish and in other languages besides English.  In the coming week, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will be bringing a plan to the Government for the introduction of regional health areas.</p> <p>  A key objective of the regional health areas is to ensure the delivery of health and social care services consistent with the needs and requirements of the local population.  It is envisaged that this will permit a fresh approach to the provision of services in Irish and in other languages consistent with the evolving requirements of households and communities at regional level.</p> <p>  As accounting officer of the Department of Health, I ensure that my officials are aware of all their responsibilities, including as regards the provision of services in Irish.  I am satisfied that this is an area in which we, as a Department, have been able to greatly improve over recent years and we are now in a position where we can manage all departmental business through Irish or English, as desired.  We learned a lot through the pandemic and learned from our mistakes.</p> <p>  We are committed to working with the HSE, in particular, to ensure that health service reform takes sufficient account of language needs in the design and roll-out of services.  I look forward to engaging with the committee.</p></speech>

I will mention again where our focus was.  We had very good information based on geography and population across the country but, as we reached high levels of vaccine uptake in the primary programme, we became concerned about vulnerable groups and non-Irish groups in particular.  Our approach involved a number of languages, which my colleague will outline.  While, as I said in my opening statement, we targeted particular languages, I acknowledge that we recorded a version in English, which was put up on our site.  In hindsight, we should have recorded an Irish version as well.  However, as Dr. Fitzgerald will outline, the target population was very clear because of the vulnerabilities and exposure among those groups.  We did make progress through that communications campaign.  I will ask Dr. Fitzgerald to list the specific groups.</p></speech>

In our national office for social inclusion, our remit includes those who are socially marginalised or excluded from mainstream society.  This includes groups such as Travellers, Roma, people in direct provision, homeless people, people affected by addiction and irregular migrants.  In the course of our work during the Covid pandemic, we saw how much Covid outbreaks were affecting those who are most excluded and who are, as I used to say, not necessarily watching the news on RT&Eacute; at night or reading the mainstream media.  When the roll-out of the vaccination campaign started, we were acutely aware that we needed to think outside the box.  I wrote a paper with my colleagues in mid-2021 highlighting how we needed to reach out to vulnerable migrants.  Even though we knew there was a focus on giving people access to vaccination based on medical vulnerability in line with the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, we knew that not everyone in society could get access easily and that a pathway needed to be opened for several of these groups.  Access issues could relate to language, physical distance, the lack of a car, distrust in society or distrust in the vaccination message.  Through our research and ongoing work, we could see that the level of uptake of vaccination among some communities in Ireland, particularly multi-ethnic communities, was very low even as their cohorts were offered vaccination.  That was the main driver of the production of these videos.</p> <p>  The first indication that we needed to do something different was that pregnant women were very hesitant to take up vaccination. Our colleagues on the ground, and GPs in particular, who were already working with Translate Ireland, an organisation that started up after the beginning of the Covid pandemic, suggested that we produce video material in the languages of certain communities, especially the languages of eastern Europeans, Brazilians and people coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, to be delivered by healthcare workers from their own countries so that they could hear the voices of their own communities.  We felt that written material did not suit these communities and that they had to be given something they could see and hear in a video or multimedia format, that is, something that could be shared on WhatsApp.  They were our main motivations.  </p> <p>  The languages we initially picked were Arabic, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Romanian and Urdu.  We then moved on to Lithuanian, Polish, Ukrainian, Georgian, Somali, Czech and Slovak.  Ukrainian was added latterly to meet the needs of the Ukrainian community that has just arrived.  We picked the top 11 languages based on the numbers of people we had in the community and the numbers of people in direct provision, another group that was greatly affected by the Covid pandemic.  We picked a mixture.  Obviously, not all ethnic minorities are excluded socially but many work in low-paid industries.  We picked the languages based on the communities, their context and the hesitancy and lack of access that we could see from our statistics.  English was picked as an audit tool to make sure we knew that what we were translating was correct.  That is why we did not look at doing one for the Irish-speaking community at that point.</p></speech>

I can clarify, through Mr. Brennock, if we made specific videos for pregnant women.  However, our primary route for pregnant women, which worked through the process was at their appointments and generally as they were coming through their clinical pathways.  Mr. Canavan might want to confirm this.  I am not certain we made dedicated videos in English or any other language for pregnant women but I ask Mr. Brennock, our communications manager, to clarify that.</p></speech>

My apologies, as I have not understood all of the exchange, but as Dr. Fitzgerald said, the particular groups in whose languages the videos were made were selected arising from statistics from the Central Statistics Office and elsewhere and were related to people who were not accessing communication as normal via their clinicians or mainstream sources.  There was not seen to be a need to make videos of this type in English or Irish.  Dr. Fitzgerald has explained the reason one video was made in English and put on the website.  However, it was not promoted or used as part of a campaign to pregnant English-speaking women.</p></speech>

We worked mostly with doctors from the migrant communities, in this instance, to produce short videos that could explain to the communities the advantages and the importance of the vaccination in case they did not pick it up from mainstream media.</p> <p>  Out of that initiative, we developed a series of videos, including on how to get a GP, how to apply for a medical card and what happens when one is pregnant.  We did these in other languages in order that people from those communities who were not able to access mainstream health services could do so.  We agreed the wording with the national immunisation office and HSE communications.  It was aligned with the general communication for most of the population but it was an extra measure for people who did not pick up on the excellent messages that were out on radio, television and the media.</p></speech>

During Covid, we were particularly trying to target vaccination through their clinicians.  Information was provided to consultant obstetricians and the antenatal staff who were meeting regularly with patients on a regular basis in order that they would use those meetings as an opportunity to promote the uptake of the vaccine.</p></speech>

The translation was delivered by a Russian or French doctor and then we advertised to our GP colleagues through the Irish College of General Practitioners and told them to look at it.  The main driver for the initiative, called "my health, my language", came from GPs and advocates in the community who wanted better messaging for migrant communities.  GPs and clinicians were encouraged to go to this video and show it and share it on WhatsApp.  They were told that this was what they should tell their patients.  That was the freagra.</p></speech>

We have obviously not done ourselves justice throughout and have not done enough in meeting our obligations on this issue and, certainly, in the context of the new Act, with Cuim&iacute;n Mac Aodha Bhu&iacute; and all the rest of the team, I want us to embrace it in a better way.  I have seen where it works well and I came from a role in Fingal County Council where we put a particular plan in place and it very much galvanised the workforce who embraced it.  It is something I am very anxious, through our communications director, Mr. Brennock, to embrace, not just in order to meet our obligations, but to try also to get people active and encouraged in the language, including myself obviously.</p></speech>

I am disappointed to hear about the woman with the medical card, in particular, because we have in our Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, centre in Finglas in north Dublin dedicated people who support the processing of medical cards in Irish so I am quite happy to take that case up separately for the Cathaoirleach.  We have some dedicated focus there to support those applications as Gaeilge.</p> <p>  Specifically on what we are going to do and as I mentioned in my opening statement, from our perspective we are working closely with the Department.  First, we will appoint someone at a senior level to support the services in respect of raising our game and our communications in respect of the Irish language.  We also want to strengthen the interface with an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in getting good advice from that office about who how we can improve this.  We want to put in supports for both the community and acute services as they communicate outwards and do so directly themselves in many communications.  We plan to put certain training in place at all stages to promote the Irish language where people will be encouraged to take up Irish-language courses.</p> <p>  The provision of the Irish language on our website and in all of our communications is something that we are going to strengthen further.  As I said my opening statement, we now have 108 pages but we want to ensure that we have an equivalence also.  </p> <p>  Those are some of the actions, Cathaoirleach, that we are setting out to do and if it is okay I will ask my colleague, Mark Brennock, to add to this on some of the actions that we plan to take, unless the Department wishes to contribute separately before him.</p></speech>

The services that the Department provides are modest in the context of the services that the HSE provides to citizens.  As I set out in my opening statement, we are making efforts now to improve our compliance and our obligations, as mentioned by the Cathaoirleach, under the new Act.  We have increased awareness among staff and provide workshops for colleagues so that they are aware of their obligations.  We are providing more supports to colleagues who want to improve their language skills, to learn the language and to become more proficient.  We have also increased the number of fluent speakers in the Department who are able to converse and correspond in Irish.  We have a very clear commitment now that people who want to correspond or speak to colleagues in Irish, that that is available to them.  From all of the feedback that I am hearing, that is going reasonably well.  Obviously, the scale of the challenges that we face as a Department are easier to manage than those which Mr. Reid would face in providing the whole variety of health services through Irish.  It is easier in the Department and we are making strides, as are other Government Departments.  As I hear from other colleagues, Departments are embracing this legislation and their obligations and are doing their best.</p> <p>  It is very much through that culture that people will be aware and be encouraged to engage in Irish, to improve their skills and to feel that they are being supported by the Department in doing that.</p></speech>

I will mention a number of points on changes that we have made and on things that we are proposing to do.  This is not to try to say that we are doing a terrific job but it is in line with what the chief executive has said, which is that we are committed to fulfilling our obligations and to serving Irish-speaking communities considerably better than we have done in the past.</p><p>The last time we met, in November, a number of members expressed disappointment and concern at the fact the SwiftQueue system for booking Covid-19 vaccinations was available in English only.  Since 1 February, it has been available in Irish and in English.  We are currently putting in place fairly extensive infrastructure to allow our website to be bilingual.  We are focusing in the first instance on providing the information on Covid-19 and the vaccine on <i>hse.ie</i>in Irish.  That work is under way and will be complete by May 2022.<br/><br/>We will then progress to broader translation of our public website.  There are many tens of thousands of pages on our website, so we are not aiming to have the full website translated into Irish, but we are putting in place a project towards broader translation of the website.<br/><br/>More broadly, as the chief executive has said, the Department of the Gaeltacht has written to us.  We are going to engage with it on the new legislation and attend the workshops and seminars it is going to hold about implementing the language standards to make sure we do it well over a period of time not just to remain in line with legislation, although of course we will be in line with legislation, but to serve the patients and service users who speak Irish both in Irish-speaking communities and elsewhere.</p></speech>

We were very concerned about the Roma communities.  At the Deputy will know, they are very hidden.  They are in many parts of Ireland.  Many of them are in rural communities.  With the best will in the world, we are still concerned about the low levels of vaccine uptake in the Roma community.  It was one of the first of the migrant communities about which we were deeply concerned because of the high rates of death and admission to intensive care in the community, including among pregnant members.  There is a high rate of chronic disease in that population and members are at high risk of complications arising from Covid.  We found that in the first, second, third and fourth waves.  That was one of the first languages we worked on and our concern for this community was one of our drivers or motivating factors in doing this because members of this community are generally not literate.  Some are but quite a number are not literate in their own language, Romanian.  We therefore felt it was better to have somebody speaking.  That goes for some of the other communities that have come into Ireland from the refugee population as well.  Many people in our refugee communities do not write in, for example, Arabic.  That was very big driver of our first round of videos.</p></speech>

This is a rapidly evolving situation.  The HSE website is the first port of call.  The address is <i>www.hse.ie/ukraine</i>.  On that page, there are multiple resources in Ukrainian and Russian.  We are also reaching out to the Ukrainian medical community and the Ukrainian community in general.  Mr. Reid is overseeing a large HSE response.  We have multiple work streams.  Within social inclusion, we have social inclusion managers and workers at local level reaching out to those in the communities and in accommodation provided by the international protection accommodation services of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The challenge is that there are more than 120 new accommodation facilities for Ukrainians.  They are in many rural parts of the country, including in some hotels that have never had experience of being a direct provision facility.  We are working hard with our partners in Government and in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Mr. Reid is probably also working with local authorities and the Civil Defence.  There are multiple ways to engage, including through NGOs.  At primary care level, there is a significant initiative in place to support GPs.  The HSE has rapidly developed an interpretation and translation service that will also be available on the ground.</p></speech>

That includes all of the services Dr. Fitzgerald has outlined.  We have appointed a national public health lead to interface with all of the services because there are obviously certain public health needs, which we have already identified.  I do not want to be seen to be profiling but one of the immediate public health needs we have seen is the low uptake of immunisation and vaccination among people from many eastern European countries.  I refer not only to Covid vaccination, but also to other immunisation programmes.  That is one but there are other areas we have already identified.  The route to market or how to address these issues is through the group of senior officials from across Departments, which also meets weekly.  We take general direction from that group but, ultimately, our interface is through our services in the community and reaching populations, particularly the Ukrainian populations that have been placed in quite rural locations in these early stages.  There is great demand on our services right now.</p></speech>
