I remind members of the notice on privilege.  They should not comment on or criticise anyone by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  We are now dealing with the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill 2022.  Does the Minister of State wish to make an opening statement?</p></speech>

Neither the Opposition nor the Government has tabled amendments on Committee Stage.  There was good discussion about and general agreement on the essence of the legislation on Second Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022033000002#A01000"><p>My note states that the commitment to the new arrangement is &euro;2.4 billion.  It is based on the exchange rate between the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and us.  It operates drawing rights, which are known as a currency.  There can be slight variations, so it is estimated at &euro;2.4 billion.  That is the maximum that we can lend to the IMF.  There are three other sections dealing with grant contributions and not loans.  They are poverty reduction and growth trust, the catastrophe containment and relief trust, and other prescribed trusts.  There is a &euro;50 million limit for each of those grant schemes, but there is provision in the legislation for the possibility of other prescribed trusts in due course, if the need arises, with maximum grant commitments under this legislation of up to &euro;325 million, compared with &euro;2.4 billion of loan agreements with the IMF.</p></speech>

I know the number has changed due to conversion rates.  How does that sit with section 4, on the individual call?  Are we guaranteeing up to that amount?  Are they just sums that would be called on under section 4?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-30a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022033000002#A01200"><p>If the IMF makes individual calls, they might be for a fraction of that &euro;2.4 billion.  Each time we respond to that call, there will be a Government guarantee relating to the specific call.  The ultimate umbrella is &euro;2.4 billion, all of which will be covered by a Government guarantee if sufficient calls are made over an extended period requesting the &euro;2.4 billion.  It is envisaged that there might be calls for smaller amounts, perhaps eventually up to that cap.</p></speech>

What measures would have to be taken by the Minister to take action on such a call or provide a guarantee?  Is it a resolution of the House?</p></speech>

He has the authority in the legislation to do this on the basis of the letter.  A sample of the letter can be made available.  It is a guarantee covering all the risks.</p></speech>

This amendment would facilitate payments from the Central Fund to the Central Bank of Ireland for IMF transactions.  He may table, but the wording is not yet complete.  It is a routine administrative matter regarding payments from the Central Fund to the Central Bank.</p></speech>

The Minister is indicating that he may need an amendment to facilitate the payments from the Central Fund to the Central Bank.  That is if there are interim payments to be made.</p></speech>
