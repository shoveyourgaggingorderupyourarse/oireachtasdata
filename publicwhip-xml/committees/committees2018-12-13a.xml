He is joined by Mr. Ciaran Wright, senior auditor.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Pat Deering.</p> <p>  Last week we did not approve the minutes of the meeting of 8 November as there was one slight change to be made to the wording.  Are the minutes of that meeting agreed to?  Agreed.</p><p>Are the minutes of 29 November and 6 December agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising out of the minutes.  There is not anything specific because the correspondence will cover most items.</p><p> The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1788 A and 1791 A, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 6 December 2018 and 11 December, respectively, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today's meeting on the provision of school transport.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next item, No. 1790 A, is an opening statement from Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We will note and publish it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication.  We held over three items from last week's meeting for further review.  The first item was from Ms Mary Lawlor, public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee on Project Nantes with a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser.  We requested a note from the parliamentary legal adviser on section 172.  We will deal with that, not today but as soon as possible.  We will consider that letter from NAMA as part of the briefing we will get from the parliamentary legal adviser.  We note and publish this.</p><p> The next item is No. 1767 B from the clerk to the committee of the Committee on Procedure, dated 30 November 2018, forwarding a complaint on matters raised by the committee in advance of the recent presidential election.  The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election campaign.  We agreed to note and publish a redacted form of the correspondence last week so as not to identify the person involved.</p><p> However, I propose that the committee draft a letter to the Committee on Procedure and a similar one to the individual who raised the matter stating that the committee's consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts 2016, Vote 1 - President's Establishment, was within the remit of the committee and that the committee's work highlighted important issues regarding transparency in the funding of the Office of the President.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

We need to consider how we knit that into our work programme at the appropriate time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#B00300"><p>What I am suggesting to the committee is that the Vote for the President's Establishment is done as part of the group of Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach at the Estimates committee.  We will take it as part of the day we have the Department of the Taoiseach here dealing with its Votes.  There is a number of Votes associated with the Department of the Taoiseach, such as the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Central Statistics Office.  There is quite a bit in the group of Votes under the Department of the Taoiseach and this is an associated Vote that is always taken as part of that group in the Estimates debate.  We will group it as part of the meeting we will have with the Department of the Taoiseach because that Department discusses it at Estimates time.  I propose in the work programme to take that group early in the new year.</p></speech>

I will make two points.  Was an audit committee established within &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in as part of the changes that were made?</p></speech>

Has the audit committee met yet?  It had not met when the Accounting Officer was before the committee.</p></speech>

That Accounting Officer is who we had previously before the committee on this topic and he is who we will have present when we deal with the Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach, and we will include that as a specific item.</p> <p>  It is important, however, to clarify what the Deputy has said.  That allowance is paid directly from the Central Fund and does not go through voted expenditure at all, and that was one of the issues.  The Central Fund is managed by the Department of Finance.  We will specifically have to deal with that amount with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance when the Secretary General is before the committee.  What is known as the Central Fund, the finance accounts of the State, does not go through the Oireachtas for a vote.  The main other such items that are not voted through the Oireachtas, including that allowance that we spoke about, include interest on the national debt, contributions to the EU, payments for judges.</p></speech>

Was that not the issue?</p></speech>

Everything the Deputy is saying will be dealt with.</p></speech>

Rather than us pre-empting our discussion in the spring, I am merely saying it must involve the two Secretaries General to deal with the full aspect of expenditure in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, those of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#B02300"><p>That goes as far back as the 1990s.  When the Accounting Officers appear before us, it would be useful for them to give some understanding of why it was decided to do it that way.  Just as that is an anomaly, there may well be other anomalies.  It would be interesting to see how such anomalies originate.</p></speech>

We will get a briefing on the background.  I guess it was done in order that there would not be a controversial debate on the floor of the D&aacute;il about such expenditure in an Estimates process.  What was valid in 1938 may not be valid in 2018.  That is a matter we will discuss when we come to it.</p> <p>  We will look at that Finance account specifically.  It is always a concern to me that large items are paid through this account and never discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  People will have heard me say this previously.  We will pay special attention to that account this year.</p></speech>

The committee may need to plan a little around how best to interrogate the total expenditure for the service.</p></speech>

We held this over from the last day.  There is useful information in this correspondence that will feed into our periodic report.  We asked for a breakdown of various aspects of the claims.  The agency does not want to identify hospitals and talks about groups of hospitals.  We do not want to go there at this point in time - we can consider the matter next year.  However, there are two items.  It gives a breakdown on the number of claims for maternity services and the total number of claims.  One issue I had asked was, how much, out of what it pays every year, goes to the wards of court.  It has given the figures: in 2015, 2016, 2017 and up to 31 October this year, it was &euro;101 million, &euro;81 million, &euro;126 million and &euro;87 million, respectively.</p><p>The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has done a report on wards of court which the D&aacute;il will debate in the new year.  However, this is very interesting information that we have never seen before.  It seems to be the practice that in serious cases it is agreed in the court that the person be made a ward of court.  It looks as though a very high percentage of the payments made by the State Claims Agency are actually paid to the wards of court fund.  This prompts another question as the wards of court fund is outside the reach of public scrutiny whereas when it is in the State Claims Agency it is within public scrutiny.  I suggest we ask for one further piece of information in relation to that table 3, namely the total other payments for compensation so we can see the percentage of total payments to wards of court.  I asked a question merely on guesswork but I am stunned at the amount of money that is going directly to wards of court.  It illustrates the scale of the issue.</p></speech>

The whole issue of open disclosure is an area that we will have to examine thoroughly.  I understand the State Claims Agency has a function in supervising or assisting or advising some parts of the public service in mitigating against claims arising in the future.</p></speech>

Entities such as the Air Corps would fall into our examination when the State Claims Agency is again before the committee.  It would have done some supervision and there are issues which certainly require scrutiny.  There is also the matter of open disclosure in non-clinical claims.  We need to look at a range of things including CervicalCheck, the wards of court and the difference in the types of hospitals where claims arise.  The other component is also important.  If we are to prevent future claims we must look at how they do their work on risk assessment.  If that fails, we will end up with claims that we should not have.</p></speech>

We have had some engagement with the State Claims Agency but we can see there is work to be done on the costs of the claims, prevention and minimising, what has been done and the lessons learned.  That has not been done before in the Oireachtas.  I am not saying that we will do a special report, although we might, but we will examine it in 2019.</p></speech>

Where something happens in a hospital, and inevitably things do, there is an internal and external review.  Claims often arise from these incidents but there is no record of those reviews.  I raised this at the last meeting.  For instance, in response to a question about external reviews - I did not ask about internal reviews - the Saolta Group in Galway has stated it has no record of external reviews carried out in the last ten years or the cost.  That is the official answer.</p></speech>

I am struggling to know where to go with the answer.  It was a simple question and the response was clear that it had no record.  The question related to the number of external reviews and the cost.</p></speech>

What a risk management capacity should do is identify those types of issues, the learning points and ensure that there is follow up and that any continuing exposure is dealt with.  There should be some kind of oversight in an organisation of where things might have gone wrong, have lessons been learned and if changes have been implemented.  That might be the area on which to focus when addressing Saolta, and to ask if Saolta does not have the information, what is its risk management function doing if it is not doing that.</p></speech>

Sometimes the State Claims Agency reports to the hospital.  The reports the Deputy mentioned are commissioned centrally sometimes and they do not go to the hospital.  There is a gap.</p></speech>

That information should be readily available and passed on in terms of openness and accountability, and the information should be fed into the State Claims Agency, which ought to be aware of this.

We told them it cost &euro;399,000 and they wrote back saying it was &euro;399,000.  We formally asked for that breakdown some weeks ago and will ensure that we get it in due course.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence, No. 1754, is one held over from last week when we discussed it briefly.  It is from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing and Local Government.  This was the instance where, as I mentioned, the credit policy of the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme was heavily redacted.  It was so voluminous that we had said that we would hold it over for consideration but I wish formally to note and publish the document rather than leave it hanging until the new year.  We had a preliminary discussion last week but this is just to sign-off on it formally.</p></speech>

There are a number of employees or former employees of UL who have been in correspondence with the committee on this topic and therefore I think it is appropriate to ask the president to confirm that those to whom the correspondence refers have been sent a copy of this correspondence and, if not, to do so.

The next item is No. 1775 B from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, President of the University of Limerick, UL, dated 4 December 2018, providing additional information requested by the committee in relation to the steps taken by the University of Limerick to engage with three specific members or former members of staff.  It is a three page letter with one thing I want to confirm.  In the second last paragraph of the letter on page 7, it is stated that persons B and C remain employees of UL.  It continues by stating that UL continues to engage with persons B and C so as to ensure they can return to the workplace as soon as possible.  I raised this the last day and I think we might have written back.  If we have not, I want to know where in the workplace is being referred to.  Is it a situation where the people involved are being offered some other job in some other section and not the job they were in before this incident?  We need clarification.  On reading that letter first, it might be thought that those people are back.  If we delve deeper, they may not be back in their own job.  I want that clarified.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. 1776 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 4 December 2018, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the transfer of the property on Grace Park Road from religious congregations to the HSE under the residential institutions redress schemes.  We will note and publish this.  We will keep a hold of it.  It is still between the solicitors.  We will not sign off on that religious congregation handing over the sites yet.  This is an update on the letters that are toing and froing but without conclusion.  We will continue to monitor that.</p><p> Correspondence No. 1778 B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 3 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee.  I refer to the instruction given to education and training boards, ETBs, in respect of the publication of minutes of ETB meetings, including the date of commencement and a schedule for each of the 16 ETBs for the publication of their minutes.  I am pleased today that all ETBs are now publishing minutes of their meetings online.  We will note and publish this.  Helping to get that carried out is something we have achieved.</p></speech>

It is welcome that have got this information but I fast forwarded to further slide requests on page 6.  I read that.  There is going to be a case next week, on 20 December I think it is, with an application to the High Court to have the records of the slides of some of these women released.  Why is that happening?</p></speech>

I have been talking to some of the people involved.  Some of the applications, included in these 18, go back to April.  A fresh application, however, came in.  It is not acknowledged anywhere that the original application for these slides goes back to last April and May, in some situations.  It gives the impression that it is a shorter duration by virtue of the fact that there was a second application.</p> <p>  The key issue here is the format in which slides or photographs are produced.  I refer to them being usable in the event of a court case.  There was to have been a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  That was cancelled at very short notice, something like 12 hours notice, to the great disappointment of the 221 Plus group.  This is one of the issues that would have featured at that meeting.  Much of information here is accurate but there is one item of information that certainly takes a liberty - and a significant liberty. </p> <p>  The failure to begin with was that people were not given information about their own health.  That has now been repeated because some people, albeit a small number, have to go to court to determine whether these records can be released.  I do not think we were given any kind of indication that there was a dispute when the HSE was before this committee.  For me, that is misleading this committee.</p></speech>

I have also been speaking to some of the ladies directly involved.  For public information, I want to touch on a few points in the letter.  It is an extensive letter with very detailed information.  We welcome the information provided.  It is the first time anybody will have seen this level of information on this matter.  I do want to make some points for people watching.  The letter states that in respect of the cytology slides it is a condition of the laboratory that it holds the document for up to ten years once testing has been completed.</p> <p>  The letter from the HSE continues on page 2 with the kernel of the issue Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned.  The HSE has put what it calls a protocol in place because it states that these slides are a critical piece of primary physical evidence that will be relied on by patients to advance their claims and by the laboratories and the HSE in defending any such claims.  An exact protocol was put in place by the HSE as to how the slides are to be released.  I will come back to that because it is relevant.  The HSE states that it wants to maintain the chain of custody and to ensure that the slides are issued through laboratory to laboratory transfers.  Even though the HSE, and the national screening service, is the legal custodian of these slides, they are normally held in laboratories.</p> <p>  It goes on to state that a digital image is taken to record the condition of the slide prior to its dispatch so as to ensure that if a slide is lost or damaged in transit, a secondary record of the contents of that slide will be available.  Typically, the taking of such images requires the input of a specialist cytologist or screener.  That is some of the reason for the delay.  I am just putting that on the record.  I am not agreeing or disagreeing.  It is being stated by the HSE that some of the issues patients have might result from a single patient slide being in one or two, or more, laboratories and more than one laboratory, therefore, might have to be contacted for some individual patients.</p> <p>  The letter goes on to state that early on, before the HSE established its protocol, some people, because it is their medical information, were contacting the laboratories directly.  The HSE was losing a chain of custody, as it calls it, of evidence that might be very relevant.  It put this protocol in place and that has ensured that the HSE now has a centralised approach.  I ask the Deputies to pick up on what I am saying when I am finished.  The HSE has stated that the updated position, as of Friday, 28 November, was that slides have been released under the protocol to 30 patients represented by 16 different firms of solicitors.  The number of patients who received slides following direct contact with the laboratories, before the protocol was put in place, was 18.</p> <p>  On the next page, the HSE gives the release time for 49 slides.  That is not 49 people because some people might have slides in more than one laboratory.  It is clear that 25% of them were well over the eight week period.  I cannot find this in the letter but the HSE has stated that, in its protocol, when arrangements are being put in place to meet a request for slides to be transferred from laboratory to laboratory, it must also be to an identified person with relevant experience taking overall responsibility for maintaining the physical environment in which the slides are stored and examined.  I think we have to agree with that.</p></speech>

The court case concerns the fact that some people want their slides released but not in accordance with the HSE protocol.  I think the essence of the case is not that people cannot get their slides.  The HSE states that slides should be issued according to this protocol.  People are saying they want their slides but not through the protocol.  Deputy Catherine Murphy may correct me if I am wrong.  I think this is why the HSE, from a centralised base, wants to maintain the chain of custody.  It states that if slides are being transferred from laboratory to laboratory and from named physician to named physician, it wants this done in accordance with the protocol and it probably wants to maintain the integrity of that protocol rather than this happening outside of it.  I am almost finished now, and Deputy Murphy may pick me up on anything she wants to pick me up on, but this is such an important issue that it is important to put this information out there.  Then it states, "[A] firm has indicated that it wishes to have the High Court rule on the arrangements that should be applied to the release of slides where no legal proceedings are in being."  They might not be in being now but they might be at a later date.  The correspondence continues, "For completeness, it should be noted that...on 8 November last, the HSE had not received the information necessary to release slides relating to the 51 patients in question (i.e. the 18 patients who have issued proceedings and the 33 other patients who have not)."  What had happened in these cases is that the HSE had identified the laboratory in Northern Ireland; however, it had not given the name of the responsible person in the laboratory.  The HSE stated that it considers it likely that many of the requests that were referred to at our recent meeting are possibly part of that 51 in respect of which slides have not been released because the HSE has not been given the name of the person who was going to take custody for it in the laboratory in Northern Ireland.  The correspondence gives the turnaround times relating to the slides in the table on the following page.  If it looks as if I am defending the HSE, all I have been doing is summarising its position in its letter.  The essence of the matter seems to be that there are a number of cases held up in which the person in the laboratory has not been identified and the HSE states it will not give a slide to a laboratory unless it knows who the responsible person is.  Then there are other people who do not want to go through the HSE protocol.  This seems to be the essence of the court case.  I call Deputy Murphy.  That is just my reading of the HSE's letter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.76" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#E00300"><p>I agree with a lot of the Chairman's summary.  Certainly, no one, not least the women involved, would want the original slides to be exposed to any kind of damage.  That would not be in anyone's interest.  Quite rightly, there is a protocol.  My understanding is that the protocol was deemed not sufficient by one solicitor who had experience of contesting a case in the courts and that this same solicitor, who has a number of clients, went back and suggested some amendments to the protocol within a week - this was in September - and has not been engaged with since.  It is important to say that.  Essentially, the HSE is stating, "It is our protocol.  It cannot be amended."  My understanding is that the difficulty is that the resolution of the photograph of the slide that the HSE proposes would be not sufficient to show up the abnormalities.  What use is that?  This is the kernel of the problem.  Going back to our relying on information when a public body comes before the committee, we were told there was a 22-day turnaround.  It was as if we were inventing a problem.  This problem has been acknowledged in this letter and it will be further acknowledged next week.  I hope the matter does not have to go to court.  There would be absolutely zero point in going to court if there were a satisfactory outcome to the matter.  It strikes me that there was zero discussion of there being a problem here when we had representatives of the HSE before the committee.  I really take exception to that.  We must be able to believe what people tell us when they come before us.  The word "candour" has been used here on numerous occasions.  We would not have had to keep going back looking for information if it had all been outlined in the first instance.  There continues to be a problem, however, and I think the public would be surprised at this, given that the failure, or part of the failure, in the first place was not providing the information that was needed.  It must be given in a format that is usable as well.</p></speech>

It does put its hands up and does not disguise this.  In its own way it is important we release this letter today because many people are looking for it and there is significant information in it.  Our discussion teasing out the issues here is probably helpful to the process.  I ask the HSE please to listen to what is being said here this morning because we were told these matters should not have to go to court.  If there are issues with the details of a protocol, I ask the HSE to try to sort them out without going to the High Court if at all possible.  I think we would be unanimous on this if it could be done.  I thank Deputy Murphy for raising the matter.  Without her pursuing it the last day, we would not have this correspondence today.  It is very useful for many people involved, especially the women directly affected.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is 1780 B from the HSE, providing information on the Deloitte report into governance arrangements in respect of section 38 and section 39 organisations.  It is expected that we will be given a copy of this report in January.</p><p>The next item is 1782 B from Mr. Pat Smyth, interim CEO of Tusla, dated 4 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on procedures to secure service level agreements and the memorandum of understanding on information-sharing with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will note and publish this.  The important aspects of this letter are the following.  Regarding the memorandum of understanding on the sharing of information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla makes quite an issue of the data-sharing agreement and the legal services involved from both organisations.  I think they are getting advice on this.  Tusla states:</p><blockquote>Once approved and signed off, Tusla and [An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na] will agree an implementation strategy.  The time frame for implementation has been set as Q1 2019.</blockquote> <p>That is useful.  The other item Tusla gives is a full list of all the organisations with which it has commissioned a service level agreement.  I think every one of these organisations bar one has signed a service level agreement, and that one exception is in the process of being - to use Tusla's words - &quot;decommissioned&quot; from dealing with Tusla.  This is again progress on following up on these service level agreements.  We started with the HSE, we found a weakness in Tusla, we referred to it in our periodic reports and Tusla seems to be 100% on top of the job.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is 1784 B from Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, dated 5 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on the review of the pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes.  It includes a note on the progress of the Deloitte prospectus review and a note on the nursing homes steering committee.  We will note and publish this.  People may be interested in it.  It is a follow-on from the information we requested.  There are copies of minutes of meetings and of records of information.  That is useful.</p><p>The next item is 1785 B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing an information note on testing the constitutionality of excise law in a tax appeal case.  This was mentioned at our meeting.  He says it is not a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission to make any determination but, rather, it is a matter for the courts to decide constitutionality.  He provides information on high-income individuals' restriction and a summary of section 485F, carry forward of excess relief for the years 2007 to 2016.  This is as a result of a question I asked and it is good to get this in the public domain.  The correspondence concerns one of the reasons some high-wealth individuals pay quite reduced amounts in tax.  We understood that if they had losses, and if they had claimed this allowance and carried forward losses in a given year rather than using them all, they could carry them forward again.</p><p>Some people will be interested in that.  We asked for details of the fines imposed by courts in respect of tobacco.  We found them farcical.  For the millions of euro involved the fines issued were farcical, and the situation has become more farcical now.  Three cases went to court.  One person was fined &euro;12,000 and two individuals each received a fine of &euro;5,000.  One individual received a fine of &euro;5,000.  Any defendant who received a sentence had it fully suspended.  There is zero deterrent to smuggling in Ireland as far as I can see.  We talk about it every year.  The revenue or some other body should be given the authority to impose very serious fines.  All that happens is that smugglers lose one particular shipment.  They carry on the next week with the next lorry-load.  That is something we will have to come down on firmly in our periodic report.  It is no wonder it is happening on this scale because there is zero enforcement and zero penalties relative to the scale of activity. </p><p> The next item is No. 1,786, from Ray Mitchell of the HSE-----</p></speech>

We are keeping that man busy this week.  The item is a note on the record retention policy in place, in particular procurement documents, and changes that will be made to this.  There is also a note providing a list of supports available to those affected  by the H1N1 vaccine, that is, the flu vaccine.  This arose from matters concerning the procurement of goods and services and retention of records.  We found that some of the documentation concerning CervicalCheck was not kept on file.  That is where that query arose.  </p> <p>  The next  item of correspondence is No. 1,787 from Mr. Nick Ashmore, chief executive officer of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, dated 5 December 2018.  It provides a response requested by the committee regarding the value for money query.  I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who raised the matter.  I find this response completely unsatisfactory.  From recollection I think we asked some questions.  A major fund is available to the SBCI.  It does not lend directly.  It provides funding to on-lenders, meaning banks or other institutions.  I want to know the breakdown of how much is provided through banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders.  I find it extraordinary that on writing to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland we got back a three-page letter on money matters without a euro symbol in it.  There is a lot of lovely talk about policies and principles.  It could have been taken from the opening statement describing what the SBCI does in its annual report.  It gives us none of the information we are really looking for; how much the SBCI has loaned, how much the banks have loaned on, how much the non-banks have loaned on-----</p></speech>

We acknowledge it, but we want a proper reply the next time.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1,789 from Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 6 December, providing information requested at our meeting last week.  These queries concerned contracts awarded without a competitive process.  There are very useful details here.

That does not necessarily mean that there were no other possibilities.  It is not an excuse for not having a tendering process.</p> <p>  The same applies to the contract to support the development of the national mitigation plan, NMP.  The Department says the process was shelved because the supplier is considered unique because of the research it offered.  Who considered the contractor unique?  Again, I do not accept that as a reason not to have a tendering process.  The same occurred with a NMP climate modelling contract worth more than &euro;600,000.  Again, there were no competitive bids.  The Department's reason is that the contractor has a specialist team.</p> <p>  There is a wider implication here.  Even if it was the case that these were unique specialist services, why is in-house expertise not being built up at the Department?  It was the same with the national broadband plan.  We have ended up with only one bidder because it seems that the only contractor left is the one that can do the job.  We all know why that happened; because of privatisation.  However I do not accept that for these contracts.  An awful lot of contracts are being awarded without any competitive tension at all.  We are given the excuse that the Department believes that the supplier is the only organisation or private company that can do the job.  That does not cut it.  I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined the correspondence. </p></speech>

We challenge these outcomes when we become aware of them.  We ask the Department to demonstrate to us that this is the only supplier who can do this.  It is a little clearer when a public body is locked into an ICT system and there is only one supplier of licences or requisites for it.  We then check that the procurement testing for that has been carried out, even on a ten-year cycle, and that there is proper full-life recognition of the costs associated with the contract.  A public body cannot just pick a supplier and decide that the State is tied to that supplier.</p></speech>

Following up on what Deputy Cullinane was saying, I am struck by No. 4.  The upgrade of the Department's financial management system was worth &euro;74,000.</p><p>It says the vendor is the sole supplier within Ireland of the software used by the Department of Finance.  How did the Department pick a financial management system with only one supplier of that service in Ireland?  It is nonsense to think there is not a myriad of companies that could provide a financial management system to the Department.  We will write to it asking it to give us an information note regarding each of the items mentioned by the Deputy where there was either a sole supplier or these people had unique expertise.  We want a note on each of them as to how the Department arrived at that conclusion.  </p></speech>

I know we have a very busy work schedule and a lot of work to do but the broader issue concerns procurement.  This is another example of where there are problems.  This time, it is citing a lack of expertise in the marketplace and saying that in its judgment, only specialised companies can do this work.  In other areas, we have seen examples involving leaving it too late before rolling over contracts or putting them out for tender.  We know there are ongoing problems in the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We have done it but it is bit sketchy.  We are coming at it in bits and pieces here and there so I ask that we join it all up and at some point, produce a report on procurement because the problem is that there are no sanctions.</p></speech>

We then give the Accounting Officer a slap on the wrist, there is no punishment or sanction and it continues.  I know there have been some improvements in the HSE because of our work.  Notwithstanding that, it still comes up over and over again for many different reasons.  I know we will get to our work programme.  Can we look at the issue?</p></speech>

I have raised the matter with regard to computer expertise.  What is happening is that there is less and less competition.  That is the problem.  There is less and less competition under the guise of more competition and we are struggling piecemeal with it so I would certainly welcome an opportunity to come back and deal with it in a more comprehensive manner.  We are just beginning to identify the problems.  It is a bit like spin-off companies where we barely touch on the matter.</p></speech>

For example, &euro;100,000 was paid for the provision of legal advice regarding the Corrib gas field project.  The reasons given for not having a competitive process include the contractor having specialist knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this complex project.  We would certainly hope that whoever was getting the contract had specialist knowledge and an understanding of the project or it should not have got th.e contract but to suggest that there was nobody else in the country who could have done it does not stand up from our perspective.  We will come back to that</p> <p>  We now turn to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 1774 C from Senator Gerard Craughwell, dated 3 December 2018, is correspondence requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the expenditure by the Department of Defence defending High Court actions on its failure to implement the working time directive for the Defence Forces.  We will request a note from the Department regarding the matters raised.  </p></speech>

The Defence Forces are not subject to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  Similar Acts are in place in other countries to which the relevant defence forces are subject so we are unique in this respect.  Because there is no possibility for class action in this State, individual cases are being taken by the trade union.  It seems the WRC is siding with the workers in each and every case.  Rather than, again, dragging more and more workers through the WRC with a cost to the State, it would make more sense to deal with the substantive issue.  It seems that from the WRC perspective, the EU has a competency in this area that supersedes national law.  This is one of the reasons the WRC is making the judgments it is making.  Senator Craughwell mentions the European directive in his correspondence.  We need to go back to the Department with that substantial point, which is that if it is losing all these individual cases and is faced with more, why does it not deal with the substantial problem here?</p></speech>

The individual does refer to Dr Fitzgerald's item of correspondence, which we discussed earlier.  The individual wishes to know if he is referred to in Dr Fitzgerald's correspondence.

Let us test some of those minutes and see how we get on with them.  We can certainly come back and ask for further information.</p> <p>  That is the end of correspondence and we now move on to statements on accountancy since the last meeting.  There are four on the screen.  There is the carbon fund clear audit opinion, the University College Dublin clear audit opinion and the usual issue about the deferred pensions in the education sector and payments totalling &euro;5.4 million to 75 suppliers for goods and services where procurement procedures did not comply with Government procurement guidelines.  We will group them all together.  Next is the Limerick and Clare ETB, clear audit opinion with the same issue of a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules.  There is also Laois and Offaly ETB, clear audit opinion and attention is drawn to the disclosure statement on internal control that Laois and Offaly ETB would welcome an increase in internal audit resources.  We covered that last week.</p> <p>  Here we go again.  UCD and Limerick and Clare ETB are not in compliance with public procurement guidelines.  Is there any information on the statement of internal control in the accounts?</p></speech>

For anyone who wants a breakdown or background on that, it is in the published financial statements laid before the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The next item is work programme and we want to talk about the meetings early next year.  We are not proceeding with the meeting with the Irish Prison Service next week.  Is that agreed?  I think everyone is agreed to that.  Time is very tight and we will come back to that.  Thursday, 17 January, we are having the first meeting back with the Department of Justice and Equality about the Irish Prison Service and Vote 21.  Hopefully that is agreed.</p> <p>  The following Tuesday is a separate and private meeting with the whistelblowers and complainants in relation to the University of Limerick.  We will pencil that in now, but when we go into private session for another item, we might have a brief discussion on the structure of that meeting.  We will do that in private session in a moment, but we will publicly set that date for it now.</p> <p>  On Thursday, 24 January, we will deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the Waterford Institute of Technology and his special report on the remuneration of certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology, Sligo.  Those organisations, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills will attend on 24 January.  All of these have to be confirmed.</p> <p>  On 31 January, we are back to our housing meeting.  We will have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and specifically the Irish Council for Social Housing.  We will deal with the Vote for housing and planning.  We will try to conclude our meetings about housing at that meeting.</p> <p>  On 2 February, we have the Vote from the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on chapter 1 deals with the financial outturn for 2017.  Chapter 2 deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer.  Chapter 3 deals with the control of funding for voted public services.  Chapter 22 relates to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  We will have to make arrangements as to whether it will take a separate slot at the meeting or be a part of the bigger meeting because I think the council is meant to be independent.  We will work out the format of that.</p></speech>

As I understood it, after our last meeting when Deputy O'Connell was here, we would ask the HSE.  The Brothers of Charity Services in Ireland would not have to come, but we would ask their representatives and go through this.  The issue was that they seemed to be applying rules and people were being charged, some of whom were reimbursed, others of whom were reimbursed from a certain date but not the whole time period.  The person who contacted me took issue with the information that Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE provided to this committee.  I have unilaterally written my own rebuttal to Mr. Mitchell, putting a series of questions.  I sent it off lately, so I have no response.  It would be good to have the HSE and the Brothers of Charity before the committee but Deputy O'Connell said at the meeting, and others agreed, that such a hearing could be broadened to include other indirect charges being applied to long-term residents in nursing homes.</p></speech>

We will discuss it in that context when we have the HSE in but in the meantime, I have given a commitment that I would meet the people who wrote those directly in the new year in any event.  We will circulate the time of that meeting.  It will not be a Committee of Public Accounts meeting; we will meet in a meeting room and any member who wants to come to that meeting is welcome.</p></speech>

The second HSE issue which is not in the work programme that I am raising for the first time is HSE outsourcing, not under sections 38 and 39, but in respect of adult services for people with disabilities, how that is handled, how it is supervised and the amount that is provided.  That is something that at some point in the first half of next year it would be well worth specifically looking at.</p></speech>

It is being paid for but the service is not being used in such circumstances.  The level of supervision of that leads to the inadequacy of the services.</p></speech>

It became clear when we were looking at the CervicalCheck issue that proceedings had to be issued in court before the agency even knew about it.  It did not seem that there was a mechanism to do open disclosure in a way that was non-legalistic.  That has to be part of what we do when we examine the agency because we will have to keep going back on individual streams of work that relate to different issues such as CervicalCheck or thalidomide unless we get to that.</p></speech>

Regarding the summit on the catastrophic infants' cases, the agency in its correspondence states, "The Agency only ever becomes involved when the letter of claim is received."  By that time, the solicitor has done all the research and all the work and then submits his or her claim.  The agency further states, "This has the inevitable consequence that the Agency has to "play catch-up" as it can only commence its liability and causation investigations when it receives a letter of claim."  By definition, then, the system is geared such that there will be a significant time lag.  This is another example of it.  The agency will be before the committee again as part of our work programme but we will write to it in the meantime if there is a gap in its responses to the issues we raised with it the last day.</p> <p>  We will now go into private session.</p></speech>

The examination was carried out to ascertain whether the Department of Education and Skills can demonstrate that it is achieving value for money through its arrangements with Bus &Eacute;ireann to deliver the school transport service and whether there is adequate oversight of the service by the Department.  The special report was based on financial and service data relating to 2015.  The briefing material provided by the Department includes data for later periods and there have been some significant subsequent developments which the Accounting Officer will explain.  However, as the key findings of the report are likely to still apply, I will present them as reported.</p> <p>  Primary school children are eligible to avail of school transport services if they live not less than 3.2 km from their nearest suitable school.  The eligibility minimum distance for post-primary pupils is 4.8 km.  Pupils who do not qualify under the eligibility rules may use the school transport service if there is spare capacity on a bus route.  Such users are known as concessionary ticket holders.  Eligible children who hold a medical card and special needs pupils are exempt from charges for availing of the service.</p> <p>  The cost to the Department of school transport services in 2015 was &euro;173 million, or close to &euro;1 million per school day.  The bulk of the cost is accounted for by payments to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which received &euro;149 million in 2015, or 86% of the amount spent by the Department.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also collected a little less than &euro;14 million in fees from fare-paying pupils.  The balance of the expenditure by the Department is accounted for by various grants, including for special needs escorts and transport grants.  The average annual cost of transporting eligible pupils was approximately &euro;1,800 per head in 2015.  Fees recouped from fare-paying pupils amounted to a little more than 8% of the costs.  </p> <p>  Although there has been a steady increase in the total number of enrolments in primary and post-primary schools over the past decade, the number of pupils who are eligible for and avail of the school transport service has fallen significantly.</p><p>In 2007, the number of eligible pupils who availed of the scheme was 127,000 or 16% of enrolled pupils.  By 2015, this had dropped to 89,000 or 10% of enrolled pupils.</p><p> The school transport bus fleet is made up of a mix of large, medium and small buses.  Taxis are also used to transport some pupils with special needs.  Much of the service is subcontracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to private bus and taxi operators.  Payments to subcontractors accounted for 71% of the cost of the service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2015.  Based on assumed average carrying capacities for vehicle types, we estimated the bus fleet as a whole had a potential carrying capacity of 163,000 pupils in 2015.  Relative to the number of eligible pupils, the estimated level of spare carrying capacity in the fleet was 48%.  Some of this spare capacity is taken up by concessionary ticket holders but the estimated residual spare capacity in 2015 was still significant, at about 35%.  There was also evidence that some ticket holders do not use the transport available on a daily basis resulting in further underutilisation.  At the same time, there is local demand in certain areas for concessionary access to school transport services that cannot be accommodated.</p><p> The examination also looked at the oversight arrangements in place between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We found that in 2015 the Department was still relying on arrangements that had been in place for over 40 years contained in a 1975 document entitled, Summary of Accounting Arrangements.  I concluded that the accounting arrangements provided for in the 1975 agreement are inadequate given the level of costs involved.  Reporting requirements are weak and there is an absence of key performance indicators or other metrics that would allow the Department to assess service performance and the achievement of value for money.  I recognise there have been some developments since the report was completed on a service level agreement.</p><p> The accounting arrangements provide for the Department to pay an annual lump sum transport management charge to cover Bus &Eacute;ireann's indirect and unspecified other direct costs.  The charge is provided for in the agreement at 13% of direct costs.  By agreement between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department, the management charge was capped at &euro;16.7 million in 2011, at &euro;15 million a year between 2012 and 2014 and at &euro;11.3 million for 2015.  Information provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the Department and the costs to be met from the management charge indicate that, notwithstanding the cap, the amount paid was in excess of costs in each of the four years to 2014, resulting in an accumulated surplus being held by Bus &Eacute;ireann estimated by the Department at &euro;11.2 million at the end of 2015.  The report includes a number of recommendations for improvement in the oversight and accounting arrangements.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief members on implementation progress in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#N00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  I will not read my full opening statement given the tightness of time.  I will focus on our response to the recommendations.</p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s general agreement with the recommendations is recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, progress has been made on implementing the recommendations since that time.</p> <p>  On forecasting, while the school transport scheme continues to be a demand-led scheme, in planning for projected demand the Department liaises closely with the National Council for Special Education in regard to projected enrolment trends at primary and post-primary.  The Department is undertaking a route audit with independent professional advice to ensure that route design is optimised from a value for money point of view, taking into account the location of eligible children.  In the process of preparing for that review, the Department worked with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the digitisation of its route maps.</p> <p>  The Department has strengthened the governance framework around school transport and continues to do so.  We have worked with Bus &Eacute;ireann to put in place a number of additional elements of our governance framework, which builds on the 1975 arrangement that underpins our relationship with Bus &Eacute;ireann on school transport provision.  A service level agreement has been put in place between the two organisations.  This sets out the reporting arrangements in place between the two organisations, the roles and responsibilities of both organisations, the agreed outputs to be delivered by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the key performance indicators for the operation of the scheme.  The agreement is under review and it is intended that an updated service level agreement will be put in place in 2019, with a view to further strengthening the governance framework around school transport.</p> <p>  Also in the context of reporting and performance monitoring, certain overhead costs and other indirect costs attributable by Bus &Eacute;ireann to the school transport scheme are known collectively as the transport management charge.  The Department commissioned an independent expert to carry out a review of the apportionment methodology for it.  The report was completed in March 2018.  The report provides a detailed analysis and classification of the costs incorporated into the charge.  Based on the recommendations of the report, the Department has developed a reporting framework and we are working with Bus &Eacute;ireann with a view to completing these reports initially on a biannual basis with a view to moving to quarterly reports.  In addition, the Department has been taking steps to reduce the accumulated surplus arising from the charge.  The surplus of &euro;11.2 million recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General' report will be eliminated by the end of the current year.</p> <p>  In regard to the final recommendation, all operational meetings between the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are minuted and agreed by all attendees as a standing agenda item.  While it did not generate recommendations, it is noted that a central part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was an examination of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s procurement processes.  The report records that Bus &Eacute;ireann was compliant with public procurement guidelines.</p> <p>  I will mention two other areas of note in the school transport scheme.  The first concerns concessionary transport.  The purpose of the school transport scheme, having regard to resources, is to support the transport of children who live in remote areas.  We have heard about the distance criteria.  Families of eligible children living in areas where it is uneconomic to provide a transport service are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements if a service is not available.  A number of non-eligible children are also transported in those circumstances, where bus places are available, after all eligible children are catered for.  The transport is provided in the interest of maximising the utilisation of the existing fleet and in providing a service to families where the capacity exists to do so.  Since the number of spare places is dependent on the number of eligible children requiring transport, there can be no guarantee from year to year of a place for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p> <p>  On the special education needs scheme, the purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  In general, such children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their needs.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs.  The Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for these children.  This is reflected in the standard of service provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis.  Eligible children are exempt from school transport charges.</p> <p>  At a cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017, school transport constitutes a significant expenditure of taxpayer money.  The scheme is under financial pressure from increasing demographics at primary and post-primary level but, more significantly, from the increase in the numbers of children with special educational needs being transported.  While cognisant of the costs associated with the scheme, and having taken on board the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Department is continuing to strengthen the process to ensure value for money in the delivery of the school transport scheme, while also ensuring that all eligible children are accommodated with school transport services.  </p> <p>  I am very happy to provide any further information sought and respond to questions from the committee.  As the Chairman noted, we are joined by representatives of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Kent" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#N00300"><p>I am joined by Ms Miriam Flynn, who is our chief schools officer, and Mr. Tom Delaney, our chief financial officer.  They have joined me as part of a new senior management team at Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We are very pleased to be here to answer any questions and assist the examination of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p> <p>  We have been operating the school transport scheme successfully for over 50 years.  We do not exercise discretion on the policy and all applications are simply dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines.  It is important to note at the outset that the delivery of our operation on the ground is highly complex and the scheme is administered by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a cost recovery basis only.</p> <p>  The scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the number of services provided under the scheme has increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to more than 4,500 now.</p><p>More than 460 new school transport services were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann in 2017.  This year alone, another 300 new services are expected to be introduced by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  The vast majority of these will cater for children with special educational needs.  All newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender by Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p><p> With regard to the management of the overall network, 95% of Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet operates two double trips daily, with the bus used for different school runs both morning and evening, comprising two return trips.  More than 60% of contractors also operate double trips.  It is important to note that 83% of the costs of the scheme comprise payments to contractors.  Due to the nature of special educational needs routes, where the individual needs of a child are taken into account, many of these services are operated in single vehicles on a door-to-door basis.</p><p> On procurement, more than 90% of routes are subcontracted to private operators and 20% of these routes are tendered on an annual basis by Bus &Eacute;ireann in compliance with EU guidelines on procurement.  We welcome the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which demonstrates that Bus &Eacute;ireann is fully compliant with public procurement standards.  This is testament to our stringent and equitable standards, which we apply to all our procedures and practices.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted opportunities for improved governance and I will touch on those.  There has been the introduction of a service level agreement, there are monthly operations meetings to review periodic financial and statistical reports and there are quarterly meetings with the chief executive and senior officials from the Department.  I can provide some context in the information we cover in this regard.  We provide a formal budget and projected costs for the financial year, which are agreed at the start of every year, and these consider both internal and external cost drivers, emerging trends, the anticipated level of demand and policy developments which may have a bearing on each of the cost headings each year.  We prepare a schedule of monthly payments based on the number of school days each month, the mode of transport and the eligible children travelling.  This is furnished to the Department at the beginning of each year, and it is designed to provide an estimate of the annual projected cost.  These figures are reviewed at monthly meetings and amended as required.  Sometimes there must be change, such as when there is a status red weather warning and costs have to be reviewed.</p><p> Individual statutory accounts are not produced for school transport as it is not structured as a separate company within Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, all finances pertaining to school transport are audited and a separate statement of account for the school transport scheme is prepared as part of the company&rsquo;s annual independent audit.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to providing the highest levels of transparency to the Department across all cost allocations.  We have engaged specifically with the Department on allocations related to the indirect costs of staff, property and information technology, which account for nearly 85% of these indirect charges.  Most recently, we are in joint agreement that all these costs are demonstrably related to school transport.  A biannual review is in place to ensure that the basis for cost allocation is robust and transparent.  Bus &Eacute;ireann accounts are fully audited by Deloitte.  An additional audit of all school transport activity is undertaken to comply with the summary of accounting arrangement in line with the 1975 agreement.  This year and taking into account the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Bus &Eacute;ireann is in discussions with our auditors regarding a separate audit under general accepted accounting principles for the school transport part of our business.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s 2017 accounts noted that a &euro;6.7 million ring-fenced surplus was held within its reserves on behalf of the Department to be used solely for future expenditure on school transport-related activities.  In recent years, this has included spend on the creation of a new online ticketing system, an improved telephony and call management system and new school buses, all of which were authorised by the Department.  Currently there is no surplus in reserve and our 2018 financial statements will support this position.</p><p> On the subject of the special needs scheme, it has evolved in recent years with a significant growth in the provision of transport for special educational needs children.  This year, we received in excess of 3,000 new individual special educational needs applications or requests for amendments to services and this contributes to the growing cost of providing services.  It is also worth noting that while the volume of work has increased because it is complex to deliver, there has not been a corresponding increase in the costs of administration associated with this.</p><p> We welcome the expansion of the scheme in recent years and we are conscious that we must also continue to strategically refine our own resources, processes, procedures and technology supports to ensure we meet its growing needs.  We will do all that in close liaison with the Department of Education and Skills.  We are committed to full transparency and to continuing this close co-operation as the scheme evolves.  We fully enforce the rules of the scheme, comply with the performance requirements of the service level agreement and every day we try to deliver high standards of safety, consistency and reliability for all students who avail of the school transport scheme.  We do this on behalf of the State.  We have been operating the school transport scheme for over 50 years and we look forward to continuing to providing this vital service into the future.</p></speech>

The roll-out of the bus system for schools was a good idea and I availed of it when I attended secondary school in 1968, which is a good few years ago now.  While it was a great scheme when it was rolled out, there is always a "but".  I am a rural Deputy representing County Kilkenny and every year, from July onwards, school transport, in particular concessionary tickets, causes me a major headache.  I will focus on that issue today.  As I mentioned, the service is good for most but it is not good for those who are left behind.  That is the problem.  I hear daily about problems and even last week a constituent with four children contacted me here in Leinster House about a problem.</p> <p>  Most parents work nowadays and it is not like it was years ago, when one parent stayed at home while the other was the breadwinner.  It has changed and both parents must work, so getting children to and from school is the issue.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party did some research for the 2016 general election and we updated the results this year.  It found that 350 pupils with concessionary tickets did not access the school transport service this year and that &euro;4 million would be sufficient to cover the costs involved.  I accept that is a simplified version and rolling out services to this group would be a different job for Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It is small money in the overall purse of taxpayers' money.  The Department and the Minister should address the issue.  I repeatedly bring it to his attention.</p> <p>  There was a recession and we changed the rules in 2009 or 2010.  Now that the recession is over, we should review the scheme and look after the 350 children who have been left behind this year, if my figure is correct.  We should try to include them in the school transport scheme.  Will the witnesses comment on that first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018121300002#O00400"><p>The concessionary element is a key part of this, as we organise the scheme on the basis of eligible pupils first and then concessionary pupils.  All pupils are supposed to have applied for transport by the end of April and all payments are supposed to be made towards the end of July.  The first problem is that people do not necessarily all apply and pay fees on time.  That is a challenge when it comes to organising routes.  Getting past that, Bus &Eacute;ireann, on behalf of the Department, must organise the routes, starting on the basis of the people who applied and implementing them on the basis of those who have paid.  Once all the eligible people who have paid have filled the seats, the remaining seats are available for concessionary tickets.  A large number of children are travelling under the school transport scheme using concessionary tickets.  In the 2017-18 school year, they numbered just over 27,000.</p> <p>  This year, there were approximately 3,000 applicants who applied for concessionary transport who did not receive it.  Of those, just 1,129 applied on time but did not secure a seat, while 1,888 applied late and did not receive a seat.</p><p>The figure is just around about 3,000.  We are speculating on a scheme here.  It is a matter for a Government to make policy but I do not mind taking this a little distance.  If were to have a scheme where concessionary transport was available to everyone then, we would have a different number of applicants.  Those applicants are on the basis of the scheme we have at the moment, not on the basis of a putative scheme that may provide transport for all concessionary users.  </p><p> We were very conscious of this being an issue.  Obviously on the establishment of the current Government, we had a review and published the outcomes.  We are continuing further work on the nature of "concessionary" and whether there is a way we can seek to meet some of the need that has been identified, such as for a large group of concessionary users - not individuals - who seek to go a certain distance and who may already be eligible for school transport.  We are exploring options in that regard and, yes, they would cost money.  They probably would cost more than the figure to which the Deputy has referred because obviously one must organise transport.  We are looking at that.  One of the tensions we have in the scheme is that we have a scheme where costs are going up, especially on the special education side.  We also have a tension, and it is an appropriate tension, to provide a social service to people who want to have it.  That is a tension always.  We want to make sure that we strike the right balance and that balance is obviously in the rules of the scheme and so on.  Yes, we recognise it is a difficult issue.  I am not sure it is as small as the Deputy set out and I am not sure it is even as small as I have set out.  If we had in place an open choice to be transported to anywhere up to a certain distance limit, that could actually cost a huge amount of money.  Obviously there may be room to develop the scheme slightly.  We are looking at whether that is a possibility and that would obviously cost money if we were to do that.</p></speech>

I have experienced this myself as I must drive through these areas.  A 40-seater bus serves a small place called Paulstown and brings children to Kilkenny but seven children have been left off.  I believe that it would not cost an awful lot of money to provide a 50-seater bus.</p> <p>  I disagree with the changes that have been made to the qualifying criteria for concessionary transport.  I know that the Department is not to blame for the changes because we, as politicians, are responsible for the changes.  I come from a little place called Ballyhale which is in the southern part of County Kilkenny.  In 1967, the three primary schools in the locality were amalgamated into one school.  For 40 years there were no problems and everything worked beautifully but all of a sudden these changes were made.  My grandchildren attend the school.  Unfortunately, after a service being continuously provided for 40 years in the parish, due to the changes that were made here, parents of the children have been told that they should send their children to a different parish because that school is nearer.  That is crazy stuff as everyone will agree who knows the loyalty that people have to their parishes, particularly in rural areas.  While I am not talking about all rural areas, people tend to be very loyal to their parishes.  There is religious loyalty because one receives the holy sacraments of baptism, first communion and confirmation in one's parish church.  All of that has gone on for generations and the same applies to hurling, football, soccer of whatever sport one plays.  Unfortunately, at the stroke of a pen we, as politicians, changed the criteria in 2010 or whenever.  Therefore, after three generations have availed of school transport, parents have been told they must send their children to their nearest schools.  I measured the distance that obliged one family in the parish, with three children, to travel.  It was 0.25 km and the family was told the children had to attend a school located outside of the parish.  We all know that one's loyalty is to one's parish.  The family was told this because of the new criteria and, unfortunately, siblings will be separated as a result.  The older siblings can attend one school but the next lot must attend school in another parish, which is nearer in terms of kilometres but not in any other way.  That is a crazy situation so we must review the matter.  I do not blame the Department for this situation.  It is us, the politicians, who must review the scheme.  I ask the Minister and my own party to review the matter and I hope it will be reviewed shortly.  I ask the Secretary General to comment.  </p></speech>

It can be done but it is a policy change that costs money, and it would have to be applied across the country and in all areas.  We have to have a consistent national policy.  Yes, that could be done.  Yes, it could cost a lot of money because Bus &Eacute;ireann run buses of different sizes at different times.  Yes, it can be done but, yes, it could cost a lot of money.</p> <p>  In relation to the amalgamations, the policy view was taken arising from the value for money, VFM, review.  There is a very good example in the VFM of a few Catholic schools that happen to be in the same Catholic parish, where parents were living closer to one school but only could get school transport to the school further away.  To be honest, we cannot set a scheme in stone in relation to amalgamations which were made 50 years ago.  </p></speech>

Parents can choose to send their children to other schools, if they wish.  I know there are challenges on parents to get students to different schools in respect of transport and so on.  This is not requiring them to attend school.  Parents can choose which school to attend, obviously subject to there being places in schools.  This is about the availability of school transport to support that.  I draw that distinction because I think it is an important distinction. </p> <p>  If we introduced and kept the level of choice to allow people to go to somebody under the former closed or close school rule, as well as the closest school, which was the policy dilemma, we would then have a myriad of choice, and a myriad of choice in transport costs a huge amount of money.  It is a reasonable policy to say that the State will support a child to go to his or her nearest primary school.  If a parent wishes to choose for a child to go to a different primary school, that is a reasonable choice for a parent to make but it is a choice that parents can make and arrange themselves. </p></speech>

I am not talking about parents who want to pick specialist schools for their children and want the State to pay for it.  I am talking about parents sending their children to one primary school in a parish.  The parents have no choice because there is only one primary school in the parish.  After 40 years, the grandparents, parents and grandchildren, have all of a sudden been told that the option is closed.  These people have a right to get the same service that they were promised in 1968 and enjoyed for 40 years.  Unfortunately, politicians have changed the situation with the stroke of a pen.  If people went to court and outlined that they always had access to the school then I think the Government would be bound by it.</p></speech>

The Secretary General has stated that school transport cost &euro;190 million in 2017.  Was that value for money?</p> <p>  I want to discuss the surplus.  The Secretary General has said that there will be no surplus in 2019.  There was one in 2015, according to the report compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To me, the term "surplus" sounds like a profit was made.  It is a crying shame to have a surplus and a profit when a couple of hundred children have been omitted from the scheme.  It is a pity that money could not be used to bring the children to school rather than have a surplus and profit.  Does a surplus mean there was a profit?       </p></speech>

Everything is assigned.  There was a reserve held, which was held by Bus &Eacute;ireann and referred to in their accounts in latter years, which was assignable, on agreement by us, to certain costs.  We made the call this year that we would not let the company retain that any more.  That is no longer being retained and will not be retained by the end of 2018.  There was no profit in the scheme.  It is a scheme on the basis of cost recovery, in terms of expenditure.</p></speech>

It is being said that its coffers are a lot richer because of the roll-out of the bus scheme.</p><p> I want to go a step further.  It is a monopoly when there is only one service provider.  Would we get better value for money if we opened it up to private contractors?  Bus &Eacute;ireann is subcontracting them for the routes.  The routes are given out, many of which I know, around Kilkenny and Carlow and everywhere else.  Would the Department not get better value if it went directly to the subcontractors, put the routes out to tender and saw who came in with the best price?  Would that not save us money at a cost of &euro;190 million?  When one has a monopoly and no-one to compete against, it does not sound like good business.  The service level agreement that is being talked about was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report up to 2015.  I question it as well.  If we even got a sample of putting it out to public auction to see who would come in at the best prices, we might get a better and cheaper service.  I ask the Secretary General to comment.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann has a transport infrastructure management expertise, which is why we work with it to do this.  Within that, nearly 83% of what it does is on the basis of procuring out.  Some 83% of the money we give it is procured out.  Bus &Eacute;ireann does that efficiently and it follows public procurement in doing that.</p></speech>

There is no alternative national organiser that we see.  The bulk of what Bus &Eacute;ireann does is to outsource procurement, which is done to Government procurement standards.  There is no question about the procurement by Bus &Eacute;ireann of the services.  I think it is very really helpful that the value for money question was confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We get updates and sign-offs on reports from Bus &Eacute;ireann to confirm that this is the case.  We are looking at other ways that we can confirm that this is the case.  I am not saying that we just take it on its word forever but we have to look at it.</p> <p>  I do not see an alternative national organiser to step in and organise all of those services and to procure and to work it out.  We are, however, undertaking the audit of routes and when we look at that, which I referred to in my opening statement, we can then see if that informs any other policy choices.  Of course, there are policy choices.  At the moment our very strong policy option is to work with Bus &Eacute;ireann as the route provider providing that it is outsourcing the vast majority of the service, as it does.  The private sector is hugely involved in school transport.</p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann are running the system for the Department.  Could the Department of Education and Skills not run the system directly and put it out to tender without Bus &Eacute;ireann?  It is a second layer of bureaucracy that could be avoided with better value for money.  I am just a lay person asking these questions.  I am a businessman and farmer as well, and when I am trying to get a price, I put it out to two or three people to see which is the best price.

There is a transport expertise that is unique to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  There is route design, ticketing, and a whole range of things with which we, as a Department, do not want to be involved.  We have set up agencies to provide State examinations and to do the work of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  We set up one on education welfare that is now within Tusla under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I do not believe the Department itself should be undertaking that work.  Given the extent to which Bus &Eacute;ireann outsources in the first place, it is the company's transport management expertise that is vital and very important to us.</p> <p>  On value for money, we have to ensure that we understand all of the costs and that we are on top of all of the costs, and its accountants are signing off on these, and we are checking as appropriate.  That is part of the service level agreement that we have discussed, along with a number of other matters.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about value for money and whether we are making a profit.  First, 90% of the routes that we operate are put out to tender and procured in complete compliance with EU guidelines.  Anybody who gets to operate them will have won them on a competitive basis.  Second, 83% of all of the costs associated with the delivery of this scheme at the moment go back to the contractors.  They come through the Department, they pass through us and they go out there.  This company has been through a radical transformation, as the Deputy may be aware, even in the past couple of years, and it continues to take on board a lot of the findings that we have.  We have a transport management charge that tries to recover the indirect costs.  It has fallen almost every year.  It has fallen from &euro;11.2 million and is part of the transformation that we tried to do again last year.  It will be of the order this year of &euro;10.5 million of costs.  That goes to cover all of the indirect costs that surround and go into the business.  We try to deliver and utilise it to get as many double trips into the business as we can into every single route.  That is an important point.</p></speech>

From our experience, it is still better value and cheaper to the State to do that rather than contracting two separate vehicles and different contractors to do it.  There is value delivered on that.  We continue to try to utilise the capacity.  Even though, as the Deputy states, there is concessionary use there, we try to ensure that where we take it in, that there is a contribution coming back into the value of the route.  Those students are having to pay in to utilise it and that contributes to the value of it.  What we are doing is that we never stop.  We have a new management team here with a school transport officer just in place and what we are undertaking is a full structural review within our business as to who is delivering it.</p> <p>  We have delivered a lot of the services directly ourselves with our own Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet and drivers, supported by a lot of clerical administrative staff.  We are now looking at the full needs of the scheme in conjunction with the Department.  In particular, as we have recognised that as special education needs have grown, some of the assistance we must do in that regard has to grow.  One does not see that cost coming up.  If anything, one can see that everything we are charging through what is called the school transport management charge, which is almost a misnomer because it is a recovery of all the indirect costs of providing the service, is coming down year on year since 2008.  To the Deputy's point, I can categorically state that we operate this on a cost-recovery basis.  There is no profit in this for us at present.  That is another matter for us, but that is within the scheme.  Where there has been a surplus from one year to the next, it is identified, completely ring-fenced and brought to the Department-----</p></speech>

The surplus that is handed back should be utilised to look after parents who are in need of transport.  In 2015, the level of spare capacity was 18%.  Almost 20% of capacity was available in 2015.  What was the situation in 2017?  What is the situation in 2018?  Given that we have the situation that we have, it is extraordinary that 20% of capacity is not being utilised.  The 2015 figure I mentioned came from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

Mr. Kent and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; have touched on this.  We try to ensure we get the maximum utilisation out of all vehicles.  Approximately 95% of Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles operate more than one trip, morning and evening.  The same can be said of more than 60% of contractors.  Even though there may be spare capacity on one of the trips, the Department is still getting a more cost-effective network and better value for money.  I assure the committee that where capacity exists on a particular route, it is fully utilised to meet the demand that exists for concessionary transport on that route.  If there is demand for concessionary transport, any spare places are allocated on that basis.  This year, we probably have the highest number of concessionary pupils travelling.  The total number is approximately 28,400.  We aim to try to utilise capacity as best we can.  We also have to look at capacity in the context of the value for money it provides and the utilisation we get out of the individual vehicles.  I would like to touch on one other point, which is that there will always be an element of spare capacity.  If 35 eligible children present for travel, one has to procure a 50-seater vehicle.  There will always be cases in which a certain element of spare capacity exists anyway.  The key priority for us is to look at this issue in the context of the amount of utilisation we can get out of the vehicle and the cost that the State would incur if a separate vehicle had to be procured.  The two issues of utilisation and cost-efficiency are looked at in tandem.</p></speech>

The hoarding of seats is a big issue in rural Ireland, where I come from.  I am talking about seats in respect of which tickets have been allocated.  I have received answers on this from Bus &Eacute;ireann on several occasions.  Seats are being allocated but are not being used; they are being hoarded.  The survey to which I refer was conducted for a month earlier this year on the bus that brings children from Paulstown to Kilkenny.  It was found that on every day of the survey, 11 seats were available on the bus - going in and coming home - and seven children were left on the side of the road.  The parents did this survey themselves.  The 11 seats that were not being used were being hoarded, perhaps by parents who were bringing their children to school on their way to work.  Perhaps they keep these seats for rainy days on which they cannot bring their children to school.  Something should be done about such terrible practices.  Seven children are being passed and left on the side of the road, even though there are 11 empty seats on the bus from Paulstown to Kilkenny.  I am just giving an example.  I do not mean to mention my own area all the time.  It is a crying disgrace to see 11 seats being left empty as the bus goes in and out, while seven children are left on the side of the road.  This survey was carried out over the course of a month.  It found that on average, ten or 11 seats were empty every single day.  Bus &Eacute;ireann or the Department should wake up and do something about this.  If a seat is not used over a period of two or three weeks, it should be taken off the person who is not using it.  Some allowances can be made.  Parents are keeping these seats to use them on a rainy day when they are not going into Kilkenny for a work day or something like that.  I am not saying I know what the situation is.  It is a disgrace that 11 seats were continuously available for a month without being used, while seven children were left on the side of the road.  Something should be done about it.</p></speech>

The Department must have some documents, having considered the complex issues involved.  The Department might share with us the benefits of what it has looked at.

Well done.  I am aware that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I thank its representatives for their co-operation.  The officials from the Department are present to discuss their oversight of the scheme.  It is a great scheme.  I know there are operational difficulties on the ground, but I will leave them for the moment and look at what we are here for.

I realise that things have moved on since then.  I suggest we should look at the conclusions in the report.  Even though this is ostensibly a cost-based service, the report identifies serious flaws in the recovery of costs, particularly the management charge, which I will come to.  Oversight reporting requirements were weak, there was no service level agreement, and forecasting was poor.  The report makes three recommendations, within which there are a number of elements.  What do the officials from the Department have to say about the serious flaws in the recovery of costs?  I understand what Bus &Eacute;ireann has said.  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that the management charge was fixed at 13% of the direct costs, regardless.  It was capped at that level.  There was a surplus arising from that year after year.  The figure for "accumulated service" was &euro;11.2 million when the report was compiled, but it had decreased to &euro;6 million last year.  I might be wrong, but I think it was recommended that this should be eliminated on the basis that there was no adequate explanation from the Department of how it was fixed and so on.  Mr. McCarthy might correct me if I am wrong when I say the recommendation was to get rid of it.  I understand it is gone now.  Where has it gone to?  How did it happen?  If it was correctly done on a cost recovery basis, how was this charge allowed?  Where has it gone to?  I understand it has gone this year as a result of the special report.  Is that right?  It did not go on foot of any action from the Department.</p></speech>

Some members of the committee will recall a session we had about school transport four or five years ago.</p><p>Arising from that session, we indicated that we would welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General going into Bus &Eacute;ireann to determine whether that was desirable.  That was the genesis of the report.</p><p> We decided to have a very good look at value for money in school transport in the final part of the past decade.

We also focused on the fixed charge.  We carried out a detailed report on the fixed charge at that time as well.  We concluded that the best way to reduce the fixed charge was to cap it.  Previously we had a cheap seat for every child, which meant that we did not have spare capacity.  When we moved away from that, the extent of the charge meant that reserves were building up, from which Bus &Eacute;ireann was occasionally able to purchase buses with our agreement.  The company purchased computer equipment, dealt with other matters, improved their mapping of routes and so on.</p></speech>

I accept that it was probably used for the good of the service.  It is now gone.  It has been highlighted that this surplus was not reported in the Department's statements.  I refer to the paper record and the justification for it.</p></speech>

We looked at the value for money represented by having a seat for every child because the reserve was building up.  We agreed an allocation from it, and we worked on the basis of allowing Bus &Eacute;ireann to keep it from year to year.  We had discussions internally and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In parallel with the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we decided that we did not wish Bus &Eacute;ireann to retain it from year to year and that we would fund any costs on an agreed basis in a year.  That is the basis on which we are proceeding.  It was public knowledge.  We had talked about it openly at this committee.  We recorded it in our accounts in 2017.  It is in Bus &Eacute;ireann's accounts as well.</p></speech>

When we procure services, there are sometimes different vehicle types.  Whether it is a 44-seat or a 52-seat bus can sometimes depend on the locality being served.  Part and parcel of that is that where there has been demand, particularly for concessionary seats, we will try to make sure that every seat is occupied.  We also try to take into account the mixed nature of bus types we use.  There is a combination of singles, 14-seaters, mid-size vehicles and bigger buses.</p></speech>

The issue that continues to confront us is that the closing date for this is around 27 July.  We are also trying to get everything else in place for the beginning of the school year in September, five to six weeks later.  Until we know exactly where the demand will emerge every year, we almost have to evaluate it on a year-to-year basis.  To cater for that, particularly in the case of any mix or change in demand, we retender the contract.  As I said, 20% of all of the service is retendered to make sure we are getting efficiency and value.  Second, all of the routes continue to be reviewed.  At this point we have made it clear that if there is any audit requirement, or if any way can be found to improve efficiency and utilisation, we will work with anybody who wants to review that with us.  We will be completely open and co-operative on that.</p></speech>

We try to get the maximum utilisation out of a vehicle.  We may require a 50-seat vehicle to operate a post-primary trip with 44 children.  That bus can do a primary run which may have only 25 children on it.  We will try to utilise that vehicle because it is more cost-effective.</p><p>Unfortunately, it has an adverse effect on spare capacity numbers but it affords a greater level of efficiency and is far more cost-effective from a value-for-money and a departmental perspective.  When one looks at the figures in isolation, it is the multiple runs where the level of spare capacity is higher.  Where one vehicle is doing a single run, the levels of spare capacity are much lower.</p></speech>

There has to be some new and imaginative way of looking at this and I understand the Department is open to that.</p> <p>  On climate change, we want more people to travel by bus.  That is essential.  On the other hand, there are practicalities involved.  I refer to the situation in Galway, about which I want to make a general point.  Children go to school, and they have tickets.  If they go home at 4 p.m. or thereafter, they miss all of the after-school activities.  A letter was written to us in respect of this matter and we were asked if the children could use their tickets on regular buses.  In this case, it is Carraroe, ag gabh&aacute;il siar do dt&iacute; Ceantar na nOile&aacute;n.  Those children have a choice of missing after-school activities and going home on the school bus or, with the permission of Bus &Eacute;ireann, using their tickets on regular buses which are passing back towards Carraroe in any event.  However, they cannot do the latter.  Am I making my point clearly enough?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it would not only be our consent that would be required because one is talking about the scheduled services that are operated under the supervision of the National Transport Authority, which determines the fares and sets the fare strategy in respect of those services.  We collect the revenue in the context of how those fares are set.  In an ideal world, if we had integrated tickets, we all agree they might work on those services.  An integrated ticket would recognise revenue on a particular trip and then revenue on another trip.  Perhaps that is something we can aspire to but at the moment it is not possible.</p></speech>

We have major changes to make in the context of climate change.  We are talking here about one child but the circumstances involved are reflective of those of quite a number of people.  The person who wrote that letter stated that there are over 20 students involved.  Are we going to obliged 20 people to drive their children home in cars or jeeps simply because we are waiting for an ideal time when there will be integrated tickets in place?</p></speech>

Children may choose not to take the school bus; they may take a public bus and pay for it later.  The issue is that there is a public service.  Whether there is space on it, I do not know.  The issue is that whether the State should pay for the two seats.  The first seat on the school service and the second seat on the public bus, or is it possible to rotate seats so that, potentially, somebody else could use the school bus seat.  That is very difficult to manage on a day-to-day basis.</p></speech>

We have clerical staff in place in 16 locations in Ireland.  We operate 11 depots throughout Ireland.  We try to continually review the number in the fleet and how many people are in different places to determine if it is reasonable.

It is something we should look at because if one is dealing with one operator, there is only one set of management and vehicles to deal with and one maintenance and health and safety strategy and so on.  It is an alternative to tendering each time and going in to see if Marc MacSharry, the bus operator in Sligo, has everything he needs from a safety and organisational perspective.  While there would certainly be initial capital cost in making sure the fleet was appropriate to the demand, it would be worthy of examination.   Is it safe to say the scheme is designed totally based on demand?  We will see what is looked for next year and then we will put a series of tenders together that will deliver for those children.</p></speech>

We have a housing crisis.  It is replicated in urban centres around the country.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; will know from parliamentary questions and representations we make to him about the smaller schools that are under pressure, where every year there is a child whose brother has a place on the school bus who cannot get one because there is a new way of measuring the route to the school which means it is not the closest school or whatever.</p><p>Bearing in mind the difficulties we have in many urban centres and in Dublin, and while there are always pressures to build new schools - I am aware of two new schools in Harold's Cross - has there been any cross-departmental analysis of the introduction of a more proactive transport scheme to try to encourage the repopulation of rural schools?  Using transport as a tool might be of assistance in terms of housing and pressures in many of the urban centres.  For example, school X with its facilities and infrastructure in a rural area could be built up to a viable number of students, which, in turn, would take pressure off the urban difficulties we are having in abundance throughout the country.  Has any such analysis been conducted?  Is there an aversion to examining something like that?  I am guessing there has been no such analysis due to all of the other pressures on the Departments</p></speech>

A number of rural schools throughout the State are under pressure and from a political perspective any councillor, Deputy or Senator would be able to verify that this is the case.  We have pressures in respect of many other issues, not least school places, housing and so on.  Could using school transport in that way be worth looking at?

First, I can recall a case of a second level school in the west where the patron had decided to close the school.  The Department did an analysis, having regard to school transport costs.  Notwithstanding that the school had 250 pupils, we calculated that it was more cost efficient and of more benefit to the local community to leave a second level school in the town.  There was a Catholic patron at second level and it transferred the patronage to the local VEC, as it was at the time.  Work like that can be done.  At a very high level, we have Project Ireland 2040 and we have economic targets to develop populations in the regions in scale.  I am on the project 2040 delivery board and a lot of work is being done to bring together perspectives from the different Departments to enable economic growth, including houses and jobs.  Obviously, educational infrastructure will link to that in the regions.  At a high level, there is a serious policy to seek to have diversity of economic growth and capital investment from the State to support that.</p></speech>

I wonder about the wisdom of these policies where on the other side of the policy house we have serious difficulties - and will have into the future - because of urban pressures.</p> <p>  The issue of the closest school criteria has jarred with me, and I raise the particular query due to an education grant aid query I had.  With regard to the distance from one's house to the school or the university is Google Earth or Google Maps now the standard that the State or the Department embraces as the benchmark?</p></speech>

We deal with that through a range of agencies.  The services to the islands are probably more specialised and have a very particular community sense to them.  Therefore, it is the Department that leads around those areas that is responsible.  The decision has been that its understanding and expertise around community issues and decisions is probably the more significant issue that determines how it has been decided to make that allocation.</p></speech>

As a committee, we should ask the Department of the Taoiseach to move this to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because the Department of Rural Affairs and Community Development is not overrun with avionics engineers.

Indeed, he has enough to do already but I ask the question in the context of his office being able to provide this committee with the picture that it needs.  In the context of the commercial mandate of Bus &Eacute;ireann and so forth, is the Comptroller and Auditor General in a position to give us the picture that we want, given that one part of the equation is subject to audit but a very significant part of it is not?</p></speech>

There are certain aspects of it for which we never got an explanation, including, for instance, why a 13% add-on for management costs was ever appropriate.  Part of the recommendation there was that there needs to be a better understanding of what makes up that charge, why it should be what it is and so on.  Work has been done over the past number of years to try to get a better fix on the costs.  We noted that the assurance that was being given on the account that is produced under the 1975 agreement was an assurance that the account was produced in the manner required under that agreement.  It was not an assurance that this is an account of the cost of the service, which is what the Department is moving towards.</p></speech>

When making the comparison one should be comparing similar type maintenance, similar kilometres, etc.  In terms of the direct provision, as will have been noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it has always been at a slight premium in terms of what we pay relative to the market.

Where are the regional differences?  Do the witnesses have that information?  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we are trying to find out if we are getting value for money.  There are lots of activities in Irish life in respect of which we know the cost, including the cost of surfacing a kilometre of road in one county versus another county, which is subject to tender but there can be crazy variations.  Is Bus &Eacute;ireann experiencing similar variations?  Are there parts of the country where there is not a lot of competition and in which it suits operators not to have too much competition?</p><p>Other operators can enter the market.  Where is the most expensive and least efficient area?</p></speech>

In the past year, it has sometimes been difficult to procure vehicles and provide contractors in certain parts of the country.  That is part of the reason for the discussion on whether direct provision is needed.  Even though we might go to tender, post to tender and invite participants, if we do not get the response we need, we must figure out how to meet the needs of the scheme.</p></speech>

That comes to more than &euro;90 million for the 12,000 students, which is well over &euro;7,000.  All of those children with special needs must get to school, but where does the Department draw the line between offering the grant to the parents to provide their own transport and providing transport itself?  If it costs &euro;8,000 per year on average to operate this system, where does the Department decide the cut-off point is?  What grant does it award?  It is based on distance.  What are the minimum and maximum grants?</p></speech>

We have a process for allocating transport for children with special needs on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>The application will come to us, signed off by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  We will then contact Bus &Eacute;ireann to see if a route is currently available.  There could be a special needs school transport vehicle going by the house, in which case we will just put the child on it, possibly at no additional cost or a small additional cost.  If we calculate that the grant would be cheaper than amending a route then we will offer the parents a grant, but often they cannot take it because both are working, so it is not all about economics and it is addressed on each child case by case.</p></speech>

It has led to the situation where even when long distances are involved some parents feel the grant is not sufficient.  If it is in the region of &euro;3,000 but the Department is paying &euro;8,000 for somebody to go with a contractor on a bus, I can understand the reason some parents would be reluctant to take it up if it is in the region of &euro;3,000.

It is a fantastic service.  I am aware of it from a person in my family.  The Department is rolling out a great service.</p> <p>  We must have been hardier in my day because I used to be on a bus for an hour and a half to two and a half hours.  We were hardier in the 1970s than nowadays.  I did not know there were restrictions on time.  At the same time, we were damn glad to get the bus.</p> <p>  In a case where the bus is full and there are no tickets available if anyone is even an hour late in paying, he or she is finished for the year.  I was involved in several cases where families forgot to pay over a weekend, or in one case it was only an hour late, and they were excluded for the year because they did not pay on time.  There was no appeal system.  Those who were late were just ruled out for the whole year until the following year.  Most of them learned from that and they paid the following year.</p> <p>  Parents are frustrated by the notification system.  They might be told on a Friday evening that even though the school is open on Monday no bus would be available.  That is frustrating for parents and people in general.  Working parents must make alternative arrangements.  An early warning system should be in place to warn parents, for example, a month in advance, that children on concessionary tickets will not get a place on the bus.  Something must be done about that.</p> <p>  In effect, there is no appeals system.  I have been through it on several occasions.  An inspector comes out and makes a decision and that is the end of the story.  He might come out a second time if one contacts him.  The inspector covering my area is based in Waterford.  However, there is never a change.  Whatever decision is made is upheld and there is no come-back on it.  In one case there was a third of a kilometre involved between two schools in adjacent parishes.  I did the journey myself in the car based on where the children were let off the bus in the evening and the distances were equal.  Even though I went to the inspector there was no give whatsoever.  Three generations of a family had been to the school concerned.  The family was told to go into a new parish for the sake of a third of a kilometre even though where the children were being dropped off meant it was the same distance between both schools but no one would listen.  That was the end of the story.  The provision of a place on a school bus was ruled out.</p> <p>  Another case concerning health and safety has been going on for years.  The Garda was contacted by parents as the bus was turning at a dangerous junction.  We appealed it on several occasions.  The inspector came out two or three times and said the bus would continue to turn at that point.  I thought it was very cruel that they did not take the safety aspect of where they were turning into consideration.  People were trying to drop children off on a bad bend in the road, and they were waiting for them with no place to park but they got no hop on that one.  I do not think the appeals system is working.  A better system should be in place for parents and politicians.</p> <p>  I have called on the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to amend the rules governing the school transport scheme which state that, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis, to ensure who apply for a concessionary ticket can be accommodated.  I put the same question to the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  From an operational point of view, would Bus &Eacute;ireann be open to amending the rule and would there be a significant additional cost associated with amending the rule?</p></speech>

We have monthly meetings at which the risk register is considered.  We meet representatives of CI&Eacute; and the claims are presented to us and we interrogate them.  A management committee reviews every case to decide whether it is appropriate to fight the case or consider a settlement.  There is a significant amount of rigour by the CI&Eacute; investigations team and secondary investigation teams to ensure that nothing untoward is being done.</p></speech>

I do not suggest that Bus &Eacute;ireann would take a passive approach to contesting claims but if it is not picking up the tab, these things could happen subconsciously.  It would be a good exercise to compare these cases against others that are taken against the company in circumstances where it is footing the bill.  That might be an interesting analysis.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the number of vehicles has fallen from approximately 600 to approximately 400.

For several years there has been a policy of contracting out services where demand had diminished.  Typically, we directly employed part-time school bus drivers.  As each retired, a decision was made on whether to replace the driver or contract out the service.  In recent years, more services have been contracted out than new drivers hired.</p></speech>

The issue relates to the vehicles as well as the drivers.  As was explained, there has been a long-term issue as the traditional practice of cascading from road passenger vehicles into schools is probably no longer feasible.  We need to decide whether to replace vehicles and direct provision at current levels or at a level which will satisfy the market going forward.  That is a funding dialogue which we are entering with the Department.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is very welcome here today, along with his officials.  The format of the meeting is that the committee will hear the T&aacute;naiste's opening statement before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.</p><p>Before we begin, may I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in this committee room.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I also welcome members of the diplomatic corps who are with us for today's meeting.</p><p>I call on the T&aacute;naiste to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018121300002#D00500"><p>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to have a discussion with the committee members.  I look forward to their questions and comments.</p> <p>  My initial statement will be reasonably lengthy but it will give a good overview of some of the issues with which we have been dealing at the Foreign Affairs Council at the European level as I was asked to do.  Obviously, I am in the committee's hands, but I suspect there will be demands for quite a detailed discussion on Brexit, which I am happy to do.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members for the opportunity to address them this afternoon.  I am keen to provide an update on the developments at the EU Foreign Affairs Council which most recently met this Monday.  In addition, I know the committee is interested in developments related to Brexit, given fast-moving events this week, and I look forward to a discussion on this and other matters.  </p> <p>  My Department has provided a detailed information note to the committee on the wide range of issues the Foreign Affairs Council has considered in the past few months.  In the interests of maximising the time available for discussion, I propose to address the major themes of the Council discussions in my opening remarks.   </p> <p>  As ever, developments in the Middle East featured prominently in discussions at the Council.  I supported the addition of Jordan as a discussion item on the agenda in June.  This took place just after I visited Jordan myself.  My own view is that Jordan plays an essential role as a stabilising influence in a difficult region and I believed it was important for the EU to express, and show in a concrete way, our support.  Jordan has long hosted large refugee populations of Palestine refugees, refugees from Iraq after 2003, and now hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.  This places a huge strain on the Jordanian economy, and US cuts to funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, have made the situation even more difficult.  As Jordan is trying to introduce economic reforms, under pressure from the IMF, I feel it is important that the EU look at the trade access that Jordan has to the EU market and see how that could be improved.  I am also pleased that plans are proceeding for Ireland to establish a resident embassy in Jordan early next year.</p> <p>  The gravity of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen simply cannot be underestimated.  The UN has warned that the country is on the brink of a major catastrophe.  The need for a ceasefire is stark.  At the June Council, EU ministers were briefed via video conference by UN special envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths, on his framework for peace in Yemen.</p><p>We agreed conclusions that reiterated that there cannot be any military solution to the conflict and underlined our strong support for the UN special envoy and his efforts to bring about an inclusive political solution.  In November, EU ministers reaffirmed our strong support for efforts to bring the parties back to the negotiating table.  The situation in Yemen is incredibly shocking and distressing, and there has been little good news over the past four and a half years.  I was very glad to hear that peace talks restarted in Sweden last week following intensive UN efforts and a number of confidence-building measures.  Clearly the problems in Yemen are very complex but it is an important step that both sides have come to the table and I think everybody wishes those efforts well.</p><p> The Council has also considered the death of Jamal Khashoggi.  On behalf of the EU, the High Representative has called publicly for an independent and credible investigation which Ireland fully supports and insists on.  As I have said directly to the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Dublin, we must get the facts of the case and ensure that those responsible are held to account.  Ireland also specifically raised the Khashoggi case during Saudi Arabia's universal periodic review at the UN Human Rights Council in November.</p><p> The situation in Libya was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in July and October and conclusions were adopted this week reflecting the seriousness of the situation there and the importance it is accorded by the EU.  During these meetings, my counterparts and I reiterated our united support for a Libyan-found solution to the political crisis, under the auspices of the UN political process.  We also underlined the importance of elections in completing Libya's transition while recognising the need for the right conditions to be in place for free and fair elections, which is challenging.</p><p> Libya and Syria also featured in the October Council discussion on the external aspects of migration with the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, and the director general of the International Organization for Migration, Ant&oacute;nio Vitorino.  Ireland wants to find a consensus on migration based on a balance of responsibility and solidarity.  We support efforts to tackle root causes and are supportive of the UN global compact on migration which has unfortunately become controversial in some parts of the world, and in our view represents a balanced approach for co-operation between countries and regions with very different perspectives on and experiences of migration.</p><p> My colleagues and I discussed the situation in Iran in November and again at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday.  We discussed the implications of the re-imposition of US sanctions in November, and reconfirmed our support for the joint comprehensive plan of action, the nuclear agreement.  Our objectives are to support the continued implementation of this agreement which has been successful and continues to deliver, and to support EU business in continuing to trade with Iran to the benefit of both sides.  However, we also expressed our concerns about Iran's recent ballistic missile tests as well as the destabilising role which Iran plays in many countries across the region.  The EU believes that we must face these issues head on and deal with them.  However, we believe that keeping faith with the agreement we have already reached on nuclear issues is an important first step in bringing Iran back into the international fold as hopefully, eventually, a responsible and constructive partner.  These are challenging issues and I expect we will return to them many times but there is a high degree of unity among member states in what we are trying to do.</p><p> On Monday, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed preparations for the upcoming EU&ndash;African Union ministerial meeting in January.  This will be the first annual Joint Ministerial meeting since the AU-EU summit in Abidjan last November.  We agreed that the meeting agenda will be developed around three themes: peace, security and governance; investment, trade and skills; and multilateralism.  Ireland remains committed to supporting countries in Africa in meeting the challenges they face, both bilaterally and through our membership of the EU.  We must continue to strengthen co-operation between the African Union and the EU, including on trade and development.  The proposal for an Africa-Europe alliance for sustainable investment and jobs sets out a comprehensive economic agenda with job creation at its core.  The Foreign Affairs Council also discussed developments in Africa more generally, including in the Horn of Africa and Red Sea in June, and in the Central African Republic in October.  We will have an opportunity to attend an EU-Africa summit on Tuesday next week, in Vienna.</p><p> In November and December, the Council discussed Ukraine.  On Monday, Ministers expressed deep concern about tensions in the Sea of Azov.  The EU expects Russia to ensure unhindered and free passage through the Kerch Strait to and from the Sea of Azov in accordance with international law.  Ministers met with the Ukrainian foreign minister and reaffirmed the EU's unwavering support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.  In November, ministers condemned the so-called elections in the separatist Donbass region of Ukraine on 11 November as running contrary to the letter and spirit of the Minsk agreements.  Ministers also welcomed progress on reforms in Ukraine while noting that much more still needs to be done.</p><p> The Council discussed developments in the western Balkans, Eastern Partnership and Central Asia.  Ministerial meetings with the Eastern Partnership and Central Asian countries took place in October and November.  On Monday the Council had a wide-ranging discussion on the western Balkans, touching on progress in 2018 and expectations for 2019.</p><p> A very difficult situation is unfolding in Venezuela.  In October and again on Monday, ministers discussed the situation in Venezuela, which appears to be worsening.  There is an acute humanitarian crisis with the potential for regional instability due to the strain being put on neighbouring countries by mass migration.  Ministers agreed to explore the idea of establishing an international contact group to bring together the EU and other actors with influence on both sides in Venezuela to facilitate negotiation.  It is expected a decision on this will be made at the January Foreign Affairs Council.  Ministers also discussed the EU reaction to the upcoming inauguration of President Maduro on 10 January following elections that were neither free, fair, nor credible.</p><p> With regard to the EU global strategy implementation, the Council has been discussing how the EU can promote a rules-based international order with multilateralism as its key principle and the United Nations at its heart.  This is very much in line with Ireland's vision which I articulated at the UN General Assembly in September.  The EU global strategy commits the Union to promoting peace, prosperity, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  The Council continued to monitor progress on the implementation of the strategy.  This includes strengthening the EU's peacekeeping capacity in support of the United Nations.  We have also made progress on implementing a strategic approach to strengthening the resilience of states and societies in our neighbourhood and developing an integrated approach to conflicts and crises.  Unfortunately there are far too many in our neighbourhood.</p><p> The Council discussed security and defence issues in the context of the EU global strategy in November.  Ministers adopted a new civilian common security and defence policy, CSDP, a compact that will make civilian CSDP more capable, flexible and responsive, and will strengthen the EU's external engagement in the rule of law, policing and civil administration.  It will also enhance the capacity of the EU to respond to new and emerging challenges in our neighbourhood.  Ireland was a leading promoter of the compact. </p><p> Ireland supports ongoing cooperation between the EU and the UN on peacekeeping operations and crisis management.  We were pleased that the EU endorsed the updated shared priorities of the UN-EU Partnership on Peace Operations and Crisis Management in September.  The Council also welcomed an Irish paper, introduced by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, on how EU member states can better co-operate under the auspices of the EU in support of UN peacekeeping operations.</p><p> I do not propose to read out a dissertation on Brexit.</p><p>Essentially, our approach to Brexit is to prepare for all eventualities but to continue to try to influence what we can where we can to maximise the chances of the deal, which was negotiated over a nearly two-year period, holding and taking effect.  We now have a withdrawal agreement that is a compromise on both sides.  The EU and the UK have had to compromise.  The core Irish interests and vulnerabilities have been responded to in the withdrawal agreement in as effective a way as could have happened.  The Good Friday Agreement and the common travel area are protected.  The guarantees that were given politically this time last year have been followed through on and delivered in a legal text to ensure people do not have to worry about future border infrastructure re-emerging between our two jurisdictions.</p><p> Other issues in the withdrawal agreement are citizens' rights more generally.  The approximately 3.5 million EU citizens living in the UK and the approximately 1.5 million UK citizens living around the EU will have certainty.  The financial settlement issue in terms of the UK's contribution to the EU's budgets up until the end of 2020 is largely settled.  Perhaps most importantly for businesses, there is the facilitation in the legal text of a transition period for an initial 21 months until the end of 2020 and then the option for the UK, if it wants to take it, of extending the transition for a further one or two years if it is necessary to finalise the detail of the future relationship agreement between the UK and the EU.  </p><p> On the issues that have caused so much political controversy and debate in Westminster, in particular with regard to the backstop, it is important to say that the factual position, rather than the case being made by some, is the backstop does not represent a threat to anybody.  It is about preventing the threat to the normality, stability and peaceful relations that have built up over the past two decades on the island of Ireland and ensuring we do not have the corrosive impact in the future of enforced border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions.  Some people in this room will know only too well why we have been so firm and clear, across all political parties, on this request and on the insistence it is accommodated in a withdrawal agreement.  </p><p> There has not been enough focus on the context of the backstop.  The only reason a conversation around the backstop began at all was that people wanted to protect the peace process and ensure the trade and movement of goods, services, people and capital on the island of Ireland, which has reinforced good relations, can sustain into the future.  It is also important to say the backstop is a fall-back, last resort, insurance mechanism.  Nobody wants to have to use it.  Last December, the UK and EU negotiating team agreed we would try to solve the Border concerns on the island of Ireland through a future relationship agreement that would be comprehensive enough to do it.  If it was not possible, the second option would be that the UK would offer bespoke solutions recognising the unique challenges the Border presented on the island of Ireland.  Let us not forget it is not just a border between two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland but will become a border between the United Kingdom and the EU.  It is the EU's external border.  If it is not possible to get agreement on bespoke solutions, the default, fall-back position was the UK would maintain full alignment with the rules of the customs union and Single Market in the areas necessary to protect North-South  co-operation and an all-island economy and to protect the peace process.  Many people seem to talk about the backstop as if it is the basis of the future relationship, which it is not.  We are all committed to ensuring the backstop never takes effect.  Should it take effect, we are committed to trying to ensure it is only temporary so it can be replaced with something more permanent.  For the moment there is not another credible fall-back solution that can take the place of the backstop.  That is why EU leaders and the British Prime Minister have been so clear that there is a need for the backstop even though we want to avoid using it and if it ever takes effect we want to make sure it is temporary and short-lived.  The temporary commitment has to be qualified.  It is qualified by the language in the withdrawal agreement, which says it is there unless and until it is replaced by something else that can do the same job.  We all want to replace it.  I have said many times I do not believe anybody on the island should feel threatened by the backstop.  This is a worst-case, fall-back position.  Even in that case, Northern Ireland is effectively being offered free, uninhibited, seamless trade access to the EU Single Market and customs union and to the rest of the United Kingdom's single market too.  It is a British red line that has resulted in the element of the backstop that is now referred to as the single customs territory because Theresa May made it very clear she would not accept any deal that put Northern Ireland into a different customs union from the rest of the United Kingdom.  The response to the EU from some in Westminster, that the EU was looking to trap the UK into its customs union with the backstop misunderstands where it has come from.  It was a British request.  The initial proposal from the EU side was we would have a Northern Ireland-specific backstop that would not involve the rest of the United Kingdom .  It was a British request to make the backstop UK-wide on customs to which the EU initially said "No" and then facilitated after a lot of very difficult negotiation.  It is now a point of criticism by some in Westminster, which is an irony that needs to be exposed.  </p><p> I commend the British Prime Minister on following through on the political commitments that were made last December and on understanding the fragility and complexity of politics on the island and the need for an insurance mechanism that can address and allay the fears many people have of seeing physical border infrastructure re-emerging on our island.  She has addressed it with the backstop.  She now needs to get some accommodation from us in the context of the reassurance and clarification for which she is asking.  She is not asking to change the withdrawal agreement.  She is asking for reassurance and clarification from the EU side that everything possible will be done to avoid the backstop ever being used and, therefore, a focus on both sides to get a future relationship that is comprehensive enough to deal with the issue.  She also wants reassurances that if the backstop is ever triggered, in other words if there is a time at the end of a transition period but before a future relationship has been signed off on when there is a need to use a backstop we will all work to ensure it is only on a temporary basis and that it gets replaced with something that can do the same job but is more permanent.  </p><p> There are other issues related to Brexit, which I can go into.  The final thing I will mention on Brexit is contingency.  We will continue to negotiate politically to try to get acceptance and agreement to ratify the withdrawal agreement, which we believe is the most sensible way to manage Brexit now.  We also believe the agreement on the political declaration on the future relationship is balanced.</p><p>We do not know if the Parliament in Westminster will ratify the deal.  We hope it will but as we do not know whether it will, we have to plan for all eventualities as to how, as a country, we respond to a no-deal Brexit.  We have spent many months planning for Brexit.  Our public commentary on contingency planning has been primarily around what we describe as the central case scenario, which we still regard as the most likely outcome, whereby there is a deal, a withdrawal agreement and a two-year transition period at the end of which we would have to be prepared for the new realities of a new trading environment.  It may involve a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK that in all likelihood would require some customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks by inspectors from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and so on.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit that kicks in after 29 March, a lot of these preparations will need to be fast-tracked and work in that regard is under way.  We made a Government decision on Tuesday that essentially is an instruction to senior civil servants, essentially the Secretaries General, to build on the plans already in place to ensure we can be ready by 29 March.  There also is an increase in the intensification of preparations at EU level, collectively, for contingency plans too.  In many areas, EU competence will determine how contingency works, be that in aviation, fishing, data protection, security, recognition of certification and standards, citizens' rights and movement and so on.  As I said earlier in the D&aacute;il, the Commission has been holding sectoral seminars with the 27 member states to discuss contingency planning in all these areas and on how the European institutions would likely respond and how they would expect countries to respond in a way that is consistent with that.  The last of those sectoral seminars will take place on 10 January.  <br/><br/>Next week, we will publish an update paper on contingency.  We have a Brexit stakeholders group which meets every five to six weeks. It is comprised of a broad cross-section of people, including political parties, who are following Brexit closely.  We will bring that update contingency paper to that group and we will publish afterwards so that people will have a clearer picture in terms of the areas where Ireland will be planning domestically, in partnership with other EU countries and with the EU institutions to put in place contingency plans.  To be clear, contingency planning is not about maintaining the <i>status quo</i>after the UK leaves the European Union.  Contingency planning will involve a lot of negativity in the context of a no-deal Brexit and a much more difficult trading environment in which we will be obliged to mitigate against the worst impacts.  A no-deal Brexit will be difficult for everybody.  It will be particularly difficult for the UK but it will be difficult for us too and we should not pretend otherwise.  This is why getting this deal across the line in January, to which 28 countries including the UK have signed up, is so important.</p></speech>

It was useful to have the briefing note prior to the meeting.  On migration, it has to be acknowledged that there is more migration within Africa than there is from Africa.  There are countries within Africa which face very challenging situations and which are coping with migrants as well.  The T&aacute;naiste used the example of Jordan but there are many others.</p> <p>  On Libya, how confident is the T&aacute;naiste of a Libyan-found solution when there are some many factions there?  Are the detention centres still open because they are a source of funding for certain groups within the Libyan framework?  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that a number of Deputies visited Syria a couple of months ago.  It was a private visit, which opened our eyes to the reality of what is happening.  I would say there were atrocities on all sides within the Syrian conflict.  There is no good side or bad side but the reality is that the majority of people still living there are trying to rebuild their lives.  We saw many examples of that resilience.  It is time that we considered engaging in Syria with the people who are living there and are trying to rebuild their country after the conflict.</p> <p>  On Yemen, it is good that the negotiations have started after a long lead-in.  The point was made in the briefing note that there cannot be a military solution.  Where is the condemnation of the arms trade?  EU member countries such as the UK and France are fuelling that conflict, yet there is to be no military solution.  As long as the arms continue to be provided, that is what will happen.</p> <p>  We had an interesting meeting yesterday with an Iranian delegation and the message that came across for me is the way in which the sanctions are affecting them.  The US is pulling the strings, as it has been doing in Cuba for many years.  It is sanctioning companies and banks because they are trading with countries it does not like.  I will leave Brexit to other members, or I might come back in on it later.  </p> <p>  I acknowledge that countries need aid, that we are very generous and that we do it right but giving more aid is the short-term answer.  We are not looking to the long-term answer, which is the policy coherence, in respect of which we await the White Paper.  In regard to the &euro;110 million in additional funding, has the T&aacute;naiste earmarked where it is going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.822" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018121300002#G00400"><p>I will respond to the Deputy's questions in reverse order.  On the issue of aid, I refer to the new paper.  I am slow to call it "aid" because it is really about development and partnership.  I speak a lot about the relationship between the EU and Africa, which in my view, in terms of political infrastructure, is totally inadequate.  We need a partnership between Africa and Europe in the future which is based more on co-operation and equal input than on funding and aid.  A lot of aid is linked to contracts and is tied.  I am glad to state that Ireland is not part of that approach.  The new aid strategy will attempt to link development and capacity building whereby the private sector can complement and add significantly to the platforms we are trying to create through aid programmes around stability and local capacity building.  Hopefully, I have shown a record in this area in terms of the Africa agrifood support programme, which I put in place during my tenure in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This is the type of activity in which we need to do more.  I hope the Deputy will see in the aid strategy, when published mid-January, a new approach that she will welcome.</p> <p>  On Yemen, I have agreed to a motion in the Seanad on Yemen, which will be debated next Tuesday.  It involves a condemnation of arms exports to Saudi Arabia in the context of the war in Yemen, although we are all hopeful that the talks process can ensure that the ceasefire is lasting.  It is important that we are realistic.  It is virtually impossible to get a united EU position on arms trade.  We do have arms trade treaties by which member states are bound.  It is the responsibility of countries exporting arms to know where they are going and for what they are being used.  A number of EU countries that historically have exported arms, for example, Sweden and Austria, are no longer selling arms to countries that are actively at war, including Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Ireland has been quite vocal in respect of this matter and has supported a motion that is balanced but also direct.  I suspect that motion will be agreed, virtually unanimously, in the Seanad on Tuesday next.</p><p> I have a note on Syria which I must read.  A new reality is emerging.  So far, few refugees have returned due to fear of savage repression.  These are the fears which prompted the start of the conflict in 2011.  We will continue to have to provide significant humanitarian aid, not only to Syrians who are refugees in their own country but also to those who are refugees outside their country.  There is a real fear of reprisals and the settling of scores.  While some refugees will be welcomed home, others will not, depending on what side they were on in the civil war.  We must not be naive about what is possible in Syria in the context of timeframes and so on.  We must be aware of the need to facilitate the safe return of Syrian refugees to their home country, not only because of the difficult burden refugees place on neighbouring countries but also because people have the right to return.  We are some way off seeing the opportunity of safe return for many refugees, particularly in light of the approach of the Assad regime.  Oversight will be essential when that return happens.  There will also have to be a global effort to rebuild the country.  The same is true of Yemen.  Yemen and Syria are countries which will require many billions of euro and dollars to rebuild.  Societies will need to be rebuilt as well as physical structures.</p><p> Political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya allow for only a limited capacity on the part of the international community to end abuses there.  No one should pretend some of the camps from which pretty horrible imagery has emerged have gone away.  While significant efforts have been made to build capacity among systems in Libya to protect people, we are clearly not where we need to be.  There is a need to build consensus among groups and factions in Libya in order to provide a platform and foundation for free and fair elections.  The UN process is the one we need to follow.  Part of the problem in Libya is that different organisations were trying to do different things for a while, but they have now all coalesced behind UN efforts which is necessary and positive.  However, I would not want to be overly positive about where we are.  Libya is still a haven for human trafficking and a very sophisticated and well-funded level of illegal activity.  Families are sent from Libya in boats that have no capacity to get very far at sea and so on.  The EU has funded some successful efforts to repatriate people to home or source countries from Libya and we will see a great deal more of that in future.  It has been successful and reduced numbers significantly.  However, there is still a great deal of work to do.  It is very hard to get certainty around co-operation with a state when one does not have a sound structure with which to negotiate politically.</p><p> I take the point about migration and am glad to say the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has signed on behalf of Ireland the UN&rsquo;s global compact on migration, which is a voluntary commitment.  Unfortunately, many EU countries decided not to do so but a majority did.  It reflects how deeply divisive the global political debate on migration continues to be.  We see those tensions in the Mediterranean now.  That NGO boats are no longer allowed to operate in the Mediterranean is a reflection of some of the challenges the EU faces and even of the challenges faced by the likes of Operation Sophia.  It is sobering and a matter in respect of which Ireland will continue to try to have an input.</p></speech>

He is welcome, as are the members of his team.  I have raised most of my questions with the T&aacute;naiste previously.  Can he provide an update on the Middle East peace process?  He mentioned previously that he was anxious to convene a summit or meeting in Dublin in the new year.  Can he provide his view on two areas, one of which Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan touched on?  The first is Iran and the climate of human rights there.  It was news to us yesterday that the death penalty has been legislated out of practice there.  That includes the stoning of people to death.  As late as this morning, we met a group involved in the advocacy of human rights and democracy in Bahrain.  They painted a pretty grim picture for us about political prisoners.  There appears to be a complete lack of open, transparent democracy and freedom of speech.  People are tried, locked up and sentenced to death for speaking out even on Twitter.  We were told that there are approximately 40 people under sentence of death.</p> <p>  Can the T&aacute;naiste provide an update on the chilling effect of the situation in Hungary and the rise of Viktor Orb&aacute;n?  I have raised this matter with him before.  What is the impact of that on open democracy, the media and the judiciary there?  Some of us had the benefit of a briefing last week from our ambassador to the UN, H.E. Geraldine Byrne Nason, on the campaign for a Security Council seat at the United Nations.  Can the T&aacute;naiste comment?  I ask for a comment on the undocumented Irish in the USA.  We are up to speed on the campaign on the E3 visas, but there is a lingering concern about how, ultimately, we can address the cohort of Irish who are undocumented within the United States of America.</p> <p>  We are eating, sleeping and drinking Brexit every day of the week.  Can the T&aacute;naiste provide a little more detail on the work under way on preparedness and the recruitment campaign Revenue is conducting for customs staff in particular?  Different numbers are being quoted on how many people are actually being sought through the current recruitment campaign.</p><p>Will the Minister give us some indication as to where the critical mass of these people will be?  Will they be dotted along the Border, will they be in our ports or will they be everywhere?  We have not been saying a whole lot publicly about the detail of the contingency planning, but will the Minister give us any insight into it?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018121300002#J00300"><p>There are many questions but they are all valid.  On the Middle East peace process, which we have spoken a lot about and which I have spoken with Deputy Crowe about, I refer to the positive contributions that Ireland is making.  Last week in the UN, Ambassador Byrne Nason did what can only be described as a phenomenal job in ensuring that Ireland was not only relevant but actually pivotal in getting a resolution agreed at the UN General Assembly which got the support of 156 countries.  Only six countries opposed the resolution and a small number abstained, and it was an Irish resolution on the Middle East, insisting on a two-state solution and referring to previous UN resolutions which recognised the unacceptability of settlement expansion and the need for a fair and lasting peace process.  We remain very active on the Middle East peace process at international fora, and my record at EU Foreign Affairs Council meetings and at the UN is pretty strong on that.</p> <p>  As I said before, we plan to have a meeting in Dublin early next year.  It is not possible to do it in January so we are hoping to be able to do it in February.  It is purely a scheduling reason because we need to get key countries here, we need to get certainty from the most important of those countries that they will attend on certain dates and as the Deputy would expect, these are busy people.  I am hopeful we will be able to get an agreed date in February and we will have a number of key EU and Arab countries here to have discussions privately in a retreat-style structure, which is what we want and what we think will work well.  We have consulted widely on that to try to get some new thinking into the Middle East peace process which will obviously involve the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>  On Iran, the human rights situation there is a matter for concern as Iranians do not enjoy freedom of religion and belief, expression or assembly, and there are particular concerns about the treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders.  The situation of women is also an issue of real concern.  While we have taken on and support the EU perspective on the nuclear agreement because, in our view, it is important to prevent the development of nuclear weapons, that does not mean that we are not critical and, we hope, consistent on the human rights record in Iran.</p> <p>  On Bahrain, I remain very concerned about the human rights situation there.  The Bahraini Government has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record, and human rights are enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution.  Fulfilling this commitment must include allowing space for Bahrainis to express disagreement with or criticism of the government without fear of arrest or mistreatment.  I am often confronted with these issues in different parts of the world where politicians ask me with seriousness and respect how we fund NGOs that are critical of our own Government, how we justify doing that and sometimes how we fund NGOs that are critical of other governments that are supposed to be allies that we trade with and work with.  The truth is that in any functioning and normal democracy, constructive and transparent criticism through active, mobilised civil society is a good thing, not a bad thing, and governments should not see it as a threat unless, of course, that activism crosses lines into violence and instability.  Ireland has been and continues to be consistent on that, whether it is in the Middle East or the Far East.</p> <p>  On Hungary, we have concerns over the civic space available for NGOs to continue to operate there.  In some ways it is pretty shocking to have to say that about an EU member state, but it is the truth and these concerns have been exacerbated by the passage of legislation by the Hungarian Parliament aimed at individuals and organisations providing lawful assistance to migrants and asylum seekers.  We also have concerns about the position of the Central European University and the difficulties it has been having.  It is not a good development, but having said that, my party shares a place in the European People's Party with the governing party in Hungary, and debates around these issues do take place in that forum, as they should because there is a real concern about some of the politics and the direction of policy of the Hungarian Government.</p> <p>  On our UN Security Council, SECCO, campaign, we are in reasonably good shape.  Ambassador Byrne Nason and her team in New York are very active.  We have focused not only on strengthening relations with traditional friends, particularly across Africa where Ireland has had a very active development programme for many years, but also on building new alliances and friendships across island states in the Caribbean, which are now discussing with us how to build resilience in terms of climate adaptation.  We will hold a small island states conference in Ireland next summer, specifically focusing on how to build a blue economy sustainably and how to respond in the context of climate resilience where islands are literally facing hurricanes of increasing strength year after year and rising sea levels in some cases, especially in the Pacific.  Very interesting and new discussions and partnerships are starting to take place there and Irish technology and know-how can be very helpful in some of these islands.</p> <p>  We also have very good relationships across the Middle East in terms of our interest and, it is hoped, our balanced input in the Middle East peace process, insisting that a two-state solution must be kept alive, even though many people write it off already, that any peace process has to happen on the basis of parity of esteem between both sides, and that the obligations an occupying force has in occupied territory under international law are followed.  Sometimes I am accused of being partisan and anti-Israeli.  I am neither but I call things as I see them, as the Government does in terms of international law in agreements at UN level and our hopes and demands around a fair and equitable peace process that can work for both sides and that understands that Israel has genuine security concerns while also understanding that Palestinians need to be treated fairly in their hopes and dreams for a country of their own.</p> <p>  Our SECCO campaign will be very competitive because, unfortunately, we are competing with two other countries that are also very active on the global stage.  Two tougher competitors than Norway and Canada could not have been picked and only two get chosen from the three.  This vote will take place in about 18 months but we are working hard, we are well placed and we have shown before that we can win a place on the UN Security Council, even when there is stiff competition.</p><p> On the E3 visas and the undocumented, I hope that there might be a breakthrough in the next 24 hours.  However, we must be careful not to issue firm predictions because we can never be certain what will happen in the US Senate.  The Government and Deputy John Deasy in particular have worked very hard on this issue.  Our embassy and team in Washington have done a great job in this regard, and I hope that will be recognised if and when we get this across the line with the support of friends of Ireland in the US Congress and Senate who want to progress a structured and sensible facilitation of Irish people who want to get a visa to live and work in the United States.  Australia is the only country to receive E3 visas.  It receives an allocation of 10,500 visas a year for predominantly young Australians to go to work legally in the US.  That special facilitation was granted after Australia militarily assisted the US.  In recent years, only approximately half of those visas are used, meaning there is an unused surplus.  Of course, we have reassured Australia that we are not seeking to take its visas but only wish to be facilitated with those visas which it does not use and which could be applied to Irish people who wish to travel to the US.  To reassure Australia that this will not in any way undermine its scheme, it is proposed that the surplus would be allocated to Ireland in the following year.  Australians will not be losing out in any way.  Any unused surplus in 2018 would be allocated to Ireland in 2019 and so on.  That is my understanding of the current proposal which aims to reassure Australia that Ireland is not trying in any way to undermine its allocation.</p><p> We have a significant amount of support on the issue from people such as Congressman Richard Neale, who was a sponsor of the legislation in the US House of Representatives.  Some US Senators who have been very helpful are seeking to facilitate this measure which might be approved by the US Senate in the next 24 hours.  It must be unanimously approved by the US Senate.  A single Senator could prevent it moving ahead.  We have worked hard to address the concerns of a small number of Senators and I hope we are nearly there.  It is very much about putting a visa system in place for new generations of Irish people, which is very important.  For many decades, young Irish people have travelled to the US for work or adventure through various mechanisms to be part of the new America.  I consider it very important that new generations of Irish people also have that opportunity, which is why the E3 visa proposal and legislation is of such importance.  In return for the E3 visa facilitation, we have offered to facilitate US nationals who want to come to Ireland.  No Irish people would find the commitments we have made in that regard objectionable.</p><p> On the undocumented, the Government has not lost sight of the pursuit of relief for undocumented Irish citizens in the US.  The Government, including my Department, works with our envoy to the US Congress on the undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, and will continue to pursue the goal of trying to provide certainty, relief and safety for the many undocumented who work and live in the US.  Many of them are part of Irish immigration centres which we support and fund to help look after them.  We initially hoped to get legislation that would also provide a pathway to citizenship for many of the undocumented.  The E3 visa is a slightly different vehicle.  We will look for opportunities to focus on the challenges that undocumented Irish in the US continue to experience.  I am well aware of their current concerns and vulnerabilities.</p><p> On Brexit, there is some confusion on the numbers.  We began our contingency preparations on the basis of what I have described as the central case scenario.  When one is preparing for something, one should start with the most likely outcome.  In the case of Brexit, that is that there will be a deal, a withdrawal agreement, a transition and then some type of free trade agreement or similar which it is hoped would involve only limited border checks.  In July, the Government agreed to take on an extra 1,077 inspectors and staff in our ports and airports, primarily Dublin and Rosslare ports and Dublin Airport, which are where the vast majority of commercial goods traffic enters the Irish economy.  In fact, half of the product going to Northern Ireland from Britain comes through Dublin.  The central case scenario would involve approximately 200 customs officials being taken on by the middle of next year.  In a no-deal scenario we would need to take on all of the approximately 1,000 staff who would be required in our ports and airports far more quickly.  That would involve the recruitment of approximately 600 customs officials, with the other 400 recruits being sanitary or phytosanitary inspectors at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and food health inspectors at the Department of Health.  There are recruitment campaigns under way or in preparation in those Departments for those inspectors.  The Revenue Commissioners has moved ahead with its recruitment process for customs officers and is in the process of initially recruiting 200 officers.  However, a panel of 3,000 people applied for those customs jobs and that panel will allow us to increase quickly the number of customs officials we take on if that becomes necessary in a no-deal scenario.  We will provide far more detail around those numbers when we publish a paper to provide an update on our contingency planning for a central case or no-deal scenario.  We do not yet have all of the answers because many of the issues are being discussed at EU level and form part of EU competence.  However, the EU has published approximately 70 papers on no-deal Brexit planning, so a substantial amount of work has been carried out in that regard.  That work must continue and intensify to ensure that we are where we need to be by 29 March to try to mitigate what would undoubtedly be the many downsides of a potential no-deal Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-13a.829" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018121300002#K00200"><p>The Minister is correct that we need to be seen as critical, fair and consistent.  People would be somewhat surprised, however, by some of the statements issued following meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The Minister mentioned that the elections in Venezuela were neither free nor fair, but there was no mention of certain other elections, such as those in Bahrain on 24 November.  As the Minister stated, there are significant question marks in regard to Bahrain as no opposition candidate was allowed to stand in the election and people have been jailed for tweeting their opposition to a motor race, never mind tweeting opposition to the regime.  That is the type of country with which we are dealing.</p> <p>  On the reference to the destabilising influence of Iran, those living in Iran, Iraq or even parts of Syria would probably say it has been a stabilising influence in the sense that it has helped to stand up to ISIS in that part of the world.</p><p>That is again debatable but Iran has played a positive role in some cases in that part of the world.</p><p> The Minister spoke of the blocking statute devised some years ago to counter United States sanctions on Cuba.  The statute was never operated.  Will he expand on how that would work?  Some of us were active with the Cuban support group in working against sanctions and so on.  There are difficulties with bank transfers and basic activities like that.  How would this roll out and what impact would it have on groups in Ireland?</p><p> While previous speakers also raised this matter, I will return to the UN migration compact.  Like me, I suppose the Minister has received emails and letters about the UN global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration that was signed this week in Marrakesh.  I do not know about other members but I am somewhat astonished by some of the lies and misinformation being spread about this non-binding compact.  Some of the stuff on social media is appalling, as there is talk of a flood or influx of migrants into Europe.  It all comes from a handful of right-wing organisations or countries.  I welcome that migration has been recognised as a global phenomenon and that it needs a global framework to deal with some of the challenges it can create.  The compact recognises the major positive effect that migrants can bring to countries.  Does Ireland's signing up to this compact mean tens of thousands will come to Ireland?  This needs to be explained to people.  It is also important that these lies and the hysteria arising from fear about the compact are dealt with.  It is important that those of us who understand what is going on, particularly Government spokespersons, counteract and explain the reality and positivity of the compact.  That perspective would be shared by most parties represented here.  Again, people can get carried away by a handful of letters or a couple of phone calls and some are scared as a result.</p><p> I will focus on Brexit, an issue that has hardly been touched.  Nobody could deny this week has been a bit of a shambles in Westminster.  We now know British Prime Minister May remains in place for now but nobody knows what will happen next.  The Minister clearly explained the importance of the backstop.  I ask him to state again, in no uncertain terms, that the backstop is non-negotiable.  There have been positive statements relating to Brexit coming from our EU partner countries, for example, people have explained the importance of having no hard border and no diminution of people's rights.  Will the Minister focus on that?</p><p> Some of us travelled to meet groups in Belfast and Derry two weeks ago.  The main concern was about a diminution of rights.  People are concerned about what is coming down the tracks.  We met people from an educational background who are concerned about access to the Erasmus programme, the EU health insurance card and student fee rate, along with other elements.  Statements on this from our EU partners are welcome but is there now a need to put some flesh on those statements?  What is the Minister's sense of what is coming down the track?  Yesterday, we met people from the north-west partnership in Derry who spoke about the working structures.  They mentioned the A5 route and how it would open economic development in the region.  People from Manufacturing Ireland spoke about the difficulty in the central area of Monaghan and Fermanagh.  I am talking about putting flesh on these issues.  One of the simplest proposals is the development of a port in Donegal.  The money required would be small but it would have a major impact on the region.  How can these forward-looking proposals be actioned?  Will we issue demands to EU colleagues in this regard in order that we can build on peace and statements about having no hard borders?  Part of this relates to developing the economy and trade in those regions.</p><p> The most important element relates to the rights of people, and it is what people keep coming back for.  It is about access to the European Court of Human Rights for citizens living in the North.  The original statement referred to those "residing" in the North but there is no mention of that now.  How do we reinforce those rights?  I am not just talking about the Good Friday Agreement but rather the potential in the agreement.  That is where we must "talk up" the Irish peace process; it is not just about what we achieved in the past but what we can achieve in future.  I am interested in the Minister's thoughts on that.</p><p> I could get into discussions on a hard Brexit and the issue has been mentioned in the Chamber.  If there is a hard border, we could speak about holding a Border poll because unity by consent is part of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has a different view in that regard.  We must also speak in terms of the possibility of a hard Brexit and the implications it would have.  The Minister will say there is a possibility that the agreement will be ratified by the British Parliament but the numbers currently do not stack up.  We are hopeful that it can happen.  I am concerned by what we can do in the Border region to support and build on the peace process.</p></speech>

I have concerns about Bahrain, as I outlined earlier.  The truth is there are many things happening in many parts of the world and we cannot focus on all of them at the same time.  I gave members a sense of some of the priority areas, countries and challenges we have been trying to deal with at the Foreign Affairs Council at EU level.</p> <p>  On the matter of Iran and the nuclear deal, as I and other EU figures have said many times, we were very disappointed by the decision of the United States to withdraw from that deal.  My EU colleagues and I discussed Iran and the joint comprehensive plan of action at the Council meeting in November and again earlier this week.  We reiterated our united and continued support for the full implementation of the agreement, including the creation of a special purpose vehicle that can effectively allow for investment and money flows back and forth in the context of the United States sanctions being implemented, which is not easy.</p><p>It is not easy because the US financial system is the core of much of global commerce.</p><p> I am glad the Deputy raised the global compact because there is a great deal of scaremongering taking place in that regard.  I have had people approach me in the street to raise it, which is unusual in Ireland where we have generally avoided what I regard as the politics of migration.  That is partly because of where we are geographically but also because we do not tend to have a hard left and a hard right in Irish politics on a large scale from a policy perspective.  Ireland supports the global compact for migration which was adopted at the UN conference in Morocco in the last few days and we look forward to joining other signatories to ensure migration is safer, more orderly and better managed.  It is regrettable that some countries have indicated that they will not join the compact but we hope they will reconsider in time.  The lessons we learned in the European Union during the 2015 migration crisis should remind us of the need to address migration in a co-operative and comprehensive manner.  The global compact is non-binding and in no way infringes on states' sovereignty.  Suggestions that it might lead to a surge in migration are absolutely unfounded.  Migration is a global challenge whether we like it or not and we need collective solutions based on multilateral agreements and structures, primarily through the UN and EU.</p></speech>

I spoke to Deputy Crowe briefly as we walked over to the House for the vote.  Many people seem to have the wrong impression about the global compact.  It is somehow seen as countries wanting an open door policy on migration.  It is nothing of the sort.  This is about trying to balance rights and responsibilities to make sure that countries respond in a way that is consistent with international humanitarian law.  It provides for a recognition of the reality of the extent of migration in various parts of the world and the need to respond collectively in a consistent way which allows countries to manage their own borders appropriately but which at the same time ensures that we can respond to the humanitarian challenge of significant levels of migration which are not going to reduce any time soon.  We are talking about millions of people on the move within the continent of Africa at any given time.  Unfortunately, significant numbers of people continue to flee conflict and oppression.  There are also, unfortunately, millions of people in refugee camps.</p> <p>  Migration is a reality to which the international community needs to respond with much more consistency than has been the case to date.   Some countries take hardline positions in this regard and shut their borders and others then have to accept a totally disproportionate burden in terms of the humanitarian challenges relating to mass migration.  That is not sustainable and it is what the global compact is essentially trying to respond to.  I am pleased to say that the majority of UN member states support the compact.  There is a lot of work to do because some very influential and wealthy countries have decided not to support it.</p> <p>  On Brexit, it is fair to say that the backstop is now part of a negotiated agreement that will not change.  The British Prime Minister gave a very strong defence of the backstop on Monday when she spoke in the House of Commons in very difficult political circumstances.  She recognised that the House of Commons needed reassurance and clarification on the backstop from the EU and I hope we will be able to give her that.  She also recognised the need for the backstop in the context of providing certainty and reassurance to people on the island of Ireland that they are not going to face border infrastructure as an unintended consequence of Brexit.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to why the backstop is so important.  The presence of the backstop in any withdrawal agreement is not negotiable.  Reading some of the reports in the British media today, there seems to be confirmation that even if there was another future relationship agreement in place, which is unlikely to happen, a backstop would still be required in the context of a withdrawal agreement, which creates the space through transition for the future relationship to be negotiated and finalised.</p> <p>  All of the focus on the backstop has in many ways camouflaged or hidden many of the other very positive elements in the withdrawal agreement, which are following through on the very strong language of this time last year in the political declaration by the UK to no diminution of rights for citizens in Northern Ireland.  Essentially, that is something on which we will have to get further detail in the context of any future relationship agreement.  As a result of the fact that people in Northern Ireland have a right to Irish citizenship, they will also have a right to EU citizenship.  Therefore, they will, like other citizens of the EU, be able to move around, study and work across the Union.  There is a difference between EU citizenship and EU residency rights and entitlements and it is important to signal that distinction.  It is the intention of the British Government to try to ensure that the Erasmus programmes that are in place would be made available to all British citizens in the future through an agreement with the EU.  European health insurance is also something on which there will be positive negotiation in the future to ensure that citizens in Northern Ireland and British citizens generally can benefit from the scheme.  The UK would have to contribute towards it because there is a cost attached.</p> <p>  Investment in the north west generally or in the Border counties is a separate issue to Brexit.  However, the two are linked.</p><p>If we look at the 20-year plan for Ireland, Project Ireland 2040, there is a big emphasis on the north west and on the Border counties in terms of investment in road infrastructure but also in North-South connectivity.  For example, doing a full value-for-money assessment on high-speed rail networks between Belfast and Dublin is part of that 2040 plan.</p><p> The Deputy makes the case for the need to demand certain things of our EU colleagues to ensure that we reinforce and protect the peace process and so on but all I can say is that to date, our EU colleagues have been nothing short of extraordinarily supportive in this Brexit process in respect of the solidarity that Ireland has got.  Many people predicted that as these negotiations intensified, Ireland would be cast aside.  I am not suggesting that the Deputy was saying otherwise.</p></speech>

All these matters require facilitation from other EU countries of a withdrawal agreement that is about protecting interests on the island of Ireland and a peace process.  The focus on Ireland and the attention to detail there sums up for me why we are in the European Union because small countries matter and when they are threatened or vulnerable, bigger countries and not so big countries in the Union are supportive and show solidarity.  Today it is Ireland but next year it could be Estonia, Latvia, Cyprus or Malta.</p> <p>  There are benefits to being in a union and we are seeing an understanding and a solidarity that is important, not in a way that is anti-British or against the UK but in a way that is looking for a fair outcome.  That conversation will continue from the withdrawal agreement, if we can get it agreed and ratified, into the future relationship negotiation that in my view will continue for the next two to four years, which is why there will be a need to extend the transition period should it be triggered and if the withdrawal agreement facilitates that anyway.  I do not see how we can get everything done in 21 months but that will be a decision for the UK and we have some big hurdles to overcome before those choices have to be made.  Between now and 21 January, the British Prime Minister has to find a way of getting this deal ratified and we need to do everything we can to help her, within reason.</p></speech>

I was glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste say that under no circumstances could we countenance the reintroduction or re-emergence of Border infrastructure.  I live in a community that has been transformed through the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  I said at this committee before that it was only when the Brexit referendum happened that we took stock of the progress that has been made on this island and under no circumstances can we go back.  I used the phrase previously that the referendum decision knocked the stuffing out of Border communities because those of us who grew up in parishes that were divided along the Border and who have had the privilege of representing two counties with a long land border with Northern Ireland have seen the benefits of the Good Friday Agreement and as the T&aacute;naiste inferred earlier, there has been a huge growth in North-South trade and the development of the all-Ireland economy through the mechanisms that were put in place and through the political environment that we have had as a result of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>As the T&aacute;naiste knows well, the food industry and many other sectors of our economy have grown on an all-Ireland basis and those enterprises and commerce grew without people waving flags or talking about political ideology.  The political framework and understanding was there on how to go about creating business and working together.  We have businesses that were established here by people who are from a different political tradition than I come from and similarly, people from the South are establishing businesses in Northern Ireland as well and that has been really beneficial.  It is only since June 2016 that we have realised the progress that has been made.  It is thankfully a transformed society, even though we fully realise that we have progress to make in other respects.</p><p>I recently attended the launch of a publication by Donnacha &Oacute; Beach&aacute;in of Dublin City University, DCU, entitled <i>From Partition to Brexit</i>.  It was very heartening to listen to the President of DCU, Professor MacCraith, speak at that launch about the students in DCU.  The overwhelming majority of those students and the students at every third level college in the country thankfully did not live through the Troubles.  They are a new generation that did not experience that troubled era on our island and we surely want to make sure that every protection is made so that we do not go back in any respect, be it political, economic or social.</p><p>I know the Government is putting in a huge effort, supported by all political parties here, in bringing representatives and the T&aacute;naiste's counterparts in other governments to the Border area, as we did with parliamentary groups.  It gave a good understanding to people in other member states of the European Union that we do not have a border, that the communities are living side by side and that under no circumstances could we countenance a return to the era where we had impediments to the free movement of people, goods and services.</p><p>Together with Deputy Crowe and the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I was in Belfast and Derry recently to meet different groups about the need for investment of which we all are aware.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the 2040 national plan and he mentioned the development plans for the north west and for the east coast.  We all welcome those but there is a central Border area that needs particular attention and it does not get the attention in Project Ireland 2040 that I would like to see it receive.  It is an area to which I would like to see some attention given, although I am realistic enough to know there are always competing demands.</p><p>The British have spoken about a prosperity fund post 2020 for Northern Ireland, which is a bit of a misnomer if ever there was one.  Alongside the peace programme and the INTERREG programme, perhaps we should have developed a particular fund to be administered through the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, which covers Cavan, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone and similarly in Derry and Donegal in the north west, as well as in the east Border region.  We should explore the possibility post 2020 of the British, the European Union and our Government contributing to a specific fund.  I would like it to be given some consideration in that respect because our area, regardless of what Brexit there is, will unfortunately be adversely affected.  Those are just some ideas for consideration.</p></speech>

We are constantly looking for ways to build bridges between North and South and building strong and resilient economic development along that mid-Border region should be a big part of that because that was obviously a big focal point for the Troubles in the past.</p></speech>

The Bill was published on 14 November and concluded its passage through Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last week.  I welcome the support received in that House for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Harty, and Deputy Durkan for their support on this legislation. </p> <p>  This is a short and technical Bill comprising eight sections all focused on the specific issue of health insurance.  The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old, sick or healthy.</p> <p>  Legislation is needed each year to update the amounts of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the amounts of stamp duty levied on health insurance contracts to fund the credits. </p> <p>  As part of the process, the independent market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, carries out an annual evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year.  Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits that should apply the next year.</p> <p>  The rates for next year, recommended by the authority, have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health.  This year&rsquo;s Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits across genders and age groups, and there will be no change in the stamp duty levy on contracts.  Maintaining the stamp duty levies at existing levels should ensure that health insurers do not increase premiums and that contracts remain at an affordable price for all citizens.</p> <p>  In addition to the technical amendments, this year&rsquo;s Bill provides for a number of amendments to the Acts governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI. </p> <p>  In short, it is proposed to expand the membership of the Health Insurance Authority board; to broaden the composition of the VHI board; and to enable VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly.  I will outline each of these proposed changes in turn.</p> <p>  The Health Insurance Authority was established in 2001 with provision for five board members to be appointed.  Since then, the health insurance market has become more complex, with insurers adopting innovative marketing and product propositions to expand their client base and improve their risk profile. </p> <p>  Further significant changes can be expected as the Sl&aacute;intecare programme is implemented.  The role of private health insurance in our health system could change significantly, and the regulator must be able to react to this changing role and to advise the Minister for Health appropriately.</p> <p>  For the objective and effective discharge of its functions, it is desirable that the authority includes a broad mix of skills and experience and expanding the membership of the board will ensure they can deliver its strategy and address any challenges it meets.</p> <p>  The Bill also contains two amendments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, which are the governing legislation for VHI.</p> <p>  The first VHI-related amendment deals with board composition. Currently, the VHI board is restricted to having only two persons who are &ldquo;health service providers&rdquo; on the board.  This amendment will remove this restriction and includes a new provision that the Minister will give due consideration to the mix of skills present on the VHI board when making appointments, thus ensuring the highest standards of governance.</p> <p>  The second amendment to the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts deals with one specific area of VHI&rsquo;s business activities.  The amendment will permit VHI to sell international healthcare plans directly, not only as an agent as it is allowed to do currently, and it will remove the requirement for VHI to seek ministerial approval before selling these plans.  This development is consistent with VHI&rsquo;s current status as an insurer authorised by the Central Bank.  VHI is competing in a highly competitive and regulated marketplace and this amendment will remove the impediment to VHI&rsquo;s ability to compete with its competitors and thereby allow VHI to avail of potentially significant business opportunities. </p> <p>  The Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is long established and well supported Government policy for the health insurance market, and the amendments to the legislation governing the Health Insurance Authority and VHI are to allow these organisations to plan for future developments in this ever-changing and complex environment.</p> <p>  I commend this Bill to members.</p></speech>

The risk equalisation levy is a regressive levy if one assumes that higher-income households buy more expensive healthcare and lower income households, where they can afford it, buy less expensive health insurance policies.  Risk equalisation divides into two different types of policies, namely, advanced and non-advanced, and it applies a flat rate to them.  It applies a levy of &euro;444 to the advanced policies and &euro;170 to the non-advanced policies.  The advanced policies range in price from about &euro;800 to over &euro;5,000, whereas the non-advanced tend to be between &euro;400 and &euro;800.  Therefore the levy seeks a higher percentage from those with cheaper policies.  The difference with the premium, platinum-plated policies has very little to do with clinical care in the hospital but is more how fancy the room is and the trappings.  If my understanding of the levy is correct, we are essentially subsidising fancy rooms for higher-income families.  One way we could change this levy would be to apply it as a percentage of the price of a policy.  As part of the deliberations for the Bill this year, was there any discussion on changing the levy from what is broadly accepted as a regressive measure into either a neutral or potentially progressive one?</p></speech>

I am standing in for the Minister, Deputy Harris, who is busy in the Upper House.</p> <p>  Currently, older people tend to buy more expensive policies.

One of the frustrations felt by some in the industry is that, in their view, the VHI holds unusually high reserves, which means it passes the overcompensation test.  That is relevant to the levy.  The belief is that it meets the criterion of keeping profits below 4% by moving an unusually high level of those profits into reserves.  I believe that, given the history of insurance companies going into liquidation here, the more reserves companies have the better and I do not suggest the VHI should have lower reserves.  However, it is relevant to the legislation because, by holding reserves which are significantly above the Solvency II levels, the VHI can manage its profit margin down and this has an impact on the rest of the industry.  Can the Minister tell me if any of this was considered in the context of the Bill for this year?</p></speech>

It will be done next year by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA.  That deals with that issue.</p></speech>

At 80%, they are above the Solvency II requirements.  What is the Cabinet's view on that?  Is it content with the high reserves the company has and the impact this could have on the insurance industry?</p></speech>

However, the VHI is an independent commercial company and, as far as I am aware, it is in the process of lowering its reserves.</p></speech>

We have approximately 300 health insurance policies in the market.  I know the Central Bank is pushing for simplicity and my understanding is that the number has come down from about 400.  I am sure we can all agree that it is pretty much impossible for anyone to find the right health insurance policy.  There are many reasons for this but one of the main ones is the massive and bewildering complexity involved.  Did the Minister, the Department or any part of the State use this legislation as leverage to engage with the industry with a view to seriously driving down complexity in order that consumers can understand what the best package is for them and their families?</p></speech>
