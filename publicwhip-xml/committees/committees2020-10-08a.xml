At the outset, it was envisaged that NAMA would have a life of around ten years, and would therefore be winding up in 2020.  However, a Department of Finance review published in July 2019 recommended that NAMA continue to work out its residual loans for a limited period beyond 2021.  It further recommended that, before the end of 2021, NAMA would submit to the Minister proposals and a plan for the dissolution of the agency.</p> <p>  Because NAMA&rsquo;s primary purpose is to dispose of the loans it acquired on the best achievable terms, it is more meaningful to consider its cumulative performance, rather than make year-to-year comparisons.  </p> <p>  Members have been provided with a graph that shows how NAMA&rsquo;s profit level has been tailing off.  It had accumulated reserves totalling &euro;4.5 billion by end 2019.  At that date, it was projecting delivery of a final surplus of &euro;4 billion when it winds up.        </p> <p>  The other key aspect of NAMA&rsquo;s financial performance is the ongoing reduction in its holdings of loan assets, and associated borrowing.  At the outset, NAMA acquired property-related loans with a par value of &euro;74.4 billion for an outlay of &euro;31.8 billion.  This was funded through the creation of &euro;31.8 billion in debt.  Both the level of loans outstanding, and the outstanding borrowing, had reduced considerably by the end of 2019, as reflected in the agency&rsquo;s statement of financial position.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the special report on NAMA's management and disposal of the Project Nantes loans.  In autumn 2018, concerns were raised with the previous committee and directly with my office about the sale by NAMA in 2012 of a portfolio of loans to a Luxembourg-based company.  The disposal, referred to by NAMA under the codename Project Nantes, was one of its first loan portfolio sales.  The loans included in the sale were mainly of two types.  There was a large number of high-risk equity-backed loans, which had no property collateral, and which NAMA acquired from the participating banks for a nominal payment of &euro;1 per loan.  Most of the other loans were property-backed, related to properties predominantly located in other European states or the US, with only about a quarter related to properties in Ireland.  </p> <p>  The concerns raised about the Project Nantes loan sale included questions around the adequacy of the sales process, the price achieved for the portfolio, and the legality of aspects of the sale.  There was an exchange of correspondence between the committee and NAMA, which we have reproduced in an appendix to the report.  Despite the explanations provided by NAMA, I felt that the matter required further inquiry, and my office therefore undertook a value for money examination of the sale. </p> <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s general strategy to manage its loans was to organise them by reference to debtor connections, that is, grouping of loans connected through a common debtor, or common group of debtors.  What became the Project Nantes portfolio was part of the larger Avestus portfolio, which in turn was part of the Quinlan and Quinlan Partnership debtor connection. </p> <p>  In its response to the committee&rsquo;s inquiries, NAMA emphasised the outturn it had achieved on the Avestus portfolio.  NAMA&rsquo;s total outlay on the Avestus portfolio was &euro;136.3 million.  Between 2011 and 2013, it realised a total of &euro;204.1 million from the loans, thus yielding an overall cash surplus of &euro;67.8 million on the portfolio.  NAMA has stated that it is strongly of the view that that surplus was the best commercial outcome achievable for the Avestus portfolio at that time. </p> <p>  In fact, the Avestus portfolio of loans was disposed of in eight transactions, rather than in one single portfolio sale, so it is relevant to consider also the outcome on each transaction.  As figure 3 in the report summary indicates, two of the transactions, related to large office developments in London, resulted in very substantial gains for NAMA, while five resulted in modest gains.  In contrast, Project Nantes resulted in a sizeable loss for NAMA.</p> <p>  Contrary to a code of practice for NAMA&rsquo;s disposal of bank assets approved by the Minister for Finance in 2010, NAMA did not seek current independent valuations of the Project Nantes loans or of underlying property collateral.  Furthermore, NAMA did not pursue a competitive sales process.  Instead, it negotiated exclusively with one potential purchaser of the loans called Clairvue, which was introduced to the process by Avestus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.10" nospeaker="true" time="11:30:00" ><p>In July 2011, the NAMA board approved a repayment target for the Avestus loans, but there were errors and inconsistencies in how NAMA arrived at the target.  Correcting for these errors and inconsistencies, the repayment target would have been significantly higher.  NAMA told Avestus what the approved target amount was.  It then went on to agree adjustments to the target with Avestus as the various transactions progressed.  As a result, Avestus knew the residual amount NAMA needed to raise through the Project Nantes loan sale in order to achieve its repayment target.  The Clairvue offer was very close to that amount.</p><p>Where a competitively-based market price for the Project Nantes loans could have been struck cannot now be known.  However, without the assurance of a contemporaneous asset valuation and a competitive sales process, I believe there is no basis to conclude that NAMA achieved the best possible financial outturn from the Project Nantes loan sale.</p><p>The requirements of section 172(3) of the NAMA Act 2009 prohibits NAMA from selling a loan collateral property to a debtor or an associated debtor who is in default in relation to any NAMA loan.  However, this legal prohibition is limited and does not apply to the sale by NAMA of a loan or portfolio of loans.  Since Project Nantes involved a loan sale there is no reason to believe that there was any infringement of section 172 of the NAMA Act.</p><p>Despite the statutory limitations, NAMA put in place arrangements that required those purchasing loans to make a declaration confirming that the purchaser was not connected to the debtor whose loans it was purchasing.  Clairvue and the debtors each made the declarations required by NAMA in relation to the Project Nantes sale.  In addition, Clairvue disclosed to NAMA in advance the nature of the fee and performance-related compensation arrangements Avestus had with Clairvue, including arrangements for a number of the debtors to redeem personal loans at a future date.</p></speech>

Before we get to questions I call on Mr. McDonagh to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020100800002#B00300"><p>The committee has invited us to discuss NAMA's 2019 financial statements and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on Project Nantes.  I am joined by Mr. Aidan Williams, the NAMA chairman, Mr. Jamie Bourke, our head of strategy and communications, and Ms Noelle Condon, our chief financial officer.</p> <p>  Last year, 2019, was another successful year for NAMA.  We reported a profit of &euro;265 million and continued to make material progress on all of our objectives.  Coupled with our 2018 results, in the past two years alone NAMA has generated profits in excess of &euro;1 billion.  We generated more than &euro;1.3 billion in cash during the year, exceeding our deleveraging targets.  This and further cash generation during 2020 brings cumulative cash generated by NAMA since inception to &euro;45.7 billion. </p> <p>  As a result of a programme of efficient and focused deleveraging over the past ten years, our loan portfolio is now 97% reduced from its &euro;32 billion acquisition cost.  Our deleveraged position means that NAMA is far less vulnerable to potential falls in asset values than it would have been just a few short years ago.  However, NAMA is not immune to the effects of the economic crisis created by Covid-19.  The impact of Covid-19 can already be seen in our financials for the first quarter of 2020, where we reported a loss of &euro;49 million.  The widespread and unexpected market disruption caused the NAMA board to make a management judgment on the possible reduction in value of our residual assets.  Thankfully, some parts of our portfolio have performed better than expected since the end of the first quarter and we are reporting improved results for the second quarter.  The disruption continues to impede the completion of some of our activities and delay planned debtor exits and asset sales.  Accordingly, it is increasingly likely that NAMA may be left with a larger residual portfolio by the end of 2021 than the &euro;300 million previously envisaged.</p> <p>  I now turn to the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on Project Nantes.  I would like to make the committee aware of our statutory confidentiality obligations under sections 99 and 202 of the NAMA Act, as well as the confidentiality clause in the loan sale.   These clauses effectively preclude us from discussing or disclosing specific information regarding debtors, their loans or transactions.  However, in this context, and in consideration of the published report which does contain a great deal of information, I will endeavour to be as comprehensive as possible in my remarks.</p> <p>  Following our last appearance before the committee, we engaged in extensive correspondence with it regarding the Project Nantes loan sale.  The queries originated in part because of an allegation that the loan sale was not compliant with section 172 of the NAMA Act.  This allegation has been found to be incorrect.</p> <p>  As regards the other findings in the report, from our perspective there are a number of fundamental points to be made.  The Nantes loan sale cannot be viewed in isolation.  It must be viewed in the context of the global connection exit strategy.  We achieved profits of &euro;78 million on six out of the seven connection loan bundles, as evidenced by the graph on page 12 of the special report, but made a &euro;10 million loss on Nantes, resulting in an overall profit for the taxpayer of &euro;68 million.</p> <p>  A consensual loan sale ensured the achievement of the global exit target in the most efficient manner.  It is NAMA's experience that in certain circumstances higher returns can be achieved from the targeted sale of assets to credible specialist buyers.  That is to say, open marketing does not always result in the best possible outcome.</p> <p>  As regards NAMA not seeking up to date valuations, the loans were independently valued in 2009 prior to acquisition by NAMA and reassessed in an independent business review, IBR, by a large accounting firm in 2011.  These earlier valuations were arguably overstatements by the time the loan sale was completed in January 2012 as Irish asset values continued to decline by approximately 30% from late 2009.  We did, however, have up-to-date appraisals of valuation on the assets.</p> <p>  We fully accept and regret that there was a miscalculation on the part of NAMA in setting the &euro;125.5 million target, as certain loans were inadvertently misclassified in the IBR report.  This transaction occurred early in NAMA's life cycle when we had no central IT systems and relied on multiple spreadsheets with volumes of data.  Since then, our internal controls and IT systems have evolved and improved and are significantly more robust as well as being subject to rigorous control testing by our auditors.  Nonetheless, we are of the strong view that the miscalculation of the target did not affect the outcome from the portfolio.  The gross proceeds achieved of &euro;210 million exceeded the restated target of &euro;151.8 million by &euro;58 million.  This was a notable return in a very depressed market.  Irish Government bond yields were close to 18% and Ireland was in the middle of a Troika bailout.  Equally, it is acknowledged in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that had NAMA set a higher repayment target for the Project Nantes loans there was no guarantee that a sale could have been concluded at that higher price.</p> <p>  All commercial transactions carry risk.  If NAMA withheld the sale of every asset because it may subsequently increase in value, we would never have disposed of a single asset.  We make considered decisions based on our section 10 mandate, the information available at the time and the expertise and experience of our staff.</p> <p>  We still have much work to do in order to maximise the value of our residual portfolio.  However, in a very real sense, we have already achieved the primary statutory mandate set out for NAMA when it was established.  We have fully repaid the &euro;32 billion in debt issued to acquire loans.  Importantly, we repaid the Government guaranteed portion three years ahead of schedule in 2017.  This not only removed a contingent liability for the State but significantly aided Irish banks in returning to the financial markets.  We have deleveraged 97% of our acquired portfolio and made a substantial and tangible economic and social contribution through our residential funding programme, which has delivered more than 17,000 units to date, our docklands strategic development zone programme, which is 75% complete, and our social housing programme, which has provided more than 2,600 homes to date.</p> <p>  Most remarkably, in my opinion, this year we accomplished a goal that was simply not considered possible when NAMA was first established.  We delivered a sizeable surplus payment of &euro;2 billion to the Exchequer in June of this year.  Our surplus will provide the Exchequer with valuable resources that the Government may use to alleviate some of the immense pressures currently being experienced throughout our society and the economy.  Further transfers totalling &euro;2 billion are anticipated over the next two years.</p> <p>  Our progress in the achievement of our objectives demonstrates that our decisions have overwhelmingly been the correct ones.  We all can see the effects of Covid-19 in causing lower valuations of assets and we are fortunate most of the portfolio was disposed by the end of 2019.  We have the capability to effectively address any challenges that may arise from dealing with our residual portfolio and we remain reasonably confident we can preserve the &euro;4 billion surplus.</p></speech>

I was involved in the NAMA debates when the legislation was before the Seanad.  As I have said, I envisaged that there would probably be a second or third NAMA Bill and, with the benefit of hindsight, there probably should have been.  On a macro level, Mr. McDonagh and the former chairman, Mr. Daly, deserve great credit for achieving what they set out to do.  The failing was in the legislation and in the fact that there was not a second or third NAMA Bill as matters became clearer.  The failings we see are probably on the ethical rather than the statutory side at this stage, such as the lack of a social dividend and, arguably, the focus on supporting the construction industry to the extent it did.  No doubt, books will be written on all these matters in the future but, on a macro level, our guests deserve great credit.  I am sure it was an extremely busy but fast decade for them.  I hope Mr. Daly is doing well and wish Mr. Williams well in his role.</p> <p>  Would our guests accept, looking back, that mistakes were made with regard to Project Nantes?</p></speech>

There were two loans we had acquired from the banks for &euro;18 million.  When that information was relayed to the independent business reviewer, it was not stated that we had paid &euro;18 million for them.  The independent business reviewer assumed they had been acquired for zero, because it thought they were equity loans as opposed to first charge loans.  It put them in at a value of &euro;2 million rather than &euro;18 million, so that was a difference of &euro;16 million.</p> <p>  As for the personal loans of &euro;9.7 million, we always knew we had acquired them for &euro;9.7 million.  If &euro;16 million is added to &euro;9.7 million, it is close to the &euro;26 million adjustment before the 15%.</p></speech>

Under the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, code, valuations have to be performed by qualified valuers.  The code of practice required an appraisal, and appraisals can be done by people who are not qualified valuers.  That is a distinction under the SCSI code.  We believed that although the November 2009 valuations were dated 30 November 2009, they were effectively done in late 2010 because there were references back to 30 November 2009 . They were provided to the independent business reviewer, which did an assessment of those cashflows as part of its work.  We relied on those as meeting the criteria for being appraisals as opposed to valuations.  We all knew that because of the stress that was on the markets globally at that stage, asset values were effectively falling.  The Deputy will recall that in 2011, very much like today, the whole eurozone was crisis-----</p></speech>

The SCSI is very perfectionist about its profession and says valuations have to be done by qualified valuers.  The code of practice, however, states that appraisals can be done by people other than qualified property valuers.  They can be people who have knowledge of the situation.  We believed that the independent business reviewer had knowledge of the assets he was reviewing as part of the property plan.  We also had people internally who were very seasoned property professions, who had the view that the information going forward was representative of what the assets were worth.</p></speech>

This was declared in the previous term of the Committee of Public Accounts, that I had worked as an auctioneer and, on one occasion, had been handling a receivership file for individual private homes.  If someone was selling a three-bedroom semi-detached property at that stage, by NAMA's insistence there would have to be an up-to-date valuation.  It might have been less than &euro;100,000 at the time for certain properties, particularly in rural Ireland, yet when the properties were in the tens of millions of euro, the desktop appraisal was acceptable.  Does Mr. McDonagh accept that there was a very thorough and robust micromanagement of individual property sales of relatively low value, but that when it came to the big stuff, we were not applying the same level of oversight.</p></speech>

In fairness, one tries, at the time, to take a decision.  We had business plans from 800 debtors.  We had to review those business plans and make an assessment of what we thought the assets were worth when we were putting it forward to, in this instance, the credit committee of the board.  If a property was being prepared for sale, we would accept that whoever was selling the property would give us an assessment of value for the asset.  If it then went on the market, the market would determine what it was worth.</p></speech>

When we got to the sale of Project Nantes, the Avestus portfolio had already performed well because there had been two large and very profitable disposals and others that broke even.  Then we came to Project Nantes, where we were sort of in clover, for want of a better expression, compared with the recovery targets that were set.  Is there any sense of complacency here, where due process was overlooked because, to get out alive, it was decided just to take the first person who came and to waive the need for competitive tension and the normal processes that would apply, on the basis that the overall target for Avestus and the recovery would be met and, therefore, anything would do?</p></speech>

I am saying that, in the context of this and, similarly, of Project Eagle, it is a matter of fact that valuations were not done, that competitive tension was not sought in the normal way and that mistakes were made in aspects of the valuation.  My question, in effect, is whether this was looked at in isolation and decided that, as one of the 800 business plans that would perform, there was no need to worry about the kind of detail that would be applied to others.</p></speech>

It was highlighted in the business plan, which was reviewed and sent to the board by the independent business reviewer and to my internal team at the time, that there was a real risk that if the third-party creditors moved against these people, the whole business would collapse and go into liquidation, and we would have lost the asset-management platform of Avestus to manage these assets, which were in multiple jurisdictions and were quite complex in their financial structuring, which they fully understood.  Their help was needed to unwind - let us put it that way.  We always share that concern.</p> <p>  To be clear with the committee, all the debtors in NAMA have made efforts to get out of it.  That is just the nature of the business and it is very understandable.  Avestus was trying to find people to back it and to get its loans out of NAMA.  Another major US real estate fund had expressed interest before Clairevue and backed out, and then Clairevue came along and made an offer.</p><p>It also wanted to make an offer wherein we would give it indemnities and underwrite its due diligence costs, both of which we refused to do.  Even in January 2012, when we decided to proceed with the offer to Clairevue, we knew these concerns were still there and that these debtors were very vulnerable to third-party actions.  At the same time, in January 2012, we decided that we would not sell the discrete asset in Paddington as we would be better of continuing to fund it and finishing it.  As a result of that decision, we turned it from a &euro;75 million valuation to &euro;104 million.  We were constantly evolving our strategy to make sure we could get the maximum out of the connection but at the same time the vulnerabilities attached to these debtors always existed and it was a real risk to us in terms of management.</p></speech>

It was quite a thorough report which made for a shocking read.  I refer to the litany of mistakes, the oversights, the lack of transparency around record-keeping and the lack of adherence to guidelines and best practice.  This morning's statement from NAMA disputes much of what was identified in the report as poor practice.  That is quite astonishing.  Is Mr. McDonagh seriously suggesting that because a profit was made overall on the Avestus loan bundles that the glaring errors made in Project Nantes are therefore irrelevant?  Making a mess of one thing is not cancelled out because NAMA did not make a mess of everything.  Does Mr. McDonagh accept that?</p></speech>

If the Avestus connection was able to write the cheque and give us &euro;125 million, that would have been a complete loss to the taxpayer but the important thing to remember here is that we did not achieve &euro;125 million or &euro;152 million, but &euro;210 million overall.  I cannot say that I or anyone else in NAMA is infallible, that we do not make mistakes or that we are not humans.  We did not want to make the mistake.  The mistake was made, we apologised for it, we regret it and I wish it did not happen but it did.  What more can I say other than that I wish it did not happen?</p></speech>

I think NAMA has done a very good job in recent years in difficult circumstances.  Its return to the Exchequer of the sums that are there is very welcome, particularly now.  I recognise it is a commercial enterprise operating in a commercial environment, which is extremely difficult.  It needs to make commercial judgment calls, not always with the benefit of perfect information that we all might like.</p> <p>  I also recognise that NAMA has a significant level of oversight with the Comptroller and Auditor General and this committee in public forum.  That is a pressure on a commercial enterprise that other commercial enterprises do not have.  I recognise and acknowledge all that.  It is clear that Mr. McDonagh is here to talk about a mistake that has been made.  He has acknowledged that, and I accept that.  On the other hand, I have some detailed questions on it.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the part of the report dealing with the level if disagreement with and contesting of the Comptroller and Auditor General's findings and the engagement on that.  I note that over the last two years NAMA has derogations for legal services of over &euro;11 million.  It is important that NAMA is equipped with appropriate legal commercial expertise given the commercial entities it is engaging with.  However, I have a concern where that expertise is being used against other entities of the State.

The infrastructure cost alone before one can build a house is something between &euro;25 million and &euro;30 million.  One has to put that in before one can actually build anything on it.  Given our timeframe, it is probably not going to be viable for us to put that level of money in before we can start construction.  Over time, while that might be built out - that might be an excellent site in an excellent location - it will be long past NAMA's lifespan.  These are sometimes the difficult decisions that we have to make.</p> <p>  Another site has an issue where effectively the National Roads Authority has to put in a spine road before that.  It does not have the funding to do it.  We have another site in Wicklow where one of our clients has built a lot of houses and wants to continue building houses, but unfortunately Irish Water needs to improve the whole water infrastructure.  The cost of that infrastructure is, I believe, between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million because it is going to serve the whole area and Irish Water does not have the funding to do it.  The client wants to build 200 houses extra.  Irish Water says it does not have capacity for it.  The client has got permission to build 25 more houses because that is the maximum Irish Water can connect to the network.  The site has planning permission but third parties outside our control, like the National Roads Authority and Irish Water, have other issues which are preventing that.  We are funding any site which is commercially viable because it makes sense for us to do that; we make money.  It also provides housing.  No matter what NAMA can do, we cannot do Irish Water's job and we cannot do the National Roads Authority's job.</p></speech>

They also had to tell us what borrowings they had with third-party banks.</p><p>In fairness to the debtors, with regard to any cash resources they had when they came under NAMA, we said they would have to pay the interest on NAMA's loans.  The third-party banks were not happy about this and were asking why their loans were not being serviced.  This still goes on today but it was particularly prevalent in 2010 and 2011 when all banks were distressed and everybody was trying to grab whatever assets they could.  They were threatening to appoint receivers, liquidate assets or take judgment actions.</p></speech>

I noticed something in Mr. McDonagh's statement that always grates with me, as I have said on several occasions.  I refer to the word "profit".  I appreciate that NAMA ended up with portfolios on which there had been great discounts.  I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General said the outlay was &euro;74.4 billion and that NAMA received the assets for &euro;31.8 billion.  I would say we are talking about a "surplus" rather than a "profit" given that the public took a hit of &euro;40 billion.  That is important to note.</p> <p>  The par value for the assets relating to Project Nantes was somewhere in the region of &euro;306 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

NAMA hoped to get &euro;46.2 million.  We have heard that there were errors and Mr. McDonagh has accepted this.  The public took a great hit and NAMA was set up and given a job to do, which was to get as much as it possibly could for the assets.  Its terms of reference stated that it was to achieve the best possible amount.  Why then would it not have insisted on a competitive process in every instance?</p></speech>

It does not say that we have to openly market such sales.  We set a target for the connection but this target was not achieved.  The portfolio was sold off in parts and this was the residual connection.  As I told Deputy MacSharry, Clareview was one of the first funds to come and look at this portfolio.  Another US fund looked at the portfolio and declined to buy it.  Clareview made an offer and we had to decide whether to accept that offer or to negotiate with Clareview.  We negotiated a sale of the portfolio with it.  There was nothing inconsistent with the code in doing so.</p></speech>

There may well have been a desktop exercise carried out after that.  Mr. McDonagh might confirm whether there was.  There was no competitive process and Clareview knew that there was no other bidder.  Did NAMA not just throw in the towel in attesting that there was no more to be achieved from this?</p></speech>

We still had the same issue, which was that, in buying this loan portfolio from NAMA,  Clareview had the same issue as NAMA had.  It had to take the view that it could manage this connection even if those involved were enforced against by third parties and made bankrupt.  These specialist funds probably have more specialist expertise in managing complex infrastructures in multiple jurisdictions.  We had to make an assessment.  This was a business assessment based on the best information we had at the time and it suggested that this was a good offer.</p></speech>

The Deputy must recognise something.  She talked about November 2009 but the valuations were actually done in 2010 by reference to 30 November 2009 because that was the set valuation date.  The difference is that between November 2009 and 2011 and the start of 2012 the Irish market was falling dramatically.  Commercial property prices had fallen by 30%.  We looked at this by getting a valuation in 2019 - for somebody to go back to value them at the time we sold them and they said the &euro;10 million would only have been a &euro;3.5 million loss because there would have been a &euro;6.5 million reduction in the Irish assets between November 2009 and the time we sold them.  With assets we sold, I wish I could say we made a profit on every asset in our portfolio but we did not.  One must make a decision at the time and one must live with it, in terms of making sure one did what one thought was the best outcome at the time.</p></speech>

The previous three years we did 2,500 units.  What is happening is that a number of our debtors, because of the improvement in the market in the past number of years, have been able to pay off their debts and leave NAMA.  Some of these are big house builders and, fair dues to them, they have paid off all their debts to the taxpayer and then moved on.  That, therefore, reduces our capacity in terms of the number of builders we have in NAMA and building units.  We have tried to deliver the maximum we can.  This year we would definitely have delivered 1,500 units.  However, because of the lockdown and Covid and the restrictions in terms of people working internally. Before one could have a plumber, an electrician and a tiler working in a house at the same time, but they must now work discretely because of the necessary Covid restrictions.  Hence the 750.  As such we have had to push the target out to 2021 and we will get to the 20,000.</p></speech>

Then we have a situation where, on the valuation NAMA had placed on the file and very conveniently with the Project Nantes portfolio, Clairvue offers, through a non-competitive process, essentially the gap NAMA needed to fill.  A gap that Avestus was aware of and that this director, who happened to also be a director of the company that made the bid, was aware of.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Thus there was a situation where a company that had an interest in purchasing this portfolio had, as a director, someone who was aware that NAMA had a target price to achieve and that company, very conveniently, valued that portfolio at almost the exact amount NAMA needed to secure.</p></speech>

When they are given a target to meet they know exactly what is needed to meet the debtors.  Again, just to be fair to Avestus, as it is a requirement, that person became a director of Clairvue in, I think, December 2011.  Clairvue made the first offers to us in October 2011, before that person was a director.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has suggested that the overall portfolio was undervalued to the tune of &euro;29 million.  There has been a suggestion that on the Nantes project a loss was incurred by the taxpayers in Ireland of &euro;10 million.  Mr. McDonagh is suggesting that it has only been &euro;3.5 million.  All of these things are possible but what I do not understand is the answer to his first question which is that he accepts and contends that this was actually a success for the agencies and for the Irish taxpayer.  Whatever about laws being broken, bad practices were clearly employed.  My fear is that NAMA is not as angry as hell about the fact that it has been played.  A guy who was operating for a company that it employed was also a director of a company for somebody who is purchasing the portfolio that was for sale through a non-competitive process.

I am angry and I was very unhappy at the fact that they were not upfront with us and told us that one of their colleagues was not a NAMA debtor, and to to pick up this point, was being asked by Clairvue to become a director of this Luxembourg entity which bought the portfolio.

In 2018 it was &euro;8.6 million.  The derogations for legal services were &euro;3.9 million and in 2018 it was &euro;7.4 million.  For the benefit of the committee, can Mr. McDonagh outline the steps involved in the derogation process and what the values for thresholds are for derogations that require to be approved by the NAMA board?  Can he also explain the reason where a service provider had prior and existing knowledge of the debtor and outline what this refers to, please?</p></speech>

In overall terms, every procurement policy is in complete compliance with the code of practice issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We allow derogations but these derogations are provided in the context that they do not break European laws, which is a golden rule.  The board must approve any derogations which are above &euro;200,000, which is the EU threshold.  Most of our derogations arise in two particular areas.</p> <p>  One is on legal services, primarily litigation, where such litigation is taken against us and we have no choice but to defend it.  If we have a firm working on a case for a number of years, sometimes in foreign jurisdictions, and there is then suddenly another strand of litigation, it does not make sense to use another firm and we would continue to use that firm.  The foreign litigation that we have been involved in has been very expensive. </p> <p>  The other area in which many derogations arise concerns mainly information technology systems where we had spent a great amount of money building a specific IT system for NAMA to suit our business because when we started this agency in 2010 there was no business like NAMA.  Sometimes, if we wish to try to do something else and add additional controls, we have to pay for those additional services to enhance systems and controls.</p></speech>

This is a substantial amount of money for non-competitive procurement.</p></speech>

Much of this litigation took place in the US which is very expensive.</p></speech>

Sometimes we have litigation taken against us by parties who repeatedly appeal the decisions, even in Ireland, up to the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and even in some cases, to the Supreme Court.

Thankfully, some of those properties had income in rents coming from them.  Non-disposable income is made up mainly of rents or debt settlements with people where additional unencumbered assets and things like that are being handed over.  The majority of this money relates to rents which we received from assets we collected over the years before we sold them.</p></speech>

I am a bit like Deputy Carthy and am trying to get to grips with all of this.  I have a question but I will check that I have it right before I ask it.

Clairvue offered almost exactly that, which we now know was probably less than it was worth.  In some of the submissions today I am reading that Clairvue paid Avestus a fee in performance-related compensation.  What does that relate to?</p></speech>

As I said at the start, these assets were involved in very complex financial structures in the way they were set up.  Clairvue took the view that it needed people in Avestus to help it to unwind the assets as they were sold over time and it paid Avestus an asset management fee to help it to realise these assets over time.  Avestus was not going to benefit from any profit but it is going to get an asset management fee on the back of managing the assets.</p></speech>

They have been approaching banks, private equity funds and wealthy investors to tell them that their loans are in NAMA and asking them to refinance those loans out of NAMA, at which point they would help the bank, private equity fund or investor to manage those loans afterwards.  That is the real world and that is what happens.  The reality is that whoever puts their money up, these guys are tough as nails and they will not give any of their profits away to the former debtors.  They might pay them a fee to help manage the asset, depending on the complexity of the situation and if they needed them.  In most cases, they do not pay a fee.  They just throw the debtor aside and manage the asset themselves.</p></speech>

Given that our bondholders are repaid and considering NAMA's projections of a &euro;49 million financial loss in 2020, is it still the plan to wind down and dispose of assets on the existing timeline?  If so, why?  Would it be more prudent for the State to hold on to some of these assets and realise the more annualised yield?</p></speech>

We believe some of this land will become quite valuable before 2025 because of planned infrastructural works by the State.  To give the Deputy an example, we have a lot of land banks in north Dublin.  If the planned MetroLink went ahead, whatever the case is, that would open this land bank.</p></speech>

Pre-Covid-19, there were plans for work to start on MetroLink and once we start opening up and approving access to lands, as everybody would know, it effectively becomes more valuable in terms of people getting planning permission for housing, commercial buildings or whatever the case is.  This turns the land from having agricultural value into having commercial value.  For argument's sake-----</p></speech>

It analysed NAMA versus the Sociedad de Gesti&oacute;n de Activos Procedentes de la Reestructuraci&oacute;n Bancaria, SAREB, in Spain and the German bad bank.  Moody's said that NAMA has been by far the biggest success of those three comparable bodies that were set up in the same time.  Even the troubled asset relief programme, TARP, in the US, which was set up in late 2008, has had a performance of somewhere around 1%, although it has been a few years since I have seen its figures.  Even on the measures that were set up by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the section 226 report, our performance has been up around 7%.  We are farther ahead and our costs are a lot less than the comparable bodies in Germany and Spain.</p></speech>

What are the current numbers of staff in contracted employment with NAMA?  What is the gender balance of that?  What percentage of senior managers are female in the organisation?</p></speech>

Some 19 of these were made redundant, sharing &euro;1.01 million in redundancy payments.  In light of NAMA's wind-down, how many redundancies is it expecting in 2020 and what strategies is it using to retain staff?</p></speech>

In fact, our voluntary redundancy programme just closed this week.  We offered 33 redundancies and we only had 20 who applied for and accepted them.  We have a number of people on contract, so that will hopefully make up a lot of difference.  That is not surprising in the Covid-19 environment.  This time last year, people wanted to leave because there were plenty of jobs in the economy but it has become different in the last six months, which is understandable.  To answer the Deputy's question, everybody in NAMA will be made redundant by 2025.  That is the trajectory we are on, while at the same time we hope to return at least &euro;4 billion to the Exchequer.  That is what it is about.  It was never an organisation for the long term.</p></speech>

The committee said that people were leaving NAMA and jumping straight into the private sector and that it was not good that they were bringing their knowledge from NAMA straight over to the other side of the table.  The NTMA is the employer, not NAMA.  It introduced garden leave provisions so that when anybody leaves NAMA, they have cold storage periods before they can start working anywhere else.  Garden leave provisions are typically three months' contractual leave but if somebody says they have been offered a job somewhere that is unrelated to NAMA, we might reduce that to two months.  That is just a way of ensuring somebody does not leave NAMA and go straight into somebody across the table.</p></speech>

This relates to Project Nantes, which NAMA acquired from participating banks for a nominal amount of &euro;1 per loan.  Most other loans were property backed and related to properties in the US and across Europe.  With regard to that portfolio, I understand Project Nantes was one of the first portfolios the witness dealt with under NAMA.  From his earlier comments and the question regarding an individual who was involved both on the negotiating side and ultimately in one of the purchasing entities, I believe he said that the amount was mooted around October 2011 but he did not start until, perhaps, November or the like.</p></speech>

In fact, in January 2012 there was one equity loan which was attached to the Paddington asset, that was including Clairvue, and we took it out.  There was an adjustment in the price to reflect that.  It was the best outcome for NAMA because we made &euro;1.1 million more than what Clairvue was prepared to pay for it by holding onto it.</p></speech>

It made a conditional offer to us of around &euro;29 million on the basis that we would indemnify it against anything that would be wrong with the assets, which we could not do, and that we would pay its due diligence costs of &euro;250,000.  We said we were not doing that and we would not do a deal with it on that basis.  We negotiated those two things away, the indemnity and the &euro;250,000.  In January 2012, we became aware that there were developments in the Paddington asset which were going to increase its value and we decided to retain the Paddington asset.  We had the loan over the asset itself, a 50% loan, but we also had the equity piece which the debtors had borrowed to put the equity into the Paddington asset.  We took that loan out of Clairvue and there was an adjustment to the price from around &euro;29 million down to &euro;26.7 million.  With that adjustment of &euro;2.5 million or &euro;2.6 million we ended up getting &euro;1.1 million more subsequently on the back of taking it out of the loan.</p></speech>

We want to see the full value realised on behalf of the taxpayer.</p> <p>  I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  His report states that "without the assurance of a contemporaneous asset valuation and a competitive sales process, I believe there is no basis to conclude that NAMA achieved the best possible financial outturn from the Project Nantes loan sale".  What was missing in his investigations that means he cannot make a full definitive evaluation in terms of any impropriety, if one can call it that?  His report also states: "Since Project Nantes involved a loan sale there is no reason to believe that there was any infringement of section 172 of the NAMA Act".  How did he come to that conclusion?</p></speech>

My sense is that there could have more available, but I could not put a figure on it.</p></speech>

It was originally envisaged that NAMA would be disposing mainly of property.  It did not envisage, and put the same restriction in respect of, the disposal of a portfolio of loans.

NAMA informed Avestus of the &euro;125.5 million repayment target it aimed to achieve, and Avestus was given six months to meet that target.  Despite the importance of that exchange, NAMA, as far as we can ascertain, did not document that communication process or put the proposal in writing to Avestus.  As the chairman of the board, did you find it unusual that the offer made to Avestus was not properly documented or put in writing?  Was that common practice within the organisation, particularly with a multimillion deal such as this?  It was not documented and there were no minutes or any documents relating to that, as far as we can ascertain.</p></speech>

This is something that when it arises in practice always raises questions not just in respect of NAMA but also other bodies.  If one is bringing a car for which one paid &euro;4,000 to a car auction, and the first person one meets inside the gate offers &euro;4,000 and one decides to take it and go home, it would not be good practice, particularly if there were potentially other buyers.  Has the board ever discussed loans being offered exclusively to one body such as this?  Why were the loans not advertised in the normal fashion?  I heard the CEO's answer on that, but would it not have been better that they were advertised, at least?  There were a number of months involved.  There was no independent valuation.  Would it not have been advisable to seek a valuation?</p></speech>

The valuation used by NAMA was a 2009 valuation.  Part of the portfolio related to Irish properties which we would all accept would have dropped from 2009 to 2011.  Those of us who were around at the time would have seen that happen.  The other part of the portfolio which was overseas, not in this State, increased in value, for example, the Paddington and Kensington properties.  Moving into 2012, those were exchanged for that 2009 valuation.  Why was no revaluation of the assets carried out prior to the sale in accordance with NAMA's loan sale policy?  I might put that to the CEO.</p></speech>

They were not assets in London, New York or some of the better places which had recovered.  If one thinks back to mid-August 2011 up until the end of 2011, the eurozone was in deep crisis.  There was talk at the time about the euro imploding.  Financial markets everywhere were dislocated and in distress.

At the time, NAMA was under immense pressure from the troika to generate cash to pay off &euro;7.5 billion of debt in order that Ireland could get out of the troika bailout.  We knew that it was highly likely that these debtors would be enforced against by third-party banks and creditors.  We had to make the decision at the time because we knew that we had to get money in and that these guys could fall over at any moment.  If they fell over, we would find it very difficult to realise value on those assets.</p></speech>

If I might give a practical example, an off-market offer for two houses in a good suburb in Dublin was recently made to us.  We were offered &euro;1.8 million to sell them off-market.  We said we would not sell them off-market, we put them on to the market, and we only realised &euro;1.5 million when we put them onto the market.  If we had accepted the off-market offer, we would have got &euro;1.8 million.  We said we could not because we live in a new world and we had to put them on to the market, and we got an offer of &euro;300,000 less in the final outcome.  That is why I said in my statement that putting properties on the market is not always the best outcome, but in the world we live in today, everything goes onto the market and has a valuation.  It is completely different from 2011.</p></speech>

That is why the board said it would extend farther than the legislation allowed and that we would seek the section 172 for sales by debtors or receivers or in respect of loan sales.  The board extended it even though it had no statutory basis.  Therefore, we started seeking the section 172 declarations anyway even though it was not particularly a legal requirement under the Act to deal with that.  The board recognised this in 2012.</p></speech>

There are two subsections to my question.  The reason we know or became aware of this was that a former Deputy, Mr. Mick Wallace, informed the House of that information.  Was NAMA aware of that before it was conveyed to the House or was that the first time Mr. McDonagh heard of it?</p> <p>  I hear what Mr. McDonagh is saying with regard to changed procedures over the past number of years and we welcome that.  I hear what Mr. McDonagh is saying when he says he hopes it will not happen again.  However, have NAMA's procedures and processes changed to a degree that at least there is an effort or a mechanism in place by which there is an attempt to identify whether people are working for, advising or facilitating purchasers of portfolios who might have some form of insider information?</p></speech>

The Deputy can say that.  I will not say that.  In terms of procedures and as a result of our previous appearance in front of the committee we have put a chief legal officer in place in NAMA.  We have started a process of going back through transactions to look at documentation around them and have done quite an involved exercise on the biggest asset sales that happened in NAMA, which is still ongoing.  There are check processes around this, going back and looking at things like this.  We are at the later stages of that and have not uncovered anything unusual or something like this.  I wish to give the committee that assurance.  It shows again that when the committee makes a suggestion to us we take it on board.  We try to do supplemental checks we are legally entitled to do.  That is the important thing.  We cannot do something or make allegations against people but we try to re-establish the facts and make sure they were what we were told at the time.</p></speech>

In terms of the lands and sites NAMA currently has to dispose of before 2025 or thereabouts and previous land it has sold, has NAMA kept the full planning permissions attached to those sites active or did it let them lapse?  If so, roughly how many are we talking about?  I would have hoped and expected that extensions to planning permissions would have been applied for to keep the value on the sites.   Finally, if we find there are breaches of section 172, will enforcement action and pursuit of those issues be taken?</p></speech>

Sometimes the issue has been that the planning granted is not commercially viable but that is another story.  If it does not cost much to extend the planning we will do it and we will work with the local authority on that basis.</p> <p>  In terms of section 172, if we find that anybody associated with NAMA did something we were not aware of at the time and people tell us or we find out ourselves and believe there is a breach of the law, we are absolutely obliged under the Criminal Justice Act to report it and we do report it.</p></speech>

They are two high-profile sites, namely, the Exo Building near the Point Village and Boland's Quay which has been pre-sold to Google.</p> <p>  We have minority interests in four other sites where we are in joint ventures with Oaktree and Kennedy Wilson.

We are trying to work with Waterways Ireland to sell our joint interest in that site together to maximise the value as all that money will come back to the taxpayer because Waterways Ireland and NAMA are State entities.  That is what we have left in the docklands.</p> <p>  Poolbeg SDZ was granted planning in April 2009.  We launched a competitive process in July 2019 and that process is still continuing.

I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as the interference from mobile phones affects the sound quality and transmission of the meeting.  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and Mr. Ronnie Downes and Mr. John Kinnane from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank them for coming in and making themselves available to meet the committee in advance of budget 2021.  This pre-budget session with the Minister is an opportunity for the committee to continue its pre-budget scrutiny and, in particular, to examine increased public spending for 2020 and how this will impact budget 2021.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members the meeting is limited to two hours due to the current Covid-19 guidelines.  This is to ensure the safety of the members, witnesses and secretariat staff.  We have agreed to speaking slots and times and I ask members to remain within these agreed times.  I remind members that other members are due to attend later and I ask members to vacate their seats at a reasonable time and use the wipes available to wipe the area, which will allow the next set of members to arrive and take a seat.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to meet in advance of budget 2021, which I will present to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann next Tuesday with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.</p> <p>  The economic and fiscal situation has changed dramatically in the past several months as the Covid-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the economy, public finances, and the lives of our citizens.  To respond to the crisis, Government has introduced a series of measures to support our key public services and to cushion the impact of the pandemic on households and enterprises.  The scale of the additional supports introduced is estimated at &euro;16 billion this year, which would bring gross Voted expenditure for the year to &euro;86.5 billion.  This represents an increase of more than &euro;19 billion, or 30%, on expenditure in 2019.</p> <p>  The impact on workers and businesses has been devastating.  From a position where at the start of the year we were at close to full employment, the Covid-adjusted measure of unemployment at the end of September stood at almost 15%.  To respond to this crisis, Government has allocated more than &euro;9 billion in additional funding to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, bringing total expenditure to more than &euro;30 billion, to provide in particular for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme.  As of last Monday, there are just over 200,000 people in receipt of the PUP and approximately 38,000 businesses have registered for the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  While the number of people in receipt of the PUP has significantly reduced since the peak of almost 600,000 in early May, these figures indicate the scale of the challenge still facing businesses and workers.  In this context, the extension of these schemes to the start of April next year announced in the July stimulus and the subsequent decision to reopen the PUP to new entrants, provides greater certainty for businesses and workers of the support available over the coming months as we continue to live with the virus.</p> <p>  The provision of funding to enable our health service to respond to Covid-19 has been a crucial element of the Government's response.  The Revised Estimate for health approved by the D&aacute;il in July included a &euro;2 billion increase relative to the health allocation set out in the Revised Estimate for public services 2020 published in December last year.  This funding has allowed the HSE to put in place public health measures across a number of key areas.  Further funding has also been agreed, for example, to extend the scope of the influenza vaccination and to provide for the 2020-2021 winter initiative.  While work is continuing at finalising the funding requirement for this year, it is estimated that the overall increase relative to the December Revised Estimate for public services could be up to &euro;3 billion. </p> <p>  Access to education is probably the most important opportunity available to our young people.  In this context, to support the safe reopening of our education systems, an aggregate of almost &euro;0.5 billion is being provided to our schools and further and higher education sectors.</p> <p>  The overall budgetary strategy for 2021 will focus on prioritising crisis management measures to address the challenges posed by Covid-19 and Brexit while preserving and maintaining existing levels of service within core expenditure programmes.  In regard to core expenditure programmes, &euro;70.4 billion in gross voted expenditure was allocated to Departments in the Revised Estimate for public services 2020 published in December 2019.  At this stage it is planned that, before accounting for policy measures in key areas such as health and housing, the budget Estimates for 2021 will include an increase of approximately &euro;3 billion in this core expenditure, comprising &euro;2 billion in current expenditure and &euro;1 billion in capital expenditure.</p> <p>  Of the &euro;2 billion in current expenditure, it is estimated that there are pre-commitments of &euro;1.1 billion to be funded in relation to demographics and to meet the carryover costs of prior year measures and public service pay deal commitments.  In relation to capital expenditure, we will also ensure that the increase in capital investment set out in the national development plan is implemented in order to support the recovery in the economy.  This would see core gross voted capital expenditure of almost &euro;9.2 billion next year, an increase of almost &euro;1 billion on the gross voted expenditure amount set out for this year in the Revised Estimate for public services 2020.</p> <p>  Ensuring the provision of the necessary funding to support our citizens and public services, in particular the health service, over the next phase of the Covid-19 pandemic will be the key priority in budget 2021.  In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021. Consequently, there is a range of potential expenditure requirements that need to be worked through in detail.  Taking into account the level of expenditure arising from Covid-19 this year, these costs will be significant, but are also subject to significant uncertainty.  With 38,000 employers registered for the EWSS, the Revenue Commissioners are to make payments this week to 31,700 of these employers in respect of 335,000 employees.  In addition, with more than 200,000 recipients of the PUP this week, before the nationwide level 3 restrictions were introduced, this indicates the scale of the challenge faced by workers and their employers.  With the additional funding required for health and social protection amounting to more than &euro;12 billion in aggregate this year, as we continue to live with the virus and manage any resurgences through 2021, the funding required for our health service and for income and employment supports will remain significant next year and subject to a degree of uncertainty that would need to be reflected in the estimated expenditure amounts for next year.  In particular, given the challenges from Covid-19 that our health service will continue to deal with next year, this will be a key priority area in budget 2021.</p><p>As a result, there is extensive engagement with the Department of Health and the HSE as we seek to arrive at a workable, sustainable and comprehensive allocation for the Department of Health that can help build the necessary capacity and resilience into our health system.</p><p> Given the complex environment in which budget 2021 is being framed, I will seek to put together an expenditure settlement for next year that will allow Government to respond in an effective manner.  This will require an approach that earmarks resources that can be used to respond to the changing environment as the position with regard to Brexit and the virus continues to develop, that ensures we continue to deliver on our core expenditure programmes, and that puts in place the building blocks for delivery of meaningful improvements in key priority areas for the Government, in particular in health and housing.</p><p> This approach seeks to ensure incremental improvements in the delivery of core public services across Government while committing the necessary level of resources to support our people and our key public services in living with the virus next year as well as targeting the necessary resources to support economic recovery as we deal with the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.  I would be delighted to take questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#B00300"><p>My first question relates to the budgetary measures.  Is it still anticipated that there will be &euro;12 billion in budgetary measures?  I understand &euro;9 billion will be Covid related, with &euro;2 billion in current expenditure.  I understand a total of &euro;1.1 billion was pre-committed.  Then there is &euro;900 million to deal with pressures on services as well as &euro;1 billion from a pre-pandemic allocation of capital expenditure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#B00400"><p>My thanks to Deputy Farrell for the question.  That is the budgetary framework that has been agreed by Cabinet.  That is, in effect, as Deputy Farrell has correctly described, an estimate at this stage.  That is what it is.  It is a work in progress of the amount of Covid-19 related expenditure that we will have to incur again next year.  It is subject to considerable uncertainty because it is based on certain assumptions around the economy and the number of people who will need employment and income supports and so on.  There is a high degree of certainty that we will have to continue to support transport, education and health services through next year.  The figure remains a work in progress.</p> <p>  To be thorough with the committee, I will offer some detail on the &euro;3 billion.  Deputy Farrell correctly described this as made up of &euro;2 billion and &euro;1 billion.  That is before any new budget day decisions.  If we want to make any new initiatives in health, housing and other areas, then we need to go beyond that.  It is our intention to go beyond that and to have some new measures, but the exact quantum is not confirmed at this stage.  We are working within real constraints.</p> <p>  The delivery of new policy initiatives and delivering on any programme for Government commitments would involve additional expenditure because, in effect, the &euro;12 billion Deputy Farrell has referred to is largely to stand still.  It is for dealing with Covid and pre-commitments and increasing the capital budget from last year's budget as well as allowing for a modest amount for existing levels of service and potential new measures.</p></speech>

They have said how important this would be in the coming year to deal with the employment situation.  How much of the &euro;9 billion in Covid-related expenditure does the Minister anticipate will be allocated to health?  In the Minister's opening statement he mentioned the uncertainty.  What will the allocation be in health?  What proportion, if any, of that will be baseline?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#B00600"><p>We are very much working in ranges here.  Let us consider health expenditure in 2020.  A Revised Estimate with an additional &euro;2 billion has already been brought forward to the House, as Deputies are aware.  We have signalled that there will be further expenditure in health.  Under the current Estimate, expenditure in the course of 2020 will be somewhere of the order of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion beyond the original budget for health.  A detailed assessment has been done and is continuing into how much of that expenditure will have to be incurred again next year.  I believe the bulk of it will need to be, to be frank with the Deputy, because we have to work on the assumption that Covid will be here through next year.  Having said that, a significant amount of personal protective equipment, PPE, was purchased this year.  Some of that will carry over into next year.  Between &euro;800 million and &euro;900 million was spent on PPE and some of that will be available next year.  We need to expect that the vast majority of the additional amount that is being incurred in 2020 will have to be incurred again next year.  It would be in a similar range but it is still a work in progress.</p></speech>

It was previously indicated that a deficit of between 4.5% and 5.5% was expected.  Have the deficit projections changed in light of the recent strong corporation tax returns?  If so, will the Minister give us the projected change in percentage in nominal terms?</p></speech>

That is before any new decisions we take on budget day.  As Deputies are aware, we are also considering a recovery fund and considering making additional funding available next year that we can deploy to respond to the evolving needs of the economy through 2021.</p> <p>  Tomorrow night the White Paper will be published setting out the projection for the current year updated on a no-policy-change basis and then, in effect, what the projection will be for next year.  Essentially, this would cover the position were we not to have a budget at all or not do anything.  I am signalling that would be of the order of 5%, but that is before we make any new decisions in the context of budget 2021, and I have signalled that there will be some new decisions.</p></speech>

We are going to have a very large deficit in 2020, somewhere of the order of the mid-20s in billions.  In net terms the addition to our national debt will be less than that because the National Treasury Management Agency, which manages our national debt, holds cash reserves.  A significant proportion of that will result in additional debt and the same will hold true for next year.</p> <p>  We are going into this economic crisis with elevated debt levels so we need to be careful.  One thing that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I strongly agree on is that we do not want to stand out from the pack.  We do not need to be best in class but we certainly do not want to be an outlier on the negative side in terms of our deficit.  At this point we only have certainty that the European Central Bank will continue its accommodative policies up to the summer of 2021.  At some point, the ECB will change its policy and we will have to work with the markets and demonstrate a pathway to fiscal and debt sustainability.  That is broadly our strategy.</p></speech>

We have also seen that the International Monetary Fund has said this week how important it is to ensure we put in enough capital expenditure to stimulate the economy.  This brings me to my next question.  We saw previously in December 2019 that there was a pre-pandemic allocation of &euro;1 billion extra.  That makes &euro;9.1 billion for capital expenditure this year.  The Minister mentioned in his opening statement a figure of &euro;9.2 billion.  What further increase does the Minister anticipate?  Is the figure &euro;9.2 billion final?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#B01400"><p>I think it is important to put it in context.  The capital budget for 2020 was a little under &euro;8.2 billion.  We made funding available on an exceptional basis of the order of an extra &euro;1.5 billion during the year.  Much of that was for grants.  This would not be typical capital expenditure in the form of bricks and mortar.  We provided approximately 1.5 billion extra on a once-off basis.  What we have committed to is that the ceiling in the national development plan for 2021 of &euro;9.2 billion will be met.  We are looking at whether there is scope to go beyond that and increase it further.</p><p>When we talk about a 12% increase, which the Deputy raised on the floor of the D&aacute;il, that is above and beyond the amount that was budgeted for 2020.  The additional amount in 2020 was of an exceptional nature and would include many of the restart grants.  We had two rounds of those for businesses.  There was capital expenditure in health as a crisis management response. </p><p> It is important to say that what we are doing now is very different from a decade ago when capital expenditure was cut by up to 60%.  I would not understate the importance of the Government committing to maintaining capital expenditure of over &euro;9 billion.  The final figure will be confirmed on Tuesday.</p></speech>

All roles are enviable or unenviable as the case may be.  My first question relates to the extent to which he foresees the need to borrow and the degree to which he may approach limits.  I am not asking him to give an indication as to what the limits are, if he thinks it is unwise to answer that question.  I have to ask the question.</p></speech>

It is a very fair question.  We are looking at very significant borrowing again next year and we need to do that because it is the right thing to do.  We need to support the Irish economy through 2021, and maintain and improve public services where we can.  We are anxious to make progress on some core programme for Government commitments because the crises pre-Covid have not gone away.  They might not be getting the same level of attention as before the pandemic, but they are still very much there.</p> <p>  That is why I have signalled to the committee a desire to make decisions that improve our permanent capacity in health services.  That is really important.  We need to build more houses.  The housing crisis still exists and needs to be addressed.  They are core priorities for the Government and will be in the budget.  We are looking at a deficit this year, in general Government terms, of the order of the mid-20s of billions.  Next year's budget deficit will also be very significant, perhaps less than &euro;20 billion.  While the NTMA manages its cash reserves we are, in effect, increasing the national debt by amounts of that order which is significant.</p></speech>

I refer to capital expenditure.  The Minister compared previous experiences.  He has available to him borrowing capacity that was not available ten years ago.  Does he intend to use that proactively in order to, as it were, nudge the areas we can develop and need to develop, particularly health, housing and education, in the future?  A failure to make capital expenditure now will only rebound in four or five years time and we will be back to square one.</p></speech>

There is a great opportunity for us as a country to make the investments that we need.  We have the ability to borrow at historically low interest rates.  There are infrastructure needs in housing, transport, education, health, climate action, renewable energy and so on.  We need to make progress in those areas.</p> <p>  Some of the capacity in the construction sector is probably going to be freed up over the period ahead.  It is reasonable to assume that we will have a change in the amount of commercial construction activity not, it is to be hoped, in house building, but it is fair to assume that there may well be capacity in some other areas where we can get better value for money and deliver on those projects. </p> <p>  There is a great opportunity for our country to improve our infrastructure at this time.  As the Deputy knows, we will shortly commence a review of the national development plan.  The current plan is scheduled to run to 2027.  We have signalled that we want to extend that.  Over the course of the next number of months, we will bring forward a new ten-year capital development plan to 2030 with a capital envelope for the next decade.  That will provide the certainty that the construction industry needs.</p> <p>  We will also provide capital ceilings for individual Ministers and line Departments for the next five years, which will allow them to plan and progress the delivery of projects through the pipeline.  It can be slow, as the Deputy knows, to deliver on major capital projects, particularly around public transport.  We need to give certainty to Ministers that the pipeline of funding is secure.  Spending money on capital is money well spent, provided that we are getting value for money and the infrastructure that we are investing in is needed.  We will only invest in infrastructure that is actually needed.</p></speech>

Given the availability of borrowing at low or zero interest rates and the fact that commercial banks do not apply these rates directly to private borrowers, does the Minister think it is advantageous or advantageous to him, in his capacity as Minister, to have the lower rate prevail in this country as is available to other European countries, in particular members of the eurozone?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#C00800"><p>I am asking about the two.  To what extent does borrowing for the Government impact negatively or positively on the fact we pay approximately 2% for our borrowings in the private market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#C00900"><p>They are two separate issues.  On sovereign borrowing, while we are able to borrow at historically low interest rates we are taking on additional debt and while we have certainty about the servicing costs of that debt for the duration of the bond, it will mature and have to be refinanced.  We could be in a very different environment when it comes to those debt instruments maturing.</p> <p>  We need to be careful about the decisions we make.  The interest rate might be close to zero now, but in ten or 15 years time when the bond expires, the cost of borrowing could be dramatically higher.  We do not want to have a situation where a proportion of our tax revenue that we are receiving as a Government is going on servicing debt.  We have to think down the line and make sure that our national debt is sustainable in overall terms. </p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, the key measure is the size of the national debt relative to the size of the economy.  That is why having economic growth is so important.  The projection for next year is very much dependent on Covid which, in turn, is very dependent on the next four weeks and whether we get a trade deal in the Brexit negotiations.  If we can continue to grow the economy, get back to growth next year and manage the deficit in a safe and responsible way, our debt sustainability will be secure.  We take advice from our debt management agency as to how the markets would view Ireland in different scenarios.  That is an important factor because once the ECB withdraws supports the markets will take a view.  We want to be in a good space.</p> <p>  In regard to borrowing costs for other customers in our banking system here, whether they be business customers or mortgage borrowers the statistics show that borrowing costs here are higher.  We have been given various explanations as to why that is the case.  When it comes to mortgage rates, they are falling which is to be welcomed.  There is some competition and new entrants are coming into the Irish market.  I would encourage all consumers to shop around.  There are probably around 100,000 mortgage holders in Ireland who would get a better deal by going elsewhere.  In many cases, they would get a better deal with their existing institutions.  They should seek to do that.  That is what will ensure that everybody gets the best value from their loans.  We will continue to work on the issue.</p></speech>

The banking system sets its interest rates based on a range of factors, including borrowing costs on the interbank and wholesale markets.  They are factors.  There are other considerations, such as the cost of capital and so on.  These issues would not be relevant to the factors that decide the cost of sovereign borrowing.  There are differences, but there is some relationship.</p></speech>

I have a final question.</p><p>Given the current situation in regard to Covid, the Minister may have to go back to the borrowing well again and again.  I am not saying that is the right thing to do; he will have to make that judgment as the situation evolves.  Is the Minister satisfied that we have available to us adequate borrowing resources and security to deal with any situation that may arise in the context of Brexit or Covid-19?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#D00200"><p>We do at this time.  There is borrowing capacity at this time but we cannot assume that it will be available forever.  That is why we have to make sure we make the right decisions, that we focus on the recovery of our economy as well as maintaining and improving public services and that we try to bring about greater employment.  The current rate of unemployment is 15% but the imposition of level 3 restrictions has real implications too.  We are seeing a very strong export performance in the pharmaceutical sector and in internationally traded services such as IT and so on, but it is evident to all of us that parts of the domestic economy are struggling.  We all know the devastating impact of the virus on the hospitality industry, in particular on aviation and to a lesser extent on construction.  Hospitality is a jobs-rich area in normal times .  We need to grapple with and manage our way through this virus as best we can and, hopefully, get to a point where we can rebuild employment and bring our unemployment levels down.</p></speech>

The plans we have in place now are plans for 2021.  We do not seem to have a medium-term plan.  We do not appear to have done any calibration of the different scenarios over the next four to five years.  That is a concern which I hope the Minister will address.  It might be crystal ball gazing but we need to see what the different scenarios would look like in order that we can have a contingency in place.  The Minister mentioned a recovery fund.  I presume that is an amount of money to create a fund for recovery.  I ask the Minister to comment on the absence of a medium-term or two, three or four year projection which would be very important if we are to plan for every scenario, as we have done in the case of Brexit?</p></speech>

In normal times, this committee would have more information available to it by way of projections for the next number of years but there is so much uncertainty it is impossible to predict in many respects what is likely to lie before us for next year.  To go beyond that, is very much crystal ball gazing but we will need to do it.  We have indicated that in the stability programme update in April of next year we will set out the fiscal projections and the macro-economic projections for 2022 and beyond.  That is important because we do need to set out an overall fiscal framework for the next number of years.  The view we have arrived at now is that the degree of uncertainty is so extraordinary there would be little value at this point in time in predicting 2022, 2023 and beyond.  We will do so in the spring of next year.</p></speech>

One of the problems we have with capital expenditure is that the timeline to deliver projects is far too long.  If one decided tomorrow morning to build a housing scheme, it would be three years before there would be anything on the ground.  What can be done to stimulate that process and to remove some of the procurement hurdles to make capital expenditure on projects that need to be delivered attainable within a short timeframe?  The Minister said that he recognises that construction industry commercial activity will be slowing down because of the uncertainty.  The Government could pick up on this opportunity to have public works done.  When reading a report on Revised Estimates I noted that last year the OPW got only two of six projects off the ground, which is one third of what should have been done.  This is a fault of the system, not the OPW.  Will the Minister undertake to review how the Office of Public Procurement is doing its business such that we can accelerate the benefit of the budget for capital expenditure see the results of it quicker?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#D00700"><p>The Deputy asked some fair and good questions and he touched on some really important issues.  One of the benefits of setting out five-year capital ceilings is that it gives Departments certainty in terms of the envelope they will have, rather than on a year by year basis.  While the national development plan did set them out over the last number of years, we will do so for the next five years as well.  This gives an important level of certainty.  </p> <p>  It can be slow to deliver capital projects in Ireland for a whole range of reasons.  I do not think procurement is the most significant element of it.  I think it is about the legal challenges that may occur at design stage and planning stage and the regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome.  As part of the review of the NDP and the ongoing work of my Department which is responsible in overall terms for the delivery of capital projects, we will consider ways in which we can improve the system.  I recognise that that needs to be done.  The Deputy gave the very good example of flood schemes.  We have new EU regulations in terms of environmental impact assessment reports.  We need to have a proper process in place to ensure that projects can progress in an appropriate manner and as quickly as possible.  As far as I can see, funding is not the constraint much of the time.  Rather, the issue is ready-to-go projects, particularly in the public transport area.  We do not have any major public transport project ready to go if we had the funding to finance it.  We have to keep advancing projects through the system to make sure that they are ready.  There are various blockages in the system and I agree with the Deputy that more work needs to be done.  My Department will lead that work as part of the NDP review and its ongoing work.</p></speech>

Local authorities have seen a decimation in their income stream this year.  As we are in uncertain times, we can predict that rates revenue will be very low.  In terms of housing, we need to ensure that our local authorities are resourced to deliver on the social and affordable housing that is required.  They do not have the resources to do that at the moment.  The services they are delivering, which everybody takes for granted, are under threat now.  It is great to say that they being given a particular amount of money to keep them going but we need to enhance them.  They can be a key driver in restarting the economy as well.  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the supports he will give the local authorities to make sure they are the stimulation generator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#D00900"><p>If I may, I would like to make one further point in regard to the previous question.  The Deputy touched on the issue of servicing land.  It is a key issue.  People often talk about building houses, but there is very little talk about delivering the infrastructure that is needed, including the water and wastewater.  This will require funding being provided to Irish Water and the local authorities to deliver those schemes.  I recognise the importance of that work.  We will not build the houses we need unless we provide the funding to deliver the infrastructure.  I will put real focus on that issue because I recognise that nothing happens if the services are not in place.</p> <p>  On local authorities, it has been a really difficult year for them.</p><p>They have lost revenue across a number of different headings as a result of the impact of Covid-19.  I am conscious of that.  The Revised Estimates for the local government Vote has been approved so the funding for the commercial rates waiver will be released now by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien's, Department very quickly.  We will be refunding 100% of the commercial rates that were waived, so that will be &euro;600 million that will be transferred to local authorities.  They would not always collect 100% but we will refund them 100%.  In addition to that, I recognise there are deficits.  If they are carrying significant deficits in the next year, that will be a difficulty for them in maintaining services.  They are now preparing to enter their own budget process and have made decisions already around the local property tax, but officials in my Department and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s, Department are examining closely at the moment the outturn for this year to see what further help may be needed for local authorities, and I hope we can arrive at a conclusion quickly.</p></speech>

We are pumping a lot of money into the health service.  The concern I have relates to the outcomes.  There may be dead weight there and there may be easier or more efficient ways of doing business.  The health service needs a huge amount of support at the moment, but with all of this additional money going in, what measures have we put in place to make sure we see the benefit after it is spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#E00300"><p>That is a very good point.  As part of the Estimates process, we are working through all of that in detail.  I am determined to ensure that, in providing extra money, there is clear delivery of key outputs and there is recognition that we need to make permanent improvements in capacity.  That is coming at a time when it is very costly because we have to fund the Covid response in the Department of Health and the HSE with additional expenditure in 2020 of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion, and much of that will have to be incurred again.  We can see the strain that imposes on the Exchequer, but there is general agreement across the political system on the direction of travel.  We want equal access to our health service and we need to ensure we improve permanent bed capacity, including ICU capacity.  My team are working through the detail of that with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his officials because additional money will only be provided where it is clear what the public is getting in return by way of an improved service, improved capacity and improved infrastructure.  That process is almost complete.</p></speech>

The question may have been asked already while I was on the way down from my office but we are all interested to hear the Minister's views on the planned expansion to the national development plan and the additional resources he hopes to make available to deliver on some commitments.  Will  the Minister elaborate on what new commitments account for the additional &euro;1 billion in expenditure that he is on record as proposing?  Will he also, in his response to that question, elaborate on some of the lessons that need to be learned from the cost overruns related to the children's hospital?</p></speech>

I had a good exchange with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, which the Deputy may not have heard, on the question of the national development plan, NDP.  I will repeat briefly in terms of background.  The original budget for capital expenditure for 2020 was &euro;8.1 billion.  On an exceptional basis over the course of the current year we allocated a further &euro;1.5 billion through the July stimulus, the restart grants and other measures to bring the outturn significantly up for 2020.  The NDP ceiling for 2021 is of the order of &euro;9.2 billion.  The Departments already know their allocation under that.  That is about &euro;1 billion above the budget for capital expenditure in 2020.  There are increases in a range Departments.  Transport gets a large increase in 2021 but it is spread through the different portfolio areas.  What was the Deputy&rsquo;s second question?</p></speech>

How can the Minister apply those lessons to the NDP review?</p></speech>

I have had a lot of engagement with our procurement function within the Department at this stage.  I have received briefings on the national children's hospital, and lessons need to be learned there about project management.  I will be asking as part of the NDP review that, in deciding on new allocations, we articulate what those lessons are and make sure they are built into our policies going forward.  We do not want a situation where projects are gobbling up a huge amount of resources that can get then not be made available to other Departments.  It is a costly lesson but one that we are determined to learn.</p></speech>

Does the Minister agree with that suggestion and does he agree that that is the quantum of money required to meet the demands over the next four to five years and peaks and troughs we may expect in our economy?</p></speech>

Our public expenditure in 2020 is going to be of the order of &euro;16 billion more than expected and up about 30% compared with the outturn in previous years.  Much of that has been gone by way of stimulus measures, employment supports and income supports.  In the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the budget will be exceeded by some &euro;9 billion and we will now be spending in excess of &euro;30 billion under that Vote.  That is the Vote under which the wage subsidy scheme is administered in addition to the pandemic unemployment payment.</p> <p>  What we are doing with capital expenditure in terms of investment and providing stimulus is part of the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  On budget day, however, we need to give confidence to the business community and employers that we see a way out of this and have a plan to bring the country through a very challenging and uncertain period.  That will be a key objective.</p> <p>  We are also examining the concept of a recovery fund, which we signalled within the programme for Government.  We are scoping out the nature and the extent of that at this time. That fund would be used either for current or for capital purposes to respond to the emerging needs of the economy.</p></speech>

Some people may confuse the idea of stimulus fund with national economic recovery fund.  Are they interchangeable terms?  Is it the same thing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#E01100"><p>I think they are interchangeable.  They are certainly interlinked in that the application of a recovery fund is a stimulus to the economy.  Certain decisions will need to be made on budget day when we set out the framework for 2021 and outline the level of supports we intend to make available to the economy.  However, it is important we have flexibility next year as well because we do not quite know what we are facing and we may need to respond in a rapid way to changes in our economy and needs that will emerge in a very short timeframe.  The concept of a recovery fund we can apply over the course of the year is a good one and it will form part of our budget day package.</p></speech>

One way we could give businesses some certainty that they could keep their doors open and assist them with their labour costs is to extend the form of the wage subsidy scheme beyond the expiry date of next March.</p><p>Would the Minister agree with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, when he said at the committee last week, that if we had, for example, a German style wage subsidy scheme or a short-term work scheme in place when the pandemic first hit, that we potentially could have saved many more businesses and jobs at the outset?  Businesses need that certainty that the wages can be paid and the support will be there, and workers need that economic certainty over the next period of time, that there will not be a cliff-edge date of 31 March 2021, where all wage subsidy supports will be removed.  That would be catastrophic for incomes, workers and businesses across the country.  Does the Minister agree that the wage subsidy scheme, in some form, will need to be extended, given the twin challenges of Covid 19 and Brexit?</p><p> It was this time last year that my party proposed a form of a wage subsidy scheme and skills support scheme to mitigate the worst impact of a potential no-deal Brexit.  That is coming into view, and businesses need to hear from the Minister and the Minister for Finance about providing that certainty for them beyond the end of next March.</p></speech>

Its introduction predates my time in government and credit is due for same.  Approximately &euro;2.7 billion has been paid out to date under the scheme, and what we have sought to do in the July stimulus and the decisions we have taken as a Government is to provide the certainty that we can for as long as possible.  As the Deputy stated, the scheme is due to run until the end of March, which is almost six months away.  The issue is also being considered in the context of the budget, and I know that the Minister for Finance has spoken about it to this committee.  However, we are under no illusion about the level of dependence that many employers have on the scheme now, and we need to think very carefully about the future of it, and particularly the effect of an abrupt end to it.  We hear the Deputy's message.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#F00400"><p>I thank the Minister for appearing before the committee today.  I wish him well in the work he is doing and congratulate him on the work he has done so far in what is clearly an unprecedented and challenging time.</p> <p>  My first question concerns the role of accelerated capital spending in terms of labour market activation.  The Government has already announced the July stimulus, and the Minister has indicated that in the upcoming budget there will be further capital stimulus.  Does the Minister take the view that accelerated capital works, including the retrofitting of social housing and the construction of active travel infrastructures, such as cycle lanes, would counteract some of the significant unemployment figures he mentioned in his statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#F00500"><p>I very much take that view, because I think investment such as that serves two purposes.  First, those works are needed anyway.  The retrofitting of social housing is something that needs done and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, have been engaging on that issue, and it is something that we are looking at closely in the context of budget 2021.  Also, such works provide employment opportunities for our economy, and that is a significant advantage.  Some great work has been done around the country in the active travel area, and the additional funding that was provided to the Minister in the Department of Transport in July, is being very well spent.   We will see much more of that, because it is great for communities to see improvements in local infrastructure that make it safer for people to get out walking and cycling.  We are working on further initiatives in that space, but what we have done through the July stimulus, and the spending of that at a local level, has made a real difference and has provided jobs at a time when they are badly needed.</p></speech>

We can see very good roll out of this kind of instrument in our regional cities.  We need to extend it to our towns and villages and it would be good to see measures in the budget in that regard.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that there are pre-commitments of &euro;1.1 billion in relation to demographics.  Has the Minister's Department done an analysis of the demographic pressure on public expenditure over the next few years, and will the &euro;1.1 billion increase be similar over the next decade?  What impact will this have on the public expenditure strategy?</p></speech>

I know from my time in opposition that the figure often provided for demographics may actually not meet the true cost.  In the past number of weeks I have been having a lot of bilateral meetings with Ministers as one would expect, and the amount of money that is needed, even to stand still, by way of an existing level of service, can be very significant at times, and it might lead one to think that the figure for demographics has been under-stated.</p> <p>  There are pressures right across the system, but it is an issue of which the Department is very conscious, because if we want to have a proper medium-term fiscal plan, we need to know exactly what the costs are of an ageing population, in terms of pension provision, nursing home care, care for the elderly and home support.  We are seeing a fall-off in the numbers coming into primary school, but an increase in those at second level, for example.</p> <p>  We are working with the different Departments and some of them have a very good handle on what the pressures are and the budgetary implications of same.  It does tend to be managed on a year-to-year basis, so I would like to see if we can get a more medium-term assessment of what those demographics are, and build that into our budgetary framework.  It is certainly an issue that I spoke about in opposition and I am seeing it on the front line now.  It is a real issue and we would like to see a more long-term assessment of those demographic pressures.</p></speech>

How does this compare with our European neighbours, and are there particular expenditure challenges in the Irish context that other European countries do not have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#F00900"><p>The level of support that we have provided for the economy by way of the economic supports, the liquidity measures that have been provided, and the additional capital investment stands up very well in comparison with our European peers.  The data are there to back that up in terms of the quantum of resources <i>per capita</i>that our Government and the previous Government provided.  When it comes to the public expenditure implications, I am sure the Deputy has seen the pre-budget expenditure update for 2020, which provides a very detailed breakdown of the extra &euro;16 billion of supports that have been provided.  There are some very large chunks there in relation to employment affairs and social protection, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the wage subsidy scheme, and health, of course.  It also includes the business supports and the extra investment we have had to make to keep our public transport companies running, so that they can operate with much reduced capacity, and the funding in education for our schools, and further and higher education institutions.  Therefore, it is a very significant response.  I am not sure how it compares in terms of additional public expenditure on services with other European countries, but it is something we can check.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Minister mentioned the multi-year capital envelopes given to the Departments.  Is there scope for increased and more definite multi-annual funding commitments, particularly in the area of housing, which might bring greater certainty and increased efficiency in capital expenditure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100800002#F01100"><p>Yes, I think there is.  That is the short answer.  I want to see Departments spend their capital allocations in full.  I do not want to be giving money to Departments and then seeing significant underspends at year end.  There can be reasons for that.  With Covid, for example, in the whole area of housing and construction, there was a shutdown for a period of time, and we have seen the impact that has had in completions in that particular quarter, which is understandable.  In the normal run of events, I want to see capital budgets spent for the purposes for which they are given, but there is merit in providing a multi-annual commitment and that can be done at two levels.</p><p>It can also be done at the individual Vote level so that within the overall Department allocation, there will be certainty about the allocation for a particular area of activity.  That is something we are looking at.</p><p> The Deputy's point about housing was a fair one.</p></speech>

The various restrictions that have been imposed on people's lives and their quality of life, the loss of employment and the isolation that many people have had to live with over recent months have all had an impact.  That is undoubtedly the case.  I have been in discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about the funding for the new mental health strategy.  I hope we can make progress on that in the context of the budget next week.  I recognise it is a real issue and it is a priority for the Government.  I hope we can assist in the area next week.</p></speech>

There has been a significant increase in the funding for homelessness services in recent years and we need to continue with that.  There has been some progress on the reduction in the numbers of homeless families and individuals, but there has been nowhere near enough and we need to do much better.  While a top priority for the Government is to deal with the housing crisis in its various forms, its most acute form is where a person or family is homeless.  We have had good engagement in the context of the Estimates and can, I hope, deliver a decent envelope to make more progress on the issue.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, the advice the previous Government received was along the lines that the individuals concerned are not employed by the State and are not public servants as such.  The advice was that the issue could have much wider implications throughout the community and voluntary sector, such as for section 39 organisations and so on.</p> <p>  When I came into office, I sought to meet the union representatives, which I did in July along with officials from my Department and from the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, given that it is the line Department for community employment schemes.  We put a process in train at that time for further engagement at official level with the union representatives and that is at quite an advanced stage.  There is not a proposal on my desk at this point, even though I have been told there is.  I hope we can make progress on the matter but in a manner that will not have much wider ramifications that we cannot manage, which is the challenge we face.  Progress may be possible and I await a full report from the officials involved in the engagement since that meeting in July.</p></speech>

There were 42,000 inquiries and 21,000 applicants, yet only 453 were successful, although that was through no fault of the groups.

This has been ongoing for some time, to be fair, and a great deal of progress has been made.  In respect of the 1 January potential cliff-edge date, what needs to be done for that date has been completed at Rosslare Europort.  There is a longer-term plan but what needs to be done for 1 January has been completed.</p> <p>  Similarly for Dublin Airport, what needs to be done has been completed, while for Dublin Port, the vast majority of the works have concluded.  An environmental approval was required from An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the completion of the remaining projects and that has come through.  Some outstanding works, therefore, will extend to 2021, but the contingency plan is being put in place by the relevant agencies along with my Department.  Those agencies will include the HSE, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Revenue Commissioners, and they are working with an infrastructure group led by the Secretary General of my Department.</p> <p>  Funding is not the issue; it is a timeline issue.  The vast majority of works required at Dublin Port have been completed.  I visited it a few weeks ago to see for myself and significant progress has been made.  I am confident the port will be ready to deal with whatever scenario arises on 1 January.</p></speech>

That is to be very much welcomed because it reduces the level of dependence on the use of the land bridge . At Rosslare Europort, the works have been completed, whereas at Cork Harbour and other ports apart from Dublin Port, the volume did not meet the threshold required for additional works to be carried out.  I inquired specifically, as the Deputy might imagine, about Cork Harbour and other ports, and the advice I received was that no works are required there in the context of Brexit preparedness.</p></speech>

Vacancies can be filled.  My priority is to ensure that the funding will be made available for those posts to be filled.  It can be difficult in certain areas.  It is an operational issue for the HSE directly but if there are specific challenges, we will work with the Department of Health and the HSE to see what we can do to manage them.</p> <p>  As for pay issues, we are constrained.  We have a public sector pay deal that will end at the end of this year.</p><p>There is a real issue at consultant post level with certain posts remaining unfilled throughout the country, which is a concern and a real difficulty in delivering the reforms we need, the capacity improvements we are going to need, and the changes required in certain practices.

One of the themes arising is their concern around oversight and spending.  The PBO has said it is struggling to keep up with the announcements of particular budgetary items.  A number of groups have raised the issues of oversight and transparency in their submissions to us.  I will give an example.  The winter plan, with an expenditure of &euro;600 million, allocates 10% of the funds to private hospitals.  I am not arguing about the benefit of that in the context of capacity for the health service, but there was not a huge amount of detail about the nature of that agreement.  Considering the dynamic nature of the spending we are required to do at the moment, will the Minister comment on how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is dealing with the issue of oversight and transparency in both the immediate and the medium term?</p></speech>

This provides a lot of detail on what has been an exceptional year.  I acknowledge that point.</p> <p>  The previous Government and the current Government had to respond in an unorthodox and rapid manner to circumstances that have prevailed.  My Department has constant engagement with particular line Departments.  There are people in my Department who manage just the health Vote.  When it comes to any new announcement from the Department of Health there is detailed engagement on that, and my Department has to be satisfied that proper processes are being followed, that there is value for money and that any new policy initiatives are fully thought through.  Ultimately, we have to sign off on that.  The Chairman gave the example of the winter plan.  It is a dramatically larger and more comprehensive winter plan than ever before, and so it needs to be because of what our health service might have to deal with in the next months.</p> <p>  We are happy to work with this committee and the PBO on any particular issues or any proposals or suggestions they have around improving transparency in spending decisions.  It has been a challenging year.  We have done our best to provide as much information as we possibly can at a time when things are changing very quickly.</p></speech>

I am sure it will be done on an ongoing basis.  Our priority for now is budget 2021, and Covid is a core part of that in making sure we have adequate provision in the areas the committee has spoken about, especially health.  That is a real challenge.  At the moment our focus is on trying to make the right decisions in the context of budget 2021.  There will be an Appropriation Act later this year to confirm the outturn and spending for the period of 2020.  In the normal course of events the Comptroller and Auditor General will look at individual Votes and spending across Departments.  I am sure there will be a particular focus on exceptional expenditure and where decisions had to be made in very short timeframes.  I imagine this will be done in the normal way.  The Committee of Public Accounts will also examine the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports on expenditure in 2020.  It is important to put that on the record also.</p></speech>

We also discussed how countries such as France are looking at a deficit of around 7%.  IFAC felt that many of the independent financial advisory groups in other countries were looking at around 8%.  In that context, is Ireland pitching its deficit at the right level?  Is Brexit the reason for that?</p></speech>

We are not saying that the deficit has to come in at 5% or below next year, no matter what.  That is not the position of the Government.  The position is that on a no-policy-change basis, the forecast of deficit for 2021 would be of the order of 5%.  That is before we make any new decisions and before we decide on the quantum and scope of the recovery fund, for example, and how we apply that over the course of next year.  We are not wedded to a particular deficit outturn figure for next year.</p> <p>  The more important consideration is the level of support the economy needs.  To be honest, I do not think we fell back this year in providing very significant support across the economy.  The intention is to provide extensive support again next year.  We want to see a situation, however, where the deficit at least starts to move in the right direction.  There is a degree of uncertainty about the outturn for this year.   It will depend on the tax receipts in the final quarter.  The potential impact of any further restrictions could also be significant.  There is a lot of uncertainty.  Next year we would like to see the deficit going in the right direction.  We are not wedded to a particular figure that we have to meet come what may.  The overall priorities are to support the economy and to protect services.</p></speech>

These are challenging times, no doubt.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on the Chairman's question about the deficit.  In the budgetary strategy published on 16 September the Minster outlined that a 4.5% to 5.5% deficit of GDP on a no-policy-change basis included the &euro;9 billion Covid-related expenditure.  When the Minister talks of that 5% figure it includes &euro;9 billion Covid-related expenditure, &euro;1.1 billion pre-committed and the &euro;1 billion capital that has already been factored into 2021.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It may well be the case that some element of it would be a Covid contingency because of the deep uncertainty we have in projecting the number of people on the live register who will need support next year, for example.  It is a very volatile situation.  Not everything may be allocated to the individual Vote level.  In broad terms the recovery fund concept is separate and additional to the provision we would make for known Covid expenditure in 2021.</p></speech>

The Minister was always the person who talked about us not having surprises on budget day, yet he will give us all a surprise in just four days' time.  In any other year we would know the quantum of the package.  At the minute the budgetary strategy talks of a package in the region of &euro;12 billion.  The question is, what will the package be?  Will it be &euro;14 billion, &euro;15 billion or &euro;16 billion?  What size is the recovery fund?</p><p>Four days out from the budget, the least the Minister could do to show respect to a budgetary oversight committee would be to indicate to it how far he is going to push the envelope on Tuesday.</p></speech>

In recent days, I have seen different rolling assessment figures in the Department regarding what will be needed for Covid next year.  I am saying that to be up-front with the Deputy.  When we brought the memorandum to the Government, &euro;9 billion was the estimate.  It remains broadly accurate but I am not wedded to the figure because we do what we need to in respect of Covid.  That is the commitment I am giving on that issue.</p> <p>  The recovery fund is additional.  It is important that we remain agile and flexible next year.  Nobody could have predicted at the beginning of 2020, when Covid was not here, that there would be additional expenditure of &euro;16 billion in the course of the year.  Covid is now here and I hope it will only be here for part of next year but its impact is difficult to predict.  It depends on the health situation and decisions that have to be made in that respect.  We are in extraordinary times.  Arriving at a decision on the correct level of support is very challenging and difficult.  The work on that is ongoing but we want the support to be of an order that can make a real difference.  We realise there will be issues to which we will need to respond over the course of the year.  We need to have the resources to do so, and we do not want the resources to be in addition to the projected deficit and so on for 2021.</p></speech>

It is not the way to do budgets.  I acknowledge that there are moving parts but he has a sense of the quantum at this stage.  That is usually published in the summer economic statement, which he and the Minister for Finance have decided not to publish this year.  This decision was heavily criticised by our independent fiscal advisory council.  That said, it appears that what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has said to us is that there is a lot of uncertainty.  I agree with that.  I completely agree that we need to be very nimble and able to respond to unforeseen circumstances.  There may be money set aside that I hope will never be drawn down because of an improvement in circumstances.  One thing we know for sure at this stage, however, is that 2021 has to be the year of recovery.  We need to stimulate the economy.  What the Minister has suggested to me is that the recovery fund is really to deal with contingencies associated with Covid as opposed to the stimulus being requested.  On budget day, there should be a package that stimulates the economy but it appears that this is not being presented because there is expenditure on Covid of &euro;9 billion to keep the lights on.  It is a recovery fund that is about contingencies that we can identify so I guess the Minister is not going to refer to additional capital or certain types of stimuli, and much of the other expenditure pertains to carried over costs.  Where is the big ambition for stimulating the economy, which we know has to happen next year?  In this regard, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has identified, for illustrative purposes, a stimulus package of &euro;10 billion over a two-year period.</p></speech>

It is designed to be used to support the economy and act as a stimulus rather than to support service areas.  It is important to make that point.</p> <p>  Let me address the estimated Covid expenditure next year of &euro;9 billion.  Deputy Doherty described it as keeping the lights on but it is about services and policy decisions already made on the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme for the period up to the end of March.  There are also important supports for employment, transport, education and all the other areas where we know there will be additional expenditure in 2021.  The recovery fund is, therefore, a stimulus and it is about supporting recovery and jobs.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we need to be agile and nimble next year.  The idea that we can stand up on Tuesday and set out with a degree of certainty everything we need to do next year is not realistic in the circumstances we face.  We will, however, do the best we can to provide as much certainty as possible and to give hope to people so they may be confident we will get through this, that the economy will recover and that the Government is willing to provide the resources necessary to bring about and support the recovery.  The recovery fund is going to be an important part-----</p></speech>

Why will he not provide the committee responsible for budgetary oversight with the parameters of what he is considering?  I am not looking for the exact figure but an indication as to whether the recovery fund is &euro;500 million or &euro;5 billion.  With respect, this is the budgetary oversight committee.  One of the recommendations made after the last crash was that there should be scrutiny prior to budgetary announcements and no surprises on budget day.  Surely, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath has a sense of the quantum, yet he is deliberately keeping that information from us today.  I am not looking for a figure that is accurate to the cent but for parameters.  Are we looking at what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is suggesting, namely, up to &euro;10 billion, or &euro;5 billion or something more modest?</p></speech>

Collectively as a committee - I am not referring to Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael - we do not have a clue about the budgetary parameters the Minister is considering for announcement on Tuesday.  We do not know whether there will be &euro;6 billion, &euro;7 billion, &euro;8 billion or &euro;9 billion in addition to the &euro;12 billion set out.  That is what this committee is supposed to be examining.  It is supposed to be feeding in, giving its thoughts and providing analysis so there will be no more bunnies taken out of the hat and no more big surprises.  The Minister knows the parameters.  I do not want a final decision as I know it has not been made and that things will change right up to the last moment but the Minister knows whether the figure is &euro;500 million or &euro;5 billion.  He could give us a range indicating the space we are in.</p> <p>  With respect to the Minister, and acknowledging this is his first outing as Minister to a meeting of this committee, of which he has been a member, the Government is treating the committee with disrespect by not allowing it to do what it was set up to do, that is, to scrutinise the parameters set prior to the budget.

We have heard what various external commentators have had to say, and the truth is that we are continuing to work on it.  It will need to be a significant fund to meet the challenges that will arise across the economy in 2021.  No final decision has been made at this point but we have given confirmation of what we would regard as the stimulus, for example, in the whole capital expenditure area.  We have made policy decisions already about employment and income supports through to the spring of 2021, and further decisions will be made on budget day.  I have heard what the Deputy has had to say.  The issue raised is one we can work on in the future.  This is an extraordinary year and we need to have the flexibility, as a Government, to make decisions right up to budget day and to set them out next Tuesday, which I look forward to doing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.457" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#A01200"><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for skills and further education, Deputy Niall Collins, and their officials to the meeting.  I congratulate both Ministers and wish them the best of luck in their new roles.  As Chairman of the committee, I look forward to working with both of them, their officials and their Department.  I speak on behalf of all members of the committee.</p> <p>  The meeting will comprise two parts.  Part one will be the briefing on parts of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 under the remit of the Department with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  Part two will be a discussion of the Department's key priorities, specifically, the effects of Covid-19 on the 2020 admissions, the reopening and delivery of courses in further and higher education institutes, future funding reforms at both levels to include apprenticeships and traineeships, and proposed national strategies for research, innovation and science.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite both the Minister and Minister of State to make brief opening statements, which will be followed by a discussion with members of the committee.  As the Minister and Minister of State will probably be aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on the website following the meeting.</p> <p>  While the meeting is in two parts, to ensure absolute clarity I propose that members can ask questions on both parts together because of the time constraints involved.  This is the most pragmatic way to ensure that all members get a reasonable amount of time to ask questions.  If there is time at the end of the meeting, members can ask supplementary questions and I will accommodate everybody as fairly as possible.</p> <p>  It has been agreed that we have a rotation of speakers.  Each speaker has six minutes to include the speaker asking questions and the Ministers responding.  Then we will move on to the next member.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask Ministers and their officials and all members to switch off their mobile phones or turn them onto airplane mode.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister, Deputy Harris, followed by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here today and to be joined by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the most recent CAO offers, the so-called round four, came out approximately an hour and a half ago.  I am also conscious that the class of 2020 has had an horrifically difficult year.  I am confident that everything that could possibly have been done was done to make sure there was a pathway for them from secondary school to third level and that people were working in good faith in that regard.  However, I also know it has been an extremely stressful period of time.  I have been working closely with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I promised last week to move mountains to make sure that any student who required an additional place or a new place as a result of the error in the calculated grades would get that place in this academic year.  I am delighted to report to the committee that this has happened.  Every single student who had an error in his or her calculated grades detected by the CAO has been offered a place to start this year by the CAO in round four this morning.  While there will be much political scrutiny of calculated grades and all of that, and that is fair, right and proper in the Oireachtas, it is a moment to thank the higher education institutions which have worked incredibly hard to make this happen.</p><p> I have been struck by the level of collaboration among and by the can-do attitude of the Higher Education Authority, the CAO, the Irish Universities Association, IUA, the Technological Universities Association, THEA, the Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, and all the staff in my Department who worked hard to make this happen as quickly as possible.  I want to put that on the record of the committee as I am conscious that it is a timely matter and one that has just happened in the past hour or so.</p><p> The creation of my Department is a major opportunity for us to shine a light on issues that perhaps all too often do not get the attention they deserve.  I am aware there is cross-party consensus on the creation of this Department on the basis that no matter who the Minister for Education and Skills is or who works in the Department of Education and Skills, these issues deserve their own Department.  If we can couple further and higher education with research, innovation and science, we potentially have the opportunity to achieve something really good here.  I sincerely look forward to working with every member of this committee in a collaborative, bipartisan manner to try to get as much done as we possibly can.</p><p> There are two aspects to the Department.  There is the economic aspect in terms of making sure we future-proof the economy and produce the skills and the research, which is all very important but, equally important, and not to be seen as the poor relation, is the social inclusion element.  There is still educational disadvantage in this country.  It is neither right nor proper for that to be the case, particularly when I meet Pavee Point and others who have been rightly highlighting issues which, in my view, have not been addressed in recent years or when I meet Down Syndrome Ireland and the only conversation adults of 18 years of age with Down's syndrome are having is what day-care places they would like the HSE to provide.  It is not right that 55% of people in this country lack basic digital skills and that 16% of adults lack basic reading skills.  There is a significant issue when we talk about the knowledge economy.  People are getting left behind and I think there is a chance through pathways in community education, further education and higher education to get things done.</p><p> We must drop the snobby attitude in this country.  I was struck by the op-ed by the provost of Trinity College on this issue.  If he is writing about it, we should really pay attention.  I refer to the idea that everyone must be funnelled straight from secondary school to university.  It is not on and it is not right.  We are behind the curve regarding apprenticeships and other such approaches.  I look forward to working with all members of the committee on developing a literacy skills strategy, a new apprenticeship action plan and on breaking down the barriers.  I am sure we will not agree on everything, but I hope there will be lots we do agree on and that we can work on them.</p><p> I have been asked to comment today on key issues relating to the Brexit legislation.  I will not dwell on it too long because I think the committee will be quite familiar with it.  There are fewer than 100 days to the end of the transition period.  We are focusing on our readiness in that regard.  That will require new legislation to underpin the readiness measures.  Members will recall that last year, 2019, the Brexit omnibus Act was enacted.  This Act sought to provide contingency measures to address issues arising in a no-deal, cliff-edge scenario.  As the withdrawal agreement was concluded, the majority of the provisions in the 2019 Act cannot now be commenced so we need a new Bill.  The proposed 2020 Bill is intended to deal with the permanent change that will arise at the end of the Brexit transition period.  It forms a vital part of our national Brexit readiness preparations and it tries to deal with a range of complex issues in terms of how we do our business in a post-Brexit world.</p><p> From our perspective, the matter that is of particular interest to this committee relates to the treatment of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  The provisions in the legislation are essentially of a technical nature so that is the reason I do not intend to dwell on them.  I do not think there will be much disagreement.  Grant assistance for students participating in further and higher education is provided for under the student grant scheme and student support regulations, which are published under powers contained in the Student Support Act 2011.  The student grant scheme is administered by SUSI and it provides grants to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p><p> A number of provisions contained within the 2011 Act and the associated regulations will be affected by Brexit and therefore they need to be amended before 1 January 2021 when the transition period ends.  Part 7 of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (consequential provisions) Bill 2020 will make the necessary amendments to the Student Support Act 2011.  The key amendments proposed are in respect of definitions regarding approved institutions, approved courses and student interpretation.  As colleagues will know, under the current legislation, eligibility regarding approved courses and institutions is limited to courses and institutions located in member states.  The proposed changes will widen the definitions post-Brexit to encompass the UK as a third country.  Each year, approximately 1,500 students studying in the UK and approximately 200 UK nationals studying in the State, qualify for SUSI grant support.  We want that to be able to continue but, without the proposed amendments these students will not meet the current statutory-based eligibility criteria.  The provisions in Part 7 of the Brexit omnibus Bill will address the problem by amending the Student Support Act to enable students to continue to qualify for grant support post Brexit.  That is the Brexit part.</p><p> Regarding key ministerial priorities, again I will not dwell on this too much because I think we will have a chance to pick it up during the interactions.  I acknowledge that the Department was the brainchild of the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I know it is something he championed throughout his political career.  He feels very strongly about it and so do I.  I do not think the establishment of this Department could come at a more important time.  The pandemic has upended the lives of so many people.  People have had to rethink their assumptions and their futures.  They may have lost their jobs or they may be in need of a new direction.  This Department has a responsibility to give people the best possible chance of a good future through education, either by providing a solid and resilient further or higher education foundation, or by helping people get back to work, reskilling and retraining.  We have started the work through the 35,000 additional further and higher education places provided as part of the July stimulus package.  As recently as yesterday, I announced a new Skillnet programme whereby we will retrain or reskill people who have lost their job as a result of Covid-19, in particular those who have lost jobs in hospitality and retail.  It is expected that 2,000 people will benefit from this initiative by the end of the year.</p><p> As colleagues know, we launched a new apprenticeship scheme and for the first time ever we will provide a financial incentive to any business that takes on an apprentice.  The good news is that since we launched the scheme this summer more than 800 people have taken up the opportunity and we plan to do much more in that regard.  There is also much more to do in the area of apprenticeships.  We must continue to upskill and learn and recognise that it is about lifelong learning.  Learning is not like riding a bike.  It is a muscle that we constantly need to exercise and use.</p><p> We also need to future-proof the economy and ensure people have the right skills to protect the workforce.  The Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, will drive the agenda in the Department.  We met with the regional skills fora yesterday in this regard to consider the skills needs required in each part of the country.</p><p> The other equally important twin driver of the Department is to promote social inclusion.  We must ensure that every individual, regardless of where they come from, who their parents are, what their parents do or what their gender is, has an opportunity to reach his or her full potential through a variety of education and training routes supported by the right access interventions.  As a country, we have made a lot of progress in recent years, but we are nowhere near where we need to be.  We have a lot more work to do in that regard.</p><p> It is time for a bit of blue-sky thinking.  We will come up with ideas that people will say could never be done.  People told Donogh O'Malley he could not achieve what was subsequently achieved in the context of secondary education.  We need to be ambitious in this area.  We have a significant amount of work to do.  I have highlighted the area of literacy which I think is key.  I acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has championed that, and I want to work with him on it because we cannot ensure people can take part in the economy and in society if we do not get this right.  We will publish our first ever national adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills strategy in six months' time.</p><p> I would like to talk about Covid, which I reckon will come up in the exchange, so I will not waste time on that now, but we have taken a number of interventions to protect students, staff and the quality of education during this time.  We have more to do in that regard.  Within my first few weeks of taking office, we have made changes to the student support scheme for people living in direct provision.</p><p> We introduced mandatory consent classes for incoming students.  I hope that is an area this committee could examine.  The level of sexual violence that is still being encountered by people in third level institutions today is really shocking.  There are still dinosaurs and they come in different ages, shapes and sizes and they need to be called out.  There needs to be a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence.  I need the committee's help in that regard as well.</p><p> We secured Government approval to go to tender for the PPP bundle of 11 major capital projects in the technological university and institute of technology sector.  The technological university agenda will be a major priority of ours as well.  In the research space, there is a significant amount more to do on a regional basis and a North-South basis.  I am meeting with the president of Queen's University this week and I am due to meet my counterpart in Northern Ireland this month.  We need to do more on an all-island basis.  I am interested in working with the committee on that too.</p><p> We need to review the SUSI scheme, which is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Many members have and will highlight shortcomings in the SUSI scheme.  It is a good scheme but it needs to be updated to reflect where we are at now.  I want to work with members on that as well.  That is just a brief whistle-stop tour of some of the issues.  I look forward to answering the questions of members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#B00300"><p>I welcome the two Ministers and thank them for engaging with the committee.  I also welcome the comments of the Minister on the CAO process.  Despite all the difficulties we had in implementing the system this year it still must be recognised that this year there will be more people getting their first choice than in any other year.</p><p>That must be said as it is not often heard.</p><p> I welcome the comments about apprenticeships.  I was a teacher in a DEIS school for over ten years and I suppose there is a message that a person does not need to aspire to a third level or master's degree and there are plenty of other choices for people.  That should be reinforced time and again, so I welcome those comments.</p><p> I will focus on the Brexit aspect of today's briefing.  Brexit and the exit of the UK from the EU poses significant risks and challenges to us here in Ireland.  However, in every difficulty there is also opportunity and in 2021, Ireland will be the only English language-speaking nation in the EU, which will undoubtedly serve us well in attracting thousands of international students to our shores.  Not only that but significant opportunities will present in terms of attracting other academics and staff from UK-based universities.  There is much to be optimistic about when it comes to the opportunities that may be presented to us by Brexit.</p><p> That said, Brexit poses a number of significant challenges for us.  In 2017, the number of Irish applicants hoping to study in the UK fell by 31%.  The figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service in the UK for 2018 and 2019 suggest that EU applicants as a whole to the UK are down by approximately 7%.  The decline in both Irish and EU student applications is undoubtedly connected to Brexit.  Ireland only represents 9% of the applications from the EU to third level institutions in the UK where it previously would have represented approximately 15%.  The decline in the numbers is clearly connected to Brexit.</p><p> My concern is that these consequences will place greater pressures on us at home to educate third level students.  Funding for Irish universities has increased in the past few years but almost a decade of cuts has undermined the sustainability of the higher education system in Ireland.  A deficit in funding for the sector is a significant challenge.  Despite a significant increase in third level students, leaving their number at an all-time high, the higher education sector in Ireland remains dramatically underfunded.</p><p> That said, there is opportunity for Ireland in that nearly 2,500 academics from EU countries have resigned their positions in UK universities in the past few years.  Will the Minister clarify if the UK will remain in the EU research programmes post-Brexit?  In 2017, the UK received over 15% of EU framework programme awards, as well as 20% of all European Research Council awards.  Will the Minister comment on what opportunities exist for us in Ireland to attract a portion of that investment?</p><p> Will the Minister also comment on the Erasmus programme?  The aim of this programme is not solely educational and it is also about promoting integration and mobility between EU countries.  In 2018 the UK received almost 30,000 EU students on Erasmus programmes, so will the Minister also comment on the efforts being made to attract this cohort of students to Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising these matters and for acknowledging that we have put many extra places into the college system.  It is our job to keep those places as we know the demographic pressures that will come on this sector.  I welcome his comments on apprenticeships and we could do with learning from the Deputy's expertise on the matter.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in his comments on Brexit.  Overwhelmingly, Brexit will be negative for this island and the European Union but we must look for any opportunities we can find in that very difficult environment.  The attraction of international students is one, although the pandemic has put the cat among the pigeons.  As we move beyond it, we will have a new international students strategy and will consider what the future of a sustainable model for international students in our country will look like.  The benefits of international students range beyond the monetary, and it is about diversity in education as well.</p> <p>  There will be a chance to reboot the North-South relationship and do much more with it.  For example, I am excited by proposals from Science Foundation Ireland that we could have a cross-Border research centre on infectious diseases, and what an incredible dividend that would bring to public health learning and North-South relations.  The members have heard me speak about cross-Border universities and the idea that we would work on an all-island basis if such universities did not recognise borders.  I have chatted to Deputy Conway-Walsh about some of these ideas and I have no doubt we will do that again.</p> <p>  We have more work to do on the Erasmus programme.  My first priority is to ensure every student in Northern Ireland, who has a right to be Irish and be European, can continue to access the Erasmus programme.  Just before coming to this committee hearing, I signed off on a proposal in that regard and I will consult with Government colleagues on that.  The proposal is that we would continue to provide access to Erasmus programmes for students in the North.</p> <p>  I have had meetings with the UK science minister on the research piece.  It is fair to say the UK is continuing to negotiate on where it will fit.  I hope it remains a part of the EU research infrastructure but even if it does not, we must look at how we could strengthen our bilateral relationships.  I want to maximise how we draw down on international funds and opportunities for research.  This will involve putting more boots on the ground, to be frank, locating more people in Brussels and working with European institutions.  My new Department will be doing quite a lot in that regard.</p></speech>

I share the Minister's vision and very much look forward to working with him on all the topics mentioned in his statement.  I know he understands there are a number of pressing questions I must ask.</p> <p>  The first concerns the 8,000 students who did a leaving certificate in 2018 and 2019 who were severely disadvantaged because the CAO access points increased so drastically for subjects.  The Minister knows, for example, that the early childhood care and education course at the Technological University Dublin increased by 24 points.  What has the Minister done to create a level playing field for those students?  What does he say to those leaving certificate students who have now been left at home with no college place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#C00500"><p>I look forward to working with the Deputy as well.  I am very conscious that this pandemic disadvantaged every peer group.  The Deputy could quite rightly point to the students of 2020, who have gone through a very stressful year, as have the 2019 students.  I will not use the Deputy's time but I took legal advice on the matter.  It was not possible, according to that advice, to ring-fence places for the 2019 students.  Therefore, the best legal and operational route available to me was to massively expand, at an unprecedented level, the number of available college places.  That resulted in many more people getting into college.  I accept that the Deputy could point to examples from the 2019 or 2020 class, as well as previous years, where people did not get a place.</p> <p>  The then-Government was not the first party clamouring for the leaving certificate to be cancelled and there was almost a cross-party consensus that the leaving certificate examination could not take place.  We had to respond to that on the grounds of public safety and we put in place the very best possible system.</p> <p>  We cannot have it every way.  I am confident we have the most robust system possible but I am very conscious of the individual impact it has had on people.</p></speech>

What plans does the Minister have for those students and how can he ensure fairness, even at this late stage, for them?  There is a cohort of such students, and both the Minister and I probably know some of them who are sitting at home now, feeling very disadvantaged with a real sense of injustice and unfairness.</p></speech>

They did.  Maybe we would have a different conversation if they did not.</p> <p>  The Deputy is making a point that is not unreasonable, which is that some students got an upgrade.  The very honest view was delivered by the chief inspector at last week's press conference at Marlborough Street, which was that we have a long-standing precedent in this country, which is decades old, that nobody gets downgraded.  Short of rerunning the entire process, which nobody would advocate, there is no way of determining the impact.</p> <p>  The Government, in a pandemic, thought this to be the fairest system.  Is it perfect?  No.  I am encouraged, however, that more people than ever before got places and more people got their first choice.  With the latest error that we had to deal with, and to which we do not expect to have to respond, we still managed to get everybody in.  There is a precedent that a person cannot be downgraded.</p></speech>

We should focus on that.  I say to people that there are so many routes to getting where they want to go.  We need to be able to promote and highlight that.</p><p>More people are starting university this year than in any previous year.  On top of that, there are many other routes for students to get to where they want to go.  I was talking to a student who missed out on UCD by a few points last year, did one year in further education and training and got into UCD in round zero this year.  In a pandemic year I would encourage those students to look at the full range of options available to them.</p></speech>

I can assure the committee that the USI is also engaging regularly with me on this matter.  There are two parts to the question and the answer.  One cohort of students lives in college-owned accommodation.  My very clear message to colleges is that I expect refunds to be issued in those cases.  I do not need to lecture that sector on that, if members will pardon the pun.  The authorities are already taking action.  Administrators at NUI Galway and the University of Limerick have said that if students do not use the accommodation, they will get a refund.  That should happen-----</p></speech>

Some 12,300 students have appealed their grades.  Some of them will have been upgraded following corrections but some will not.  When will students have the results of those appeals?

My job and that of my Department is to provide people with places if they make successful appeals.  We will go through exactly the same process we go through every year to make sure that anyone who has lodged a successful appeal gets an offer, ideally this year.  On the basis of the process I have just gone through I am very optimistic that there is a real willingness and ability to do that.  However, I do not yet know the outcome of that process.</p></speech>

I welcome the creation of the new Department of further and higher education, research, innovation and science.  I previously worked at NUI Galway, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  I very much appreciate the importance of research and innovation, linked with third level education, to drawing foreign direct investment and industry to Ireland.</p> <p>  I welcome the update and the detailed information the Minister has provided.  I also welcome the recent announcement of extra places in the Skillnet Ireland and Skills Connect initiatives.  More than 300 businesses have engaged with that.  Regarding apprenticeships, as the Minister said, it is very important to highlight the other opportunities available to students.  More than 2,000 students will resit their exams in November and it is very important that all students realise there are opportunities to earn and learn as an apprentice or to do things in further education.</p> <p>  I was very happy to hear the recent announcement of funding for technological universities.  This is of huge importance to regional areas.  The Connacht-Ulster Alliance is to receive &euro;5.7 million, allocated to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, IT Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  Right beside where I am based in Ballinasloe, the consortium of Athlone Institute of Technology and Limerick Institute of Technology was also awarded &euro;5 million.  I would like to ask the Minister about the timeline for the submission of applications for those technological universities and when they will be formed.  It is important to understand the real need to attract investment and industry to regional areas, particularly those areas with regional transition status.</p></speech>

I feel a bit inadequate answering her question having been reminded of her impressive CV in these areas.  I look forward to working with her.  The Senator and I have spoken about the apprenticeship issue before.  Finance is an important aspect and the funding has been widely welcomed, but it is only one piece of this.  I accept that we need to do more.  The apprenticeship action plan we are due to bring to the Government by the end of the year must also look at the other things we have to do.  To be very honest, some of the issues are cultural.  We need to look at that.  I would hope that when we have an advance copy of the plan or the complete plan - whatever the committee wishes - we could engage in some detail on what a successful apprenticeship action plan would look like.</p> <p>  Technological universities are potential game changers for regions.  Senator Byrne and I have spoken about the Technological University for the South East and Senator Dolan has referred to the Connacht-Ulster Alliance.  I am delighted that we have been able to provide funding to help these projects happen.  I understand the Connacht-Ulster Alliance consortium is hoping to make an application by the end of the year.  Once an application is lodged with me, the legislation says I have four months to appoint an international review group and then the process takes off.  We have one up and running in Dublin and another is due to open in Munster.  The next two big ones will be the Technological University for the West and North West and the Technological University for the South East.  I think they can be game changers and I really look forward to rolling them out.  They will be a major political priority for me in Government.  </p></speech>

The streamlining of further and higher education into universities and institutes through the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, levels is important for the Irish Universities Association, IUA, and third level institutes.  I would very much like to know the Department's position on the funding for the European Research Council, ERC, under Horizon Europe.  It is crucial that agencies such as Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are able to access European funding to attract the best brains to Ireland.  We must also retain the talent in Ireland.  The ERC is seen as a groundbreaking way of attracting talent from across the world.  It is also one of the important innovation factors bodies such as IDA Ireland, the State organisation for attracting investment to Ireland, can point to.  The amazing research teams that are breaking ground in many areas, including healthcare, medtech and pharmaceuticals, will attract investment here.  I would like to understand the Department's position on supporting investment in innovation and research to attract investment to Ireland, and its support for Horizon Europe.</p></speech>

In recent days we passed the milestone of &euro;1 billion in net contributions from Horizon 2020.  That is a real credit to the research community and ecosystem that exists in Ireland.  I want to acknowledge that.  Really transformational stuff is happening there.  The Covid-19 pandemic made the benefits of research very practical and a lot less abstract for all of us as we go about our lives.  We need to build on that further.  Being very honest, as I have said when engaging with stakeholders, it has been a bit siloed to date.  Perhaps the job of my new Department is to pull all of these concerns together.  The successor strategy to Innovation 2020 is due shortly.  That will be an opportunity to look at research across the full spectrum, taking note of the economic benefits and the societal good that can come from research.  Until the creation of this Department, the Irish Research Council was under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority.  Science Foundation Ireland was a part of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  Institutes of higher education were autonomous.  This is a chance to pull all of this together.  If we do that, the result will be greater than the sum of its parts.  My first objective is to draw up a successor strategy to Innovation 2020 that is comprehensive and pulls everybody together.</p> <p>  I am a little concerned about the amount of funding proposed in the overall budget at a European level.  I hope the European Parliament will be able to work on that.  I would like to see Ireland engage even more energetically at an international level through the OECD, international fora and organisations, and at a European level.  This is key to foreign direct investment.  When it comes to the jobs of the future, investors will be asking more and more about the research ecosystem in a region or country.</p></speech>

NUI Galway recently provided a very good example in the form of its translational medical device lab.  One of the youngest ever winners of an ERC starting grant is based in NUI Galway and works with medtech companies in the Galway region and University Hospital Galway.  This research developed a product for sharing ventilators.  The Galway VentShare project is now up for an award.  This really shows how investment in research and industry has an impact on our community, society and economy.  Even in this time of immense crisis and need, investment in research and innovation works for Ireland.</p></speech>

I want to echo comments on the importance of the creation of this new Department.  I am very gladdened to hear the Minister emphasise further education because it is very often overlooked.  I was also glad to hear the Minister state so clearly that there are many pathways for people to progress.</p><p>That is extremely important and I am very heartened to hear that emphasis.</p><p> I want to focus first on the Brexit element of the presentation and drill down into the data on student numbers.  There are 200 UK students in receipt of SUSI grants.  Does that capture the full number of UK students choosing to attend college in the Republic?  I ask the Minister to provide more details on fees.  At the moment non-EU students pay far higher fees.  Will that apply to UK students or will they be given a dispensation and allowed to attend at EU fee levels?  </p></speech>

On further education, it is not by accident that it is in the title.  This Department was briefly, for about 24 hours, called the Department of higher education, research and innovation or something like that but it must be further and higher education and we need that to be seamless.</p><p>On Brexit, my understanding is that the figure of 200 refers to those studying who qualify for the SUSI grant.  Of course, that number can go up and down.  It does not capture the totality of UK students, just the totality qualifying.  On fees, what we are trying to do is maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  We are trying to make sure that the relationship that is currently in place does not change.</p></speech>

I echo the concerns expressed by Deputy Conway-Walsh for the 2018-19 cohort of students.  I am sure every one of us has a story of a constituent who would have made the grade in previous years but who has now fallen short by a very slim margin.  If anything can be done for such people, that would be very welcome.</p> <p>  On the costs of attending third level in the new Covid-19 environment, good work has been done to try to close the digital divide in terms of funding hardware but I have a question regarding software.  Software for particular courses in subjects like design, for example, can be very expensive.  As I understand it, software providers were very accommodating in the last term and much of their very valuable software was provided free of charge in that interim period but that situation no longer pertains.  We are closing the digital divide to some degree by funding hardware for third level students who are now, for the most part, attending college remotely.  Are we also providing funding for software to allow students to participate fully in their courses?</p></speech>

We cannot just tell people to study online and leave them at it; we obviously need to support them.  The first step is buying the hardware and the Deputy has acknowledged that spending.  Approximately 17,000 laptops have been purchased and distributed.  That has gone well but we need to continue to do more on that front, including in further education.  We are using the student assistance fund to provide funding for students who have a connectivity issue.  I have met students who said that it is grand to receive a laptop but they cannot access the Internet.  We have made it very clear that the student assistance fund can be used to provide dongles and other devices that people might need.  I also want to explore further the possibility of developing community hubs so that if the Covid-19 situation becomes more medium-term than we would have liked, students will be able to continue to learn in their communities.</p> <p>  On software, my understanding is that the &euro;168 million Covid-related funding that we have provided to the third level sector is for things like licensing costs and so on.  I am meeting representatives of HEAnet this afternoon and will check that for the Deputy but it is my understanding that those costs are encompassed in the Covid costs.  If they are not covered or if the universities have an issue with software, I will address it.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the decades-long tradition of Irish tradespeople being welcomed all over the world because the quality of their apprenticeship training was so high.  I will refer briefly to the town centres first policy that is written into the programme for Government.  If we are to revitalise the centres of our towns and villages, there will be huge demand for people with heritage crafts and skills.  In that context, I urge the Department to engage with the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, Deputy Noonan.  If we are developing a new range of apprenticeships, we should also consider heritage apprenticeships in areas like food and heritage buildings.  If we are to revitalise our towns and villages, there will be a need for particular skill sets and there are huge opportunities there.  There are also opportunities in the retrofitting space.  Heritage skills could be put to very good use in terms of unlocking the older housing stock.  I urge the Department to include that in its work programme.</p></speech>

I encourage members to make a submission, through their parties or as individuals.  All submissions are welcome and will be seriously considered.  One of the stated goals of the Department is to expand the range of apprenticeships available.  As the Deputy knows, there are 56 at the moment, including the traditional trades to which he referred.  We must try to ramp up the different sectors within which apprenticeships can and should be offered.  Furthermore, there is a huge gender gap in the apprenticeship sector, as we all know.  Recent figures indicate that only 4% of those engaging in apprenticeships are women, which is a shocking statistic.  A major part of our focus in the apprenticeship action plan will be on ensuring that we get more balanced gender participation.  I will take up the Deputy's suggestion with regard to the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage.  I am open to correction but I think the OPW offers apprenticeships in stone masonry which would be allied to heritage work to some degree.</p></speech>

I hope to speak on a number of issues, some of which are areas of agreement while others are potentially areas of disagreement.  I will start with areas of agreement.  I was impressed with the Minister's presentation on the issues of literacy and apprenticeships.  Statistics on the levels of education among prisoners, for example, are disturbing.  Two studies in recent years showed that half of our prisoners have a junior certificate qualification or lower.  The Minister spoke about the high rate of functional illiteracy in Ireland which is one in six, meaning that around 18% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate.  That level represents an improvement in recent years but it is still disturbingly high.  The Minister spoke about members of the Traveller community and people with disabilities.  I work with the Professional Football Association of Ireland, PFAI, which has told me that one third of League of Ireland footballers have only a junior certificate as their highest qualification.  I ask the Minister to work with the Opposition on the issues of literacy and apprenticeships.  Is there potential for us to work together on the establishment of a national literacy agency, as suggested by the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA?  This would bring together all of the components, which are in eight or nine Government Departments, and put them into one single agency that could drive the issue of literacy across the board, including child, adult and family literacy.  Two Private Members' Bills were introduced in the previous D&aacute;il, one from the Government and the other from the Opposition, to provide for plain language in public documents to make them much more accessible.  Often those who need public documents most are in the cohort of people with lower literacy levels.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to comment on those points first.</p></speech>

This is a major issue.  All of us have personal experience in our families and communities of how this can be a real barrier to participation.  When we talk about basic literacy, we are talking about people not being able to read a Panadol box. and in terms of basic numeracy, we are talking about people not being able to understand their ESB bills.  This is locking people out and it is becoming intergenerational.  It is a real problem.</p> <p>  I have responsibility for prisoner education and intend to focus on that as well.  We cannot be serious about rehabilitation if we are not serious about breaking cycles of deprivation and lack of educational attainment.  I am very interested in that area.  I would sincerely love this committee to focus on the issue of literacy.</p><p>I have an open mind on the legislative change.  I have got Government approval to chair an interdepartmental group on literacy, numeracy and digital skills and I will chair my first meeting of it with next week, so we will see where that brings us.  I am conscious even in recent days of plain language.  The State needs to start copping on because we are sending out volumes of information to people and I find I often have to read it two or three times to take it in, so we need to practice what we preach as a Government.  I will be happy to work with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

On the leaving certificate, I am glad the Minister acknowledged that not everybody in the Opposition or across society was advocating for the scrapping of the written leaving certificate examinations because the Labour Party was not.  We are advocating for independent investigation into what happened this year in order that it cannot be repeated next year.  Rather than that being a point of contention between us, will the Minister speak on next year&rsquo;s cohort and what they may go through if there is an issue regarding the sitting of a written leaving certificate examination next year?  There are 60,000 students in sixth year this year who are worried about the potential for a repeat next year.  Can the Minister give some level of comfort to them that lessons have been learned from this summer that will not be repeated next summer if it comes to the point where the same decision has to be made?  We all hope it does not come to that point but some level of reassurance from the Government that lessons have been learned from this summer would be welcome because sixth year students are watching this very carefully.</p></speech>

We might disagree on what we call it but the idea that we would not review and learn in relation to this year&rsquo;s calculated grades would be bizarre to me.  I do not speak for the Minister, Deputy Foley, but I am quite sure there will be an openness in the Government to making sure that any lessons that need to be learned are learned.  This was done in real time and in crisis mode and people worked in good faith but one would be pretty stupid not to review it and see what went well, what did not go well and what needs to go better.</p> <p>  From my perspective, my job is to make sure that when a leaving certificate result, however it comes about, is processed and given to the Central Applications Office, CAO, that we have the maximum number of opportunities for people.  One of the challenges, to which I am sure the Deputy will hold me to account, is that we have greatly expanded the number of places in college this year.  That helped a lot.  These are not just numbers; they did get more people into college.  We need to try to make sure we do not create a bubble effect next year.  There are budgets coming up and so on but I need to try to maximize the number of places available for the class of 2021.  I assure them that is what I will do.  </p></speech>

Second, a cohort of students is moving into student accommodation because they have attendance requirements for their courses and do not have sufficient broadband at home.  Will the Minister give some guidance or give us some comfort that he will be giving guidance to higher level institutions that there will be understanding in that regard and that attendance requirements being online or in person will be relaxed?  This will mean students will not have to make decisions that will be extremely costly because of the quality of the broadband they have at home, their inability to have remote access to lectures and the cost of accommodation.  We hope the Minister will work with the third level institutions to iron these issues out.  There has to be some accommodation for what they are going through.</p></speech>

I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing that the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education was a Minister for Health but I can assure students and staff that I will take a very cautious approach to the issue of on-site attendance in the interests of people&rsquo;s health.  I have met the unions and will be meeting them again tomorrow.  I have met the leaders of the higher education institutions.  I meet the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, on a regular basis.  Health has to come first, second and third in this regard and then next, and very quickly, has to be the quality of the education.  I  am very encouraged by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, report that showed that despite the extraordinary emergency situation in which staff had to work and students had to learn, the quality of education attainment held up.  I am also conscious that the longer that goes on, the more challenging it becomes.</p> <p>  I will give just two quick answers that are important.  At the moment, we are in the middle of a three-week period whereby the then acting Chief Medical Officer asked us to put extra precaution measures in place.  We are due to review that in the next few days and to work with education partners to decide what the rest of the semester looks like.  The second issue, a very valid one, is on connectivity.  I have a meeting this afternoon with HEAnet on how we can improve connectivity.  We have good connectivity on-site.  Is there a way of getting some of that off-site?  Some of it might be funding through the student access fund; some of it might be more ambitious.  Is it possible - I do not yet know the answer to this - to create community learning hubs where people can learn in their community and have good access there if they cannot get on-site?  I will be asking or instructing, whichever is appropriate, higher education institutions to use common sense in terms of not wanting people to travel but of them not losing out.  I do not think they need to be instructed because they are showing leadership on this. </p></speech>

More broadly, I thank the further and education sector, which has responded in innovative ways to this crisis, in particular, as the Minister has addressed, to provide 424 places in a very short  time and to overcome the difficulties involved in that.  I thank the Minister for the announcement of the multi-annual technological university transformation fund, in particular the &euro;5.1 million announced for the university of the south east yesterday.  The Minister was correct in his response to Senator Dolan earlier about how transformational that could be, particularly in terms of regional development.  One other small step that the Minister and the Minister of State took was the change to ensure children of asylum seekers who are here and who are offered a college place are no longer treated as international students.  It was a small but very welcome and positive step.  I share the concerns others have raised and I think it is important that we continue to consider the leaving certificate classes of 2019 and before.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator Dolan about the European Research Council, ERC, and I welcome the fact that the Minister is talking about greater collaboration with European institutions.  In a post-Brexit scenario, we need to look at greater collaboration there.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh was correct about the opportunities with regard to retrofitting but not just in terms of apprenticeships in that area.  Many of the facilities in our higher and further education institutions need to be retrofitted and it is an easy win in terms of energy gains as a programme.</p> <p>  I will focus on a number of questions.  When the Minister came before the Seanad, there were two specific issues I raised.  I had raised them previously with the Minister&rsquo;s Department and I followed up with the Department and I still do not have answers on them.  The Minister may be able to provide the answers to these two specific questions.  One relates to support for student nurses and midwives.  I know the Minister is very much aware of the issue.  The other is the question around insurance for international students which has been running for a while.  The Minister&rsquo;s office has been helpful but I still have not got answers from his Department so perhaps on those two issues the Minister can offer some clarity.</p></speech>

I want to make sure I say as clearly as the Senator did that there is a huge "Thank you and congratulations" due to the higher education sector.  We in this room can and do call for things but the amount of graft that has been undertaken in the last week in particular and over the past few months, has been incredible and I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  We are going to get the technological university for the south east done and we will work together.  On asylum seekers, there was a huge amount work done by officials in my Department.  The Irish Refugee Council have been calling for this.  It is only a first step.  On retrofitting, the Senator is right.  We can be as ambitious as we want on retrofitting but we must also have the skills and he is also right to say we should practice what we preach and look at our own institutions.</p> <p>  On the insurance issue, my understanding is that arising from a court case this week, there is engagement, as we speak, with the sector representative bodies, with the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality as we seek to resolve the matter.  The preferred objective is an outcome where the market operates to provide the necessary insurance cover at an acceptable price.  This is a free market we live in and the insurance companies, in my view, need to help us here.  There is engagement going on as we speak between my Department and the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality and I will keep the Senator updated on that.</p> <p>  On the student nurses and midwives, when I was in a previous role we were very clear that we offered people contracts as healthcare assistants and we reached an agreement with the educational institutions that this would be recognised as part of their educational attainment.  In truth, the policy solution here does not lie within my Department but I have asked my Department to engage with the Department of Health on this issue.  The HSE is the employer in most cases.  It is entirely right and proper from a public health point of view that people say one cannot work in a hospital and then in a nursing home or anywhere else at the weekend for fear of spreading the virus.  I get that.</p><p>Nevertheless, I understand the financial challenges, so my Department is actively engaging with the Department of Health.  I am glad my office is being helpful.  As soon as we have an outcome, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or I will be back before the committee.</p></speech>

I hope the HSE, as the employer, can show flexibility.  There has to be a way.  We are spending vast sums on this pandemic and there has to be a way, within that very large sum of additional money the Government has allocated for Covid costs to health, that this group of students can be supported.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan, raised the issue of Erasmus+.  Given that it is intended that the Erasmus+ budget will increase by 55%, that presents a major opportunity for Ireland.  A campaign is needed here to encourage Irish students to take up Erasmus+ in much greater numbers.  The SFI centre, which the Minister mentioned in regard to North-South co-operation, is welcome but we need to look at many more such initiatives.</p> <p>  There are possibilities in that regard.  Joint professorships, both North-South and east-west, need to be considered.  We share common quality assurance systems and the peer-review culture between the two islands is very similar.  Work has been done by the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, the Royal Irish Academy and others, but there is an opportunity at the heart of the Department to look at how we can foster greater North-South, east-west co-operation while, at the same time, encouraging European collaboration.</p></speech>

When I was in the Department of Health, I saw the very significant collaboration that exists.  Cancer patients from Donegal travel to Altnagelvin Area Hospital and sick children from Northern Ireland have life-saving surgery at Crumlin hospital.  It works.  The island does not care about politics, and neither does health or education.  We have to make this work.  In a city such as Derry, there is very considerable potential to do more, as there is in the north west of the island.  There has been a recognition of that from university presidents, North and South.  I had engagement on this with Universities Ireland this week and have indicated to the Taoiseach my wish to engage with the shared island unit within his Department for some of the North-South expertise.</p> <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh and I have spoken about this.  For me, it is not a political issue.  It is not a green or orange issue but rather one of pragmatism, common sense and win-win for North, South and the island of Ireland . Particularly in the context of Brexit, from a research point of view our access to the European Union will be of benefit.  I am really up for it.  While I will have to engage with partners in the North and beyond, the committee could perhaps again be useful in that regard.</p></speech>

I hope that the Department achieves what we all want it to achieve and that it is a new dawn for further and higher education.</p> <p>  I will begin with a point rather than a question, although the Minister can respond if he wishes.  It relates to his previous Department.  Anywhere in the country one will hear of delays in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, psychology services and so on.  Mental health issues are significant.  The fundamental problem is there are not enough psychiatrists or psychologists, although that is partly a worldwide problem.  From speaking to people who have completed psychology courses, many of them want to be psychologists but cannot afford it.  The opportunities for them to get fully funded places where they can get clinical experience are just not adequate.  Unless someone is from a wealthy background, the option is not there or, if it is, it requires a circuitous route and many people do not take it.  That is an issue we need to crack if we are serious about reducing waiting lists and giving people the opportunities to be psychologists or psychiatrists.</p> <p>  We called for all students to get a place this year.  I welcome the fact that the Government made that decision and commend it.  The Minister identified the work of the higher education institutions, which was extraordinary in managing to achieve that, and I also commend them.  We cannot, however, dismiss the issue of students who were squeezed out.  We do not know how many there are at this point but the figure is potentially significant.  It seems the Government is considering legal action, and while I do not wish for that, it seems to be objectively the case that if such students can demonstrate they missed out on places, they will have been disadvantaged by the error.  Objectively, therefore, an injustice will have been done to them.  Can any of us be surprised if a court decides they should be awarded deferred places?  We need to examine this.  Perhaps there is some opportunity in the places that will be offered to students who sit the exams in two months.  I do not know whether some kind of mathematical exercise can be done to determine what the points would have been if that error had not occurred and whether they could be given places next year on the strength of that.  Is the Minister considering that and does he think there is scope for it in the November offers?</p></speech>

During the past week, we have been working to get additional places identified and people have been great in that regard, but the idea that there are caps on the numbers of people who can be taken into courses, given that there are shortages in the public service, seems a bit peculiar.  It is an interesting point and I will revert to the Deputy on the issue of psychiatry and psychology.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his comments about all students getting places this year and will pass them on to the higher education institutions that deserve those thanks and gratitude.  I accept his point that this year, the system was imperfect.  I accept that some students in the system now may be looking at the television wondering whether they would have got a place if something else had happened, but I would counter that with a couple of points.</p> <p>  The first is that it has been an extraordinary pandemic year and this was the best response that could have been put in place.  Second, the additional places undoubtedly provided more opportunities for all students, irrespective of the number of points they ended up with.  Third, the percentages of students getting their first, second or third place offers are all in line with or better than in previous years.  It is not for me to comment on matters for the Department of Education and Skills - I have to get the division of responsibilities right - but I heard what the chief inspector, Mr. Hislop, said the other night about how little could be done short of going back and running the system all over again, which would displace existing students.  There is no perfect solution.  There is a long-standing precedent, going back decades, that nobody gets downgraded.  While I accept the Deputy is not advocating for that-----</p></speech>

My point is that it may become the case that it can be demonstrated that students were disadvantaged by the error.  However it came to be, there was an error and it is probably the case that some students were disadvantaged.</p> <p>  We do not seek to run the CAO competition again but will it be possible, when places are offered in November, to run a mathematical exercise to determine what the points might have been if the error had not occurred, thereby allowing those students who missed out on places, despite being eligible for them, to be offered a deferred place?  I do not see any reason that cannot happen, although there are obviously other considerations, including the leaving certificate class of 2021, which is an important one.  I would nonetheless like the Minister to explore it because there may be scope in the November offers to resolve some of these issues.  I do not know how significant the error is and I do not believe that he does either-----</p></speech>

I raised this matter with SOLAS previously.  Much of what has been said about apprenticeships is very welcome.  It is about culture change but also investment.  By the same token that perhaps higher education did not get the focus it should have in the Department of Education and Skills, we need to ensure that further education will not be neglected in the new Department either.  The matter I raised with SOLAS relates to electrical instrumentation.  The industry cannot get enough apprentices.  It is a great trade, although it is not an easy one to get through and in which to get one's papers, but there is significant scope for apprentices.  There is considerable demand from employers but not enough people are taking it up.  I would, therefore, prioritise that if possible.</p> <p>  The other type of apprenticeship, if the committee will permit me to be parochial, relates to a facility in Cork that used to provide apprenticeships in both general painting and decorative painting skills, which are used in film production, signage and all sorts of different things.  Neither course is being offered and the facility is lying idle.  People who wish to paint in Cork, Kerry, Waterford or wherever have to travel to Dublin to take such courses, which makes no sense.  It is an awful waste and it is probably discouraging people from taking up painting apprenticeships in Cork.  The facility is there, and while I think it is used for some evening classes, it is mostly idle.  Can we get that back, along with painting apprenticeships in Cork?</p></speech>

One of the things we are going to have to do is to look at the public sector; it cannot be a case of: "Do as I say, but not as I do."  There is untapped potential for the public sector to do a lot more in terms of apprenticeships, and this issue was raised with me in the Seanad a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>  On the leaving certificate calculated grades, as the Deputy, in fairness, somewhat implied or acknowledged, for every move or countermove, there is a knock-on effect.  That is something of which the Minister for Education and Skills is going to be very conscious.  I will certainly pass on the Deputy's comments to her, but I have no doubt the Deputy will also raise them with her himself.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for raising the issue of consent, and I welcome his call today for this committee to examine it and to work with him on the issue.  To pick up on the point he made on the amount of sexual violence in third level institutions,  I would like to say that that is where we know the problem exists.  A survey was completed earlier this year of more than 6,000 students, and it is from that study that this consent package has been put together.  I know that the staff and students have been working on this active consent programme in NUI Galway for many years.  That survey found that 29% of females, 10% of males, and 28% of non-binary students had reported that they had experienced rape or something similar.  There is a real opportunity to look at the issue, not from the perspective of third level institutions, but to say that this is where we are putting in place the education that will inform students for the rest of their lives.  I would like to hear what the Minister feels this committee could contribute beyond the very welcome launch of the active consent programme in NUI Galway, which he attended.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the huge leadership shown by NUI Galway, along with UCC, particularly with the by-stander and active consent programmes.  I am conscious that every time I put a spotlight on this issue, it is not to in any way take away from the very good work being done by some people within the institutions, but more to try to support them.</p> <p>  I fully agree with the Senator's point on this issue.  When I talk about this issue, I do not talk about it as though it is a specific problem that is confined to higher education - far from it.  However, I am aware that there is a big issue in higher education, and education can lead in this.  Education should be a place of safety, inclusion and tolerance, and it should also be a place of learning.  Promoting positive consent in third level education is something that can help this transcend into society, which can only be a good thing.</p> <p>  In terms of how this committee can help, we have good guidelines in place but guidelines that are not implemented at a local or institutional level are no use to anybody.  I have written to each university president, indeed my first correspondence with them was on this issue.  I have asked them to produce an action plan on how they, in their own individual colleges, intend to tackle the issue of sexual violence, specific to their institutions.  That is one thing that this committee could help play an oversight role in.</p> <p>  I also intend to expand the role of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on monitoring this.  People take things more seriously if they are monitored or measured against something, and that will help.  I am very grateful to NUI Galway and the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, for doing that excellent survey but I do not think it should fall to students or a university to do this.  This State should be doing this, so we intend to carry out and publish a survey and to monitor in this area.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge Dr. Aoibheann N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in's leadership on this issue.  She has met with me on a number of occasions and is very determined - as am I - that we drive changes through her own story and experience that she bravely and kindly shared with us.</p> <p>  We also need to change the composition of people that we put on governing authorities; I have tried to show good faith on this.  The only skillset should not be being able to count numbers; it has to be broader that that.  That is why I appointed Noeline Blackwell, CEO of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, to sit on the governing authority of UCD.  Our institutions are terribly male.  I am conscious-----</p></speech>

I am relieved to hear the Senator sits on one.  Through ministerial appointments, we have a chance to send a message about this issue, and we have to do so.  We know about it now, and nobody can claim ignorance or say they did not know.  There is a real issue here and we have a chance to resolve it.  It is cultural, but it is also a matter of every parent in Ireland wanting to know that when their child goes to college, they are safe.  If we get this right, it will be reputationally enhancing for the institutions, not the other way around.  Parents will want their kids to go somewhere where they will be safe and respected; students will want to go there themselves.  Hearing from some of the people I have, like Dr. Louise Crowley in UCC who runs the by-stander programme, and Dr. P&aacute;draig MacNeela in NUI Galway who runs the active consent programme, there are real leaders in this area, and the USI has led.  I would welcome the committee's view on what should be included in action plans and how we should be monitoring them, so it could help play an oversight role in that regard.</p></speech>

On the north-west region, I know the very welcome investment was mentioned by Senator Dolan earlier.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the report by the Northwest Regional Assembly that showed that the funding is &euro;141 per head for the north-west region in comparison to &euro;197 for the other regions, and also that Europe has downgraded only that region from being a developed region to a region in transition.  How far along the trajectory does the Minister feel he is in terms of this amount of funding in bringing the north-west region to the same level as the rest, because there is an inequality there currently?  The only way to bring investment to the area in economic terms is if we invest in education.</p></speech>

I would suggest to the Senator a technological university for Connacht-Ulster should be established.  The Connacht-Ulster Alliance Consortium, CUAC, is the potential answer to that, because with that will come funding and scale, which we really need.  The cross-Border piece, particularly in the north-west, when I look at the map of the island of Ireland, it seems to me to be a no-brainer that there is the potential to do more in that regard.  I would really like to see the application from the consortium for the technological university for the north west to arrive as soon as possible.  I know there is a huge amount of work being done on it as we speak, and I thank them for that.  During the lifetime of this Government, if we can deliver for the south east and the north west, if one looks at the map of Ireland, it will be much more regionally balanced from an education and research point of view.</p></speech>

There are great challenges involved in being Ministers in a very new Department for the first time, but there are also great opportunities.  I regard both Ministers as a dynamic duo, so I expect to see great achievements by both of them in this new Department.</p> <p>  I will start with the Minister, Deputy Harris.  It is not so much a question as a request for the Minister to reflect on an issue.  Thousands of students have commenced in third level institutions and institutes of further education over the past few weeks.  We need to recognise that they are starting courses under very unusual circumstances.  We cannot shy away from the fact that they are missing out on a huge part of their life experiences as a result of not being able to be engaged on campus.  Instead a lot of them are attending lectures via zoom calls or remotely into their bedrooms.  It is important that we offer them some hope and that they recognise that the situation will not be like this indefinitely, and they will be able to get back control of their lives.  Can the Minister say anything to these students to give them that hope and to tell them that he recognises they are missing out on important developments in their lives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#H01300"><p>I thank the Deputy and appreciate him raising the issue because people do need hope.  We focused a lot, quite rightly, on the impact of the pandemic on older people but I am not sure we have given the same voice, as the Deputy has, to the impact of the pandemic on younger people.  Students studied for exams that never took place in respect of the leaving certificate; the final days and months in school were missed; debs and graduations were cancelled; and the excitement of going to college is being put on hold.</p><p>This takes a toll on people.  I point out to students that this is not forever.  We are taking this semester-by-semester.  We constantly look for more opportunities to do things on site.  We have not locked the doors of universities as we did in March.  Libraries are open.  Practicals can take place.  Small groups of students can be brought in for tutorials.  I have endorsed the USI campaign because the terribly "lecture-y" attitude going on that students need to shut the door and not come out is not helpful.  Finger wagging from all of us is not helpful.  USI have a very good campaign: "Keep it safe; keep it small; keep your distance."  Students need to be able to socialise, but just need to do it in a safe way.  The Chief Medical Officer has also endorsed that campaign.  This is not forever.</p><p> It is okay to feel fragile at this time.  In many ways we all do.  There is a 24-7 text line for any student or indeed for any of us.  We should all make that number famous and ensure all students have it in their phones, knowing they can reach out for help.</p></speech>

What would the Minister like to achieve when it comes to putting in place a reliable and secure method of funding for third level institutions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#J00300"><p>I think as a political system we have shirked our responsibilities on this for far too long.  There is a sense of "is there anything to be said for another report?"; that seems to be the echo that comes from this place from all parties.  Mr. Cassels did a very good body of work.  An all-party committee met and decided to refer it for an economic evaluation.  My predecessors have now commended that with European Commission input, and it is due back at the start of 2021.  I want to settle the question during my time here.  I want the Government to settle the question.  Core funding for higher education is too low.  Equally, cost is a barrier and we cannot have either.</p> <p>  My instinct is not to pre-empt what is to come out of the report - I do not like the idea of the student loan attached to education.  There might be some merit in being able to take out a student loan to help with some of the costs of being a student.  I do not like the idea of students emerging from third level education heavily indebted.  We need to regard an undergraduate degree as a continuation of our education system and then provide better financial supports for people at a postgraduate level.  Next year, 2021, needs to be the year in which we settle this question.</p></speech>

I, like other members of this committee, have been contacted by organisations concerned about the increase in insurance costs for international students in Ireland.  Without getting into it in too much detail, can the Minister give those institutions any updated information that might alleviate some of the concerns they have?</p></speech>

My understanding is this arises from a court ruling.  This week the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality and my Department are engaging.  As I said earlier in this meeting, it is my preference that the operators step up and provide access to affordable insurance.  Considerable engagement is going on behind the scenes in that regard.  As this has come up a few times, I will endeavour to get a note on its status to this committee next week.</p></speech>

We need to have a mechanism to allow young people in school to recognise that if they do well in certain courses in the leaving cert they can see an avenue through to apprenticeships in the same way as other students who are successful academically see an avenue through to medicine.  The Ministers may not be able to answer that.  Is that part of the vision they both see for the Department?</p></speech>

That is a big part of it.  I was in a DEIS school in my constituency recently.  There is brilliant leadership in that school in presenting the full range of options to students.  I think the CAO application process narrows the conversation far too quickly.  We keep saying that further education training is great but when we sit down around the kitchen table with our kids, we hand them the CAO form and we talk about higher education.  We need to broaden the conversation and that is part of it.</p></speech>

It is about destigmatising the notion and concept of apprenticeships and some of the courses and options available in the further education sector.  For people who do not get their first choice or their desired choice, it is not about taking a step backwards to go forwards, it is about taking a step sideways to move forward again.  Opportunities are there as the Minister, Deputy Harris, outlined in his opening remarks, where people who do not get their first choice can take a different option and achieve their desired course in the higher education institute.</p> <p>  There are now apprenticeship offerings in financial services, digital marketing and digital skills.  It is moving into the new spheres, getting away from the traditional apprenticeships which some people look down their noses on.  We all have a role to play in giving leadership and changing the mindset.  We also need to educate people who contact us. The cancellation of the written leaving cert and the move to calculated grades has resulted in an increase in the number of people contacting us who have been disappointed that they have not achieved their desired course because of the pressure and the bit of grade inflation that we know about.  When we point out the options, we find that many of them have not researched the available options to achieve what they want. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#J00900"><p>I welcome the Ministers and apologise if some of this has been covered already.  I am mindful that we now have two Ministries for education.  I was and remain a sceptic as to the justification for splitting it in that way.  I have no doubt about the Minister's ability, tenacity and zeal in carrying out his mission with his portfolio.</p> <p>  He mentioned the focus that the CAO process provides.  It has the effect of narrowing the range of options.  I agree with everything that has been said about the need to destigmatise apprenticeships to promote alternatives to traditional academic third level options having regard to the needs the country has and so on.  Is it not also fair to say that the points system as it has operated has also narrowed the focus extraordinarily and that we need a radical review of how the leaving cert is operating to shape people's minds?  With the broader focus on education, education for life, wisdom and so forth, do we not increasingly have a leaving cert focus that emphasises skills perhaps to the detriment of wider education?  Do we need to consider change in that area also?</p></speech>

I do not want to stray too much into the Department of Education and Skills.  I take the point he makes that despite all the difficulties we have had this year with calculated grades - I accept there have been many - but in one way I wonder of some this year's students have obtained a place in third level that they might not have obtained had they gone through the traditional leaving cert exam because their teachers who know their passion and their past experience have been able to grade them.  That has gone through all the safeguards and checks of the standardisation process.  In that way it is fair to say there is no perfect system, including the leaving cert exam.</p> <p>  I have not done enough thinking on this to give the Senator a fair answer.  I think there is a need for a broad conversation about how we move young adults from our secondary education system to the career pathway they want to be on.</p> <p>  I do not want to take the Senator's time but, on the apprenticeship model, even now we still sometimes talk about the traditional apprenticeships - by the way they are very important and there is a skills shortage - in some apprenticeships it is possible to do a masters for the apprenticeship.  We actually have a doctoral level apprenticeship now.  When I was a Minister of State, I met a chief executive officer of a bank in Germany who came to the bank as an apprentice and ended up being the CEO of a big bank.  It is about a diversity of pathways.  There is something in what he said. </p></speech>

We are facing into a very difficult period financially in the medium term and all sorts of good things need public funding.</p><p>Those who avail of a third level education have their chances greatly improved in life.  It improves their chances of prosperity and a very successful livelihood and so on.  Is it not reasonable that we would at least begin a debate about coming up with a system involving the financing of third level education through a system of student loans that are different from other loans in that the repayments and the extent and requirements thereof would be contingent on the eventual earning power of the college student?  Do we not need to have a conversation about student loans?</p></speech>

We are having one.  In many ways, Mr. Cassells sparked or gave voice to that conversation when he presented his three options.  As of now, those options are being economically evaluated, as was requested by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  That is due back to me in 2021.  I hope 2021 will be the year we settle the question of what a sustainable model of funding looks like.  My personal view is a little different to that of the Senator in that regard.  I think we should be trying to move into the space where undergraduate courses are an extension of the education system we have in primary and secondary schools and then look at how the State can financially support people, in terms of grants and so on, when they go beyond that.  However, I will not pre-empt the findings of the report.</p></speech>

The pledge was, effectively to honour the requirements of social distancing and all the related restrictions that are particularly important for the student cohort.  I do not wish to demonise any section of the community, but members know some sectors of the community may need to be reminded more than others about the need for safety at this time.  The university stood down from that requirement, which was surprising.  It became more of a voluntary commitment.  I believe universities are within their rights to make it a condition of registration that people sign up to such a pledge.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#K00400"><p>I would apply the same logic.  After golfgate, I wonder whether Members of the Oireachtas should have to sign a similar pledge.  There were no young people at that event.  I do not think such behaviour is confined to one age group.  However, I take seriously the point made by the Senator because, although it is a good thing to socialise and mix and all members know students will wish to so do, if it is not done in an appropriate way, it can be very dangerous.  We have seen much evidence of that in third level sectors, such as in Galway.  Universities are well within their rights as a condition of registration to consider all of those matters.  I note prompt action was taken by University College Cork, UCC, in recent weeks when it was concerned that some people were risking public health and public safety.  I have endorsed the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, campaign, as did the Chief Medical Officer.  It is a very good campaign that recognises that people will socialise but encourages them to do so safely in small groups while keeping their distance.  The regulations of a university are a matter for it and its governing authority.</p></speech>

I direct my questions to the Minister and the Minister of State.  I refer to the Department's funding model for third level institutions.  There is a significant drop-off in the number of international students this year.  Many third level institutions will not have the same amount of funding from international students as they did previously.  How will the Department fill that gap?</p> <p>  To follow on from the points made by Senator Mullen and other members on student loans, a wider debate is needed on the very different funding models in Europe and elsewhere.  I am a believer in the Australian model.  I acknowledge that not all members will agree with me in that regard.  We need a sustainable model of funding, but we also need sustainable options.  We should not decide on just one model as the way forward.  There must be several options because not all models will fit various families and students.  A suite of options must be available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#K00600"><p>All present will agree there is a need for a sustainable funding model for higher education.  Such a model is not currently in place.  That might be where agreement ends because there are diverse views on the matter.  I have heard a few of those views already at this meeting.  I suggest that we should be guided but not bound by the report the previous Oireachtas asked the Department of Education and Skills to commission on foot of the Cassells report.  That was due back at the end of this year but Covid has delayed it, as it has everything else.  It is now due back at the start of 2021.  When the report is received, I expect there will be extensive conversations on it at this committee.  I am sure the committee will wish to hear from its authors and so on.</p> <p>  The SUSI grant system already results in more than 40% of students not paying a registration fee, which is a good thing.  The Chairman is correct.  We need to have a sustainable funding model and ensure there are no barriers to access.  I am a little concerned that worries about leaving college with debt may be a barrier for some students or families.  I would be very cautious or nervous in that regard because people may be fearful of that idea.  It is not a political point - Deputy Conway-Walsh and I have debated this previously - to state that the system in place in the North is not one the Deputy would wish to have replicated in the South.  I would not like it to be replicated in the South either.  We need to tease our way through this issue.  I expect we will spend a lot of time discussing this issue in 2021.</p></speech>

I very much welcome that appointment.  I ask for the Minister's full commitment and that of his Department in the coming months because it is a part of the country that does not have a university, although it has institutes of technology in Waterford and Carlow.  We must build towards that university.  There is a significant job of work ahead of us.  Much work has been done in recent months.  I welcome the funding announced yesterday.  It is good for balanced regional development.  I know the Minister is committed to the project and I ask that he and his Department maintain that level of commitment.</p> <p>  The committee will undertake an examination of key issues around bullying in schools, Internet security and so on.  Representatives from DCU will be appearing before the committee in the coming weeks.  The examination is in support of the first UN International Day against Violence and Bullying at School Including Cyberbullying, which will be on 5 November.  I ask the Minister's Department to support that initiative.</p> <p>  The Minister announced a comprehensive financial package of &euro;5 million.  How can he be sure that funding will be used to recruit additional student counsellors and assistant psychologists, as well as other measures for the benefit of students' mental health?</p> <p>  There is a significant drug misuse problem in third level institutions.  Is the Minister or his Department doing any work on drug misuse?  I acknowledge that the Department was only recently set up. Students should be tested.  I am not sure whether there is any on-site testing.  It may be needed if we are to take on the challenge of drug misuse.  Third level presidents and staff members have openly told me it is a significant challenge.  Has the Minister put any thought into tackling the issue of drug misuse in third level institutions?</p> <p>  I will have a question for the Minister of State after the Minister has replied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.547" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2020100800002#K00800"><p>On the technological university for the south east, my Department and the Government as a whole are very committed to its delivery.  As I stated when I briefed Oireachtas Members representing the south east this week on a cross-party basis, there is a significant body of work that needs to be done in the coming weeks and months.  It is important to have a clear understanding of the key dates in the process.  I am due to meet the presidents of the two institutions, the chairs of the governing authorities, Mr. Boland and his team this month.  They are expected to present the project plan to me, laying out how they intend to get from here to the opening of the doors of a new university.  I intend to bring that to the Government and publish it thereafter, probably in November.  I will arrange for Oireachtas Members representing the south east to be briefed on the plan in advance of its publication.  The plan will have a target date of the consortium submitting an application to me, as Minister, by next summer.  If it does so by that date, the legislation states that I must appoint an independent review panel within four months.  Mr. Boland would like to see the new university open its doors on 1 January 2022.  There is many a slip between cup and lip.  All of this is contingent on a significant body of work being undertaken by a wide variety of people at each stage.</p><p>They are the three dates.  The project plan will be in October, application next summer and doors open 1 January 2022.  That has to be the roadmap but there is a long way to get from each of those steps and we will be taking an active interest in that.  The funding announced yesterday was an example of how we want to help facilitate that change management and the huge amount of work that needs to be done.</p><p> On the mental health funding, we have provided &euro;5 million in additional funding, &euro;2 million of which, in fairness, was announced in the last budget, with &euro;3 million of it being new.  That &euro;5 million has been given out to each institution through the Higher Education Authority.  I can get the committee a note on the breakdown for each institution.  It is to do exactly as the Chairman said.  Students tell me that the mental health services, when they can access them, are good.  The issue is getting access to them.  The idea is to increase the capacity and the number of student counsellors and specialists working in the sector.</p><p> On the issue of drug use, my view, coloured very much by my view as a former Minister for Health, is that there can be a significant link between drug use and mental health and well-being and I believe education is our most powerful tool to overcome that.  A good deal of work needs to be done through our education system in third level, and not just third level, about the dangers of drug use, which needs to be led by students rather than us lecturing the students.</p><p> The Chairman referenced the fact that this committee will be holding hearings on bullying.  While I am clear and very protective of the fact that this is a separate and distinct Department from the Department of education, I have no doubt there will be areas where there will be significant overlaps.  The programme for Government commits to a Traveller education strategy.  I have met Pavee Point.  That has to include the work of the Department of education and my Department and, I believe, the Department of children, disability, equality and integration.  Issues such as mental health, bullying, sex education and consent do not neatly fit in one Department and my Department and officials will be very willing to help this committee in its work on any of those issue.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Niall Collins, should be aware that additional time will be made available to allow more Deputies contribute.</p> <p>  Regarding apprenticeships in the hospitality sector, I have spoken to a number of hoteliers on this issue in the past few months since this new Department was set up and there is a real focus on apprenticeships.  I refer to the need to reboot the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic.  We saw the way the hospitality sector assisted the economic recovery following the financial crash but following that there was a huge shortage of chefs, jobs in areas of hotel management and so on.  I believe the hotel and catering college is still operating in Shannon, County Clare, and before that we had CERT.  My constituency office, and I am sure it is the case with other members' constituency offices also, has had contact from chefs in other countries who are trying to come here to work in hotels but who are facing work visa issues and so on.  I ask the Minister of State, who has responsibility for apprenticeships, to look at the area of chefs specifically because when we come out the other side of the Covid-19 pandemic the hotel and hospitality sector will be hugely important in the recovery of our economy.  It is an area the Minister of State might be able to work on with the hotel and hospitality sector.  I hope to bring the representatives of the sector before this committee in the coming 12 to 18 months to get their views on that because it has been raised with me.</p></speech>

That issue has been raised with me.  I am sure it has been raised with the Minister, Deputy Harris, every member of the committee and beyond that.  It is a concern I have had for a number of months.  The Irish Hotels Federation raised it in its communications to me and it was raised also by the Restaurants Association of Ireland.  I have had preliminary discussions on it with SOLAS.  I have asked it to examine the issue in terms of drafting of the new action plan for apprenticeships, so I am acutely aware of it and I will follow it up.</p></speech>

To go back to the laptops, the colleges and universities are using the SUSI criteria to distribute the laptops.  I do not believe that is fair.  I asked the Minister about that at a very early stage and he said that would not be part of the criteria.  I am particularly concerned about people on very modest incomes, many of whom are front-line workers.  Will he talk to the colleges and get them to reassess that and not base it on eligibility for a SUSI grant?</p></speech>

We have given the higher education institutions discretion on the basis that they would know best who needs them but I am very clear that there should not be a rigid application in that someone can only have one if they have a SUSI grant.  I will follow that up and if the Deputy has examples I am happy to talk to her offline on it.</p></speech>

With regard to the 2,800 students who plan to sit the leaving certificate in November, can the Minister give an assurance that the CAO points for 2021 will return to a balanced state?  I am conscious that they are going into an examination and they need some hope.  Will the Minister send a message to those students?</p></speech>

I want the students to know that my aim will be to continue to maximise the number of opportunities that they have when the CAO issues its offers next autumn.  It is important that my Department, and the Department of education, reflect on the fact that in many ways there is a bubble effect now because we have had a very unusual year this year, to put it mildly, and the Deputy has rightly highlighted the effect that has had on people from 2018, 2019 and 2020.  We need to make sure that this is managed, so to speak, out of the system in a careful way.  Now that we are nearly through this year's CAO process, I will give that active consideration with my officials in terms of how best we can help.  The answer from my perspective will be to maximise the college places.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, and her Department, will have a job of work to do in terms of maximising it from that Department also.  The Deputy is rightly highlighting issues about 2019.  We need to be very conscious, as she is, of the class of 2021 also.  I am acutely aware of it and I am beginning work on it now.</p></speech>

I very much welcome what the Minister said about the Connacht Ulster Alliance and the progression of that but I am very concerned that the business element has been taken from the Mayo campus at GMIT.  That makes no sense to me because of the importance of GMIT both in terms of education and but also the development of Mayo, and Castlebar in particular.</p></speech>

I know it is complex and that there are all sorts of considerations but I am trying to be constructive and I believe there is something in it.</p> <p>  I would also touch on a point raised in the exchange between the Minister and Senator Mullen.  I take the point.  My experience, and it is true in Cork, is that there were students who were acting the tool and creating a lot of issues for residents.  However, the people from the USI and the students union in Cork have done incredible work in Cork.  They do excellent work with the Garda and I want to pay tribute to them because they cannot be held responsible.  They have done everything in their power to try to minimise that and I believe they have made progress in recent years in Cork.</p> <p>  I have two final issues to raise.  On the issue of SUSI, which the Minister referred to, it falls under a number of layers.  I am not sure the amount of funding is enough but there is a major issue with the thresholds.  There are many people on relatively low incomes who do not qualify for the full grant.  In fact, the threshold to qualify for the full grant is very low.  Many people get a bit of funding from SUSI but it is not enough to allow them be able to survive on any reasonable level.  That needs to be addressed because there is a graduated approach, which makes sense, but it starts at far too low a base and, correspondingly, does not meet the needs of the people.</p> <p>  With respect to employment at third level, in some instances it suits people to work a small number of hours but I am concerned about a trend across several of the third level institutions, probably following on from a greater trend in Britain, involving the fragmentation of jobs.  People who are on a few hours are not being offered extra hours and an additional job is being created.  That is not fair.  People might expect that third level teachers and lecturers are on good pay but that is not always the case.  They can be on short hours and that is an issue we need to watch.  People working a few hours for universities who are willing to take on a few more should get first refusal.</p></speech>

The point the Deputy makes is correct.  My experience of student leaders has been that they rightly do their job to agitate and to advocate but when it comes to public health, they have shown extraordinary leadership.  In the conversations I have had to have with those in the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, they have never been anything more than proactive in wanting to protect the safety of everybody.  In fact, the people I found who were most annoyed and angry with those who were acting the tool were other students.  As Senator Mullen acknowledged too, it is not all students; far from it.  One feels let down by one's peers when some go astray in that regard.  The campaign, Keep it Small, Keep it Safe, Keep your Distance, is good solid public health advice.  More important, it does not matter what I think.  The Chief Medical Officer thinks it is really good advice for students to socialise like that by keeping it small and keeping their distance.</p> <p>  On SUSI, I take the points.  One could equally make the points, and I am sure the Deputy will, about adjacency and about the fact that we tell people to do part-time courses and do not provide support and that we tell people to go back to education and we do not take cr&egrave;che fees into consideration.  I accept there are serious limitations with the current Act and the support scheme.  The programme for Government commits to a review.  I would hope to get that review under way quickly and I hope it can be meaningful.  When we have that review, I would welcome the input of this committee.  We must be honest about what we can achieve and the pace at which we can achieve it but I would not mind an understanding from the committee in a sequencing sense of what it thinks are the most important issues.</p> <p>  On the issue of precarious employment, I, too, have an initial concern about this from what I am hearing.  In recent days, I asked my Department for a paper on the employment status of people in research, precarious employment and how we try to get on top of it.  I would be happy to engage with this committee on that again.</p></speech>

We are returning to some kind of normality within abnormal times.</p> <p>  I echo what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said about the position of third level staff.  They sometimes have very poor working conditions, poor remuneration, etc.  That is definitely an area that we must look out for.</p> <p>  On the subject of student loans, I want to reiterate that what I propose here is that we, first of all, have a brave conversation.  It cannot all be testing against what the media will think of us.  I propose that we look at people's ability to repay, in other words, that what students get and what they have to repay is tied to the advantage that they eventually secure.  It will be important that Government shows itself to be willing to embrace ideas that will be challenged from some quarters but, as with the question of exhorting students to be careful and to be safe, sometimes the message will have to be strong.  There will be much to congratulate but the news cannot always be good news coming from the Government side.  There will have to be challenging messages from time to time.  Otherwise, we will not be able to face the challenges that are before us.</p></speech>

I am certainly familiar with that concept.</p> <p>  I assure the Senator that the body of work under way will deliver to this committee an honest economic evaluation of the various options, of which the one he advocates for is one being considered.

It would be beneficial if any documentation could be shared not just with members of the committee but also with people who are eligible to attend, if there is the facility to do that.  That might help.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Chris Hazzard raised that at the last meeting.  I will address it in committee if that is okay and, hopefully, we will get a resolution satisfactory to everybody.</p> <p>  Members are advised to turn off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting, save for flight mode.  It is not sufficient for members to just put their phones in silent mode as this will interfere with the communications set-up here.  Another point is that because we are more or less all wearing masks, we are not as easily recognised as we might think we are so the staff who are taking notes, listening in and recording have asked that we say our name before we speak, if that is okay.  Second, and I apologise to Senator Currie, if someone is speaking and they do not have a microphone that we must facilitate that in some way.  We will try to work that out.  It is just to facilitate the recordings.</p></speech>

I propose we now commence with the nomination and appointment of a Vice Chairman.  I understand the clerk to the committee has received two nominations.  The first is Deputy James Lawless, nominated by Deputy Brendan Smith.  The second is Seanad&oacute;ir Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, nominated by Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn.  As there is more than one nomination for the position of Vice Chairman, Standing Orders state I must deal with them in the order in which I received them.  We can take the vote now and everyone can stay in the room for the vote.  The first nomination received by the clerk to the committee was that of Deputy Lawless.  I will put the question, each members' name will be called and then members say "Yes"or "No".  Is that clear to everybody?</p></speech>

He has been a colleague in the D&aacute;il since 2016 and he has always taken a particular interest in Border and Northern Ireland issues.  I know from my own interaction with him and work within our own parliamentary party that he has a particular interest in all-Ireland issues.  He is a competent, very hard-working and diligent Member of the D&aacute;il and would fill this role admirably.  In the event of a substitute being needed for you, a Chathaoirligh, he would do so in a very committed and diligent manner so it is my pleasure to nominate Deputy Lawless as Vice Chairman.</p></speech>

In this case, it would be customary that the Vice Chairman would be from the Opposition, in order to have a committee that is a collective and consensual.  It is good practice.  This is the first argument.</p><p>I have great respect for Deputy Lawless and I have no objection to his nomination.  He is a very capable parliamentarian.  I have worked with him on other committees and I have no problem with the man's capacity to do the job.  I just think it would be better to have Government and Opposition members in the roles of Chairman and Vice Chairman.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile served with great distinction on this committee in the previous Oireachtas.  He is very passionate about pulling together all perspectives and persuasions throughout the island.  He is a former mayor of Belfast.  I have watched him at close chambers.  I ask people to consider the issue of a cross-party Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach, more so than pitting the track record of Deputy Lawless, which is immense, against the track record of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, which is also immense.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Brendan Smith for the nomination agus gach duine ar an gcommittee who supported me.  It is a great honour to be elected Vice Chairman of this committee.  I look forward to working with the Chairman, with other members of the committee and with all stakeholders across the island and indeed across the Celtic nations and other islands as we move forward.  I look forward to the job ahead.  I want to pay tribute to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile who was unsuccessful on this occasion but is no doubt a huge asset to the committee and who indeed has more experience on it than I do myself so I am sure we will all be working together, agus n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p> <p>  I obviously was not involved in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.  I was a student at the time but I paid very careful attention and I remember well going to my local post office when the text was made available to the nation.  I studied it line by line and detail by detail and through &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il got involved in campaigning for it at that time.  One of my first outings as a young politician was going across the Border to Stormont to meet the youth wings of the other parties and that was the start.  Twenty years on, I still have many connections across the Border and indeed across the Celtic nations with Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party, SNP, as well.  I am no stranger to all sides of the island and hope to bring some of that to bear and to look forward making new relationships in working with the committee and with all sides to advance a shared island, a united Ireland and all of those goals which are so important to all of us on this committee.</p></speech>

I am here to brief the committee on Part 13 of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (consequential provisions) Bill 2020, which provides for matters relating to cross-Border bus services.<br/><br/>For the duration of the current transition period, bus services between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland, have continued to operate under EU Regulation No. 1073, which will last until 31 December.  In the event that no further agreement is made between the EU and the UK, we will face a de facto no-deal scenario on 1 January 2021.  In this scenario, and if no EU contingency for bus services is in place, we need to be able to provide contingency for the continuation of these bus services.  This is what Part 13 of the new Bill seeks to do.<br/><br/>The objectives of the Good Friday Agreement include the need to maintain connectivity between people, communities and businesses on the island of Ireland.  The continuation of cross-Border bus services is essential in maintaining this connectivity.  For those living in the rural communities of the Border counties, these bus services are of particular significance as very often they are the only mode of public transport available.<br/><br/>Pre-Covid, on a daily basis, Monday to Friday, there were more than 300 cross-Border bus journeys authorised by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  These are what are known as &quot;regular&quot; services - in other words, they operate on set days and times and serve predetermined stops.  This figure of 300 does not take into account occasional or special regular services, nor does it include services authorised by the competent authority in Northern Ireland, the Department for Infrastructure.  Occasional services are those operating on a more <i>ad hoc</i>basis, for example a bus hired to travel from Kildare to Belfast for a concert.  Special regular services are those that operate under a contract such as a bus hired by a company to transport its employees to work on a regular basis.  We need to ensure that there is continuity of all of these services and that service standards of the highest safety and quality are maintained.<br/><br/>On a long-term solution, the UK has signalled its intention to join the Interbus Agreement.  This is an EU-level agreement that enables occasional bus services to operate between the EU and third countries.  There is a protocol to extend this agreement to include regular and special regular services but it is not expected to be in place until the middle of next year.  The Department and the European Commission view the Interbus Agreement as the most appropriate solution for cross-Border bus services.  We welcome the UK's stated intention to accede to this agreement.  We would also very much welcome the UK acceding to the protocol.  If the UK does accede to the Interbus Agreement but the protocol is not yet in place, we will use Part 13 as a contingency for regular and special regular services only, with occasional services being covered by the Interbus Agreement.  In the event of the UK not joining the Interbus Agreement, or no EU-level agreement or contingency being in place on 1 January, then Part 13 will be needed to allow for the continuation of all categories of bus service between Ireland and the UK as a third country.<br/><br/>Part 13 sets out the changes needed to achieve this, proposing amendments to the Road Transport Act 1978, the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.</p><p>After the end of the transition period, Ireland will be allowed under EU law to enter into a bilateral agreement with the UK for bus services, so long as no bus agreement exists between the UK and the EU.  Part 13 lays out the rules which could form the backdrop to Ireland&rsquo;s negotiations on a bilateral agreement on bus services with the UK. </p><p> As mentioned, the National Transport Authority is Ireland&rsquo;s competent authority for regulating bus services with other member states.  The heads in Part 13 of this Bill will make the NTA the competent authority to similarly regulate bus services between Ireland and third countries.</p><p> While the heads presented here are largely similar to the provisions of Part 10 of the 2019 Act, there is a small change under head 13.5 relating to the proposed section 28N, to be inserted in the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  This provision had provided that services operating under a reciprocal arrangement, this being an interim arrangement while a bilateral is being negotiated, could operate for a period of 12 weeks.  We are seeking to amend this to 24 weeks to provide additional time to be able to complete any negotiations in the context of Covid-19 and the additional challenges it might bring to finalising any negotiations.  </p><p> As with all other Departments involved in this Bill, we have been engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as a matter of priority and that work is nearing finalisation.  In fact, we hope to have it finalised within the next day or so.  This engagement has focused on ensuring that the heads provide workable solutions to deal with the long-term implications of Brexit for cross-Border bus services.  While the Interbus Agreement and its protocol are the optimal long-term solutions, we need to prepare for any gaps that may arise and Part 13 is key to providing practical solutions in that regard.   </p><p>  The intention of Part 13 in the omnibus Bill is to provide robust primary legislation which, in the absence of an EU-level solution, will help ensure the future continuation of bus services between Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as between Ireland and Great Britain.  The Department is grateful for the support this Part has received thus far.  We trust that we can continue to work together to advance the necessary legislation.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to make this presentation and look forward to hearing the views of the committee and responding to any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-08a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020100800002#F00300"><p>I am here to brief the committee on the general scheme for Part 12 of the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020.  Part 12 concerns amendments to the provisions of the Harbours Act 1996 regarding pilotage exemption certificates.  The Part concerns the issue of harbour pilotage exemption certificates, PECs.Pilotage entails a certified pilot boarding a vessel to guide it safely into, around or out of a port.  Dublin Port Company employs 12 pilots who carry out 4,000 pilot jobs per year.  However, under section 72 of the Harbours Act 1996, a  pilotage exemption certificate may also be granted by a harbour company for a period of up to one year to one of three ranks on board a ship, namely, a ship master or captain, chief mate, or the officer of the watch holding the relevant seafarer qualification where that person can show the required competency and sufficient knowledge of the port pilotage district.  The majority of ship movements in Dublin Port are carried out by captains who are holders of Dublin Port pilotage exemption certificates.<br/><br/>Part 12, which proposes amendments to the Harbours Act 1996, was developed to address concerns that pilotage exemption certificates which have been issued by Dublin Port Company to seafarers holding UK certificates of competence may no longer be valid or may very quickly become invalid after the end of the transition period, with no means of renewing those PECs for a period after the end of the transition period.  <br/><br/>Pilotage exemption certificates meet the statutory pilotage requirements on approximately 65% of all ship movements in Dublin Port&rsquo;s pilotage district.  The frequency with which PECs are used in Dublin Port on ferries to and from the UK is high, given that ferries from the UK arrive daily, for example, from Liverpool and Heysham, or twice daily from Holyhead.  If PECs that have been issued to seafarers with UK seafarer certificates of competence on such ferries became invalid at the end of the transition period, it would lead to a number of serious problems for Dublin Port.  The turnaround efficiency would be greatly reduced as the act of boarding and disembarking harbour pilots is time-consuming with a consequent impact on roll-on, roll off, RoRo, ferries operating on tight schedules which transport most of the country&rsquo;s RoRo freight.  Pilotage by a port pilot is considerably more expensive for ferry operators than pilotage exemption certificates and the need to use pilots would impose significant additional costs on ferry companies and, in turn, their customers and end consumers at a time when many ferry companies are experiencing difficult trading conditions due to Covid.  <br/><br/>The act of boarding and disembarking port pilots brings with it an inherent risk which is greater for larger vessels.  While this risk is mitigated through standard operating procedures, there are occasions during bad weather when the mitigation is to suspend the ports pilotage service, thus delaying cargo vessels.  <br/><br/>Dublin Port Company pilots are fully occupied dealing with the more difficult pilotage assignments and the company would not be able to employ and train sufficient pilots to meet the requirement for pilotage for ferries in the time available.  The time to train a newly employed pilot for ferry operations varies from 16 months for the smallest ferries to 36 months for the largest. <br/><br/>What does Part 12 do?  Part 12 sets out amendments needed to the Harbours Act 1996 to address the concerns raised that PECs based on UK certificates of competence may no longer be valid following the end of the transition period.  Part 12.1 of the Bill provides a definition for the purposes of Part 12.  <br/><br/>Part 12.2 of the heads of the Bill ensures that a pilotage exemption certificate remains valid for the period specified in the PEC and while the person must hold the relevant seafarers certificate of competence at the time of the making of the application for the PEC, once granted, the PEC remains valid in accordance with its terms.  It also provides for an extension of the period of validity of the pilotage exemption certificates from the current one year to a maximum of three years.  It will also allow existing holders of pilotage exemption certificates to apply for new certificates in the period leading up to the end of the transition period, notwithstanding the fact that their PECs may not have expired.  <b></b><br/><br/>Part 12.3 of the heads of the Bill will enable a harbour company, through its by-laws, to require the holder of a PEC of more than one year&rsquo;s duration to undergo a periodic review to ensure they continue to have the relevant competence and local knowledge of the harbour pilotage district to enable the holder of the certificate to pilot the ship within that pilotage district.<b></b>It is proposed that this Part of the Bill, following enactment, would be commenced shortly before the end of the transition period to enable Dublin Port Company to complete the processing of applications for three-year PECs in line with the legislative changes to the Harbours Act 1996 set out in Part 12.<br/><br/>As with all other Departments involved in this Bill, we have been engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel as a matter of priority and we have finalised that work as regards Part 12.<br/><br/>The purpose of Part 12 of the Brexit omnibus Bill is to provide amendments in primary legislation which will ensure that ferries can continue to be piloted efficiently and with quick turnaround times in Dublin Port without unnecessary delays, particularly at the end of the transition period.  The Department is grateful for the support this Part has received thus far and in its previous life as Part 9 of the 2019 Brexit omnibus Act.  There are no differences between the 2019 legislation and the provisions of the 2020 Bill.  We look forward to working with the committee to advance this necessary legislation.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for inviting us to make this presentation and look forward to hearing any views or comments of the committee and responding to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I do not think anyone would have thought about pilotage exemption certificates or anything like it when the Brexit vote went through initially but this is the madness we have to deal with.  Is it the case that the Interbus Agreement will not kick in until the middle of next year?</p><p>The Interbus Agreement already exists and is made up of two parts.  It covers occasional services such as bringing people to concerts and travelling from Belfast to Dublin, Derry to Dublin or whatever.  The intention of the UK, as far as we know, is to accede to that.  The UK must sign up to it this month for it to take effect on 1 January.  The UK's membership takes effect on the first day of the third month after they sign.  In our contacts with them they have made it clear to us and, I think, to the European Commission that they do intend signing.  If they do that this month then from 1 January they will have acceded and the Interbus Agreement will take effect for them but only cover occasional services.</p><p> There was originally a protocol.  Originally, four states, including the European Union, had to sign up.  The European Union was the only one that signed up so the protocol fell.  That has been renegotiated in Europe and it is now going to go, as far as I can see, to the October Transport Council  to take effect again but it still needs three contracting parties, one of which will be the EU, to bring it into effect.  My best guess is that it will really not come into effect until the middle of next year, and that is the one that covers regular and special regular services.  In other words, the X3 service from Derry to Dublin or the ones that cross the Border around Donegal and so on.</p></speech>

We have no confirmation of this, and obviously the EU is in negotiations with the UK so they do not want to enter into discussions on the possibility, but there is a possibility that a contingency regulation will be made by the EU.  We do not know and we cannot tell.  There was one in place for 1 January 2020 and that was for a continuation of the <i>status quo</i>.</p></speech>

If the protocol is not in place then we would seek to bring this part of the Act into place.  What this allows for is an informal arrangement first, and this is all allowed under the EU treaties.  Where there is not an EU third country agreement on something then the member state is allowed to engage on a bilateral basis.  There is a mechanism in this part of the Bill that allows us to have an informal arrangement, by way of a phone call or letter, with our counterparts in the Department for Transport in the UK, to basically say, let us work on a bilateral but in the meantime for the next 24 weeks we will keep things in place.</p></speech>

I am a newbie to this committee and indeed to this institution.  This question may be directed more towards the clerk, through the Chair.  For these pieces of legislation, we have been given a brief understanding of them in the here and now.  There was a large piece of legislation, the original omnibus Bill, that would affect many issues that this committee has within its brief, the likes of data, trains, aviation and all of that type of stuff.  Would it be possible for us to get a briefing note on what the previous omnibus legislation had said about all of those things?  I know it is a huge Act but it would be helpful to get a summary of the main points around all of the big issues.  What does the legislation mean for data-sharing North and South?  What does it mean for train services, haulage and all of that type of stuff?  I ask the witnesses to excuse my ignorance but they may have worked on some of this and may be able to give us some insight into it.  At this point, in terms of the negotiations, I am quite fearful of the lack of engagement between here and the Department in the North.  I understand the mechanics of it and why the negotiations have had to be with the UK Government.  However, there are a lot of questions unanswered, particularly for people at the Northern end who are working in haulage and aviation.  Could we have a summary of all of those things that have been before?</p></speech>

We will try to get that out to the Senator.  The clerk cannot come in on this issue, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I assume that the current legislation is based on the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol.  Some of the omnibus legislation is very different from that of last year because there was contained within the previous omnibus Bill the cliff-edge scenario, which is not necessarily included in this.  The officials must correct me if I am wrong.  In fairness, I probably had a notion like Senator McCallion's that we were going to get a greater amount of detail on a greater number of issues, given that there is also a question about what this committee deals with as regards communications.</p></speech>

I do not have sight over the whole omnibus Bill.  The reins of this are being held by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs because it is an international matter.  Mr. Burke is in our Brexit co-ordination division within the Department so he would have a broader view.  Maybe after he is finished I can come back to Senator McCallion on the rail issue.</p></speech>

Irrespective of whether it is the withdrawal agreement or a no-deal Brexit, it just happens that in those cases it does not make that much of a difference.  On the other issues, road haulage has been dealt with in the wider negotiation.  It is an EU competence and is being dealt with within that.  The issues about access and cabotage and all the road haulage issues that we need resolved are part of that.  We would like to see arrangements similar to those we have currently but that is subject to the negotiations.  It is kind of stuck at the moment.  The Senator will have seen in the pronunciations by Michel Barnier that matters are stuck on the level playing field provisions, where the UK is looking for access but without necessarily signing up to the general standards that apply to EU members.</p> <p>  Maritime is not something that comes within our purview, apart from the pilotage exemption certificates, PECs, issue.  Maritime connectivity is the big issue that we have.  That is not so much stuck in the negotiations because maritime is a very open sector.  However, the customs and agriculture checks that will be required for imports both in the UK and here in Ireland pose a danger that they will disrupt the flow of goods across the UK land bridge.  For anybody going from Dublin across the UK and driving out into Dover and Calais there is a big danger of delays and the UK is predicting a high risk of disruption.  The key maritime issue for ourselves is to try to encourage trade to go around.  There is sufficient capacity on the direct services that leave from Dublin, Rosslare and indeed Cork and Shannon Foynes.  It is mainly Dublin and Rosslare that go directly into European ports.  That means those hauliers will avoid the UK land bridge and potential disruption at Dover Port or Holyhead.  It also means they would stay within the Single Market and would not have to fill out customs documentation, so there would be less of a cost.  The big ask from a maritime point of view is trying to get business not to leave it to the last minute and decide then there is a problem but to try to get them to move in advance.  </p> <p>  On aviation it is a similar type issue in that it is an EU competence and it is in the negotiations.  On the whole issue around connectivity, there is no default or WTO rules.  Aviation is not covered by WTO rules.  If we do not have an agreement there has to be some sort of fall-back position.  We will be looking to the EU for contingency similar to what was in place last year.  On citizens' issues, I can only cover the transport aspect.  One of the issues would be UK driver licences.  For anybody living in Ireland with a UK driver licence, it will no longer be valid from 1 January.  The Road Safety Authority had a large campaign last year and again this year to try to get people to switch.  We do not want a situation where people driving around day to day suddenly find their licence is not valid.  The Road Safety Authority estimates that approximately 70,000 residents in Ireland hold UK licences.  It reckons between 53,000 and 55,000 of them have switched since the start of 2019.  We still need to get the remainder over that line as well.</p></speech>

On the licences, is there a transition period after 1 January?  So I am crystal clear, on 2 January, anyone who currently holds a UK licence who is driving in this State will not be covered by their licence.</p></speech>

To make a distinction, I am referring to somebody who is resident in Ireland.  Somebody living in Newry will be fine in that they may drive up and down using a UK licence.</p> <p>  On the question of whether there could be an insurance issue, there could be if a driver does not have a licence.  The other insurance issue from a citizen point of view is that people from the North who are driving into Ireland or elsewhere within the European Union will be required to have a green card.  The United Kingdom, for its part, confirmed last year that it will accept a motor insurance disc on the windscreen of an Irish vehicle as proof of insurance.  Any traffic coming from the North or Great Britain to the South will require a green card unless the European Commission can set a date for which it is not required.  So far, it does not intend to do that.</p></speech>

Rail does not come under this Bill because there is no need for it to do so.  We actually have arrangements in place.  This is one area in which we can work very well with our colleagues in Belfast by way of co-operation between the Commission for Railway Regulation and the regulator in the North, namely the Department for Infrastructure, and between Translink and Irish Rail.  Translink is licensed as a railway undertaking in the South under the EU directives.  All its drivers will be licensed here by 1 January and they are certified under the safety directive.  The Enterprise service is operated as part of a joint venture between Irish Rail and Translink in the North so there will be no change and no impact on Belfast&ndash;Dublin services.</p></speech>

There are considerable delays and they are having a damaging impact, particularly on older people.  They are accustomed to going to a centre to renew their licences but many of the centres have closed, having already reopened.  Applicants are being asked to travel many miles, even outside their counties, to obtain a renewal.  This is causing a lot of heartache and uncertainty for them.  If there is anything the officials could do to address the issue, we would welcome it as a committee.  With the agreement of Senator Dooley, who raised this, I suggest that the committee write to the Road Safety Authority about these issues.</p></speech>

There is a link.  The procedure is explained step by step.  A driver must return the UK licence and it has to be checked to ensure it is valid in all senses of the word.  There is a fee involved.  The last I saw, the turnaround time was around ten days.  That was probably three weeks ago, maybe four.  It is important to note that, of the 70,000 licence holders I mentioned, approximately 55,000 have changed already.  That is only an estimate because we have no hard and fast figure.  I take the Senator's point that this is another layer on top of an already difficult situation but I have not heard that it is causing problems.  The last turnaround time I heard was ten days.</p></speech>

These are obviously being dealt with in negotiations.  From listening to the officials, I would imagine that, in many of these circumstances and if we face a worst-case scenario, there will be contingency plans at EU or State level and, in some cases, bilateral agreements.  I refer to something that is ready to plug and play given that there will be a great amount of difficulty if we face the absolute disaster scenario that none of us wants to see.</p></speech>

We have to be united in the response.  The task force is explicitly clear on the implications for Ireland and its dependency on road haulage and aviation connectivity.  We will be advocating a contingency regulation, as we did in the lead-up to a potential no-deal Brexit last year.  It is critical for us.  So far, the Commission has delivered for us.</p></speech>

The <i>status quo</i>continues on the basis of that engagement, and then we have 24 weeks to put in a bilateral arrangement.</p></speech>
