The purpose of today's meeting is to update the committee on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, LGBTI, and national youth strategy.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who is accompanied by Ms Olive McGovern, principal officer at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and Ms Linda O'Sullivan, assistant principal officer at the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of members and witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them on to flight mode as they may interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They also adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.</p><p>I advise the Minister that any submission or opening statement she makes to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  After her presentation there will be questions from the members of the committee.  I call the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#B00200"><p>It is fitting that we gather at this time as the world prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the modern LGBTI rights movement.  I had just fallen in love at that time.  I was a young teenager and her name was Katherine too.  This hearing is fitting and timely and will reassure young people across Ireland that Deputies and Senators remain determined to protect and respect their hard-fought rights in a different era from when I was growing up.  Our gathering here is also a sign of solidarity to those who feel isolated, alone or bullied because of their sexual identity.</p> <p>  The LGBTI+ National Youth Strategy, a world first, is the focus of our discussions today and I am honoured to be in a position to give an update on our work in this area.  At the outset, it is important to say that the strategy itself is the result of listening to the voices of young people.</p><p>More than 4,000 took part in consultations, both online and in person at meetings across the country.  The 4,000 represent a decent sample number.  The process was overseen by an oversight committee, with an independent chair, Ms &Uacute;na Mullally, and representatives from a broad cross-sectional group of relevant organisations, State agencies and Departments.  The committee, as I said, had an oversight role, but all members were determined to ensure it would be the young people who would be in the driving seat.  The result is a three-year, strongly oriented strategy which will inform policy decisions until the end of next year.  </p><p> The results of the consultation process were deeply informative and I encourage all public representatives to take time to look at the views expressed.  We should know what young people said when we asked what they thought.  It is a clich&eacute; to say Ireland is a changed country, but it is important to acknowledge that recent changes did lead to positive comments from young people.  Marriage equality, the Gender Recognition Act and even the fact that we are leading the world again with the youth strategy have all led to strong feelings of inclusivity among the young people of Ireland.  If, however, our goal is to be a fully inclusive, equal and fair society, we are not there yet.  </p><p> During the consultations, young LGBTI+ people acknowledged that discrimination and stigma, cases of bullying and harassment and a sense of isolation and exclusion continued.  They made suggestions on how to deal with these difficult issues, including by providing better training for professionals engaging with LGBTI+ young people, enforcing anti-bullying policies and addressing the health and well-being of LGBTI+ young people.  As a result, three goals were identified, the first of which was the creation of a safe, supportive and inclusive environment, which would be good for anybody.  The second was to improve physical, mental and sexual health, while the third was to develop research and data to better understand the lives of young members of the LGBTI+ community.  While my Department has a lead role, it is clear that what is required is a cross-government approach to respond to the shortfalls identified.  </p><p> What progress has been made since the launch of the strategy last June?  To coincide with it, I announced immediate actions in the areas of youth service provision, capacity building, awareness raising and research.  Additional youth services included extra LGBTI+ specific youth worker hours, the establishment of transgender groups, sexual health programmes, one to one and group support, art and drama projects, rural LGBTI+ networking events, a parent peer support network and a trans parents information day.  Trans parents are important and I have spoken to many along the way.  We might come back to that point during questions.  Additionally, I provided funding to carry out mapping of LGBTI+ youth service provision at education and training board level.  Following this mapping exercise, additional hour swill be allocated in 2019 to youth services.  I was also delighted to allocate grants for capacity building measures for 39 groups and organisations in 2018.  They included youth services, family resource centres, sexual health centres, addiction services, equality organisations, arts therapy organisations and Traveller organisations.  I have brought a couple of booklets with me to show and tell members about some of the results of that work and the capacity building that is ongoing within the different organisations.  I have one from Outcomers Dundalk and, of course, another from the national organisation, Youth Work Ireland, and its "Young and trans in rural Ireland" resource.  They are only a couple of many examples of the work that has been done.  Next month I will announce a new capacity building grants scheme for LGBTI+ specific organisations for the development of further capacity building initiatives for professional service providers.  </p><p> The strategy is also about to become much more visible.  A national competition has seen young people design a new welcome sticker for all young people's services across the public, private and voluntary sectors.  I look forward to seeing it everywhere.  I was thrilled to be a part of announcing who won the competition.  We have a copy of the image that was designed for everybody in the audience.  It will go through some work from a communications company to ensure its visibility and power in the welcome it provides for young people.</p><p> The participation unit in my Department is working with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to complete a consultation process with young people on the reform of the relationships and sexuality education programme in the curriculum.  </p><p> Goal two as it relates to mental health supports is very much the focus of the work led by the BeLonG To youth service.  I am delighted to say my Department has long been a primary funder of BeLonG To.  In recent years its expansion into providing specific mental health supports, in collaboration with Pieta House, an extraordinary organisation founded by Senator Freeman, represents the strategic partnership young people need.  </p><p> Under goal three, the strategy commits to developing the research and data environment needed to better understand the lives of LGBTI+ young people.  The tender to carry out this research has been awarded to Professor Saoirse Nic Gabhann in the HBSC Ireland team in the health promotion research centre at the School of Health Sciences in the National University of Ireland, Galway, and is due to commence in the coming weeks.  </p><p> What will be our next steps?  Over the summer an annual report on implementation will be prepared by my Department.  In September I will host an annual implementation forum on the strategy.  It will provide an opportunity to explore what is working well and future plans.  Parents will be welcome at that event.  Already a number of further actions are planned by my Department for 2020.  Work will commence to develop a leadership programme for young LGBTI+ leaders and potential leaders.  A biennial national event to publicly celebrate LGBTI+ young people and young leaders will take place.  Research proposals will be developed to examine the factors that support positive mental health for LGBTI+ young people and ascertain how these positive factors can be replicated.</p><p> The national policy framework, Better outcomes, brighter futures, and the national youth strategy provide the framework within which the strategy is being implemented.  A youth advisory group has been established to recruit a broader youth forum to ensure the voice of young people will remain central to the strategy implementation process.  The first annual implementation report will provide a more comprehensive and detailed picture of full implementation; however, I have little doubt that the strategy has already made a significant contribution to improving the lives of LGBTI+ young people In Ireland.  </p><p> It is 50 years since members of the LGBTI+ community asserted their rights on the streets of New York in the Stonewall riots.  Next month, on those same streets, Ireland&rsquo;s leadership will be acknowledged.  At World Pride we will be honoured as a nation with a global luminary award.  Ambassadors for the youth strategy will join me to accept the award.  During my visit I will also lead 400 Irish-Americans as the Irish Consulate to New York joins the World Pride parade.  With this honour comes responsibilities.  We are protectors of rights.  I am sure Deputies and Senators will agree with me that we must never shirk away from this, not least when it comes to supporting our beautiful young people.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the arts.  Will she give me a brief outline of how she proposes to use the arts in this instance because when I cast my mind back to when I was very young-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#C00300"><p>That is not that long ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#C00400"><p>It is not and I thank the Minister for saying so.  It was through the arts that I met people of different sexualities.  For a young guy, growing up in rural Ireland at the time, sexuality was closed and not spoken about.  Thankfully, it is much more open and liberal today, which is fantastic and accepted.  I found that the arts were a great medium of communication and a great way to meet people from different backgrounds and of different sexualities and whatever else and to integrate through a different medium.  I wonder what arts programmes are available and what their objectives are because the arts can be powerful and a subtle medium of communication.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the great question.  From our perspective, the arts organisations are expected to be among the first to engage with the recognition, the welcome and the welcome sticker.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of the national and local LGBTI+ organisations are in touch with their national and local community art programmes and I anticipate that they would be working with them to ensure there is an ongoing sense of inclusion and acceptance in the context of the arts.  It is equally important that we can draw on the arts to help us to find ways provide the visibility of the community, be that to demonstrate the challenges that remain or the ways in which people can be embraced and acknowledged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olive McGovern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00300"><p>In the consultation process arts organisations were identified by young people as a positive place, currently.  The gaps identified were much more around the sporting space.  For this reason, the sport organisations were brought on to the oversight committee as a special representative body.  The arts is very much a positive space.  Through the creative youth programme and other spaces, the expansion of the arts programmes is very positive in terms of the LGBTI young people's lives.  There was no obvious gap around the arts organisations.  In our discussions on the recognition marker, the arts were an obvious first port of call as an area that would embrace it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00400"><p>My point is around the expansion of that initiative into other sectors.  That is what I found myself when I was younger.  It is a case of using what is there and finding the little nuggets in that sector that can transfer across to the other sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00500"><p>The Deputy's point is worthy of mention to the implementation group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olive McGovern" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00600"><p>Additional youth services hours have in many instances applied arts-based methodologies.  The integration of the youth sector and the arts sector is important.  In terms of what is being with the additional hours, it is often the addition of an arts-based methodology into an existing youth service.  There has been significant expansion of youth arts programmes through the creative youth programme as well.  There is overall an expansion of the arts space through the creative youth programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00700"><p>Have any specific challenges been identified in the sports space?</p></speech>

We have not yet received an update from Sport Ireland but I expect that it will be open to making some progress in this area.  The full implementation report will provide us with the detail of what it has done and what it is planning to do.  Sport Ireland was a very willing participant on the oversight committee and it contributed significantly.  In regard to the capacity building measures, a number of small-scale sports organisations were applicants.  It was very enlightening to learn that at community level, sports organisations such as boxing clubs, football clubs, are doing small-scale reflective pieces within their organisations that at a community base could make their environments more inclusive of LGBTI young people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019051500002#D00900"><p>It is to be celebrated and acknowledged that Ireland is to host the Union Cup rugby tournament for LGBTI groups in June.  It will be an important time in that Ireland will be welcoming a number of groups and members from throughout the world to that competition, which I think is to take place on the DCU campus.  I had the honour of launching it recently with one of great lesbian sporting heroes, Ms Lindsay Peat, who will be joining me later this afternoon.  It is an example of the way in which Ireland is taking its lead in this area and making sure it fits into other domains, particularly sports.</p> <p>   On the specific question relating to the arts, following completion of the mapping exercise I mentioned earlier, gaps in youth services will be filled through the allocation of the additional hours.  We are to make some decisions on allocating those additional hours relatively soon, as Dr. O'Sullivan will confirm.</p></speech>

We all agree that is really important in context of consent, the understanding of the diversity of relationships and in respect of safe sex.  Is the Minister hopeful that there will be real change in how RSE is delivered?</p></speech>

It is always important to maintain hope and to image the possible.  The Department recently held a consultation on this issue with approximately 80 young people.  We are preparing a report of that consultation, which will be presented to the NCCA and will be part of its discussions with the Minister for Education and Skills on what changes are being sought.  I will forward a copy of the report to the committee.  This is a key area where there are some outstanding places where things need to change for the community.</p></speech>

For 4,000 young people across the country, this was a common theme.  However, the NCCA was anxious to go even deeper with young people and consequently, separate to our full population consultation it worked with BeLonG To and others on an additional specific LGBTI+ population consultation.  We supported that through that our participation unit with a broad population.  Even in the broad population, for whom this is not perhaps the first matter of concern, this is still a matter of concern.  Young people are calling for an RSE curriculum that better represents the reality and the diversity of young people's lives.  That is the most universal theme among any of the consultations.  The LGBTI young people have much more specific content that they would like to see covered but the general population of young people were very supportive.</p></speech>

This is a really ambitious project that should be commended.  It will, I hope, enhance the lives of young LGBT people.</p> <p>  Homelessness figures have reached 10,000 people.  Youth homelessness is an issue with which this committee will deal in the coming weeks.  An LGBT shelter has been launched in London and we know that LGBT homelessness is a big issue across the Minister's birthplace, the United States.</p><p>We do not have as much data on youth homelessness in Ireland and whether it is a problem.  In the USA, studies indicate that about 40% of all young people accessing homeless services are LGBT.  A recent study in the UK found that one quarter of young homeless people are LGBT.  We need to realise if it is a problem here.  It is touched on in some of the strategy's objectives, such as with homeless services having a safe and inclusive environment.  Can the committee do anything in its work on youth homelessness which would support these actions?</p></speech>

Two things come to mind in responding.  One is whether young LGBT homeless people are homeless as a result of their sexual identity.  I do not know.  Second, if they are part of the homeless population - no doubt they are - is the question of whether there are special supports for them to mitigate the harm which young people experience as a result of being homeless.  My officials may know if we have this information.</p></speech>

Our Private Members' Bill prohibiting conversion therapy has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.  It would be the most comprehensive ban in the world.  Some would argue it is a reach into religious freedom but we are talking about vulnerable people.  In many parts of the world, its use has been prohibited in the cases of young people and minors.  My view is that anyone seeking access to conversion therapy is vulnerable and should be protected from those who seek to take advantage of their vulnerability.</p> <p>  We have been met with goodwill from the Department of Health.  Legislative progress has been slow due to Brexit.  I understand the Department of Justice and Equality proposes to undertake research into the extent of the use of conversion therapy in the State, something that the Department of Health had floated during the debate on Second Stage.  We do not need research to know that it is happening in Ireland as it is apparent that organisations exist that offer to repress, suppress or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  Should extensive research on this delay a Bill to the point where legislation may not be introduced in this term?  What if the Department of Justice and Equality establishes that it is not that apparent and that two organisations is not sufficient to warrant a legislative ban, despite the ongoing practice in the State and that a legislative ban could also stop parents sending minors abroad to access summer camps which emphasise "praying away the gay", as we hear it described sometimes?  Has the Minister had engagements with the Department of Health?  Does the Minister support a legislative ban even if there are only one or two organisations which offer the practice?  The British Government undertook the largest survey of gay people I have come across in which this issue arose.  It is primarily an issue in faith-based practices and organisations.  I am not that hopeful and do not anticipate legislative change at the moment, given our experience to date.  Has the Minister anything to say on this?  Can she give the Bill any support?</p></speech>

It would be no big surprise that I absolutely support the idea that conversion therapy by health professionals in Ireland should not take place.  On a legislative ban, the process under way is really important.  I understand it is now with the justice committee.  As the Senator indicated, there is research that needs to be done.  It is not an unusual thing to ask for when developing law that brings forward such a change, in order to see how harmful action against citizens may be stopped or prohibited through legislation.  It is important to undertake that kind of research.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is leading the more detailed examination of the Bill.  I acknowledge the Deputy's leadership.  It is important that that process continue.</p></speech>

In other words, 95% of those who experience conversion therapy do so through faith-based organisations.  The outright ban which we propose is the only way the issue can really be addressed.  I am not contesting that research is needed but I am slightly concerned that the Department of Justice and Equality is conducting research and that the two strategies might conflict.</p></speech>

We are pleased to present the views of the association on the new oral health policy generally and specifically in regard to two matters highlighted in the committee's invitation.  The association represents 2,000 dentists, which constitutes the overwhelming majority of dentists in practice across all branches of the profession in Ireland.</p> <p>  The association was not invited to participate in, nor was it consulted in any meaningful way on, the preparation of this new oral health policy.  We saw its contents for the first time on the date of its publication last month.  We are currently awaiting a meeting with the Minister for Health and his team at the Department of Health to be briefed on the policy and how the Department intends to proceed.  Our board of directors met to consider the policy document along with our key committees for dentists in general practice and working in the HSE public service.  Last weekend we had a briefing and consultation meeting attended by 200 members of our association where dentists were briefed on the basis of our understanding of the oral health policy document and where we fielded questions and comments from our members.  Before commenting on the policy further, it is fair to say that the most common first reaction among our members is disbelief and anger at how few dentists in practice, whether in general practice, specialist practice or within the HSE, were consulted in the preparation of this new policy, even though they are the ones it is hoped will deliver 90% of dental care in future.  Therefore, we respectfully submit that this is not the last word on oral health in Ireland.  We regard this as a starting point for a badly needed discussion on oral health.</p> <p>  To give a broad overview of oral health in Ireland today, dental care is primarily provided on a private basis by dentists who work independently of the State, and without any of the levels of resources provided to doctors in general practice.  These dentists can be contracted to provide care for large cohorts of eligible holders of medical card or PRSI benefits, although the dental treatments funded by the State are extremely limited.  Public service dentists employed by the HSE play a critical, complementary role in providing expert care, primarily for children and special care children and adults.  In addition, we have two dental hospitals and a small number of acute, tertiary facilities.  Private out-of-pocket payments account for 83% of all money spent on dental care, with State-provided or State-funded services accounting for just 14%.  The latest CSO survey on income and living conditions published just before Christmas shows that almost a third of households with children where at least one person in the household had either a dental examination or treatment, or both in the last 12 months reported that the associated costs were a financial burden.  This clearly shows the consequences of the decision by the State to take away an estimated &euro;100 million per annum in State supports for patients after 2009 with cuts to the two State schemes, namely, the medical card and PRSI scheme.  That is equivalent to nearly &euro;900 million over nine years before there was some restitution as regards the PRSI.  While oral health in Ireland is improving, most of the gains are being recorded by higher income groups in the main, and the resulting chasm in oral health status according to income is widening as a direct result of the massive cuts in State support.  In passing, we should say that the oral health policy fails to explain that the reported level of dental decay is seriously under-reported by the exclusion of as many as 21% of children from the so-called Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth, FACCT, study on which it relies.</p> <p>  It is notable and very welcome, therefore, that the Minister for Health has identified reducing oral health inequalities as one of his two goals for the new oral health plan.  Regrettably, based on our members&rsquo; initial analysis of the plan, it seems certain that oral health inequalities will increase rather than reduce with the plan&rsquo;s proposals in regard to the provision of dental care and treatment.  We see this as the inevitable consequence of moving from a targeted approach, where HSE public dental surgeons directly target children at key age ranges of their development for dental services, including but not limited to prevention, restorative care and referral to secondary services where eligible.  This approach enables those who do not attend to be identified and followed up with.  The policy&rsquo;s proposal is to redirect this service into general practice where identifying risk will be dependent on attendance by the very groups who are both least likely to attend but also have the worst oral health and the greatest treatment need. </p> <p>  There are some notable positives but also some obvious flaws in this policy.  It is a positive development that we finally have an oral health policy to consider.  It stimulates discussion about oral health and that can only be a good thing.  The focus on prevention and screening, the policy&rsquo;s provisions in regard to building links between oral and general health through a common risk factor approach, its proposals in regard to the dental workforce and professional development as well as research and evaluation, are all positive developments.  However, the policy&rsquo;s focus on prevention needs to be counter-balanced by the fact that prevention going forward cannot fix the significant amount of untreated oral diseases that are already present today.  Our wish to replace the unfit for purpose medical card scheme and contract has been stymied by the declaration of the Department over many years that this could not happen until the publication of a new oral health policy.  This has also been used as an excuse also for the delayed publication of new legislation to amend the 1985 Act.  We see the publication of this policy as clearing the pitch and allowing all parties to engage without delay in long overdue discussions on the State contracts and also the need for new legislation.</p> <p>  The most glaring weakness in this policy is the section dealing with the provision of dental care and treatment.  The headline proposal, at least according to the initial media coverage, is the proposal to extend limited free dental care to children under the age of six and eventually to under-16s.  However, the plan offers no evidence to justify taking care and treatment of children from the HSE public dental service.  It might seem easy to suggest taking work from the HSE public dental service when it has been hollowed out and left to crumble over the past decade.  As the number of eligible patients increased by 20%, the number of dentists and other key support grades in the HSE fell by 20% with inevitable reductions in key targeted developmental exams and preventive dental work and with the service largely reduced to an emergency dental service.  The consequences for patients were inevitable and have unfortunately resulted as we predicted.  It is therefore incomprehensible to our members in both the HSE public service and private practice that key aspects of the public dental service are now to be privatised.</p><p>Our members are concerned that to move from a targeted, risk-based model to a demand-led model would be catastrophic for patients in lower socio-economic areas with high treatment needs.  All dentists are upset at the risks posed by the new proposals to continuity of care and the provision of emergency care for children and the possibility that the expert skills and experience of dentists in the HSE's public dental service will be lost.  They fear that the public service will ultimately prove to be a dumping ground when the unworkable model proposed, which our members believe is based on a failed and discredited NHS experiment, inevitably collapses.</p><p> No mention is made in the policy of how the current crisis in arranging dental care for children who require to be treated under general anaesthetic, which we fear is anywhere up to 10,000 per annum, is to be addressed.  Equally, raising unrealistic expectations as to what general practice can deliver or wishes to deliver in regard to treatment of children is also dangerous and suggests that the authors are seriously out of touch with the realities of general dental practice in Ireland.  The provisions in regard to the care and treatment of adults represent little more than repackaging of the existing suite of treatments which was savagely cut in 2009, a decision which every right-thinking person described as shameful at the time.  In some cases, adult medical card patients could actually be left with even fewer treatments than they can currently access.  More fundamentally, the policy offers nothing to the 60% of adults who do not have access to free or subsidised dental care other than very limited PRSI dental benefits.  We ask why there is no support or funding towards the cost of dental treatment provided to those adults and why no change is being made in the tax relief being made available to adults.  In summary, our members believe that the provisions in the policy for the care and treatment of children and adults are seriously flawed, economically unviable and operationally unworkable.</p><p> A policy that is good for patients will be good for dentists but our members feel this policy fails patients.  Any oral health policy has an obligation to use the resources of the state to the benefit of all its citizens but to ensure the most vulnerable are first served by those resources.  This is the ethical principle of justice and it is a cornerstone of medical service delivery.  This policy, as it has been presented, stands to fail this essential principle.  Despite not being consulted on the new policy, the Irish Dental Association produced its own document, Towards a Vision for Oral Health in Ireland, which we wish to see incorporated in a new oral health policy.  We have sent copies to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the main political parties and we have circulated a copy to the committee.  Over the past year, the association has decided as a matter of policy to prioritise independent practice and to reduce the reliance of general dental practitioners and their patients on dental schemes funded by third parties, such as the State, for reasons which are obvious.  Independent dental practice needs to be complemented by a stronger not weaker public dental service.  This will not preclude the association and its members from engaging with the Department of Health and its representatives following publication of its new oral health policy.  What is clear, however, is that any prospect of a successful realisation of the objectives contained within the new oral health policy will require a fundamental shift in the attitude of the State towards the profession in tandem with a new approach towards promoting oral health into the future.  The Irish Dental Association has many positive proposals to share with the Department of Health for enhancing oral health for all but only time will tell if the Department is interested in or capable of engaging with the profession.</p><p> We were asked two specific questions by the committee which we are happy to address.  The association supports the registration and regulation of all dental technicians.  The association believes that dental technicians should not see patients directly unless they have completed training to clinical dental technician, or CDT, level.  All persons providing direct dental care must have a clear scope of practice and they must be regulated fully.  Clinical dental technicians are regulated but dental technicians are not.  The association believes that it would be dangerous and unethical to allow dental technicians or any member of the dental team to provide direct access to the public without formal compulsory regulation and a clearly defined scope of practice.  Unfortunately, the public and patients do not understand the difference between clinical dental technicians, dental technicians and denturists.  Regarding school based interventions, we are extremely concerned at what we understand to be a move away from a targeted approach to provision of dental care and prevention by HSE public service dentists in favour of a demand led approach to the provision of dental care in general practice.  We are happy to address any comments or questions the committee wishes to present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Marley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#E00300"><p>I am the current dean of the Faculty of Dentistry at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  Attending with me today is our vice dean, Professor Chris Lynch.  I thank the committee for inviting us this morning to present on oral health policy in Ireland.  I will first set out why were are here today and we will then be very happy to address questions the committee has.</p> <p>  The Faculty of Dentistry of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was established in 1963.  It is made up of dental specialists and consultants, senior academics and general dentists who provide education, accreditation of postgraduate educational programmes and assessments of qualified dentists both in Ireland and abroad.  The faculty is Ireland&rsquo;s leading centre for postgraduate dentistry examinations, with around 900 dentists from Ireland and abroad examined each year and more than 2,000 of its graduates working as dentists across Ireland and the world.  Faculty representatives were invited to participate in a consultation day on the national oral health strategy which was held in Thomond Park in May 2015.  This day consisted of general information sharing and discussion activity.  I was formally invited to a meeting by Dr. Kavanagh, the chief dental officer, to meet her and the deans of the dental schools in Cork and Dublin on 7 November 2018.  The group was informed that the publication of the oral health policy was imminent.  At no time was the RCSI faculty invited to be represented on the scientific panel which was tasked with developing the policy.</p> <p>  As stakeholders with a significant interest in the delivery of quality oral and dental healthcare for the Irish population, the faculty has raised concerns on a number of issues.  The first is the lack of a foundation year of dental training.  Unlike our medical colleagues, where a pre-registration year, or intern year, is mandatory, newly qualified dentists are permitted to practice independently without the benefit of formal mentoring, clinical support, supervision and training in their first and pivotal year as a qualified dentist.  Such a scheme exists in the UK for dentists who have trained in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  We strongly support a mandatory year of foundation training for newly qualified dentists in Ireland.  This would ensure that a dentist&rsquo;s initial training requirements correspond to that of a medical graduate.  As in the UK, it is envisaged that this training would take place in established practices.  With regard to continuing professional development, we are concerned about the absence of legislation in Ireland to ensure and reassure the public that all dentists and their teams are subject to mandatory, lifelong learning and development through CPD.  That would ensure that they continue to provide safe, effective and contemporary treatments for their patients throughout their working lives.  There is a marked contrast to our medical and pharmacy colleagues in Ireland where CPD and lifelong learning are an expected and mandatory requirement.  In the UK, the equivalent scheme for dentists includes mandatory training, including in radiation protection, infection control, oral cancer detection and complaints handling.</p> <p>  We are also concerned regarding the lack of access to dental speciality and consultant training in Ireland.  Currently, there are just two dental specialties recognised by the Irish Dental Council in Ireland, namely, orthodontics and oral surgery.  There are a further 11 recognised dental disciplines in the UK and other jurisdictions.  There are a small number of specialist training programmes in Ireland but, unlike medical training, these are self-funded by the trainees.  There is also no formal mechanism for training dental consultants in the Republic of Ireland.  Currently, there is no national body or forum where consultant dental training issues, including funding, can be discussed and progressed.  On foot of section 86 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Health Service Executive has a number of responsibilities in relation to the development and co-ordination of specialist dental education and training and the subsequent alignment of this activity with dental workforce planning.  We propose that this training be expanded to include all dental specialties and consultant level training and that, as is the case with medicine, this be funded by the HSE and Department of Health instead of personally by the trainees.</p> <p>  I turn to the impacts of the policy.</p><p>Dental foundation, DF, training provides an important transition for the newly qualified dentists from the sheltered environment of the dental school to that of the rigours and demands of general dental practice.  It follows that with the absence of a foundation year of training, with protected time for learning and self-reflection in a supportive environment, the newly qualified dentist is immediately deep-dived into a complex environment of independent practice without the safety net of the support and guidance that could be provided and is provided to their medical peers.  DF training has been established, in a mandatory arrangement, in the UK setting since the early 1990s.</p><p> The next impact results from the lack of legislation to mandate dental CPD.  The Dental Council's code of practice pertaining to professional behaviour and dental ethics states that "all dentists have an obligation to maintain and update their knowledge and skills through CPD and the Dental Council decided to introduce its voluntary scheme."  As a voluntary scheme, it follows that in the absence of mandatory, audited CPD, there is an increased potential for patients not to receive as good-quality care as they should expect and deserve.  As occurs in other European jurisdictions, without this significant governance pillar, there is no formal mechanism for dentists to demonstrate to their patients that they are keeping their skills and knowledge up to date.  While we know that all members of the dental team are appropriately trained and qualified at graduation, there needs to be a formal mechanism to allow them to keep their skills up to date, continue to know their limits and continue to be able to recognise when to refer patients appropriately.</p><p> With regard to the lack of access to funded higher specialist-consultant training, there are many implications for the current state of, or lack of, postgraduate dental training in Ireland.  Fees payable for a three-year university-based specialist programme can be in the region of &euro;100,000 and this is frequently a barrier to entry to such training.  Talented young dentists who want a career in the public sector or academic dentistry in Ireland have only limited access to training programmes, unlike their medical peers.  These young dentists are likely to leave Ireland to access these programmes of training in the UK, Europe or the USA, benefitting the dental health of other countries at our expense.</p><p> As there is no formal pathway for dentists to undertake consultant training in Ireland, any consultant appointments in Ireland are being made by equivalence which is determined by individual institutions in collaboration with external assessors as part of the selection-appointment process.  This poses significant problems with appointments when specialists claim equivalence as a result of additional training.  There is no clear mechanism to evaluate equivalence, which has resulted in competitions for consultant posts being abandoned.  There are also concerns surrounding the quality assurance of training for individuals being considered for appointment to such posts.</p><p> Most dental consultants in Ireland are in their mid to late 50s or the early 60s.  Many are expected to retire in the next three to five years.  With no formal training and the difficulties with assessing equivalence, there is an existential risk to the dental service in terms of expertise, experience and delivery of undergraduate dentistry courses.  Such considerations raise concerns about the training of the next generation of dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses in Ireland as well as the leadership of dentistry in the 21st century.</p><p> I will now discuss the position in Ireland versus other jurisdictions.  Within the UK, dental foundation training is administered by the 12 postgraduate deaneries in England and one each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and currently there are in excess of 1,000 dental foundation trainees across the UK.  Key exemplars of mandatory CPD requirement in Ireland are in medicine and pharmacy.  In the UK, dental CPD is also mandatory and is overseen by the UK General Dental Council.  Higher specialist and consultant training in all dental disciplines is available in the UK, which recognises 13 specialist lists.</p><p> Regarding reform proposals, for the foundation training year, the FoDRCSI supports a compulsory year of foundation training for newly qualified dentists.  This would ensure that their immediate post-qualification training requirements correspond to that of a medical graduate.  These posts should be salaried and would complement the oral health policy objective of equitable access to dental care for all.  The FoDRCSI recommends the implementation of mandatory CPD through new legislation as a matter of urgency.  There are several possible models including that of the General Dental Council of the UK.  This will require new legislation.  However, we feel that this development would be a significant external reassurance and oversight of the commitment of Irish dental team members to the safe delivery of quality oral health care for patients in Ireland.</p><p> In regard to specialist and consultant training, the FoDRCSI recommends an expansion of the current list of recognised specialties through new legislation as a matter of urgency.  The FoDRCSI also recommends the creation a specific dental body which has, as its responsibility, the setting and quality assurance of consultant training programmes in all the dental specialties.  The FoDRCSI would be happy to input to this body given its expertise in this field.  This body would require ring-fenced funding so that both dental specialist and dental consultant training regains equivalency with medical consultant training.</p><p> The Faculty of Dentistry, RCSI, has laid out its concerns and recommendations for change.  At the core of these issues is the need to maintain the quality of care and services provided to our patients.  Professor Lynch and I are happy to respond to any further queries on the issues as outlined.</p></speech>

Some will return if the time is available.  We had invited representatives from the Department of Health but, through circumstances outside their control, they are unable to attend.  We will, however, return to hear their views at a later date.</p></speech>

They make for some stark reading and I imagine that many members of the public listening to the submissions will be worried about what was said regarding the new national oral health strategy and the issues with training, recognition, continuous professional development, etc.  The two opening statements were stark, even within the parameters of what this committee hears on a weekly basis.  It is incumbent upon us to take them seriously and I thank the witnesses for the work they put into them.</p> <p>  I will start with the oral health strategy.  I was exasperated but not surprised to hear that yet another healthcare strategy was being developed, rolled out, printed, launched and tweeted without anybody talking to the medics themselves about what might be a good idea.  The witnesses did not pull their punches on this and I do not blame them.  It is professionally disrespectful but, much more serious than that, one cannot get a decent healthcare strategy without talking to the medics in the field, in this case oral health.  What has been the level of exclusion in respect of consulting dentists from the oral health strategy?  It seems quite extraordinary.  Do the witnesses have a sense of why they were excluded from inputting into a strategy that their members will have to implement?  Did they ask if they could input into it?  They said they were still looking for a meeting with the Minister and his officials.  How long have they been looking for that meeting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.64" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Hourihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#F00400"><p>We wrote to look for a meeting with the Minister following the publication of the policy.  That was just over a month ago.  There were a number of occasions when meetings were arranged but, for genuine reasons, they did not proceed because the Minister was caught up in controversies here at the time.  I have detailed a list of all the submissions we have made in the past few years.</p><p>We made regular pre-budget submissions from 2014 to 2018, as well as submissions to the Sl&aacute;intecare project.  We also made submissions to this committee in 2013 on issues regarding the draft medical contract for general practitioners as well as countless other submissions.  We have published a number of documents regarding our efforts in the area of oral health.  Dr. Marley mentioned an event which happened in Limerick in 2015.  We were present at it, but I draw a distinction between what I call "tick-box consultation" and meaningful consultation.</p><p> The HSE has a good document on managing change.  It states there are three principles, namely, discuss, design and deliver.  That is a very good model.  We have not been involved in the discussions regarding this new strategy but we want to be involved in the design and we certainly want to be involved in the delivery.  That is because the dentists we represent are the people who will be expected to carry out that delivery.  I cannot speculate on the motivation of the Department of Health, but I am sure it will explain its approach.  Two documents were published, however, including one containing more than 50 pages, which is being circulated widely, and another 160-page document detailing in an appendix all of the groups and individuals who helped in respect of the strategy.  It is notable that only one dental general practitioner is mentioned.</p><p> I will point out that we did make submissions and we published a document as recently as last September.  That has not been acknowledged or referenced.  We also developed a document as far back as 2013, in conjunction with the college faculty and the two dental schools.  I do not believe that has been acknowledged either.  I cannot speculate on why the Department did not engage with us fully.  In response to the question posed, we are interested and we want to be involved from this point on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#G00200"><p>I thank Mr. Hourihan.  He laid out many different things in his opening statement.  People will be very concerned about two of the aspects he mentioned.  One is the assertion that oral health will get worse for some or even many people.  The other is the clear concern about growing inequality in healthcare.  Would it be fair to state that it is Mr. Hourihan's considered view that the new oral health strategy, as it stands, could make oral health and oral health inequality worse?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Hourihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#G00300"><p>That is undoubtedly the case because oral health is one of the areas of health where there is already a very clear divide between those in more deprived backgrounds and those who are better off.  What is proposed in this plan will unwittingly make the situation worse.  That will be the case particularly for children, and there will be resultant consequences throughout the entirety of their lives.  The approach at the moment is a targeted one where children are all seen.  They are brought into the HSE clinics and there is a follow-up if someone is missing on the day of the check-up.</p> <p>  In theory, children should be seen at three different age categories while in primary school, but that has not been happening because the number of dentists is insufficient.  The ideal, therefore, is that children should be seen and there should be follow-up care and treatment.  Education and information on the prevention of oral health problems should be provided on the spot.  We understand that what is being provided now would be replaced by a model based on there being encouragement to visit a dentist in general practice.  All of the evidence, unfortunately, is that those most in need, those who have the worse oral health to start with, are also the ones least likely to attend, even if such visits are free.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#G00400"><p>Will Mr. Hourihan give us an example of a child who should and would be seen through a properly resourced public intervention system?  We have such a system today but it is not properly resourced.  Let us assume the proper resources are provided and the system functions as it should.  In the context of these new proposals, will Mr. Hourihan outline what will happen to children who will no longer benefit from intervention because their parents, for whatever reason, may not bring them to the dentist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Hourihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#G00500"><p>I am happy to do that.  We have three different patient scenarios.  I did not include them in our submission but I am happy to send that information to the committee.  One of the scenarios addressed the exact question posed by Deputy Donnelly.  These scenarios are based on real experiences but I am using different names.  Let us take the example of four year old Millie and her eight year old brother.  They live at home with their father who works full time in financial services.  He drops them to the cr&egrave;che at 8 a.m.  The staff there bring Millie and her brother to school and both of the children are collected by their dad from the cr&egrave;che at 6.30 p.m.  They go home, have dinner and then go to bed.  Millie's mother no longer resides in the family home as the parents separated due to her mother's mental health issues.  Millie's dad manages to organise the day-to-day schedule during school term by cooking and supervising.  He states that tooth brushing does not always happen.  The children sometimes stay with their mother or at the home of their grandmother.</p> <p>  Millie mentions to her dad that she has a sore tooth, but it is not until her face is slightly swollen and the cr&egrave;che staff remind him that her dad organises a dental appointment.  As things stand, he takes time from school to bring Millie to the emergency dentist at the HSE.  It is noticed there that Millie has a reasonably high rate of decay in her baby teeth and has an abscess in one of her molars.  In that situation, the HSE staff would refer Millie to a general anaesthetic extraction service, having managed the symptoms with an antibiotic.  Her social circumstances are noted on the dental records and she is registered as having a reasonably high risk of future decay.  The HSE staff record that Millie and her brother will need to have a good reminder system in place.  The children are placed on recall to enable support to be given to them and Millie and her brother will be targeted at intervals throughout their school years.  They will also have continuous access to emergency care.  The HSE staff will arrange with the children's dad to liaise with the cr&egrave;che staff to bring Millie for dental appointments to enable her to continue her dental care.</p> <p>  As outlined in this new policy, in a future version of this same scenario, while Millie will have access to care bundles, it is uncertain how support will be given to her dad to remind him of the importance of the child's dental health.  It is unclear if the children can be registered as being at risk due to the mother's mental health issues.  It is also unclear how any symptoms can be managed while Millie waits for her general anaesthetic extraction appointment.  In this new scenario, after Millie has her tooth taken out, her dad may wait until she has another toothache before bringing her to the dentist again.  Millie relies on her dad to recognise the early signs of dental decay, and it is uncertain if there is any safety net for children within the new proposed structures.  It is also uncertain how the new arrangements will interact with Tusla, the child and family agency.</p> <p>  The system in place identifies, manages and arranges treatment and referral where necessary.  It also allows what presents to be recorded and a plan to be set out for the future.  That is how the public service is set up.  The difficulty is that the public service has been run down, with an insufficient number of dentists in place.  With the best will in the world, those resources are not available in general practice and those systems of recording information, arranging care and treatment and referrals and follow up are not in place.  We have no confidence that what is outlined in this strategy document suggests that is something that can be provided in the near future.</p></speech>

We have time constraints and I want to pose a question to the team from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI.  I thank them for their submission.  It makes very stark reading.  It essentially states that there is no supervised year of training, so a college graduate can go straight into private practice.  I did engineering as my undergraduate degree.  I am pretty sure nobody would have left me unsupervised to design, build and roll out anything.  This lack of a supervised year of training is worrying.  The lack of continuing professional development is deeply worrying as well.</p><p>I have two questions.  Presuming all of this information has been submitted on numerous occasions to the HSE, the Department of Health and the office of the Minister, it is safe to state this is not the first airing for these concerns and policy recommendations.  The concerns being raised seem to be reasonable and urgent.  What has been State's response to date?  If the recommendations of the RCSI dental faculty are not implemented and we proceed with the <i>status quo</i>, what are the implications for the oral health of patients?</p></speech>

If, as Mr. Hourihan noted, there is inevitable swamping of the services as they now stand, there will inevitably be upward referral to those specialist services, going by bitter experience in the UK.  They have to balance it.  If there are not specialists and consultants to manage that, there will not be a system.</p></speech>

Prevention is the way ahead but it has to be adequately resourced.  If that does not work out, there will have to be a safety net to deal with the inevitable problems that patients have because people are people.  Prevention is the answer for future but one still has to manage those with current difficulties, including those with significant comorbidity, and the elderly population.  We are all getting older, especially me.  We have to have a 21st century healthcare delivery system that allows that to be addressed.  That can only be addressed through appropriately trained, adequate numbers of experts, both at specialist and consultant level.  They will also be the leaders for the future of dentistry and without the leaders, there will not be dental provision.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Stassen, in particular, for coming in, since he operated on my daughter.  This is the first time I have seen him since the very successful operation in St. James's Hospital, for which I thank him.  I read the submissions, which are quite scary.  As Deputy Donnelly said, it is rare that we would get submissions in which the language is so stark.  The issue is quite serious.  I am concerned about the exclusion of the relevant health professionals and representative bodies from the consultation process.  Does either group have a view on why they were excluded and why it would be in the interests of the Department?  I am sure the Department has a good reason for not being here but I am disappointed about it, because that would round out our discussions.  I fully appreciate that officials have sent their apologies but it would have been better if we had been able to speak to them at the same time or as part of a separate session on the same day.  Do the witnesses have a good working relationship with the Department?  Mr. Hourihan and I would have previously interacted monthly, although it felt like it was daily, with the HSE in formal meetings where issues of concern were raised.  Is there a similar set-up in dentistry?  Is there anything like that at all?  The witnesses might offer a view as to why they feel they were excluded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Hourihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#H01300"><p>It is important to distinguish between the HSE and the Department of Health.  This is a Department of Health policy.  As the Deputy alluded to, we have plenty of experience engaging with the HSE.  For all that it can be difficult at times, there is a structure and basis to it.  I am not directing any of this comment to the HSE but to the Department because it is the Department's document.  We have not been shy about highlighting the effect of the cuts introduced in 2009.  Perhaps people did not want us to continue to point out the difficulties for patients.  We have commissioned countless articles and research, which is published in our journal.  Perhaps it was simply the fact that we are not shy about highlighting the difficulties.  Oral health has traditionally been the Cinderella within the broader health system.  I previously worked for the Irish Medical Organisation.  I commend it on its efforts.</p> <p>  There could be patients going to see a doctor in general practice and a dentist in general practice.  I know the Chairman is a doctor in general practice.  There is substantial funding for it.  Prior to the most recent negotiations, the Department of Finance estimated that grants, allowances and supports to doctors in general practice are approximately &euro;135 million a year, while there is nothing for dentistry.  Dentists have had a sanguine view of the interest of successive Governments in oral health.  We do not shy away from highlighting the impact on patients of not supporting oral health.  It is perhaps because we are as vocal as we are that we were not brought into the fold.  In our defence, we have a track record of innovation.  Ironically, when the current Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection, we negotiated, to our mutual satisfaction, changes to the dental benefit scheme.  We have been involved in innovation such as the establishment of a dental complaints resolution service, which is recognised as a model of its type.  We have been involved in advocacy with the annual mouth cancer awareness initiative, without support from the State or the HSE.  We have a track record of innovation and speaking out for oral health.  If that is why we are being punished, that is the only explanation I can offer.</p></speech>

To bring up what Mr. Hourihan said earlier about meaningful engagement, if I was developing a healthcare policy, I would want to engage the main stakeholders proactively.  I would want to listen to what they have to say.  I would want to return commentary on that as a show of respect.  I would want to make a contemporaneous return on that and then, through action, show that that input was valued.  I do not see evidence of that within this document, from the perspective of the Faculty of Dentistry and our concerns about postgraduate training.</p></speech>

I have my own view on why that would happen.  We all share the same sentiment that it is regrettable that we are talking about a discussion document into which the witnesses had no input.</p> <p>  On the number of vacant consultant posts, they gave information on the age range and confessed to ageing themselves.  I have to confess to the same.  We are all going in the same direction.  Are we facing an age-related cliff with regard to consultant posts, the number of vacancies, the number of retirements and the lack of consultants coming through or those who are leaving and not coming back?  Do the witnesses think that if we had a more formalised system of continuing professional development and training, we would be able to resolve that issue and head it off at the pass?</p></speech>

Replacing specialists and consultants at that level is about successional management.</p><p>Part of successional management is planning ahead, from the undergraduate through to the postgraduate continuum.  If the system is not doing this, it cannot be a surprise that it is not generating the people who are needed at the top end of the pyramid to deliver the leadership and expertise required to treat the very sick patients with comorbidities, the elderly and those with special care dentistry needs.  I shall defer to Professor Lynch who is a consultant and professor within one of the dental schools in Ireland who can perhaps comment on that issue also.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for meeting us and members for their interesting questions.  It is quite engaging sitting on this side of the table.  One can sense how members feel about the subject from the level of the questions they are asking us, for which I very much thank them.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what Mr. Hourihan and Dr. Marley said.  We are facing a people and power crisis in successional planning within the leadership and services in the dentistry profession in Ireland.  It relates to a number of issues surrounding the specialist training aspect, including the lack of a framework for training individuals who wish to train, the lack of funded opportunities and the failure to recognise the relevant specialist list, which is a big problem.  We operate under the Dentists Act 1985.  It was published and passed when I was in fourth class in primary school.  There are two recognised dental specialties in Ireland.  I have recently returned to Cork having worked for 11 years as a senior consultant in the United Kingdom where there are 13 dental specialties.  I was based in the main dental hospital in Cardiff in Wales.  We had a network of individuals around us such that the management of very complex and needy patients was quite straightforward because of the range of services to which there was access.  </p> <p>  My specialty is restorative dentistry.  It is not recognised as a specialty in Ireland, but it is in the United Kingdom.  I was involved in the management of patients with, for example, head and neck cancer.  They would have had areas of their mouth removed owing to the nature of their disease.  My job was to put things back and rehabilitate patients, either with implants or plates.  I am also involved in treating patients who have a condition called hypodontia.  They were born with certain teeth absent.  </p> <p>  The network in the United Kingdom was much more established.  I work with very gifted people in Ireland and there is a similar service in Cork, but, again, if the network was established around us, it would make life a lot easier for us as professionals in delivering an enhanced service for patients.  We need to look in a very serious way at the framework for training consultants and specialists and also at the recognition of dental specialties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#J00300"><p>I thank Professor Lynch.  I have one more question.  I do not disbelieve the figures that show there is an unusually high level of extractions in Ireland, especially among young children or younger people.  Notwithstanding the fact that the people who are material to the new strategy were left out of any meaningful discussion on it, do the delegate believe it will be possible to implement the new strategy with current staffing levels?  In attempting to implement the strategy with current staffing levels will it make any meaningful difference to the high level of extractions?  As a lay person, my reading is that the high level of extractions, particularly among children, is an indication that they are not undergoing their three dental checks in primary school.  I can hold my hand up in that regard.  Although it is a good while since I had any interaction with a primary school, it definitely did not happen three times.  Given the strategy and current staffing levels, is there any hope we will see a meaningful reduction in the level of extractions?  That is assuming I am correct in saying difficulties and missed appointments are flagged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Leo Stassen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#J00400"><p>When the Government introduced the change and reduced the level of dental treatment available to patients, we saw a significant increase in the number of children who presented for dental extractions in the hospital and the HSE extraction centres.  It is frightening when one sees the damage it does to a child and their future.  It frightens them away from prevention and everything else in that regard.  The new oral health policy refers to prevention, which is excellent and which we support completely, but the problem is that it takes time for prevention measures to work.  We believe the current structure of packages will actually detract from the ability to look after children, in particular those children with special needs.  We honestly believe there will be an increased need for extractions, not only in children but also adults, because of the way the policy has been put in place.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked if there were enough staff to undertake the treatment in the public dental service and the hospitals.  I say "No".  The waiting lists in both areas are very significant.  If the strategy was to be implemented - that is the important element - it would send patients to general dental practitioners who in many ways would not be able to cope with what the Government was asking of them.  There was no discussion on the policy, which was very unfortunate.  We believe it will increase inequality in providing dental care for all patients - young and old - and think that is very serious.  We want to work with the Department of Health.  We certainly would welcome a national oral health policy, but there are many flaws in what has been produced.  It is akin to a computer programmer producing a computer programme without discussing it with the people who will need to introduce it.</p></speech>

There seems to be a concern about the structure in place for trainees and newly qualified dentists.  Perhaps the committee might receive clarification on the matter.  What is the number of trainees who come out each year having completed degree courses in the two dental colleges?  What numbers are we talking about?  I understand dental training forms part of the degree course.  Will the delegates outline the training provided?</p> <p>  Reference was made to UK graduates having to perform an intern role for 12 months.  What is the procedure in Ireland when a person gains a degree and qualifies in dentistry and travels to the United Kingdom in the first 12 months after qualifying?  Is that graduate able to take an intern position there?  Perhaps the delegates might clarify the matter.  Normally in the first 12 months after qualifying people in the medical field work as an intern in hospitals.  We do not appear to have the same provision in the area of dentistry in Ireland.  Will the delegates outline what the process is in Ireland and the numbers involved?</p></speech>

There is an emerging dental workforce in the region of 100 individuals each year.</p></speech>

There has been national recruitment in the past three to four years, if memory serves me correctly.</p><p>The individuals who have approximately six months to go to graduation will undergo national recruitment interviews and be placed, based on rank, in the various regions in the United Kingdom.  The cost per trainee in Northern Ireland is in the region of &pound;60,000.  That includes various sundries such as travel expenses, etc.  It is an approximate cost for foundation training.</p><p> On the question of access for graduates from the Republic, they will find it very difficult to get into UK-based foundation training programmes, if they can do so at all.</p></speech>

Obviously, they graduate with a degree, but what is the process thereafter?  I presume a person who has just qualified would not get insurance to open his or her own practice and would probably have to move into an existing practice.</p></speech>

I presume the graduates enter that marketplace.  As of 2016, there were only 350 health board salaried dentists.  Mr. Hourihan may be able to comment further.</p></speech>

It is theoretically possible.  It would be possible to get professional indemnity insurance, but it tends not to be what dentists choose to pursue.  Traditionally, the route was for dentists to travel to the United Kingdom where they were able to access training scheme places.  As a result of administrative changes, that is no longer viable.  There was a vocational training scheme here, but it never had more than approximately 12 to 20 places.  It was abolished in 2010.  Currently, some graduates travel abroad to countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom or further afield.  Others apply for work in the public service, but such opportunities are few and far between.  Others seek to be taken on as an associate, a fully independent practitioner, seeing patients within a practice where a senior dentist is present.  Members may be familiar with the medical model in general practice or hospital specialties and the general practitioner training programme.  There is no equivalent for dental graduates.  There is no clear pathway.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the GP training programme which takes three or four years to complete after qualification.  Other training programmes in hospitals run from five to almost 12 years.  The latter period is to reach consultant level.  Was a detailed proposal made?</p></speech>

When such a proposal is made, associations usually engage with Departments or the various universities, hospitals and so on.  What level of engagement has occurred?  Obviously, if there were 100 per annum, it would not be a huge number.  It would be quite easy to calculate the cost of a year's training on the basis of the stated figure paid in Northern Ireland.  The homework seems to be done.  The question now is how it can be translated into a positive policy.  Has there been engagement with the Department or the HSE on this planned approach to training?</p></speech>

We were told that it would be considered in the context of the oral health policy, but it was not.  The policy contains passing reference to training, but there is no comment on the proposal that was submitted with a probably unprecedented number of signatories, which is very disappointing.  We can supply copies to the committee.</p></speech>

Yesterday the Cabinet signed off on something that I initially proposed in 2014.  Hence, I am not surprised when a matter is not progressed in a five-year timeframe.  If the committee sets a target of securing change in this area in the next 12 months, it will be quite an achievement to reach it.  It would be helpful for us to receive the documentation such that we could set it out as a goal to try to secure that change.  When was the most recent engagement with the Department on this matter?</p></speech>

It is a recurring issue that has been highlighted in countless presentations and submissions.  I am unsure whether there was a meeting specifically to consider that proposal alone.  It is well known within the dental community that the proposal was presented to the Department in the names of a large number of organisations.  It is referenced in several documents.  Recently the focus of the Department has been on the oral health policy document.  We were waiting to see what it contained.  I cannot say when the most recent engagement on the issue was <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

It is not a case of legislation.  Mr. Hourihan referred to legislating for CPD.  Obviously, dentists must renew their insurance each year.  I presume there is a structure whereby they must have membership of and pay fees to a professional body each year.  Would it be possible to require evidence of CPD to be shown before one was issued with a certificate to practise each year?</p></speech>

Every dentist must be registered with it in order to practise.  Registration is renewed annually.   The Dental Council makes it clear in its ethical guide that there is an obligation on dentists to engage in CPD.  There is documentation which details what is required, akin to what Senator Colm Burke has said is used to as a solicitor and similar to the situation for doctors.  However, it is an obligation, rather than a mandatory requirement.</p></speech>

My organisation would support mandatory CPD, but the Dental Council is of the view that it cannot implement it until the dental legislation is changed and updated.</p></speech>

CPD is not mandatory, although it should be.  The Dentists Act 1985 does not allow us to make it mandatory.  All of the relevant organisations, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the Irish Dental Association and the Dental Council have pressed for it to be mandatory.  Currently, all one must do to register is show one has a qualification in dentistry from Ireland or elsewhere.  That is a serious issue.</p><p> On the issue of somebody having qualified as a dentist, all of us support what we call vocational training, the foundation training and general professional training.  Once a person qualifies as a dentist, he or she can, if that person likes, go into the high street and set up his or her own specialist practice or dental practice and, as a dentist, do all aspects of dentistry.  Our problem is trying to reassure and safeguard the public.  To do that, we have always advocated for the introduction of what happens in the medical world - an intern year, a professional training or a foundation year which is, basically, a mentorship and supervisory experience.  At present, a person who qualifies as a dentist can become an associate.  He or she works for somebody but still remains an independent practitioner and the person for whom that person works cannot tell him or her what to do.  It is a poor situation we are in.</p></speech>

He will see there are priorities and action points in that.  The Department talks about nine priorities over three years that it would wish to see actioned, but within those there are 16 action points.  One of the nine priorities is action 28, which is when we first hear about updating the Dentists Act.  In terms of an evidential base of the priority placed on that, it speaks for itself, yet we are somewhat confused as to why that would not be in place to begin with before we introduce what is being proposed in terms of the oral health policy.  Professor Lynch has a comment to make in terms of continuing professional development, CPD, as well.</p></speech>

The Senator is speaking from his own experience within the legal profession.  We would like to have mandatory CPD within dentistry.  All the organisations in dentistry in Ireland feel that way.  It allows our practitioners to reassure patients that the dentists themselves are engaging in updating their knowledge and providing contemporary high-quality care.  It is about creating a framework which will allow our practitioners and dentists in Ireland to reassure the public that they are updating their knowledge and maintaining high-quality care for their patients.</p> <p>  In another way, it links back to the questions about foundation training and the year of supervised and mentored care.  I am a graduate from the Republic of Ireland.  I am a graduate from Cork.  My first job was as an associate in the UK 20 years ago where I worked in somebody's practice without the availability of a suitable mentoring arrangement.  The introduction of such a scheme in Ireland would be of great benefit to our graduates and to our patients.</p> <p>  In the UK, there is considerable research.  Educational research has been carried out on graduating dentists moving into this year of sheltered training and moving onwards into independent care.  It shows that there is a significant increase in the confidence of practitioners, but also in their ability to deliver high-quality care to their patients.</p> <p>  Within dental schools, we have directives and guidelines as to what we teach and train our students.  Our students are trained quite significantly in terms of the clinical skills they are expected to deliver, but there is an overall process where graduating students can move or transition from dental school into independent practice, and the year of mentored training and foundation training has been shown to have a significant positive effect in that regard.</p></speech>

I refer to the issue of people going abroad for dental treatment.  I have come across a number of problem cases where people have gone abroad for dental treatment because they thought it would be far cheaper and, a year, two years or three years later, are running into major problems.  It is not clear that we have a sufficient warning system on this issue that just because it is cheaper does not mean it is value for money.  I have someone now, for instance, who is going through a process which will cost &euro;25,000 to rectify the problem that the person had dealt with abroad.  How can that message be got out that there is no question about the competence of practitioners here in Ireland but that there are dangers in going abroad, and just because the treatment is cheaper does not mean a person will get value for money?</p></speech>

It sets out good questions, particularly if one is considering going aboard.  It is perfectly legitimate for people to choose where they are treated, but especially if they are going outside the country, there are some specific questions they need to ask.  The Dental Council has put together an excellent document.  The pity is that it is not widely known to the public.</p> <p>  As an association, part of our role is to advocate.  We convey that from time to time.  Sometimes people will criticise us because they will suggest we have an ulterior motive.  We do not because our members, as the Senator indicates, are the ones to whom the patients come back presenting and asking to be provided with remedial treatment.  As the Senator states, often it can be a multiple of what it cost and what they thought they were saving in the first place.</p> <p>  We would like to see greater awareness.  The Dental Council has a remit to care for patients and to look after the welfare and interests of patients.  We would like to see greater awareness of the excellent guide that it has published, that is available to view on its website but, unfortunately, is not as widely known as it ought to be.</p></speech>

I will be as quick as possible.  I thank our guests for coming before us this morning and making their presentation.</p><p>Orthodontics in particular has been an issue that I have pursued over many years, and I am sad to say that the service has not improved over the years.  It did not arise in 2009, by the way.  It has been there for many years.  In comparison with other jurisdictions, the level and quality of service available through the schools and thereafter, with particular reference to young women, is appalling, is recognised as such, and has been commented on repeatedly in international journals.  How often do our guests interact with the HSE or, previously, with the Department of Health, the health boards or whatever?  Do they do so annually, as I believe they need to do, or at particular times?  Do they have ongoing dialogue with the responsible officials in the HSE with a view to advancing the cause to which they have alluded?  My colleague raised questions about those seeking service outside the jurisdiction, which practice, incidentally, I do not agree with.  People will say, for instance, that access to dental services is less costly in Northern Ireland.  I do not support moving outside of the jurisdiction.  They might give us some idea.</p><p>The year 2009 was a watershed in the sense that cuts took place everywhere, and implicit in what we say from time to time is a suggestion that we should go back to 2009 levels everywhere.  If we go back to 2009 everywhere, we will be broke again.  That is the short and simple answer to that.  I would caution everybody that if we proceed to go down that road, there will be a higher price to pay.</p><p>The dental health of women throughout their lives does not receive the kind of attention in this country that it receives in other countries.  My colleague will deal with this subject in greater detail.  I deal with it in my clinics.  Every week, I have young women coming in who have serious fundamental dental problems for which they must wait.  If they cannot afford it, they wait forever.  This is not a new development.  This was the <i>modus operandi</i>30 years ago.  The health boards and the Department of Health at the time changed the categories under which a child could get treatment.  There were categories A, B and C.  In A, a person might be lucky if he or she got treatment in a couple of years.  In B, that person almost hardly ever did.  In C, he or she never did.</p><p>That situation continues to this day and has not changed.  It needs to be addressed, however, and there are a number of ways in which it can be.  As the professionals in the business, do our guests foresee being able to interact with the authorities, the Minister and the responsible persons in the Department of Health and the HSE with a view to bringing forward the kind of service required in modern times?</p><p> Our guests presumably make submissions annually.  They needs to be submitted annually.  There is not much sense in making a comment at some time and then letting it go away and not happen again.  I return again to the old days of the health boards.  The matter arose monthly throughout the country in the course of the debate in the various health boards.  There was a recognition at the highest level that the issue was causing problems downstream and that something should be done about it.  Something was not always done, but at least there was a focus on the issue and it was recognised as being of some urgency.</p><p> Mr. Hourihan suggested there had been little response from the Department of Health.  How often has the Irish Dental Association corresponded with the relevant authorities?</p><p> I apologise that I will be unable to remain for our guests' answers because I must attend the Chamber, but I will read them carefully and relate them to my constituents at my clinics next week.  It will help us know what we might expect in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#M00400"><p>I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.  Back in my days spent working in Dublin City Council, I worked with a few of them in the context of fluoride being in the water supply.  For the benefit of the public and the committee, will they speak briefly on the role of fluoride in the water supply and the risk that removing it would pose, with specific reference to oral health inequality and the difference in dental and oral health among socio-economic groups?</p> <p>  As a pharmacist, I have long been concerned with prophylactic antibiotic use in young children awaiting dental care, such as children with enamel hypoplasia and other conditions.  The waiting list for the required treatment can be so long that, as our guests will be aware but I am trying to explain it for the public, children are often prescribed a continuing dose of antibiotics.  I have seen cases of courses lasting more than a year, although perhaps our guests have seen worse cases than that.  I raise the matter in order that we will know what we are dealing with, and have dealt with for years, in the case of children.  This is how it has been managed.  It is not the same as when one is waiting for a hip operation, takes a few painkillers and suffers for a few months.  In the case of children, a significant portion of their young life can be spent on oral antibiotics which, if they had been treated earlier, they would not need.  As professionals, our guests might explain the impact of such prescriptions on children and their long-term health, as well as the negative effects of long-term antibiotic use.  If we had enough capacity, that type of treatment would not be used.</p> <p>  Thankfully, there has been much conversation in recent years about HPV vaccination.  Whichever of our guests is an expert on it might speak briefly on the rise of head and neck cancers, especially among young men, and how it affects the role of dentists, as people who look into mouths, and the strain it has on their service, if it does. What is our guests' position on the roll-out of the HPV vaccine to young boys?</p> <p>  I return to the issue of fluoride and socio-economic groups, as well as the effect of junk food in children's diets, especially those which include dried fruit and similar foods which are bad for teeth.  Have we done enough to educate young parents?  I know that juice is the devil in the world of dentists, as are dried raisins.  I myself have young children.  There is a lack of information available for parents, young or old, given that one might expect giving freshly squeezed juice or dried fruit to one's children to be good.  Is there work to be done with the public, perhaps at the point of delivery of a baby, to educate people about how to prevent children's dental decay and extraction?</p> <p>  Mr. Hourihan referred to the role of dental technicians and providing direct access to the public.  Will he elaborate on that?  I might ask some more questions.  I know what a dental technician is but I am concerned about the clinical interface.  Dentists are clinical specialists, regarded as doctors and permitted to use the title as such.  Will Mr. Hourihan comment further on the move he mentioned?  I did not understand what he meant.  Did he mean that somebody can substitute for a dentist?  Somebody might inform me better in that regard and I might ask more questions.</p></speech>

The idea of meaningful engagement was raised earlier but there is also the concept of engagement fatigue.  That we are appearing before the committee should be an index of the fatigue and frustration we feel as bodies and it should speak volumes.  I will hand over to Mr. Hourihan to address the other issues because I am not an expert on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Hourihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#M00600"><p>I will ask Professor Stassen to address a number of clinical matters raised by Deputies Durkan and O'Connell because the professor is eminently qualified to deal with them.  To supplement what Dr. Marley said, we have regular engagement, far more frequently than annually, with the HSE and the Department of Health.  In recent years, the standard response has been that orthodontics is considered as part of the oral health policy.  We now have the policy, which is a basis for discussion and we intend to approach it on those terms.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised the matter of orthodontics.  As he correctly indicated, there have been problems with waiting lists and the demand for orthodontic care and treatment that long predate 2009.  A report into orthodontic services has been commissioned by the HSE.  It has not been published, although we would like to be.  We are aware there has been another recent controversy and that a report will be published imminently in that regard.  We are keen for both reports to be published sooner rather than later and we will see what issues will arise.  There is no getting away from the fact that there is insufficient capacity in the public service to offer the care required.  The index of treatment need system is a way of dealing with that and rationing what can be provided with the available resources.  It cannot be denied it is a resource related issue.  As for the regularity of our submissions, we take the point that we must keep making representations on the matter.</p> <p>  Professor Stassen might speak about the issues of fluoridation, antibiotics, HPV and technicians.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-15a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Leo Stassen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019051500002#M00700"><p>They are all good questions and I hope I can answer some of them.  On the HPV vaccination, much has been written in the newspapers and discussed around the Government about cervical cancer and the problems it has created for women, in general, but also the serious problems it has created for how medicine and surgery deal with it.  The HPV vaccination has been shown to be significantly protective.  It has been shown to be useful and has been given to many girls for many years, but it should also be given to boys.</p><p>It is, without a doubt, one of the most lifesaving things that could be produced.  If it had been introduced at such a level in the past, which it would not have been, we would not be where we are now with these court cases and the threats to cervical screening.</p><p> With regard to the input, I treat an awful lot of mouth cancers.  I treat more than 100 cases of mouth cancers each year.  There has been a significant increase in the amount of mouth cancer, in particular oropharyngeal, which is directly related to HPV.  This is placing significant stress on our system of providing care for mouth cancer patients.  How it reflects in dentistry is important because many cases of mouth cancer are picked up by dentists as well as by pharmacists and doctors and they often end up with us.  Many of them require radiotherapy and they need screening by a dentist prior to having radiotherapy.  We heard Professor Lynch speak about this.  They need screening after their radiotherapy in the context of dental care.  The HPV vaccine is an absolute no-brainer and I hope the committee will push it as strongly as it can for girls and boys.</p><p> We then come to enamel hypoplasia but we are really speaking about caries, infection and other problems in young children that require antibiotics.  Antibiotics are not the treatment for caries.  Prevention is how it should be managed, followed by early detection, protecting and saving the teeth.  A tooth that develops an abscess and requires an extraction is a failure of a health system and of dentistry.  I agree completely that antibiotics are not the treatment; the treatment is prevention.  If a patient has an abscess, the treatment is probably root canal, if possible, in the older population and, for a child, extraction of the tooth but we cannot actually provide this.  This needs to be addressed.  Enamel hypoplasia is a very small part of the story.  Caries is the big problem.</p><p> Fluoride was mentioned, as was sugar. What we do know is if we want to have in place a good programme to prevent tooth decay we require fluoride, decreased sugar by whatever means in the diet and tooth brushing.  We can teach children through proper systems to brush their teeth.  We are working on trying to decrease the amount of sugar people take.  As president, I will be pushing for a lot of support for this.  We need to inform people on how children get sugar because mothers and fathers do not know.  People who train them for sport give them a sugar treat at the end of training, which is absolutely the wrong thing to do.  They should get an apple or even a toothbrush but they should not get a sugar treat.</p><p> Fluoride has been shown by all of the research available at present, and research needs to continue, to be the most practical, cost-effective and safe way to help manage caries.  Unfortunately, in the strategy put to us, it is seen as everything and it is not.  Many places do not have fluoride.  Children older than two need topical fluoride, fissure sealants and varnishes.  They are not part of the national oral strategy.  If we cannot prevent decay developing in younger people, we will have a serious problem.  If fluoride is pushed, we will also push tooth-brushing and reduced sugar of any type.  I guarantee that all of the research so far shows the application of fluoride to be safe at the levels recommended by Europe.</p><p> Dental technicians were mentioned.  The problem is educating the public on what is a dental technician.  People working on the high street as what we call denturists or dental technicians have no training in examining a mouth, head or neck, which a dentist does.  They have no experience of what mouth cancer looks like and, as I have stated, I see more than 100 cases of this year.  They are dangerous.  Many of them who provide treatment to patients are assaulting those patients and it should be taken up by the Garda as assault.</p></speech>

Clinical dental technicians are a different group of people.  There is not a huge number of them but they work very closely with general dental practitioners, hospital specialists and consultants.  They are trained to a very high level.  They know their scope of practice and what they can and cannot do.  In fairness, their role is well supported by the Irish Dental Association and hospital practice.  The clinical dental technician is a completely different person to the dental technician or denturists who, in many cases, provide illegal dentistry to patients.  Anybody who provides direct access must have a scope of practice and must be compulsorily regulated.</p> <p>  I believe I have answered most of the Deputies' questions but I will go back to Deputy Durkan.  Orthodontics is a very sexy name and everybody likes to talk about it.  Orthodontists do an extraordinarily good job and many of my very good friends are orthodontists.  What are forgotten about are the other dentistry professionals who work very closely with orthodontists.  I am speaking about restorative dentists, periodontists, endodontists, oral surgeons and maxillofacial surgeons.  We all work very closely together.  Part of the problem with orthodontics is when a mother and father are, quite correctly, worried about their child and bring the matter to all of the Deputies to highlight the issues with orthodontics.  However, the rest of dentistry and the specialisations we have spoken about are sometimes forgotten.  I have four children and I want them to have nice teeth, as does every parent, because it is very important.  I am supportive of what has been achieved.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that dental care is not just about orthodontics; it is about the whole of the dental team providing a service to patients in order to ensure that they have what the Minister, Deputy Harris, referred to, which is equitable and the highest quality of oral health.  I do not know whether I have answered all of the Deputies' questions.</p></speech>

That was the PRSI scheme.  Changes were also made to the medical card scheme and there were two aspects to this.  These were the cut in fees to dentists and the severe restrictions on the range of treatments provided to the patient.  In fact, in terms of the consequences, the restriction on the range of treatments was far greater.  Obviously, dentists are unhappy that their fees were cut.  From the point of view of patients, however, the severe restrictions were greater.  Previously, it was an open-ended scheme with certain treatments explicitly provided for.  Two changes were made.  It moved to a capped or budget-led scheme.  It was a demand-led scheme and it is now a budget-led scheme.  Changes were also made whereby some treatments that were previously covered automatically are no longer covered, or some are still available but dentists must seek approval or permission, which is sometimes given and sometimes not.  The FEMPI consequences for the two schemes were many and varied but the consequences for patients, as was said earlier, mean an increased number of presentations with far more advanced difficulties.</p></speech>

Now, he must get approval for a treatment plan before he can proceed.  Is it true to say that perhaps this is hindering the progression of a treatment pathway?</p></speech>

As medical card patients were not given access to all dental treatments, implants, crowns and so on were never part of the scheme.  In simple terms, the scheme provided the essentials or routine treatments.  After 2009, there was a scaling back or reduction in the number of routine treatments that were covered automatically.  There were some treatments that could be approved on application to the HSE.  To give a short answer to the Deputy's question, the dentist sees the patient and draws up a treatment plan, which will encompass some treatments that are covered automatically by the medical card, some which can be applied for and others that will never be covered.  The great difficulty is that the HSE has not recognised that a treatment plan will include prescribed treatments that are not available automatically, if at all, and has made no provision for that.  While I accept the point made by Deputy Durkan that we cannot return to the position that pertained in 2009, we can go some way towards it or, failing that, we could introduce a completely new system because the medical card system is completely unfit for purpose.</p></speech>

Professor Lynch may comment on this matter as well.  It would probably be more than a year or sometimes two years before we received a response.  Frequently, if the principal dental surgeon could afford it with the budget available, we might be able to reconstruct the mouths of these patients so that they could eat, drink and have a life.  When I excised the cancers of these patients, it often involved excising all of their teeth or their jaw.  When they have no teeth they cannot eat, speak or drink.  I do not know whether Professor Lynch wants to comment.  It is very hard to get funding for such treatment.  While I admit that is at a higher level, it should be automatic.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare was mentioned earlier.  Will the oral health strategy complement Sl&aacute;intecare?  Are there overlapping elements?  One of the fundamental principles of Sl&aacute;intecare is to provide care on the basis of need, not on the ability to pay.  Obviously, Sl&aacute;intecare also encompasses dental care.  How can Sl&aacute;intecare be implemented within the oral health strategy?</p></speech>

She specifically mentioned the publication of the oral health policy, which was welcome.  As such, the policy fits in with Sl&aacute;intecare and our document notes that it is consistent with Sl&aacute;intecare.  We agree that if one of the essential principles of Sl&aacute;intecare is meeting need, that should apply certainly to the same degree to oral health.  We are very keen to make sure that approach is taken.</p></speech>

Would provision for a number of free dental visits for children specifically, but also for adults, be incorporated in the contractual arrangements for dentists?  What contractual arrangements do dentists have with the HSE?</p></speech>

The profession currently provides examinations to practically everyone.  Likewise, when children are seen in the public service there is no charge.  There is, therefore, no charge for the overwhelming majority of adults and for children under 16 years of age.  The question is whether sufficient resources are in place to allow that to happen.  Obviously, not everyone will avail of the option.</p> <p>  Dentistry is all about prevention and dentists would like to see far more focus on prevention.  To be fair, this has been recognised in the oral health policy but making it happen requires supports.  As a medical doctor, the Chairman will be aware that a significant level of free care is available to patients when they see their doctors and the cost is met by the State.  Far less free care is available to patients when they see their dentists but that is the nature of the existing contract.  The problem is that the treatments and the limitations on treatments render that less than ideal.  Clearly, more people are coming into the country all the time and more expenditure is needed to allow them to avail of treatments.</p><p> Children are currently seen in the public service.  Every child is seen, which is a great facility.  If they are not seen as regularly as they should be, it is because there are not enough dentists in the public service.  That is why it is astonishing to us that there is a proposal to take the service away and to instead have a completely different model that relies on people showing up, instead of bringing them all into the public service clinic.  The problem with the service. as currently structured, is that there are not enough dentists.  This means children are not seen as frequently as they would otherwise be.</p></speech>

An examination of a child takes a relatively long time.  For the dentist, it is not just a matter of the examination because many of the children require treatment.  That general dental practitioner is seriously restricted in the provision of that treatment under the current system.  If the children require preventive treatment, tooth brushing and such measures can take a lot of time.  Fissure sealings and fillings take a lot of time.  Even if an extraction by a general dental practitioner is, unfortunately, required, it takes a lot of time.  The examination is free, but the rest is not really.  Is that not fair to say?  Most of what we do in dentistry is preventive, with as little treatment as possible.  We are slightly different from doctors who examine the patient to make sure there is nothing serious, as is right, and then manage to treat them.  The doctor might see the patient again in a week to check that he or she is okay.  In dentistry, it can be at least six weeks to two months before proper treatment is undertaken.  Unlike doctors, everybody is afraid of the dentist.  Therefore, it takes a lot of time for us to handle children.</p></speech>

The services are encouraging extractions.  I am not the expert because it is not what I deal with.  If one has another disease, the condition cannot be treated.  It is left and becomes an infection, requiring the extraction of the tooth.  The number of teeth being extracted is significant.  They do not need to be extracted.  Mr. Hourihan will explain the details of the programme.</p></speech>

If they are not seen at an early stage, the likelihood is extractions are more probable than otherwise would be the case.  There are severe difficulties, but that is because of diet in the first instance and the need for greater health promotion and prevention messages.  Children ought to be seen in second, fourth and sixth class.  That is what the policy states.  It is suggested in the oral health policy that it is happening, but it is not.  In many parts of the country children are seen for the first time only in sixth class; therefore, they are ten, 11 or 12 years old, which is way too late.  If one is only being seen at that stage, it is likely one will require far more extractions than would otherwise be the case.  If children were seen earlier, privately or in the public service, much of this could be avoided.</p></speech>

I really admire them for standing their ground and not accepting things.  They did so in such a dignified manner.  I say, "Well done," to them.</p> <p>  The name of the policy is Smile and Sl&aacute;inte.  As the delegates are not smiling, perhaps we should consider a name change.  I am very disappointed that there is no representative from the Department of Health here.  I spoke about this before.  The delegates are speaking to the converted.  If representatives from the Department of Health were here, they would, I hope, take on board what they are saying.  It is like saying, "D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i."  I acknowledge that the Department sent an apology, but surely somebody should be available.</p></speech>

I am also amazed that there was no consultation.  If there is a plan, the people directly affected should have their opinions taken on board.  It beggars belief the delegates were not consulted.  Professor Stassen said people were afraid of the dentist.  It seems that the Minister definitely is.  The delegates are awaiting a meeting with him which I hope will take place.  They had made known their views on the lack of consultation.  Has the Minister acknowledged them in any way?  Has he picked up the telephone and spoken to anyone or reply to emails personally?  Is he aware of the extent of the delegates&rsquo; horror at not being consulted?</p></speech>

Members have heard from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Irish Dental Association that there has been no engagement.  There has been a box ticking exercise.  The Minister has been advised that there has been engagement and consultation.  It is disappointing that representatives of the Department are not here because I would like to know what they consider engagement to be.  In fairness to the Minister, the information he receives from his advisers is that there has been engagement, but members are hearing from very senior people in the Faculty of Dentistry and the Irish Dental Association that no meaningful engagement or consultation has occurred.</p></speech>

Mr. Hourihan has said the oral health policy fails to explain the reported level of dental decay and that it is seriously under-reported, involving as it does the exclusion of as many as 21% of children.  Will the delegates expand on that matter?  How could that happen?</p></speech>

The study examined children who were living continuously in areas where water was fluoridated.  It did not, for a long period, take account of those in care settings or who arrived into the country.  One of our members, a colleague, estimated that perhaps 20% of the population were excluded.  Obviously, 80% were included, but the view of the experts we consult suggests it means that the level of decay is under-reported.  If one examines the profile of those excluded, one notes that they present with greater levels of decay.  What we are really saying is there is a significant number of caries or level of dental decay and that it is greater than the report suggests.  Every survey works on certain assumptions.  I am sure the one in question was appropriately designed and executed.  However, the assumptions did exclude large numbers of people.</p><p>All told, this suggests the level of decay around us is greater than is suggested in the report. </p></speech>

The hospital provides complex care, in particular, for patients who might have intellectual disabilities, for whom getting access to the hospital for treatment can be difficult.  What is the situation in regard to staffing and consultants in the hospital?</p></speech>

In its own right, that poses certain difficulties.  For my own institution, I cannot speak to it directly as it is not my area.  We have a waiting list which is managed through the HSE and we deliver care in that context.  In the Dublin dental hospital, at least two consultants are employed in special care dentistry.  I am not sure what the situation is in regard to its waiting list.</p></speech>

In the provision of a service, the service has to reflect what the postgraduate and undergraduate training requires; therefore, a dental school is limited in the service it can provide in whatever area it be, whether special needs, extractions or periodontics.  The waiting list in the Dublin dental school is closed for most services unless it can fit within the area of undergraduate and postgraduate education or research needs.  The service commitment from a dental hospital or dental school is small and, therefore, it is not surprising that waiting lists are very long.</p></speech>

It is a particularly time-consuming type of treatment and it needs to be a particular person, which not everybody is.  Some people like dealing with that type of person so one can get the provision of special care in general practice, but most dental practitioners are unable to provide that type of treatment.  It is mainly in schools that it can be accessed rather than in hospital services.</p> <p>  I support the national oral health plan, which is to look at this issue, particularly in regard to the private people to see how they might be given dental care.  Who is going to provide it is our question.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact there is no recognition of the specialist qualification, a number of dentists work for the HSE public dental service and they are managed by the principal dental surgeon.  It is a regional service.  There are dentists who see special care patients in the HSE as opposed to the dental hospitals.</p></speech>

I do not believe the national oral health strategy has looked at this.  To provide treatment to a special needs patient, one could be talking about two or three sessions before they will even sit in a dental chair, and there is then the treatment.  It can take an inordinate time.  When one looks at the costing and the important resources that need to be put into this, it is not only people but it takes significant time, effort and cost to, quite correctly, provide treatment for special needs patients.  That has not been accounted for.  Everybody thinks that every dentist can provide this treatment.  Although I am not a general dentist, if a person came to my practice and I had to see them four times, I have to consider I am paying for my premises and nurses, and I have no input from anybody else.  That is a huge cost and it has not been addressed.</p></speech>

As members will be aware from the debate in plenary session of the House, the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate a person who is under the supervision of the probation service in one EU member state but who lives in another in returning home and undergoing supervision there.  The proposals made in the Bill are to increase the chances of social reintegration and the rehabilitation of offenders convicted of offences abroad; to better protect victims by ensuring non-resident offenders comply with probation conditions; and to reduce the unnecessary detention of non-resident offenders by ensuring non-custodial sentences can be enforced in the person's home state.  I acknowledge the importance of these objectives.  I also acknowledge the support of the House so far in this debate and look forward to our engagement.</p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to remove any ambiguity that may arise over the fact that the term &quot;applicant&quot;, as used in section 8, means an applicant as defined in section 4.  The term is used in section 4 where an application is made for a presumption of death order.  It is also used in section 8 where a variation order is sought in respect of what was an original presumption of death order.  The amendment is for clarity, therefore.  An applicant in section 4 is defined as the spouse or civil partner of a missing person; the cohabitant of a missing person; any other family member of the missing person, including a child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, half-brother, half-sister, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece of the missing person; a person who is acting <i>in loco parentis</i>for the missing person; a dependant of the missing person; or any other person with a sufficient interest, including, where relevant, the Attorney General or another person acting on behalf of the State in the circumstances.  The definition is all-embracing.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 7, 11 and 13 provide for the deletion of extraneous text.  Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, and 12 concern punctuation issues.  Amendment No. 14 provides that neither Part 5 nor Part 5A of the Civil Registration Act 2004 shall apply to a presumed death, thereby correcting an earlier omission of a reference to Part 5A.  In that regard, members should note that Part 5 concerns the registration of deaths in general and that Part 5A concerns the keeping of a record of deaths abroad.  As these are technical amendments, I seek support for them.</p></speech>

The appropriate registrar is:</p><blockquote>a registrar in the functional area of the authority in which&mdash;(a) the death was presumed to have occurred, or<br /><br />(b) if a place of presumed death cannot be determined, the area in which the missing person was normally resident.</blockquote> <p>The proposed amendments are in the interests of the efficient management of the registration process.  They allow an tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir the flexibility to perform registrations centrally or to assign the task to a registrar, thus simplifying the registration process by comparison with the process in the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  The proposed arrangements will also act to provide a single point of contact for the receipt of court orders.  The text has regard to the wording used in section 65(3) of the Civil Registration Act 2004, to which I made reference.  Again, it is in the interests of the efficient and careful management of the process and to allow for clarity.  I ask that the amendments be given favourable consideration by members of the committee.</p></speech>

In the context of the earlier legislation, I said we had approximately nine weeks left in this parliamentary session.  This is important legislation and I am very keen to ensure its safe passage through the House on Report Stage in plenary session.  I know that there are members present who will have an interest in dealing with the Bill on that Stage.  I am very keen to have the Bill enacted and make a commencement order at the earliest opportunity.  I acknowledge our colleagues in the Seanad for sponsoring the Bill.  I thank members of the committee for their efficient management of the Bill on Committee Stage, for which I am grateful to them.</p></speech>
