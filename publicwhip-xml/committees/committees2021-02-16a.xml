Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, support staff and myself are in the Seanad Chamber.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that all members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit either here or the Convention Centre, to participate in public meetings.   The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and he is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today, we are engaging with officials from the National Shared Services Office to examine the following: the 2019 Appropriation Account for Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office; and from the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2019 Report on the Accounts of the Public Service, Chapter 5 - Implementation of Financial Management Shared Services.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely, from within the precincts of Leinster House, by the following officials from the National Shared Services Office, Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan, chief executive officer, Ms Bernie Kelly, assistant secretary, and Mr. Sean Reilly, assistant secretary.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. Fergal Costello, Government accounting officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would like to begin by welcoming them all to the meeting.  I thank them and their staff for the briefing material that they have sent on to us and prepared for the meeting.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their computers when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  I also ask that contributors use the button to raise their hand when they wish to contribute.  As always, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile telephones are on silent mode or switched off.  When they finish speaking they should take down their hand signal and I ask as I know that it can be forgotten.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  However, one of today's witnesses is giving evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness that is physically present  The witness has already been advised that he or she may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting and debates services, I ask members, where possible, to direct their questions to specific witnesses.  If the question has not been directed to a particular witness then I ask the witness to state his or her name before responding.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021021600002#A00600"><p>The National Shared Services Office, NSSO, provides a range of administrative support functions on a shared services basis for central government Departments and for certain other public service bodies.  Since 1 January 2018, the NSSO has operated as a separate Civil Service office under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 18 records gross expenditure by the NSSO of &euro;47.5 million of which 60% or &euro;28 million was on pay.  The expenditure is distributed across four programmes.  Three of these represent the direct expenditure incurred in the year in providing the target services: programme B relates to human resources functions, at a cost of &euro;10.1 million in 2019; programme C relates to payroll shared services at a cost of &euro;12.2 million; and programme D relates to finance shared services at a cost of &euro;539,000 in 2019.  System development costs for finance shared services in 2019, totalling &euro;11.3 million in 2019, were charged to programme A, titled the NSSO function.  This was the largest of the programmes at a total cost of &euro;24.6 million in 2019.</p> <p>  There was also an underspend in the year of &euro;9.8 million or 17% relative to the gross Estimate.  This was mainly due to delays in the roll-out of the financial management shared service, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that the outturn on the Vote does not reflect the value of the payroll payments handled by the NSSO on behalf of its client bodies.  These totalled &euro;5.3 billion in salary and pension payments in 2019.  The cost of the payments was charged back to the respective Votes and other client accounts.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the statement on internal financial control, which discloses that the NSSO did not comply with national procurement rules in respect of a services contract that operated in 2019.  Due to a misinterpretation, the NSSO continued to draw on the contract after the estimated value had been exceeded.  When the misinterpretation was clarified, use of the contract ceased.</p> <p>  The report before the committee looks at the implementation of the NSSO's financial management shared services project.  The project is a complex one as it aims to replace 31 disparate financial reporting systems across 48 central government Departments and offices with a single financial management system.  At the point we were completing the report the project was significantly behind on delivery while costs incurred were considerably in excess of what was expected.</p> <p>  The business case, approved by Government in 2016, projected total expenditure for the project of &euro;47.4 million, excluding VAT.  To the end of 2019, the NSSO had spent &euro;38.4 million, excluding VAT.  The NSSO expected additional expenditure of &euro;15 million in 2020.</p> <p>  Roll-out of the single financial system was planned to take place in several stages.  The first group of client bodies was expected to start using the new system in the middle of 2018, with other waves of client bodies to follow.  By September 2020, the new system was not yet ready for use.</p> <p>  A key deliverable for the project was the development of an agreed chart of accounts.  This documents the accounts and account codes that an organisation requires for recording financial transactions.  Agreement on a chart of accounts by the potential users of the financial system proved very challenging.  While the original business case envisaged that a chart of accounts would be completed in late 2016, it was not signed off until 2020.</p><p>A large proportion of the work on the project was contracted out to a systems implementation partner.  Disputes over the terms of the contract continued throughout the work on the project.  In addition, a review by an external consultant completed in early 2019 identified significant design issues and weaknesses in the project governance framework.</p><p> As our report was being finalised in September 2020, a Government decision approved the continued development of the single financial system over an extended timeline to 2025.  Additional funding was approved, bringing the total budget for the project to &euro;115 million, including VAT.</p></speech>

We have provided the committee with detailed briefing materials.  Therefore, I will keep my statement to the matters for consideration today, which are the appropriation account 2019 for Vote 18 - National Shared Services Office and chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2019, which is titled Implementation of financial management shared services.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by Ms Kelly, assistant secretary and head of finance shared service operations, currently tasked with leading the financial management shared services programme, and Mr. Reilly, assistant secretary, who is our head of corporate services.  I may, with the Chairman's permission, call on my colleagues to assist with the answering of specific questions committee members may have.</p> <p>  With regard to the appropriation account for 2019, I welcome the clear audit opinion given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of Vote 18 for shared services, which is subject to review today.  Since the NSSO was first established on an administrative basis in 2014, and on a statutory basis in 2018, I and my colleagues on the management board have worked to ensure the NSSO operates effectively and efficiently as the service organisation to the Civil Service and that the use of public resources is scrutinised and optimised to ensure best value for money for the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The office has recorded a surplus of &euro;9.846 million for the financial year 2019, as indicated in the appropriation account on page 7.  The sum of &euro;1 million of this underspend was carried forward for use in 2020, as provided for under section 91 of the Finance Act 2004, leaving a surplus of &euro;8.82 million to be surrendered to the Exchequer.  This surplus arises primarily with regard to new programmes of work, with existing operations tracking close to budget.  These new programmes are significant, complex and transformational.  Decisions around project pace and delivery must be managed by the NSSO to ensure an acceptable level of risk.</p> <p>  I would now like to address the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 2019, chapter 5 - Implementation of financial management shared services.  The committee will be aware that while financial management is progressing towards deployment, it has not yet been implemented, whereas the NSSO has successfully implemented and is delivering HR and pensions administration services since 2013 to 38,388 civil servants and payroll and travel and expenses services to 144,266 payees.  As well as servicing civil servants, the NSSO pays the Defence Forces, members of the Garda and 60,000 pensioners.  In 2020, the NSSO was responsible for the payment of more than &euro;5.5 billion, that is, &euro;4 billion in salaries and allowances to serving civil and public servants and &euro;1.5 billion in pensions to retired civil and public servants.</p> <p>  I have provided the committee with a copy of the report of an external review of the savings achieved by HR and payroll shared services to date, which identified savings of &euro;54.2 million during the three-year period of 2016 to 2019.  This has been independently verified and equates to some &euro;13.6 million per annum.  These services have delivered, and continue to deliver, value for money for the taxpayer and Government.</p> <p>  Finance shared services will use greater automation to produce standard accounts and management information for the annual appropriation accounts and central finance reporting for Government, and will eliminate the significant manual effort required to meet reporting requirements.  The complexity lies in bringing all payment processing, Exchequer accounting and finance and accounting administration for all Government Departments to a level of standardisation supporting international accounting standards and reporting necessary to enable financial and fiscal reforms.</p> <p>  The requirement for a modernised single integrated financial platform for central government and for more timely and comprehensive reporting on an accruals basis, has been referenced extensively, both internationally by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the OECD, and here within the Committee of Public Accounts.  This programme will deliver a platform for both cash and accrual accounting with increased automation for reporting.  The extensive reforms resulting from this process design and a single harmonised chart of accounts that will be delivered as part of the finance shared services programme, together with the supporting technology infrastructure, are key enablers for the enhanced reporting framework.  This programme commenced in 2016 and although it is now making good progress, its implementation has taken longer than the original ambitious plan, primarily due to underestimation of the work required to bridge the gap from the current predominately cash accounting system to build a comprehensive system in compliance with international standards.</p> <p>  While acknowledging that it has taken longer to get to this point, changes are not unusual in these large complex enterprise projects in either the public or private sector.  Indeed, the potential for a delay of up to two years was anticipated in the business case.  The breadth and depth of work necessary to deploy this programme has turned out to be significantly more challenging than originally envisaged, but the programme has now remobilised under an updated timeline and budget that has been approved by the Government.</p> <p>  I would like to make a number of other comments regarding specific points within the chapter.  Controlling costs is critically important to the NSSO.  The expenditure associated with this phase of work had already been reviewed by the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office as part of its annual audit for 2019.  The Comptroller and Auditor General makes reference in his report to expenditure of &euro;10.3 million, which he states was potentially avoidable.  This expenditure includes ongoing project costs.  It also includes a critical and extensive review of the system design, external factors such as data protection developments and increasing cyber-risk and changes in the banking arrangements for the Paymaster General.  This involved a detailed risk assessment of all aspects of the programme and the presentation of alternative solutions in early 2019.  Every effort was made to minimise costs during this time.</p> <p>  With the help of expert advice, the programme team identified four critical issues to be addressed as follows: necessary design changes and enhancements, key design decision-making authorities, stronger technical and programme management support and agreement with the systems integration partner.  The outcome of this review, which took several months to conclude, is a fully approved design agreed by the design authority comprising of finance officers and the senior user, which was the essential foundation needed for the programme to move forward.  The design also incorporates extra build requirements.  There are now enhanced governance structures in place across the programme.  The programme risks have significantly reduced.</p> <p>  Following the completion of the review in the latter half of 2019, the resumption and remobilisation of the programme commenced.  This was further impacted by delays in 2020 due to the pandemic, as the ways of working had to be adapted to remote working with access and additional security measures needed.  The programme planning had to be adapted.  This required further investment to enhance the security of the system.</p> <p>  A Government decision in September 2020 approved the continued deployment of the finance shared service system over an extended project timeline to 2025.  It also approved additional funding based on the enhanced design, bringing the total approved budget for the project to &euro;115 million, which includes some &euro;20 million in VAT.  A sum of &euro;54 million, including VAT, was approved under the Government decision in 2016.  At that time, the business case also considered the potential where the programme could require an additional two years.  The direct programme costs, including VAT associated with that time-delayed scenario, were forecast at &euro;72 million.  The additional expenditure approved is being used to modify and enhance the technology solution delivered, manage the capability risks and take a more realistic timeline to prepare and bring Departments onto the new system based on lessons learned.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General included two recommendations in his report.  With regard to the first, I can confirm to the committee that a revised plan and costings for the implementation of the solution and deployment to the first wave of clients has been agreed, and a revised budget and indicative timeline for the programme has been approved by Government.  The Departments and offices in the first wave include the Department of Finance, the Exchequer, the Office of the Ombudsman, the President's Establishment, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my office, that is, the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>Detailed engagement is under way with the client Departments and offices, including the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to support their preparation for changes in ways of working.</p><p> Regarding the second recommendation, the NSSO has completed an extensive design review process, during which it engaged with Departments and working group representatives.  The NSSO is also engaging closely with advisers to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the solution design will cater for all public sector accounting standards.  Despite the many challenges encountered during the pandemic, this revised programme is well under way and has already passed a number of required planned stage gates.</p><p> Shared services are transforming and contributing to the modernisation of critical functions and services in the civil and public services.  Shared services free up resources to support core Government services and priorities for front-line services.  They are creating capacity to increase strategic capability in HR, payroll and finance to support the Government and the workforce and workplace of the future.  By operating a single standard way of working, the NSSO is able to support Civil Service leadership in responding quickly to new and emerging fiscal and financial requirements and changes such as the formation of a new Government or accounting, pay or tax changes, for example, PAYE modernisation.</p><p> In summary, I am confident that the actions taken to manage the risks in the finance shared services programme were the correct ones and will result in an enhanced overall reporting and finance system for the State and the whole of Government.  This transformation programme has certainly given us an opportunity to learn from mistakes and improve on programme and risk management.  The new system will consolidate all central government accounting.  It simply has to be right.  It will also standardise the way we interact with our suppliers, many of them small and medium enterprises and the Government will for the first time have a single central payment solution for all suppliers.</p><p> Before I conclude, I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank my staff.  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and despite the challenges of moving to remote working arrangements and the personal impacts of Covid, they have ensured that all essential services continued to be delivered and that this programme continued to progress.  Committee members may be aware that the NSSO assisted the Department of Social Protection by providing a helpdesk service for pandemic unemployment payment customers during times of acute need in April, July and November.  I also thank the members of the NSSO's advisory board, the financial management share services, FMSS, programme board and our other boards and committees for their continued support and the time they have given generously to assist the delivery of this ambitious programme of change.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  I will answer the questions that members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

We just heard that the NSSO was originally projected to complete the FMSS project by June 2020 with a total expenditure of &euro;47.4 million.

The cost of the programme in 2016 was &euro;54 million, including VAT.  The figure of &euro;115 million also includes VAT.  When the programme and business case were developed in 2015 and approved by the Government in 2016, it was considered that a delay in the programme was possible and, therefore, that the cost of the programme could be &euro;72 million, including VAT.

The original business case identified that cost savings in the range of &euro;15 million per annum would be realised when FMSS was fully implemented.  As I explained, however, the benefits go far beyond the savings to the taxpayer thanks to the significant implementation, the enhancements, the opportunities for international accounting standards, the introduction of a dual accounting system, central financial reporting and more information being available than is the case currently.</p></speech>

That will be useful.  I wish to ask about the disruption to the project in 2018.  Will Ms Murphy-Fagan outline what that interruption was?  The project is being run in partnership with a private provider.  Will she outline how that partnership interacted with the 2018 interruption?</p></speech>

Those risks were being tracked.  In mid-2018, the programme decided that they were increasing rather than decreasing.  A decision was taken that, rather than to proceed with the original timeline and start the testing of the system, the project would pause, reflect and review exactly where it stood and what issues were outstanding.  That work commenced-----</p></speech>

In a programme of this scale, these are normal risks that are managed, but in this case they were increasing rather than decreasing.  A decision was taken at that stage that, rather than pushing ahead with the timeline for users to commence testing the system, we would pause, examine the system and the issues and understand better what the concerns and issues were that remained to be resolved.  That work commenced at the end of 2018 and took until mid-2019.  During that time, a detailed review of all the open concerns and issues in respect of the system's design was carried out with subject matter experts from many Departments.  There were multiple workshops, an examination of the issues and consideration of what needed to change in the design in order to address the concerns.</p> <p>  It is now clear that the programme originally underestimated the level of change in standardisation that was required to move from a cash accounting system to an accrual accounting one.  That was the fundamental issue.  There was also another matter-----</p></speech>

She stated that, when the NSSO tendered for this project in 2016, the risks were underestimated.  Is it that the NSSO underestimated them or that the private provider underestimated them in the tender?</p></speech>

When the original tender went to market, it detailed a large list of requirements that would be sought from the technology solution, but what was not completed at that stage was the design of how meeting those requirements would be implemented.  When the solution-implementing partner joined, there was some discussion around the design and a difference of views on same.  This was a fixed-price, fixed-time and fixed-goal contract.  It was difficult to lock down the design at that stage, but it was not a case of one versus the other.</p><p> There were also additional issues arising in relation to the design decision-making.  There was no single authority available to make the decision in relation to the design.  The governance structure was there.  It was advisory in nature and so it allowed things to fester rather than actually close out and get locked down.</p></speech>

How much of that contract has been delivered to date and what is the anticipated value of the contract on completion in what I presume will now be 2025?</p></speech>

With each wave that will be carried out, there will be a document that details exactly the responsibilities, activities, processes, timeline and tasks.  They are all documented in great detail and that determines the activities and, therefore, the cost of each wave and phase.  At the moment, we are focused solely on getting wave 1 live.  The common solution we will all use will go live and we expect the technical solution will be available at the end of this year.  That will allow us, for the first time, to start to on-board the clients that I have called out in the first wave.</p></speech>

I may not be clear.  As the solution that we will bring live at the end of this year is the common solution that will be used by all of us, a lot of the cost in relation to this programme is front-loaded because a lot of the technology and the solution is done upfront.  Most of the cost is actually borne to bring the common solution live.  What will remain there will only be customisations that are unique and required for specific Departments at that point in time.  To answer the Deputy's point, we are not expecting any surprise in relation to cost later on.  Most of the cost is then involved in cutting over Departments and bringing them onto our system.  There are smaller amounts of customisations that will be required for Departments in later waves.</p></speech>

The NSSO deals with the personal information of more than 180,000 individuals within the public and Civil Service.  That involves a lot of personal data such as PPS numbers.  Have there been any breaches of data protection in 2019 and during the pandemic?</p></speech>

Given the sensitive data that we hold in our systems and that we transact, data protection is absolutely paramount to the business of the NSSO.  Every staff member in the NSSO, me included, takes data protection very seriously.  We had some data breaches during 2019 and 2020 but I am pleased to inform the committee that the number of data breaches continues to reduce year on year.  The numbers of data breaches reported to the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, were 27 in 2019 and five in 2020.  These are data-----</p></speech>

Nothing has ever been released externally.  They are unintentional.  For the most part, a breach occurs where a record or file is sent to the wrong Department's human resources, HR.  It is internal and while we are all officials within the Civil Service, we still define that as a breach.  As I said, the trend continues to improve all the time.  We have a data protection team.  We have data protection compliance officers.  Training twice yearly is compulsory for every staff member in the NSSO.</p></speech>

Those who are in the office are there because we have processes that cannot be carried out at home.

We have actually seen a decrease during 2020.  As I said, we have had fewer data breaches in 2020 than we had in 2019.  From a data protection point of view, the system access that staff have in their own homes is as if they are in the office.  The network is protected regardless of whether they are working in the office or working at home and we use special IT equipment to ensure that happens.  We also have a data protection compliance officer and a data protection team that are constantly monitoring and checking.  In the event that we have a data breach, we have very strict procedures that it is reported immediately to whichever Department owns the data because the NSSO is the data processor.  It is not the data controller so any time there is a data breach we always inform and fully comply with all the requirements.</p></speech>

I apologise if I come back to some of her questions, although I might come at them from a different angle.  I want to first accept the ambition of this project across many different Departments, touching not just on technology but also on work practices.  I have no doubt it is a significant undertaking.  Equally, from the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, members of the public look to the committee to explain significant deviations from budget and timeline.  Ms Murphy-Fagan would accept that the cost increase from &euro;47 million to &euro;115 million and the extension in the timeline from 2020 to 2025 are significant deviations on both grounds.  I accept part of the explanation she has given but Deputy Hourigan asked if it was a failure by the NSSO to identify the complexity in tendering or a failure on the part of the supplier in its tendering process.  I will come back to that question because I believe it is the crux in terms of the difference.</p></speech>

It is important for the committee to understand that the scope of what is now going to be delivered is significantly different from what was originally envisaged.  It is important to understand also that things have changed substantially since the original business case and Government approval for this programme in 2016.</p><p>That relates to the move to a dual accounting system and the formal approval by Government to adopt international accounting standards and the central financial reporting reform, which it is now embracing and is required to roll out following the OECD and IMF review.</p><p> What was originally tendered for, in terms of the scope and level of ambition in 2016 compared with where we are now and what the integrated solution will provide, is significantly enhanced.  Therefore, the scope of what we are looking at is very different.  That is what has created the additional cost.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021021600002#E00500"><p>Absolutely.  The chart of accounts was pivotal to this.  I will try to describe it.  It is like starting to build a house with two bedrooms, wanting to extend it to include new rooms upstairs and downstairs and then discovering that the steel support system for the house is not in place.  We had to make sure that the foundations were really solid before we took things forward.  I took external advice on this.  A number of experts gave us their views because, clearly, the options we were considering involved value for money and what were the most economically advantageous for the public service.  We considered this, but the options were limited.  We could have continued on against the timeline and let the system go live, but all of the best advice I received since stated that would have been the wrong thing to do because we would have been trying to, in effect, fix an aeroplane in flight.</p></speech>

I accept Ms Murphy-Fagan's statement that she took external advice.  When that advice was given to her and the fixed price contract was agreed, surely the level of complexity had been explored and understood?  Across all of the organisations she spoke about, it was almost inevitable that the chart of accounts would become such a complicated web.</p></speech>

They do not operate on the same standard chart of accounts.  That was one aspect of complexity, but the other aspect we underestimated was the move to introduce accrual accounting.  We designed a chart of accounts, but it was not designed sufficiently to allow us to bring accrual accounting live.  That decision was taken by Government in 2019, so it followed the decision in 2016 when we started this programme.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where else the costs arose.  Additional requirements emerged.  For example, legislation relating to the GDPR was enacted in 2018.  While it was on the horizon, we did not fully understand the complexity of operating a master supply or database and making sure that supplier data from each Department and office was protected.  There was an awful lot more complexity than was originally envisaged which I do not believe anybody could have anticipated at that point in time.</p> <p>  On cybersecurity, I am sure the Deputy and the committee are aware that it is an area that is constantly changing and evolving.  We always have to respond to and be ahead of that.  We also had to invest significantly more in cyberspace than we would have originally understood and could have anticipated in 2015 and 2016 when the original Government decision was taken.</p></speech>

Were the demands for customisation and re-categorisation part of the issue?  Could the NSSO have been more rigid and, as a result, reduced the level of complexity involved?</p></speech>

We are sitting in the middle, looking at what is required for the future and not just today.  We are trying to find and build a single standard solution that everybody can use.  From an NSSO point of view, one of the weaknesses we identified was in our governance structures.  We had a design advisory group and asked for its advice, but we did not have the final decision-making authority in place.  That is now in place in the form of the senior user from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, where Government accounting sits.  In order to get that design fully locked down and signed up to the chart of accounts, there were very intensive workshops during which the head of Government accounting, the NSSO, the finance officers from the Departments and an external chair spent three days locked in to look at the design and finally agreeing to the full single design.</p></speech>

In the shared salary service provided by the NSSO, one of the Departments involved is the Department of Education.  This committee has heard that more than &euro;2 million was spent on posting payslips to 130,000 civil servants.  We have been given very vague timelines on when it will be possible to change that.  Can Ms Murphy-Fagan confirm that her organisation operates that system on behalf of the Department of Education?  If it does not, that is fine.  Is removal of the postage requirement on the horizon?</p></speech>

Taking on all of the teachers does not make sense.  There would be a consolidation of risk.  The Department of Education runs and manages the payroll for all of the teachers in the country.  My office manages all of the payroll, time and travelling expenses, overtime and allowances for the Civil Service, retired civil servants, the Defence Forces and the Garda.  We actually have scope around the various sectors.</p> <p>  The cost to the NSSO for postage during 2019 was &euro;32,000 and the cost to the Department of Justice was &euro;160,000.  That relates to the current Garda payroll.  The cost exists because it is sitting on a database that needs to be upgraded.  We have plans for upgrading it later this year.  That will allow it, for the first time, to have the facility to use online payslips.  It will eliminate the need for postage.</p></speech>

We already provide payroll services to pensioners within our office as it is.  To a large extent, it will be seamless to our pensioners and they will not see any difference.  We currently pay our 60,000 pensioners.  They have access to online payslips which they can access remotely from their homes or even if they are overseas.  We write to them once or twice a year if there are any changes in relation to their payroll.  The finance and accounting system is effectively the payment system to suppliers for goods and services to the Government and it also provides the Exchequer accounts and effectively the statement of the Exchequer.  Our system will provide that in the future.</p></speech>

We commissioned an external review of that.  When I was before the Committee of Public Accounts a number of years ago, I gave an estimate of the savings and at that stage, the committee asked me to have that externally validated.  That report was issued in the brief to the committee before today.  The breakdown of that is between HR and payroll shared services to date.  Both have delivered significant savings and value, as was forecast.  The benefits go beyond the cost savings to the taxpayer.  There are significant additional savings in the fact we now provide a single HR and payroll shared service.  We are on single standard policies.  The application of those policies is done in a single way.  The access to information and data analytics for Departments for decision-making is all now available.  We have a digital presence in all those Departments.</p></speech>

It is live and as our staff can access services remotely, they already can go online to carry out various requirements, such as booking annual leave or booking a travel pass, if they were travelling.  Of course, they are cancelling those at the moment.  If they want to take maternity leave or parental leave, all of that can be done online.  We implemented that for HR in 2016 and we completed it for payroll in 2017.  Thankfully, all of that is already in place.  We are just upgrading those systems but the users all have access to those services currently.</p></speech>

We are on a path of work that takes 13 months to complete and that will complete by the end of this year.

The NSSO came out of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As that Department is charged with ensuring value for money and efficiencies within the public service, a situation where a project within that Department has ballooned in cost from &euro;47.4 million to an estimated outrun of &euro;115 million gives cause for concern.  The NSSO was under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but, from my reading of it, was given its own Vote because of the spiralling costs involved.  The purpose was clearly to try to achieve cost savings for the taxpayer by pooling administrative costs.  One of the issues highlighted in vindicating the need for this was that the budget of &euro;47.4 million would be recouped in savings over all Departments within 9.1 years.  We now have a budget of &euro;115 million.  What is the estimated time for that figure to be recouped in savings?</p></speech>

My understanding is it is probably 11 or 12 years rather than the original estimate.  It is important to point out again that the benefits and savings from HR and payroll shared services are clear and evident and we expect the same when it comes to finance shared services.</p></speech>

Were they to be replicated on our system, we would have to ask the question of the value for money in that.  The solution will be different for that Department than all other Departments.  We will consolidate their accounts on our system but we have not worked out the technical solution to that at this point.</p></speech>

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine accounts for 75% of the customisations in existing platforms so one would think it has the greatest potential to yield savings through the NSSO.  How will that work in practice?  The estimated savings, if the NSSO is not rolling out the financial management services from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will again be impacted.</p></speech>

We have decided to consider what is the best way for that Department to get value and for us to deliver value.</p><p>If the Deputy were to ask me that question as we move along the waves and progress the transition, I may be able to give him a more specific answer on the technical solution but it will clearly be in scope.</p></speech>

Concerns were raised at various points of the initial stages by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of Government Procurement.  All of these concerns appear to have been either dismissed or ignored.  Does Ms Murphy-Fagan accept now, considering that we are looking at such inflated costs, from less than &euro;50 million to &euro;115 million, that it might have been prudent for some of these concerns to have been taken more seriously at the time?</p></speech>

I do not believe we are comparing apples with apples.</p></speech>

In terms of the number of overruns over the years, on which some of the questions have already been asked, I note the National Shared Services Office was established in 2014 after a Government decision in 2012, it officially commenced in 2018 and this project was given a green light in January 2016.  Colleagues have asked about the new target date nine years after the original indication that this financial management shared service would be established.  It is a considerable delay, Covid or no Covid.  I accept what Ms Murphy-Fagan has said in her responses thus far.  I note it is a mammoth task to amalgamate the 31 different systems.  How old and varied are those systems that the office is trying to amalgamate?  I note what Ms Murphy-Fagan said earlier in response to another question about the staff who are already working in the various Departments.  What are the old systems on which they are operating?</p></speech>

As I have called out and as is in the chapter, there are 31 different financial management systems.  They range in age and functionality.  Many of them are legacy systems.  The external independent view of these systems is that if they were all to be upgraded to continue in a stand-alone way without a single common chart of accounts, which is essential to deliver financial reporting reform and introduce accrual accounting, the cost to the Exchequer would probably be somewhere in the region of &euro;40 million to &euro;80 million.  There is quite a significant range of technology upgrade and this was never factored into the original business case but it is-----</p></speech>

That sum was not included.  However, things have moved on since then.  To the Deputy's point, the programme is being managed in a very robust way but given the complexity, it has to be taken in a stage by stage way.  When it was started, a feasibility study was carried out.  This indicated that there was a case for considering moving to shared services.</p></speech>

I am sorry but I have limited time.  Will Ms Murphy-Fagan give us an indication on the number of years?  She might come back to the committee with the years to which those older systems date back.  That would be important.  I want to pick up on something.  Ms Murphy-Fagan mentioned the external reviews.  I note there were several of them, in May 2018 and in February and May 2019.  Does Ms Murphy-Fagan have the costs for each of these?</p></speech>

Again, Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to us with the cost.  It seems that today is all about costs.  I accept the system is complex and that deadlines are moved but the sheer volume of costs we are speaking about is phenomenal.  Ms Murphy-Fagan might come back to the committee on this.</p> <p>  I want to turn to fraud.  Internal fraud of &euro;30,500 was detected in 2019.  It took place in 2018 and 2019.

I understand improved internal controls have been put in place in the NSSO and I note the Comptroller and Auditor General meets the NSSO's audit and risk committee once a year.  Perhaps the Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General might inform us as to whether the internal controls have improved from their perspective.</p></speech>

Earlier, she spoke with Deputy Carthy about the various systems and how they have evolved over time, and said that to compare the two really was not to compare apples with apples.  I do not have a background in accountancy or accrual accountancy.  Will Ms Murphy-Fagan explain to me the new system and its practical benefits and functionality?  How has it been enhanced over time?  What can users expect to get from it in a practical way?</p></speech>

From a simple point of view, our current system of accounting is cash accounting.  It records cash in and cash out.  It is a very simple way of recording transactions.  When we introduce the second system, which is the accrual accounting system, effectively it will record a cost as it arises and not necessarily record it when it is paid.  This is quite a different system from the one we currently operate.  While we have had some level of accrual accounting to date, we do not have it as a dual accounting system.  What it will mean for the Government primarily, and for the State, is that it will give us a bigger view of commitments that are falling due.  It is a little bit like the opposite of prepayments.  It will look at what payments will fall due but have not yet been paid, as well as giving the Government a better understanding of the assets and liabilities from a balance sheet point of view.  Does that help?</p></speech>

Is there anything Ms Murphy-Fagan wants to expand on?  She said comparing the systems as they evolved really does not compare apples with apples.  Is there anything on which she wants to elaborate or is she happy?</p></speech>

Accrual basis accounting requires a very different structure in the chart of accounts, which I explained earlier.  Effectively, this is the whole structure and foundation of how all finance data are mapped and recorded.  This was the fundamental difference.  We did not understand or anticipate the significant change to it that would be required.  We do now and this is the work that was carried out at the end of 2018 and 2019.  It is now being implemented.  I believe it has been fully addressed.  I believe that what we are implementing is an integrated financial management solution that will serve the State for generations to come.</p><p>We are moving from a very outdated legacy cash accounting system, that was introduced, I believe, sometime in 1866.  It is quite a simple way of accounting.  The new system will give us far better information and a better understanding of where we are at.</p></speech>

Will it be possible to track that from this system as well?  I recall an incident in 2011 in the Department of Health that blew my mind.  It related to trying to track people in the HSE.  What happened has always stuck with me.  Is this something that will provide a read on personnel as much as the financial obligations of the State?</p></speech>

That information is already available from the NSSO because of the services we currently provide.  We provide services to more than 38,000 civil servants and we have 145,000 payees.  We have that information already.</p></speech>

When this work is completed, how will the staff in her office transition?  What will be the new arrangements, will their roles change or how will it work over time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021021600002#H00700"><p>First, we will need more staff.  When finance shared services is fully up and running, we will have to recruit more staff to carry out that work on behalf of Departments.  Within the NSSO, we currently have three divisions.  We have employees' shared services, which is responsible for all HR and payroll services.  We have our corporate service division in the centre.  When finance shared services commences operations, it will be the third pillar.  What this means for the NSSO and the work it does is that, effectively, what we will have to do will be to integrate all of the systems behind the scenes.  As data flows from the HR system through the payroll system and into the finance system, we will have to connect all those systems together.  To date, those big clunky legacy systems have not been connected.  They have not needed to be connected but they will now all be automated and connected.</p> <p>  The second thing it will mean is that we will have, for the first time, a single payment source of information because all of the suppliers that are paid by Government will be on our systems going forward.  This is a significant automation and enhancement of procurement information.  At present, it requires a large manual effort to gather information such as, for example, that which the Deputy inquired about in the context of full-time equivalents.  One can imagine the significant benefits of having all of the suppliers on one system because we will make those payments on behalf of Departments and offices.</p></speech>

I am mightily impressed.  I am sure it will be one heck of a system.  I have a question, however.  In November of 2019, when addressing the D&aacute;il, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, quoted a figure of somewhere between &euro;47.4 million and &euro;62.5 million as a final estimate for the cost of the implementation.  How did we get to &euro;115 million in 14 months?</p></speech>

The &euro;115 million figure includes VAT.  Straight away, if one excludes VAT, one is talking about &euro;95 million - roughly there or thereabouts - for that estimate.  That is an important comparator.</p> <p>  Second, the original business case was clear in that it anticipated, if the programme was delayed, because these programmes are difficult to implement, what the cost would be and that was the range that the Minister gave, I believe, in his response to the House at the time.  That delay has now been realised.  We are clearly at the point where the costs for the programme, for example, this pay bill for the staff working on the project, will be greater because they have been working on the project longer.  There are some costs that are just overhead costs which, by virtue of the timeline involved, will increase.</p></speech>

That is clearly the message that we hear back from them.</p></speech>

That has never been seen clearer than in what we are experiencing as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>  At the time, the Minister stated that he expected the savings would be &euro;15.4 million per annum when this is up and running.

So as not to confuse matters in the context of payroll, the actual administration and payment of salaries will remain with the Department.  Administration and payment of salaries is done by the Department for all primary and secondary schools.  That is done in Athlone and that is where all salaries for teachers are administered.  The NSSO is not including that in its scope.  The accounting for that-----</p></speech>

Is it possible to get some information on the feasibility studies that were completed in respect of design issues and governance structures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Hilary Murphy-Fagan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021021600002#H03200"><p>The governance structures that we had in place were the right structures but the terms of reference were mainly advisory rather than decision-making in nature.  As a result, there was a lack of authority in the context of making decisions.  This allowed issues relating to design and standardisation to remain open rather than be closed off.  We did not recognise that issue early on but once it was identified, we quickly moved to address it.  As a result, we have appointed a senior user - the head of Government accounting - and that individual is the person tasked.  Although we now have a design that is locked down so that this matter does not arise anymore, if we were to have another consideration on an element of design that needed to be standardised across all Departments, the senior user, the finance officers and ourselves would come together and a single decision would be taken.</p><p>We would not allow it to continue to churn, which was part of the problem.  That is why the governance structures were quite important.</p></speech>

This project originated back in 2016.  Does Ms Murphy-Fagan see this as being the root cause of the issues of delay and the subsequent additional costs?</p></speech>

There is no one single element, but it was certainly a contributory factor.  Not having a design locked down agreed to was, without doubt, the most fundamental issue in the programme that contributed to the cost.  However, the decision on design was taken and agreed in July 2019.  That has allowed the programme to move forward.  That was the foundational change that has allowed the programme to move forward.  I have confidence in it now.</p></speech>

At what stage was a cost put together on that, with a view to trying to expedite the timeline and also to identify the scope change in the design?  It did not come before the Government until 2020.</p></speech>

Obviously, a new Government was formed and the pandemic began in 2020.  However, the primary work was carried out in 2019.  Towards the end of 2019 and early in 2020, we worked through a detailed assessment of what was required to take the programme live, the changes required in design and the enhancements and new requirements that had emerged from data protection, cyber and central government reporting that had not been there when we started out on the programme.  All of those were costed and formed part of the programme that we took back to the Government to advise it on what was required.  That was the decision taken by the Government in September 2020.</p></speech>

Second, have there been any disputes with the partner on the new design elements, and has mediation been required on any elements in respect of this?</p></speech>

We were mindful of the options, legal considerations and value for money under the public expending code.  They were all central to the decisions that were taken along the way.  On the relationship with the solution implementation partner now, I would say that it is a most constructive one.  There continues to be tension but, frankly, that is a healthy thing.  I would never want it to be any different.  The relationship is very constructive and we are working in what I would describe as a most collaborative and professional way going forward.</p></speech>

I do not have an issue with that.  I will focus on costs, the timeframe, value and learnings.  On the scope of the work, are there any additional Departments or entities included now over and above what was part of the original scope?</p></speech>

I really just want short answers.  As there are no additional Departments or entities, the issue is the nature of the work.</p> <p>  In respect of the fixed-price contract, obviously, the business case was made for it, and the fixed-price contract was to provide a degree of certainty, from a budgeting perspective, as to what had been done.  Was a consultancy firm used to identify the scope of the project, or was that done in house?</p></speech>

Lessons must be learned from that because there are other projects that are of a similar nature, for example, the payroll system in the Department of Education.</p><p>The implementation partner is Accenture.  An article was published last October in the Irish edition of <i>The Times</i>.  I will read a paragraph from the article.</p> <blockquote> 	This is a reference to Accenture, a management consultancy hired to implement the project.  A review of the project by EY, released last year under freedom of information legislation, found &quot;the relationship with Accenture was not on a good footing from the beginning&quot;.  This led to &quot;delays&quot; and &quot;cost overruns&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>What were the delays and cost overruns caused by the relationship?  Is Accenture still the implementation partner?</p></speech>

To explain, some of the difficulty in the relationship was caused by the fact that the original requirements were not refined enough for delivery.  That allowed for debate between what we understood we required and was to be delivered, and what Accenture are building as the solution.  It is not acting in a consultancy role; it is building the technology solution for us.  That is where the tension arose.  Because the contract was fixed-price, fixed-scope and fixed-time, there was a lot of scope for tension because everybody was trying to keep the project on track.  That is obviously where the difficulty arose but again-----</p></speech>

It is difficult for all of us, including the witnesses.  I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  In respect of learning some lessons from this, if it was going to be a genuinely fixed-time contract, the scope of it would have to be future-proofed and research would have to be done to identify the differences in the entities that Ms Murphy-Fagan has identified in her contributions.  Does she accept that right from the beginning, this project was not on a firm footing, despite the fact that the scope of it did change?</p></speech>

For example, all of the hardware infrastructure and licensing that we have procured still apply.  Those have not been wasted.  There has been no loss there at all.  It is important to point out that there has been no loss.  It is the medium to long-term requirements that have actually changed.  Where we started, and what we are now going to deliver, is significantly enhanced.  That is the difference that we are looking at now.</p></speech>

Our values are very important to us and our service and commitment to excellence is absolutely critical to who we are.  My staff in my office are absolutely key.

We can look at the State's previous experiences, and especially the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Take the examples of voting machines, which were a different system but it relates to IT, that ran to &euro;100 million and did not work - the machines were in storage and are now discarded - and the personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, in the HSE that ran to &euro;150 million which was similarly unsatisfactory and did not work.  Did the NSSO investigate or examine those systems and what went wrong or what lessons were learned from those before starting on this path?</p></speech>

We certainly reviewed it.  I suggest that had we not taken the actions we have taken, we may have had a different result and we may have had something different to tell the committee.  The programme is actually on a very solid footing and I am very confident that we will have a finance system that will deliver a common solution for all Government Departments; it will be available to us to start to migrate Departments onto at the end of this year.</p></speech>

In view of the experience in the two cases I mentioned, where  the e-voting machines cost in excess of &euro;100 million and in excess of &euro;150 million for PPARS, now the cost of this is accelerating, is the Department concerned?  Does it see these continuing runaway costs as just something that happens?  It seems extraordinary.  While I accept that prices can increase and things can change, and the CEO has outlined that some changes were made to the design of what was required, the costs on these projects seem to run away the whole time.</p></speech>

One of the important things is that when the project did get into some issues, as Ms Murphy-Fagan mentioned, there was a pause and so on; considerable work was done at that stage to identify the issues and prepare a revised memo for Government to be clear on what the issues were, how they were being addressed and the overall continued value for money of the project, as to whether it was still worthwhile proceeding or whether it should stop.  Given the benefits that were outlined - future savings, better efficiency, support or reform in terms of accounting and so on - the project is still very important and will offer significant value and benefits if it is brought through.</p> <p>  The Department has also been considering the wider issue of big projects such as this, and those that are bigger again, in particular.  We reformed the public spending code, particularly the capital side, to introduce more layers and gateways to assess costs and, more important, to assess risk to try to provide better understanding of the issues that will arise and to ensure that Government is fully informed when making those decisions.  While these things cannot guarantee that costs overruns will never happen again, we are constantly looking for ways to try to identify those issues upfront and to take steps to try to minimise and mitigate those risks.  </p></speech>

She has confirmed that there is an ongoing issue with data breaches.  There were 350 in the first two years of the operation of the NSSO.  She highlighted that there were some in 2019 and 2020.

We are trying to improve the overall quality of information and the quality of service, while freeing up staff in other Departments to do different work instead.  The position for redundancy does not arise in the case of the NSSO.</p></speech>

None of us doubts there is value in this.  Were the NSSO to give advice to the Department of Education which hopefully will be embarking on implementing a payroll system - and I know the this is more than a payroll system - what would Ms Murphy-Fagan advise it against doing?  How would the office caution the Department based on its experience?</p></speech>

One would chunk up the work differently, examine governance structures and ensure that the decision making authority in the governance structures is absolutely clear.  One would also ask if the right technical abilities were on the pitch.  Some of the skills that are required for a programme of this scale are really deep technical skills that are difficult to access in the marketplace across technology solution providers themselves, let alone retain them in the Civil Service.  We must be realistic about what this type of programme requires.  Without underestimating the complexity of payroll, which we provide to 145,000 people, it is somewhat less complex than trying to design and drive the major transformation that this programme will bring about.  Finance shared services will undoubtedly bring significant benefit to the State, but it is far more complex than the transformation that was required with payroll.</p></speech>

The properties are all with the OPW.  They are either leased or owned.  Most of the properties are leased and some are owned.  The NSSO is the lead tenant in some of the buildings but, for example, we share our building in Galway with the Department of Defence.  In the case of our offices in Killarney, we share the building with another Government Department, the office with responsibility for culture and the arts.  I have detail in front of me.  Our building in Clonskeagh, where most of our staff, 380,  are based, is leased.  The Trinity Point building is leased; the Mahon Street building is leased; the Tullamore building is leased; and the Galway building is owned by the OPW.  Our building in Killarney is owned by the OPW and the second building in Killarney is also owned.  Four buildings are leased and three buildings are owned.</p></speech>

We considered it ourselves in terms of the data coming in, the costs arising and the benefits.  One of the principles in our spending code is that any project should be subject to the question of where it is time to stop or to cancel.  We considered the cost benefits as part of the treatment of the memo.  We would have been aware of the issues that were arising.  As I said, it was important the NSSO went through the process of looking at the issues and identifying potential solutions that could be put in place, so again we could come back to Government and say this is where we are now, these are the proposals for going forward and the Government has an opportunity to consider it.  That is the position, as far as I can see it.</p></speech>

All are appearing remotely and are very welcome to the meeting.  We have already received their opening statements and they have been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions so the committee has agreed that those statements be taken as read, allowing the full session to be used for questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must outline an important note on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants at the committee meeting from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within the parliamentary precincts do not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which their participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  Before I invite questions from members, I wish to tell the representatives that they are most welcome here.  As a committee we are worried about the horticulture industry, its competitiveness and where it is going to source its raw materials going forward.  While we recognise climate change is a fact of life, we want to give the representatives the opportunity to make the case for their industries and to ensure we get a common-sense solution to the transition we face.  I was talking to the Minister before I came here and he will be present at our second session later.  I wish to hear the representatives' views about what they need from us as politicians so their industries can continue to survive and to prosper economically.  The importation of substitutes or alternative products from other countries to fill the shelves that the organisations present currently supply makes absolutely no sense.  I was quoted lately as calling it ludicrous and I do not object to that statement being quoted.</p> <p>  I now invite questions from the members.  I leave it to the witnesses to see who is best qualified to answer each particular question.  If witnesses want to answer they should put up their hand to indicate.  Deputy Carthy is first on my list.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's sentiments about the potentially extremely dangerous situation we are in.  I have a number of questions for our guests.  First, will they outline the immediate difficulties accessing horticultural peat?  The challenges they are facing in the here and now due to the shortages we have been hearing about are being faced by a number of sectors.  This includes issues as benign, almost, as bedding for animals as well as the particular issues that pertain to the horticultural sector.  On 7 September, the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, announced he was establishing a working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural sector.  Many would have seen that as a good opportunity to play out all the issues which the representatives will no doubt raise.  Crucially, however, he stated the terms of reference of the working group would have a predetermined outcome, namely, the graduated elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry over an agreed period of years.  It is extremely concerning that this is a working group with a predetermined outcome that could have devastating implications.</p> <p>  The sector I am most familiar with is mushroom growing.  It forms the bedrock of the local economy in my home county of Monaghan and is crucially important in many other rural areas where there is little other economic activity.  There are currently approximately 1.35 million ha of peatlands in this State.  Could our guests give an indication of what proportion of that is required for horticultural use?</p> <p>  We hear quite a bit about the potential use of alternatives.  Our guests represent a number of sectors.  I will limit this question to the representatives of the mushroom sector in the first instance in case members have questions about other areas.  What alternatives are in place for the mushroom sector and are any of them viable?</p> <p>  My final question is on the outworking of this.  I agree with the Chairman that climate action is incredibly important and we need to take it seriously.  However, climate action should not be confused with hypocrisy.  If we have a situation whereby the elimination of horticultural peat use in Ireland simply leads to either an exporting of the mushroom industry, for example, or the importation of horticultural peat from other parts of the world, then that is not climate action but hypocrisy.  If there is an elimination of horticultural peat, what happens to the mushroom growing sector?</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence in allowing me in early.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Carthy's question, the horticulture use for edible horticulture in Ireland is probably 1% of what was harvested in 2019.  Mushrooms make up the vast majority of the edible horticulture side.  We use deep-dug peat, which is a unique product.  I do not believe any alternatives are readily available.  Research has been carried out as far apart as Australia and South Africa to identify alternatives but to no avail.  In fact, in South Africa an alternative was proposed from sugar beet or sugar bagasse.  When it was introduced to the industry there it was a failure.  At the moment, further research is taking place at Wageningen University in the Netherlands but that will provide a long-term situation and will not resolve the immediate problem for the mushroom industry.</p><p> Members will probably be aware that the mushroom industry is one of our most successful horticultural businesses.  At the moment we supply approximately 33% of the total mushroom market in the UK.  Irish-owned companies producing in the UK supply another 25% to 30%.  In total Irish-controlled mushroom producers supply approximately 60% of the market share in UK supermarket chains.  That is a unique situation for any Irish food producer.  We do not have an alternative.  We are very small in terms of land use.  We are a very low-volume industry because only a 5 cm layer of casing is put on a mushroom bed with 20 cm of compost underneath, but it is the vital part for the mushrooms to fruit.  </p></speech>

I declare somewhat of an interest.  I have worked professionally in the horticultural industry for 40 years.  I did some work in Teagasc many moons ago on mushroom production in Kinsealy.  I have visited many of the mushroom plants in the country over the past two years.  Clearly there is this issue of an alternative.  I agree with Deputy Carthy that the time for hypocrisy is over.  We have a successful and valuable mushroom production industry.  It is hard to believe we can pick mushrooms in Ireland on a Wednesday and have them on supermarket shelves in London on Friday and Saturday.  It is an amazing success story.</p> <p>  The reality is there is no alternative.  I would like to hear about the industry's engagement with Teagasc.  I hope the committee will discuss this later.  We should ask the Minister to request further research from Teagasc.  All the alternatives proposed do not produce the same yields.  I say this for the laypeople outside this committee who may be listening in.  Mushrooms are not vegetables or fruits; they are fungi.  They require heat, moisture and a particular level of light.  There are many conditions for growing mushrooms.  It is important that we protect the horticultural industry.  The programme for Government proposes enhancing the industry.  </p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to share with us the engagements they have had with Teagasc.  I ask them to outline the impacts on soft fruit production, forestry and nursery stock.  I am fully supportive of peat.  We need to take our environment seriously.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on a just transition.  I am talking about something that will take a few years.  Where are the witnesses currently sourcing their peat?  We are hearing that peat is coming in from Poland and Latvia.  Polish and Dutch growers will take up our market share if we lose it.  We need to fight hard for the horticultural industry.</p> <p>  We need to look for alternative growing media.  We know that vermiculite, peat and compost are used for the casings for mushrooms.  I am in solidarity with the growers.  I understand this business and the difficulties it is encountering.  I ask the witnesses to outline their relationship with Teagasc research and the investment they are putting into that.</p></speech>

The horticultural industry only used 1.7% of the total peat harvested by Bord na M&oacute;na.  I worked as a nursery stock specialist in Teagasc for 40 years and have considerable knowledge of the industry.  I will give some up-to-date information on Teagasc's views on what is happening.  The nursery stock currently uses 0.5% of the peat that is harvested, which is relatively a very small amount.<br/><br/>I will give a brief outline of what has happened in the nursery industry.  I started working in the industry in the early 1970s.  Prior to that, in the previous decade, all nursery hardy plants were grown in the open ground.  Selling was confined to the dormant season from the end of November up to early March.  Growing plants in containers totally revolutionised the growing of hardy plants.  It was mainly due to the importance of stagnant peat as a bulk constituent of growing medium.  As a result of decades of research by both private and public parties, of variety of peat growing media has been developed for different horticultural enterprises.<br/><br/>The Senator asked about the alternatives.  Let us consider the value of peat.  Peat has physical properties.  Without getting too technical, it has air space and water hole retention properties.  It has chemical properties with a low pH and low nutrient status, ideal for mixing various composts, and has biological properties.  It is free from pests and disease, and from weeds and weed seeds.  The growth of the nursery industry is directly related to the availability of Irish peat.  I do not like quoting too many figures, but I will just give one figure.  In the midlands within a radius of 25 miles of Tullamore, there are 25 nurseries employing approximately 250 workers generating a total output in excess of &euro;15 million.  It is very important in the midlands.<br/><br/>The Senator asked about Teagasc.  As I said, I worked in Teagasc as a nursery stock specialist.  I quote from Teagasc's submission to the recent review of peat in horticulture and the key industry issues, which stated:</p> <blockquote> 	There are currently no other abundant materials that have suitable properties at an affordable cost.  Selecting any other material currently requires a grower to compromise in terms of crop risk where aspects of crop husbandry, yield and quality are potentially impacted and currently under-researched. </blockquote> <p>The Senator asked about the alternatives.  The alternative is basically coir coming from 10,000 km away in Sri Lanka and India.  It is suitable for some products at a reduced input, but it is certainly not suitable for all crops.  It has significant transport implications and is certainly increasing in cost considerably.  We have very little pine bark available in Ireland.  Wood fibre, which is coming into the equation at the moment, is sustainable.  It is now competing with biofuels and it is certainly increasing in cost.  Green waste is something that has been researched.  The Senator may know a colleague of mine in Kinsealy, Michael Maher, who did considerable work on green waste.  It presents many challenges due to its low air status, its low stability and the possibility of impurities.  While green waste is being researched, it is certainly not an answer for inclusion in compost.  <br/><br/>Over the decades, growers have developed significant technical understanding of peat performance and its response in Irish growing conditions.  It would take many years to develop the competence and understanding of managing growing media with new physical and chemical properties.</p><p>Currently, we are seeing the addition of up to 30% alternatives, such as wood fibre in peat, but it is a long-term research programme to find a suitable compost mix.</p><p> In conclusion, it is by and large a rural-based industry and my colleague Mr. Kieran Dunne will give the committee the cost implications of the impact of shutting down such a rural-based industry.  People give great consideration to biosecurity.  We will be importing significant quantities of plants because if we are not producing here we certainly will have to import from elsewhere.  There could be significant biosecurity issues for the environment etc.  There is also, of course, the additional carbon footprint of transporting peat, mainly from the Baltic states, and possibly from Russia in the future.  Internationally, irrespective of the mode of transport, there is no benefit to the world in doing this.</p><p> My final comment on the nurseries industry is that many of those involved have told me that they have come through storms, a downturn and the onset of Covid-19.  They are still productive but many of them are asking how much more can they can take and it is certain that none of this is of their making.</p></speech>

I commend the Chairman, who has led from the front on this issue and I hope that our witnesses will find a great deal of support as a sector from this committee.  We are steadfast in our determination to find a pathway and future for this sector.  In many respects the sector has been wrongly vilified.  The public at large misunderstands what the sector does and confuses it with Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is important that the sector makes and gets heard its point that it is just looking at 1.5% of the peatlands in the country.  Everybody who has done research on this sector realise that it is a successful, sensitive and progressive sector.  In the midlands, specifically, we are conscious that more than 6,000 people are directly employed across this sector and a further 11,000 indirectly.  This is a sector of great importance for every community in the midlands and many of these businesses are family enterprises.  We have already seen the heart of the region wrenched out with the demise of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  I was struck by a comment from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a headline that leaked out from <i>agriland.ie</i>, in which she stated that it is absolute nonsense to have a reliance on imported peat.  Her follow-on argument is that we have to look at alternatives.  Our colleague, Deputy Carthy, alluded to that.  This sector has worked with Teagasc over a number of decades at this stage and we must be realistic and put on record that the viability of an alternative use to peat coming on stream soon is highly unlikely.</p><p>We are very proud of this sector, which supplies 30% of the mushrooms into the UK market and has evolved over time.  In research terms, this is one of the most progressive sectors, where one can look at Kerry Group and what Teagasc has achieved.  There is no immediate and viable alternative to peat available at the moment and the sector is certainly not getting a just transition.  It is unfortunate and very difficult for all of these businesses to be thrust into the public eye and to have to come here, almost cap in hand, to plead for their future.  I am particularly conscious of Growing Media Ireland, which represents many of the businesses I am familiar with in counties Longford and Westmeath.  </p><p>It is unfortunate that we did not get to read the opening statements but specifically with regard to producers, can the witnesses give the committee their three asks as to what they want us as a committee and as Government parties to do, as a follow-on from today, to help safeguard and give the sector the viable future it deserves?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Neenan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#C00500"><p>I will take that question.  I will start by answering Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s earlier question which asked what was the size of our industry.  The area of land for horticultural peat production in Ireland is 1,700 ha, which is 0.12% of total Irish peatlands under production.  This is a very tiny area.  The carbon emissions from the area that produces horticultural peat is now less than 0.15% of total Irish emissions.  We are talking about a very tiny area of peatlands and the emissions are very small and are in fact less than that because we have not yet finalised the research on how much carbon is taken up by the plants that are growing.</p> <p>  Returning to Deputy Flaherty&rsquo;s question, the ask is that we want the legislation to be amended urgently in order that we can get back harvesting in 2021 and have sufficient peat to meet Irish demands. Currently, there probably is sufficient peat to meet Irish demands until September of this year.  After that it will be completely comprised of imports.  We offered a solution to the previous and present Governments that was prepared by our solicitors and legal advisers, McCann FitzGerald, who are saying that the solution is not complicated.  It complies with European and Irish law and this solution says that we can under Irish law remove peat again from the planning process and beef up the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which would allow us to go back to harvesting.  That can be done by way of secondary legislation and statutory instruments.  It was not the case that the previous legislation that came in in January 2019 was of the wrong type but it did not give sufficient powers to the EPA.  Our solution, which we have given to the Government and copies of which are available for anybody to read, would overcome this and we could be back harvesting this year.  This would overcome the problems that we have in the rural parts of Ireland, which are suffering greatly.  There are jobs there already which we need to keep, rather than trying to create new jobs.</p> <p>  The second thing we are looking for is a just transition.  We do not want to be thrown off the cliff at this stage and that is what has happened.  A just transition is what has been referred to on this issue on all occasions.</p> <p>  We are not just producing peat and nothing else.  Three of our members in Growing Media Ireland have five wood fibre plants between them producing wood fibre for both the professional and hobby market.  This does not just concern peat as we are spending millions of euro in research and development on a continuous basis.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their submissions, which are all quite self-explanatory.  In view of the fact that we are meeting the Department immediately after this meeting, I have one brief question which I would ask as many of the representatives as possible to elaborate upon.  This is a follow-up on Deputy Flaherty&rsquo;s question, namely, what would our witnesses like us to bring to the Department?  What are their proposals here with a view to tackling climate change and maintaining productivity?  We have all seen the hardship that the mushroom industry went through when Brexit was first mooted.  The mushroom industry was the first casualty.  It overcame and rode out that storm and is one of the most productive of the food industries which exports into the UK.</p> <p>  In order to keep these markets going, can I have some brief answers on whether peat is being imported at the moment?  We are hearing about peat coming into the country or is it the case that peat may have to come into the country?  For the purposes of this discussion, if that were to happen or if it is happening, are there any quality issues in this regard?  We are all aware of the ludicrousness of the situation but can such imports do the same job?  Are we cutting off our nose to spite our face here?</p><p>With a view to the committee's upcoming engagement with the Department, I would like more feedback from the witnesses on what committee members can hit the Department with on their behalf and the alternatives they propose.  Bearing climate change in mind, all present know the solution to this problem is the straightforward, simple, common-sense approach of carrying on as we are.  The carbon footprint of imports alone is ludicrous.  I would like to hear a little more from the witnesses with a view to the committee meeting the Department in the next session.</p></speech>

We work very closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and Bord Bia on exports, growing local plants and creating import substitution.  I have worked with them for the past 20 years.  The quality of Irish peat is totally different from that which we could buy from the Baltic states, Scotland or any other country.  It is within the remit of all of us, including every Department, to look after the industry, including big growers and smaller growers.  The growers in the south and west of the country will be significantly disadvantaged as they may have to pay more than double the current price for compost.  The smaller growers that use a small amount of compost will not have their orders recognised by the larger companies, so it will be impossible for them to even purchase peat.  If they do manage to purchase it, they may have to pay four times the price.  There are significant difficulties within the industry.  As Mr. Gleeson stated, it is not a problem of our making.</p> <p>  The other major difficulty is that if the major players go out of the market, we will not have quality mixing plants for the horticulture professional industry.  That goes back to what happened with sugar factories.  If it is gone, we will have a major problem.  We will not be able to claw it back.  They are major issues for our industry.  The big guys will survive but the smaller guys in rural communities will have serious difficulty surviving.  We used 0.5% of the overall peat harvest in 2019.  It is a minuscule amount.  To service the amenity sector within Ireland will only require between 100 ha and 110 ha of peat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Brophy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#D00300"><p>The point was made that it is absolute nonsense to have to depend on imported peat.  It would be even more nonsensical for the vegetable industry to close and Ireland to become dependent on other countries for our food.  Food security is embedded into the programme for Government.  Through the national development plan for horticulture, public funds have been invested in our businesses under grant schemes.  If those businesses subsequently close because of this ludicrous legislation, that money will have been wasted.  It is in all horticulture that the money has been invested.</p> <p>  On the issue of food, green waste is not suitable for propagating vegetable transplants or any other food product because there are heavy metals picked up in it which would be introduced into the food chain with very harmful effects.  In our business growing vegetable transplants, we use a very specialist product.  Every large-scale grower has developed a recipe that is product specific and site specific in terms of pH balance and nutrition. Switching suppliers is not a simple fix.  It has taken us approximately four years to hone our on-site recipe for our business.</p></speech>

I concur with the previous speakers in commending the Chairman, who has been extremely vocal on this issue in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere.  I have read the reports prepared by the witnesses.  I am shocked by the seemingly decimating impacts of the changes relating to peat extraction on the Irish horticulture industry.  It is evident that many jobs will be lost and small and medium growers in horticulture will be made uncompetitive.  All present agree with the aim of moving from burning large amounts of peat for electricity generation, but it seems that no thought was given to a transition period for Irish tree, shrub, flower or other plant growers.</p> <p>  Nurseries in the south, including west Cork, the west and the north of Ireland and small, sustainable green enterprises seem to be the most vulnerable.  I have been told by many growers that before research is carried out or any other solutions get investigated, the immediate loss of peat without a transition period will put them out of business in less than two years.  These are small, family-run operations that were supported by Irish peat.  I am disturbed and worried by what seems to be nothing short of a fiasco.  We need legislation to define peat extraction for horticulture.</p> <p>  It seems to me that the green solution in this country is to withdraw products from shelves.  That has been happening quite a lot for the past seven or eight months.  It is not a solution.  One has to have something ready at hand so as to avoid putting people into a crisis such as this.</p> <p>  My questions are more for Mr. Gleeson and the Kildare Growers Group.  Obviously, if the other witnesses wish to reply, they are welcome to do so.  Why can plants not be grown in containers using soil or a mix of products including green waste instead of peat?  Can the Kildare Growers Group or the Irish nursery industry survive or be in any way competitive if they have to import peat from Baltic states or elsewhere?  What is the realistic timeframe for the industry to transition to low-peat or peat-free production from a commercial production point of view?  Reports produced by Teagasc indicate it will take a minimum of five to ten years to so do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Gleeson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#D00500"><p>I probably alluded to some of those questions earlier.  On the issue of soil, soil is not suitable for growing plants in containers.  The main reasons for that are that soil compacts in a container and there is no air space.  In addition, it is not uniform.  Soil can vary, as the Deputy probably knows, in terms of nutrient and pH levels.  One of the major reasons is that soil is extremely heavy in a container and, as such, one would have significant transporting costs.  Research carried out by Teagasc indicates that none of the other materials to which I alluded, such as pine bark, wood fibre and green waste, are successful as an entire product as a growing medium.  None of them would work as a growing medium.</p> <p>  I would like to see a course being pursued that is similar to what is happening in the UK.  The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, has given a lead-in period of nine to ten years, up to 2030, for research to be carried out on various additives.  All present realise the importance of climate and the environment.  In the meantime, research needs to be carried out before a move is made automatically.  It is not possible to move straight away and bring peat from the Baltic states and elsewhere, as the Deputy stated.  As Mr. Dunne stated, the first peat has arrived from Scotland at substantially higher cost than our local product.  We need a lead-in period.  That is very important, as are the legislation issues that were highlighted.  We certainly need up to ten years as a lead-in period before we can grow plants successfully in containers.  It is a significant issue for professional horticulture.  Growing for amenity is different because one can have contaminants in some products but they are spread or ameliorated into the soil and the soil is more capable of coping with that.  However, when one puts a contaminant or anything that is way off the norm into a container, the product or plant will certainly suffer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1500" speakername="Michael Ring" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#D00600"><p>As a person from the west, I saw the effect of closing down bogs in north Mayo and the devastation it left in villages and towns.  In this country we have some products that the rest of the world does not have but in this case some people wish to take that product away.  Legislation needs to be brought on this issue, particularly for home growers.</p><p>As was stated, there are many people employed in this industry.  It is a difficult industry in which to survive.  There have been various problems over the years with disease and other issues.</p><p> The point was made in the context of carbon and climate change that it is fine for people to be advocating for climate change.  This is a small country.  Many of those present live in rural Ireland.  It is not like there are many people or jobs in rural Ireland.  It is all right for people living in cities in Ireland or elsewhere in Europe to be making decisions that will affect isolated areas such as the west of Ireland and the midlands which do not have the kind of jobs that everywhere else has.  Small communities are dying all over the country and they need these kinds of jobs and the kind of industries we have.  If those industries could be in Dublin, they would not be in rural Ireland.  That is why we need to support this industry.</p><p> People often have very short memories.  With regard to food safety, it is not many years ago that imports of meal caused disease in this country.  That is what I am worried about in the context of importing these kinds of goods into the country.  We do not know from where they are coming.  There is no safety aspect to it.  They do not have the same compliance that we have here in Ireland.</p><p> Most of the peat is controlled by the State anyway.  Some 90% of bogs are owned by the State.  There should be no reason that we are not able to take enough out to support this industry and the jobs it provides.  Anything excess could be exported or sold.  If one looks at what America, China and all those countries are doing to the world, it is clear that, as a small country, we overrate ourselves with regard to climate change.  That is part of our problem.</p></speech>

I will just make a few more points in reply to Deputy Michael Collins.  As was stated, we are very proud of our industry.  We work very closely together.  What we bring to rural communities are real jobs in rural areas.  We bring commitment and honest leadership and we supply our towns and counties.  We are very proud of that.  What we are looking for is fair play.  We have more than 40 years' experience as an amenity nursery stock sector.  We now have the second generation and we do not wish for the committee to forget that.  If we have young people, whether trainees through Teagasc or the colleges or those who have come to the industry through their families, driving our industry forward, we have a very good export trade within the meaning of the sector.  I and others in the industry are appalled at the lack of progress with regard to the review committee that was to be set up in November.  What is happening is passing the buck and kicking the can down the road.  There has been a lack of action on the most serious situation in the 40 years of our industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#E00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  They will not hear many members of the committee telling them that they are wrong.  That would not solve anything.  There is a simple solution.  We have a problem.  Sites that are less than 30 ha do not need planning while those that are more than 30 ha do need planning.  The witnesses referred to solicitors.  What proposal are they putting forward?  As the previous speaker stated, the working group will not reach a conclusion until the end of May.  If there is good weather from 17 March or the first week of April onwards, as was the case last year, those in the industry will be milling peat.  The time to do so is when the weather is good, not when it is raining.  The working group will not make a decision until the end of May, which is a disaster.</p> <p>  Several speakers have spoken about Ireland doing this or doing that.  A green agenda is being driven at the moment and unless Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies stand up to it, as well as Independents and Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, the witnesses will be attending committee meetings and speaking about this issue for the rest of their lives.  Nothing will be solved.  A High Court case is pending.  Tree huggers have brought Bord na M&oacute;na to court in respect of the 30 ha issue in the context of peat.  Under the habitats directive, one needs an environmental impact assessment, EIA, an appropriate assessment and all the ding-dongs that go with that which have been signed in by our now President.  What are the witnesses proposing to resolve this issue?  The rule under European legislation in respect of sites in excess of 30 ha is catching every producer in the industry.  That is the bottom line.  Whether the committee lifts the witnesses in the air or tells them they are the greatest thing since the sliced pan, there is European legislation that has been adopted by Ireland and that is the problem.  What are the witnesses saying needs to be done to be compliant with the habitats directive?  By Jesus, I know more about the habitats directive than anyone else in this place.  That issue has to be resolved.  I am being straight and blunt.</p> <p>  In fairness to the previous Minister, legislation was brought in to cater for the industry.  However, it was rattled out of court.  An environmental lobby group brought it to court and took it on and kicked it out.  There was not even a fight put up.  That court ruling stands.  What legislation or what way are the witnesses saying their solicitors propose to resolve the EIAs, appropriate assessments, screening out and all of that to get them out of the hole in which they are in with regard to sites in excess of 30 ha?  If we get this wrong, there will be another court case.</p> <p>  What level of increase would there be in the price of plants, vegetables or whatever as a result of having to import peat?  All present know that importing it would be madness.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is willing to try to bring in legislation but we have a Minister heading that Department - I am saying this straight out; many people know it but not many will say it - who says he will block it.  How do we get over that hurdle?  I believe we need the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to get involved on this issue because, as the witnesses stated, it is 1.5% of the country.  Let us put together a plan.  If there is an alternative further down the road that is able to be competitive, keep jobs in Ireland and grow plants, as well being suitable in terms of the technical stuff to which the witnesses referred, then that is fine and we will go down that road.  However, one cannot just turn off the light switch and go around the room in the dark.  That is what we are doing at the moment.  Bord na M&oacute;na is out of the game.  I have spoken to its representatives on several occasions.  Tom Donnellan does not even want to know about turf or peat at the moment.</p> <p>  The other side of it is that I was before this committee in 2010, not as a member but as a witness, to give evidence regarding turf cutting.  We had to take on the State and go out and cut our turf to get justice for ourselves.  It is a sad thing that ordinary people had to do that.  What legal avenue do the witnesses know of that can be followed?  What way can the legislation be written such that it will comply with Articles 6(1) to 6(4), inclusive, of the habitats directive?</p></speech>

That is the background.  If and when one gets that, one then has to apply for substitute consent.  If one gets that, one must apply for planning permission.  Our view is that that process will take four to five years.  That is why we are saying the industry will be closed by then.  Our legal advisers have stated that under European and Irish law, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage can exempt peat from the planning process.  That would allow us to go to the EPA for a licence.  The Acts governing the EPA will have to be beefed up to take in the points raised in the court judgment.  It will have to prohibit the EPA from granting a licence unless there are exceptional circumstances.  It will require the EPA to consider whether to direct temporary cessation of activity pending a decision on the application for a licence.  The EPA will have to consider the historical and future effects of the activity before granting a licence and require the holder of an existing integrated pollution control, IPC, licence which was granted before the EPA to have the power to complete an EIA.</p><p>That was in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na, however, and is not relevant now.</p><p> Those proposals, if implemented, would remove uncertainty and the risk of industrial closure while safeguarding all the jobs.  We would be responsibly harvesting peat under the control of the EPA.  We have given that on a number of occasions.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Neenan including an EIA to comply with the habitats directive or is he including the screening out of locations where it is 15 km away from a designated site?  How confident is he?  As a turf cutter, I do not have confidence in the EPA because when I see some of the stuff it comes out with, I would be afraid of my life to give it to it.</p></speech>

We feel that the law has to be complied with but as it stands, it is impossible.  We feel that this is the only legal avenue open to get harvesting in 2021 and have sufficient supplies for all the industries we are talking about.  As the Deputy said, it will be very difficult to do it.  Otherwise, we face the closure of imports from September, if the Irish horticultural industry and the mushroom industry are to survive.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the increase in the cost of material.  In the case of coir for example, transport costs have increased by 300%, while the cost for the material to be delivered is more than 50% higher than it was this time last year, if it can be got.  One of the problems with alternatives is the reliability of supply.  In Sri Lanka and India last autumn, factories were closed over Covid and then they had the longest monsoon season in years, so harvesting was not able to take place.  There is a massive shortage of coir at the moment and it will probably be the end of March or April before it can be got.</p></speech>

What consultation have the witnesses had with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the peat industry through Bord na M&oacute;na?  I know how important peat is for soft fruit, vegetables, mushrooms and so on.  I do not agree about the alternatives but have the witnesses examined how much the increase in price will cost people within the industry such as them?  One witness stated that the smaller guy will definitely be gone and there is no doubt about that because he will be unable to afford the price increase.</p> <p>  A number of members asked what are the two most important questions that we should ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department.  We all know what our guests want, but what are the two most important questions that they want us to ask?</p></speech>

I wish to record my disappointment that they did not have a chance to read their statements into the record.  I read them thoroughly and wish that other members did too.  They contain some very important information and we have done a disservice to the witnesses by not allowing them to read their statements into the record.  I will take up the issue with the Chairman later.</p> <p>  I want to correct the record in regard to the reason these circumstances have arisen.  I sympathise with everybody who finds themselves in this difficult situation.  It is a crisis.  A legal case in 2019 ultimately led to Bord na M&oacute;na ceasing its harvesting of peat for horticultural use and that is why we are where we are.  It is up to the Government now to resolve the situation, although it is difficult and complex.  Deputy Ring often makes the point that climate change is for others to solve.  It is not for others to solve; it is for Ireland to lead, and we are leading and doing very well at leading on climate change.  We also have to lead on this issue and to resolve this situation, which is really important to Ireland, to rural Ireland and to those involved in horticulture.  I think we can do both.</p> <p>  It was suggested that this is some kind of agenda by the Green Party to stop the harvesting of peat but that is not the case.  We are fully supportive of the industry and we will work with our guests and with all stakeholders.  The heritage unit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, led by my colleague Deputy Noonan, is setting up a working group to resolve this issue in short order.</p></speech>

We have always had a fantastic relationship with the Department and we work closely on all aspects, including this issue.  In addition to working with the Department, we have worked with Teagasc, as I said earlier.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is aware of our issues, as is the Taoiseach.  We have gone to the very top.</p> <p>  The price of professional horticultural compost will double, from between &euro;37 and &euro;40 per metre to between &euro;70 and &euro;80, and that is in the greater Dublin and Leinster area.  In Cork, that could be &euro;120 per metre, while in Deputy Ring's constituency, it could certainly exceed &euro;100 per metre.  We have a superb relationship with all the Departments.  This is an anomaly, not of our making, that needs to get sorted.</p> <p>  On the issue of the working committee, I reiterate that it has been extremely slow and people have been hiding and waiting for the review committee to produce its results and findings.  To us, that is not acceptable or good enough and it needs to get sorted.</p></speech>

The horticultural sector has been a major contributor to the economy, to the value of &euro;437 million, which is not to be sneezed at.  We need to do all we can, as a committee and as Deputies, to help the sector.  The terminal decline through increased costs that will be involved - the last speaker said the price could double - will drive out the smaller people and it will favour only competitors from other countries to the detriment of our own.</p> <p>  In the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry, was adequate attention given to the impact that ending the use of peat moss would have on the industry?  Have the witnesses been contacted by the new working group?  It has not even elected a chairperson, which is crazy when people are working to such tight deadlines.  Before this meeting, we were told that the alternatives to peat moss can form only part of the overall volume of growing media.  How long would it take to develop a suitable alternative that is independent of peat moss, or will we be importing moss peat for the foreseeable future?</p><p>Are we back to the usual scenario of engagement after a decision has been made or, as I said before, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted?</p></speech>

The industry has been through crisis after crisis over the last few years, whether that of sterling back in the day or Brexit, and this is another major crisis for the industry.  I refer to the biosecurity element, which is a huge issue.  Matters such as ash dieback have been dealt with at this committee previously and we all know where that originated.  What are the biosecurity concerns as regards bringing product from other countries into the Irish dynamic?  Going forward, it will be harsh on rural Ireland if we have an industry that cannot survive for the lack of raw product.  What are the timelines?  Are we looking at unsustainability issues coming our way in the next few months?  How long before this industry becomes squeezed out because of the lack of affordable product?</p></speech>

On imports of peat, food and nursery stock, none of those would have an environmental benefit for Ireland.  If we do not have availability of Irish peat, our greenhouse gases and CO2 emissions will rise so we will be in a worse position.  Many people have asked about alternatives and previous speakers have explained the problems with those.  They are used as much as possible but they are not viable for all industries.  One thing to remember is that the alternatives have their own greenhouse gases and their own CO2 cost.  They are not magicked out of the air.  It is important to remember that, even after all the science and research that we need is done, a certain amount of peat use may be the best environmental answer and may be the most environmentally friendly use of a material we have available to us.</p> <p>  Regarding when this must be done, this is a very urgent position.  Mr. Dunne noted that there are already imports of peat coming into Ireland.  It is affecting viability and sustainability now so this needs to be dealt with urgently.  Mr. Neenan has outlined the legal options so we need to get working on those quickly.  Deputy Fitzmaurice made the point that this has been foisted on us by the EU.  Practically every other EU state that has viable bogs, such as Britain, Northern Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, which all are or were in the EU, has appropriate licensing and extraction in a sustainable manner.  They have proper licensing and proper rehabilitation of peatlands.  The EU is not the problem.  Our own legislation is the problem.</p></speech>

The meeting has been very interesting and engaging listening.  I thank the Chairman for tabling this topic because it is hugely important to people.  Some 6,600 jobs rely directly on this sector and 11,000 rely on it indirectly.  I have some knowledge of mushrooms because my family were in mushroom farming many years ago.  I was in college at the time and how much money I got going back to college on a Sunday night depended on the price of sterling at the time.  I am very conscious of that.  Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Dunne brought the crisis horticultural growers were facing to my attention a few months before Christmas.  I have spoken about it in the Seanad, and spoken to a number of Ministers and to Deputy Cahill in his position as Chairman of this committee.</p> <p>  There are a number of anomalies here.  Growers can bring peat in from Lithuania, Holland and Poland and the carbon footprint is increased hugely.  There is huge hypocrisy here, apart from the cost, which Mr. Dunne noted is at least double the usual cost and could go up to quadruple that.  Specific equipment is also needed for mixing.  There was talk of food security but biosecurity, which Senator Lombard just mentioned, is also important.  Regarding what is needed going forward, surely there can be a derogation in terms of horticultural peat.  This is a green industry.  It is not like we are burning peat, making briquettes or using it the way Bord na M&oacute;na was.  I appreciate that Mr. Neenan has spoken about legislation that is needed and Mr. Dunne and Mr. Gleeson also referred to legislation on bogs under certain sizes.  There has to be a way forward.  Countries within Europe that are dealing with the same European legislation can put their own domestic legislation in place to deal with this issue.  It has to be a priority.  The committee is going to have a meeting with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine now.  I get the sense from that Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that there is a willingness to try to deal with this, in the absence of viable alternatives at this point.  It is absolutely crucial to do so.</p></speech>

I fully support what the witnesses have said and thank them for their points and presentations.  A statutory instrument must be brought in to deal with this matter.  People have a right to earn a living and rural Ireland is being discriminated against once again and being seriously impacted upon.  Our economy is suffering dreadfully.  I have never seen a case where workers lose their jobs during a global pandemic while the Government has stood idly by and let it happen.  I have never seen that happen before and I do not think it would happen in any other EU country.  We need to get our act together.  All Government parties must support the need for a statutory instrument.  Many people in the horticulture sector and contractors who have invested hundreds of thousands of euro in specialised machinery have all been left high and dry.  It just does not make sense to punish our own people.  EU directives have often been interpreted a certain way by this Government and we do ourselves no favours by doing that.  Sometimes it is all down to interpretation of a directive.  We need to fight for our own people and a statutory instrument is the only way forward.  I fully support that and have called for it previously.  I reiterate my concerns about this issue.  Some jobs have been lost during the pandemic.  That could not have been prevented and Brexit is a prime example of that happening as well, but this is something that can be prevented by goodwill and political action.  I call on all parties, including the Green Party, which has expressed shock about the current situation, to support this.  It needs to step up to the plate and its Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, needs to stand up as well.  He does not seem to understand rural Ireland but he needs to understand that thousands of jobs are on the line.</p></speech>

To undertake this review, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht established a working group comprised of representatives from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which chaired the working group, the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the EPA.</p> <p>  The working group produced an issues paper on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  This paper was published on 9 October 2019 and submissions were invited on the paper by 31 January 2020.  Some 34 submissions were received from industry stakeholders, environmental non-governmental organisations and the general public and all of these are available to view online.  A report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural Industry was prepared by the inter-agency working group on the basis of the submissions received.  The review report was published by Deputy Malcolm Noonan, Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, on 7 September 2020.</p> <p>  The review report concludes that there are significant positives and negatives arising from ending the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  There are complexities in terms of the environmental benefits of ending horticultural peat extraction set against the economic consequences for the industry, food security, the lack of as effective an alternative to peat, and the economic and cultural impact on the local communities that would be affected.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan accepted a recommendation in the review report that a working group be established, to include representatives from relevant Departments and State agencies, environmental NGOs, and industry stakeholders under an independent chairperson to examine the issues which were identified during the review.  In particular, these are as follows: the reduction and ultimately the elimination of the use of peat moss in the amateur gardening sector in order to leave what remains in use for the industry sector to buy time to develop alternatives, enabling food security and to provide industry surety; the graduation of the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry over an agreed period of years with an agreed end date; the financing and support of those workers whose skills cannot be accommodated in proposed alternative industries; providing investment in further research into the development, education and use of alternatives to peat moss, such as bark, wood fibre, coir, biosolids, bracken and green compost, perlite, vermiculite, rockwool, and horticultural clay and in new methods of farming such as paludiculture and sphagnum farming; the upskilling of the existing workforce to regenerate the existing bogs for use in paludiculture, eco-tourism, carbon farming, and tree farming, as appropriate, to optimise environmental outcomes; the quantifying of the value of the existing viable peat lands as carbon sinks to then determine a carbon market to incentivise owners and operators of peat lands to preserve, rewet or restore their assets; and educating the public to the benefits of what would be proposed to include the climate and environmental benefits, and the economic, social, cultural and public health benefits.</p> <p>  The role of the independent chairperson will be to chair meetings of the working group and to issue recommendations to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, arising from its deliberations.  The Minister of State hopes to be in a position to appoint the chairperson of the working group shortly.  When the chairperson has been appointed, invitations to nominate representatives to the working group will issue from the Department.</p> <p> I also would like to add, Chairman, that since I prepared and sent my opening statement to the committee, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has, in fact, appointed a chairperson to the working group which is something we can also discuss during the meeting.  I thank the committee for inviting the Department to make this presentation and I am willing to try to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

With the working group there is a serious urgency on getting a resolution as to where we find ourselves.  I will open the meeting to questions from the floor and Deputy Collins was the first member to indicate.</p></speech>

I and perhaps other members were shocked when we heard what has been said but we probably already knew about this from the decimating impacts of the changes to peat extraction on the Irish horticulture industry.  This is a complete fiasco and absolute disaster.  We need legislation to define peat extraction for horticulture.  I intend to keep my questions limited in the hope that my colleague, Deputy Nolan, can speak after me and I will perhaps confine myself to one question.  I have been very lucky in getting great advice from a neighbour of mine, a local horticulturalist called Joseph Croke, from Trevor Swanton, Skibbereen nurseries and from other nurseries throughout Ireland and west Cork, in particular.  We are in a situation where we have heard that we are importing peat moss from Scotland and perhaps even the Baltic states.  That is a crazy situation to be in.  Has any research or investigation been done by universities on the amount of peat lands that could not be rewetted or returned to high biodiversity and that could be used to provide peat to the horticultural industry to reduce the significant carbon footprint of transporting peat from as far away as the Baltic states, or further afield, and what will be done with such bogs?</p></speech>

In some cases, if one can get the sphagnum moss back, these bogs will in fact become carbon sinks.  An example of that, and the Deputy may have heard of this, is that Bord the M&oacute;na has decided to rehabilitate its bogs that have been used for the generation of peat for electricity, with a view to stopping the emissions and to bring these bogs back, possibly, as carbon sinks.  There is always-----</p></speech>

I listened into most of the previous session and many of the points the witnesses made were identified in the issues paper that I referred to and in the review report.  What we need to do is to get everybody around the table now in the working group to see what solutions we can come up with.  The biggest short-term solution has been identified by Deputies and Senators and by the industry representatives which is what can be done for this season.</p><p>It says the annual carbon emissions from horticulture peat are 186,000 tonnes over a 100-week period, which equates to only 0.12% of the total peatland under protection.  Has the Department examined the level of decarbonisation resulting from the closure of peatlands that were harvested for horticultural purposes against the carbon footprint involved in importing foreign peat as an alternative?  What is the balance of that?</p></speech>

It is not the job of my Department to do a detailed analysis of that.  As one of the committee's previous witnesses has already pointed out, the legislation is in place.  That legislation regulates horticulture peat extraction and large-scale peat extraction generally.  It is fair to say that one of the committee's witnesses previously pointed out the problems with the legislation for the horticultural industry, but this legislation is not new.  There was, again in the previous session, an attempt on the part of two Ministers at the time to move away from these regulations and bring in statutory instruments.  Those statutory instruments were thrown out by the High Court.  We are therefore back to the legislation that has been there all along and we need to see what can be done now, in both the short term and the medium term.  The short-term problem is to see whether we can move away from the dual consent system and bring in some other legislation that gets over the immediate problem that, as I think some of the committee's witnesses have said, there will be no peat for horticulture by the summer or by September or October of this year, roughly.  That is the immediate problem.  We need to get people into the working group to climb up into that solution.  As I have said before, however, and will say again, the responsibility for that legislation does not come within the remit of my Department if we are to move to some kind of system involving the EPA because that agency comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#K00300"><p>I live in Kilbeggan, in the midlands.  I come up the M6 and the M4.  In recent months, it has been very noticeable to me that I meet all the loads of logs coming in from Scotland, and now I have been informed, in the earlier part of this meeting, that from here on in, I will meet loads of peat.  While it is not Mr. Lucas's fault personally, can he not see the irony of this?  I read the Department's submission and read about the first review and the number of Departments that were included in undertaking the review.  Then I turn the page and read that the outcome of that initial review was to set up another working group or review group.  Can Mr. Lucas not see from all this why people would be disillusioned and how probably the biggest problem we have here when it comes to climate change and making progress is bringing the community with us?  I am referring to the general community, the agricultural community, the horticultural sector and the people who have vested interests.  From what I see here, there are so many Departments involved that nobody really knows what is going on.  What we are witnessing is delusional.  As I said, on the road in the morning I meet loads of timber, and now I will meet loads of peat coming from Scotland.  We all admit there are climate problems but climate is a global thing, so why is it allowable and seemingly acceptable by Departments that we import peat from another country, harvested in another country, with a much bigger carbon footprint?  I know that in his answer Mr. Lucas will probably say this is not within the Department's remit, but that in essence highlights the point I am making.  When will all these Departments bang their heads together, come up with a common-sense approach and start sending out a message which the people can accept and which will bring them along with us?  We are losing the people and the different sectors at every juncture and crossroads because of mismanagement and miscommunication.</p></speech>

It looked at the background to peatlands, the importance of horticulture to the economy, peat moss versus the alternatives and the challenges in moving from peat moss use.  Then it set out some key consultation questions.  As I said, 34 submissions were received, and out of that was produced the review report published by the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, last year.  Again, the issues identified in both the issues paper and the review report were taken up in the previous session by Deputies, Senators and the committee witnesses.  One of the things that became clear from the submissions received was that there was a general view that a working group should be set up to see how we could move forward.  As I said, we will have the relevant Departments, the non-governmental organisations and industry stakeholders under an independent chair, all in the same virtual meeting, to see whether we can come up with a solution to both the immediate problem and the medium to long-term problem.  In all the documents to which I have referred - and I was involved with the previous working groups - there are no easy answers.  There are pluses and minuses, and no one is denying that, so we need to see what we can come up with and what solutions we can come up with now.  Then all the relevant Government Departments - I think the committee knows which ones will be involved - as well as the NGOs and the industry stakeholders can be brought together.  Let us see what solutions we can arrive at.  As I said, there is legislation in place already.  The basis of that is EU law.  We have to see, as witnesses said in the previous session, whether there is an alternative to that solution such that we can get in quickly in order at least to get us over this season and into the next season.</p></speech>

What dialogue did the Department have with the nursery people, that is, the mushroom, vegetable and fruit people?  They are in dire straits with what is coming down the tracks and facing them.  They do not see the alternative that is being spoken about because I do not believe that the research into it has been carried out, and they would agree with that.  This has a devastating effect on the horticultural industry, and I think very little thought has been put into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Lucas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#K00600"><p>As I said, we produced a key issues paper for public consultation.  It was available for public consultation between October 2019 and January 2020, and submissions were received from industry stakeholders as well as the general public and non-governmental organisations.  All those submissions are available to view online.</p> <p>  As for the working group, as I said, some of the issues that have been identified during the review are medium to long-term issues and will require medium to long-term solutions such as alternatives to the use of peat in horticulture and the mushroom industry.  This does not mean that any proposed changes to the legislation could not have been discussed in parallel with the setting up of the working group.  Now that we have the working group, let us get everyone together.  We know what needs to be done immediately.  That has been made clear and was made clear by Deputies, Senators and the previous witnesses.  Let us see whether we can come up with a solution to this problem.  I have talked about the legislation.  As I said, it is an area I do not want to go into very much but the committee can see what I have said already.  There will not be easy solutions in the legislation.  Previous witnesses have brought forward some ideas that can be discussed in the working group, and then the relevant Department can see whether those are feasible or can be introduced and be legally sound.</p></speech>

I have heard a number of suggestions here to the effect that "that is not in my brief" or "that is in someone else's brief".  Senator Paul Daly makes a really strong and cogent case.  We need a multi-agency approach to tackling this problem.</p><p>Perhaps we have not touched sufficiently on the economic impact assessment.  I refer to the economic impact this is having on the horticultural industry.  I ask Mr. Lucas about his knowledge of that.  What was the most recent economic impact assessment?  It is critical to all of this.  We need to look at the economic aspects, as well as the sustainability and environmental aspects.  Is he aware of when an economic impact assessment was made on these proposals and the reduction in the use of milled peat?  What was the last economic assessment he, or any member of his group, had sight of?  The multi-agency approach needs to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

It was also taken up in the review report.</p> <p>  My remit, and that of my Department, is to try to facilitate a solution.  My main remit, as Deputy Fitzmaurice and others are aware, is designated raised bogs.  These are not designated raised bogs.  My main remit is not horticultural peat but I wish to try to be part of a solution to this problem.  I can be part of the solution by getting everyone together to come up with a solution to the short-term and longer-term problem.</p> <p>  A multi-agency approach was mentioned but we will have a multi-agency approach.  We are bringing together representatives from the key Departments, industry and non-governmental organisations, under an independent chair with vast experience in both the academic and practical sides of the horticultural industry.  The best approach to take is to bring those players together and get them to try to come up with solutions quickly.  </p> <p>  I am not trying to escape anything.  My remit is to try to come up with a solution for an area of work that is not my main work.  However, I can see the problems.  I have seen the problems since I became involved in producing the issues paper and the previous working group from late 2018.  I am aware of the problems.  I have seen them.  As I would like to be part of the solution, let us get the working group going.</p> <p>  However, certain things are not within my remit.  I am prepared to admit that but it is fair to say that those under whose remit the issues are will be involved in the working group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#L00300"><p>I thank Mr. Lucas for joining us but anyone listening will note he has referred to the working group in almost every answer as where the solution will be found.  </p><p>Mr. Lucas has talked about the working group operating under what appear to be speedy circumstances.  It does not reflect my experience of Government-appointed groups in terms of either interim or full reports.  The Minister of State published the review report on 7 September.  He had it to hand before that.  Today, we are told he has appointed an independent chair, five months later.  Why did it take five months?  I do not know this gentleman, Dr. Prasad, and will not cast views one way or another.  Can Mr. Lucas outline the criteria under which the independent chairperson was selected?  There will be a period before all the members are appointed.  My understanding is that expressions of interest will be sought and members will be appointed.  </p><p>I have a fear that the working group is a facade to enable the Government to hide behind the working group in terms of its outward decisions.  One can see it already in Mr. Lucas's responses.  A Green Party Minister will say he followed through on preventing the use of horticultural peat and other Government Ministers will say it was a working group.  </p><p>Mr. Lucas's opening statement states there are significant positives and negatives arising from the ending of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  We have seen nothing from the Department or his opening statement acknowledging the negatives of the proposed course of action.  </p><p>The fundamental problem with the working group, as has been set out, is that it has a predetermined outcome.  It states that one of its terms of reference will be to facilitate the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  It is not an environmental objective; it is a political objective.  In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, Mr. Harry McGee quoted a Green Party Deputy as saying &quot;we cannot have a situation where we are extracting peat and causing greenhouse gas emissions&quot;.  It shows the naivety and ignorance on this issue because this is not a matter of extracting peat or not.  It is about whether we extract it in Ireland or somewhere else.</p><p>My questions relate to the mushroom industry.  Does Mr. Lucas accept that at present, there is no viable alternative to horticultural peat for that sector?  Does Mr. Lucas agree that if we move with the stated aims for the working group, which is his answer to all questions, namely, to see the elimination of the use of peat moss, the outworking for the peat industry is the export of the Irish mushroom industry or the import of horticultural peat?  Does Mr. Lucas accept that defies environmental logic?</p><p>Does Mr. Lucas accept the requirements under horticultural peat extraction that 2,000 ha of 1.35 million ha of peatland in the country is enough to satisfy horticultural peat needs?  Does Mr. Lucas's Department have any proposals in place to prevent the export of horticultural peat when we are having this conversation?  To me, it defies absolute logic.  </p></speech>

An advertisement was placed in the national newspapers seeking expressions of interest.  It ran for two approximately two months, until the end of November.  The expressions of interest were then assessed by a departmental panel and a recommendation was made to the Minister of State on the basis of the assessment carried out by the panel.</p> <p>  I do not agree this working group is a facade.  It has come about through a long process through the issues paper and review report.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, decided to establish the working group, under an independent chair, arising from a number of submissions on the review report.  I do not see any reason the working group should not commence its work very quickly.</p> <p>  I also do not agree there is a predetermined outcome.  In my opening statement, I indicated the working group was to examine the seven issues identified during the review.  They are a framework for the group to act but I do not believe there is a predetermined outcome.  There will be different views and different people will have different priorities.  Let us see if we can come up with a solution to the short-term problems and the medium- and long-term issues.</p> <p>  I cannot say whether there is a viable alternative for the mushroom industry.  The committee heard the industry witness in the last session who is more expert than am I.  It would not be fair of me to make a comment on that.  The same goes for horticultural peat exports, which would come under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It would not be fair or appropriate of me to say whether it should be stopped.</p> <p>  However, this working group is not a facade.  I am not a politician and I am there.</p><p>I have been asked to do a job and I am prepared to do it to the best of my ability.  I do not think it is a facade and I do not think it has a predetermined outcome.  Let us get people in the room and let us see if we can come up with a solution.</p></speech>

He has given us a very good overview.  I am delighted to see momentum building behind the working group and to see the chair being appointed.  We heard specific requests from the producers and operators in this sector when they came to us.  Hopefully some of those will be achieved through the working group.  The most immediate request is that they get production for this year up and running.  It is good to hear Mr. Lucas state that a key ask of the review group is to achieve this.</p> <p>  Obviously, this issue is very important for the committee.  As it and the crisis in the forestry industry are probably the two most important issues facing the committee at present, we will be watching it carefully.  Industry representatives appeared before us and outlined details of their legal advice and recommendations from McCann FitzGerald, which have been given to the Department.  In anticipation of the commencement of the working group, can legal opinion be sought on that, either externally or from within the Department?  Can it be expedited to be ready for the working group to review?  Clearly, there is a legislative requirement and industry representatives have pointed out that a workaround to this crisis has been found in every other European country.  I appreciate we are bound by EU legislation but workarounds have been found right across Europe.  The onus is on us to act fast to save this industry, which has an employment worth of &euro;500 million annually.  I wish Mr. Lucas well in his deliberations.</p></speech>

As for legal opinion, from what I picked up from previous witnesses, the legislation is moving towards a system under the EPA .  That comes under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  From my own experience of how Departments work, in general, when legislation is brought forward legal opinion is sought from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and then the drafting of the legislation is done by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I do not see any reason the opinions mentioned by witnesses earlier cannot be forwarded to the working group.  If legislative changes are to be brought forward, I see no reason they could not be considered.  Generally, when Departments seek legal opinion, it comes from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  Most Departments, including our own, also have an inhouse legal adviser on secondment from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office who gives legal opinion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021021600002#M00400"><p>I thank Mr. Lucas for appearing before the committee today, for his contribution and for answering our questions.  I commend him on his excellent answers to date.  I also commend him, the Department and the Minister of State on stepping in to facilitate this cross-departmental and interagency group which is going to seek to resolve this situation in the short and long term.  It is an important issue.</p> <p>  I am delighted to hear Dr. Prasad has been appointed chair of the group.  Deputy Carthy may not know about him.  Dr. Prasad has more than 40 years' experience in this area.  He was the chief scientist for Bord na M&oacute;na.  He worked for more than 15 years with the New Zealand department of agriculture.  He has more than 40 years of expertise in total.  We are very fortunate to have a man of his calibre leading this working group and guiding the process.</p> <p>  I take issue with Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s statement, which betrays his and his party&rsquo;s abject knowledge of the environment.  Even the industry witnesses we heard from today provided statements, if he cared to read them, which said we need to transition away from the use of peat.  I think even Deputy Fitzmaurice would agree with that.  I absolutely reject Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s position.  He implied this is some kind of green agenda or ideology.  I want to put on record we are fully supportive of the industry and we believe the working group that has been put together, which is led by Dr. Prasad, is the right way to go about things.  I am actually embarrassed a Member of the Oireachtas would show such abject misunderstanding of this issue.  This is what we hear from Sinn F&eacute;in all along.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Lucas here today.  He is a person I have dealt with for many years.  Deputy Fitzmaurice knows more about bogs than I do but we have had many meetings over the years particularly about issues in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Who will be deciding on the working group and will it be balanced?  I have no doubt it will bring in all the appropriate Departments.  What worries me is not Mr. Lucas&rsquo;s fault but is totally the Government&rsquo;s fault.  It relates to the formation of the Government and the way it broke up the Departments, which results in no one having responsibility for this issue.  As a person who was in government for a long time, I know what happens when nobody has responsibility for nothing.  The result is nothing happens.</p> <p>  I must say that Mr. Lucas always listened and tried to come up with solutions.  I give him ten out of ten for trying to come up with solutions.  I am confident this working group will work but there must be balance on the group.  It cannot be made up only of environmentalists.  In spite of what Deputy Leddin might think, I am as much in favour of the environment as he is.  If he wants to, he can come to the place I have in relation to the environment.  The problem with Deputy Leddin and a few of these people is that it always seems to affect rural Ireland more than it affects any other place.  It affects our jobs and the way we live.  It is fine for people who do not live in rural Ireland, who do not understand rural Ireland and who lecture us about rural Ireland.</p></speech>

This is having a serious effect on jobs in our industry.  Mr. Lucas is aware of my views over the years and while I would stop him and his Department from making decisions about rural Ireland, who is there to do it now?</p></speech>

Obviously, the key Departments need to be there.  There needs to be industry representation, as well as representation from the non-governmental organisation sector.  I believe there will be balance in the working group.  We are coming towards the end but what my Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I are trying to do is to facilitate a solution to this issue.

The review also referred to graduating the elimination of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry over an agreed period of years with an agreed end date.  This is exactly like the just transition process and one can look at what happened there.  There is absolute chaos.  I come from one of the worst affected counties, Offaly, where there is chaos with many jobs needlessly lost.  There is a recklessness involved in the whole process.  How can the horticultural sector have any confidence in such a proposal, given what is happening with the just transition process?</p> <p>  The review also mentioned the possibility of finance and support for workers whose skills cannot be accommodated in proposed alternative industries.  How can we believe that when one looks at the peat contractors?  Their work could not be accommodated and yet the Government explicitly ruled out anything like compensation or a financial support package, about which I asked on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  In terms of EU directives, clearly Mr. Lucas does not want to state whether he believes a statutory instrument is necessary.  It is necessary to protect thousands of jobs.  Does he accept that sometimes, EU directives are interpreted by Ireland in a way they do not need to be?</p><p>Ireland wants to be the good boy and girl of Europe and goes further than it needs to with many measures and directives, which are sometimes interpreted harshly to the detriment of workers and rural Ireland.  What are Mr. Lucas's views on that?  I have seen time and time again, particularly in agriculture, that the interpretation Ireland makes goes further than it needs.</p></speech>

I will reiterate a point made by Deputy Leddin.  During the review, the industry also accepted there was a need for provision from the use of peat.  As I said in answer to Deputy Carthy, what is set out in the review report are the issues identified during the review.  It is not a predetermined outcome.  It is a framework for the work that needs to take place.</p> <p>  Regarding just transition, my Department and Ministers played a big role.  We have started to restore the designated raised bogs, the special areas of conservation and the natural heritage areas.  We have a big programme in place since 2020.  Bord na M&oacute;na is project managing that programme and is doing both the physical works on site and providing the professional services.  Allied to that, we have a smaller scheme involving local contractors who are involved in peat restoration work.  We have played our part in just transition and we will continue to do so.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice can correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association ever put forward a proposal for financial compensation to the Department.  I am open to correction on that.</p></speech>

The association always stated that, as contractors, we wanted to continue cutting turf and we have never looked for money because turf cutting is our game and will remain our game, regardless of what any eco-warriors think.</p></speech>

The Deputy has clarified the point I made.</p> <p>  Regarding interpretation of EU law, it is a road I am reluctant to go down.  All I would say is there is a peatland infringement case against Ireland and a separate infringement case on this particular subject matter.  As I said earlier, the European Commission does not mind whether we do it by statutory instrument or by primary legislation as long as we implement the directives.  That is all I will say on that.</p></speech>

I have had many battles with Departments down through the years, but I will say one thing about Mr. Lucas and I will be very clear about it.  I have found him helpful to work with.  For the sake of the peat industry, rural Ireland and the workers around this country, until something better and more efficient comes along in ten or 15 years, which will grow plants and do everything else, people will be willing to change but until we get to that point, we cannot just knock off the light.  I ask Mr. Lucas, and I know he cannot do it on his own, to first get a solution for this year and then people can go out.  To be brutally honest, people are not going to wait all year for a committee to decide whether they can come or go when the weather is fine.  They will go out on the bogs, it as simple as that.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Lucas for engaging with the committee on this issue.  I will give a summary.  This is a major issue for the horticulture and nursery sectors.  I welcome some of the comments from Mr. Lucas about the establishment of a working group.  I also welcome that he recognises the time pressure for a solution for the horticulture sector.  If we get a spring like we had last year, early April will be the prime time for cutting peat and, therefore, time is of the essence.  The economic viability of these home-grown industries is dependent on a common sense solution.  Listening to Mr. Lucas, I am hopeful that a common sense solution will be found very quickly.</p> <p>  I know some committee members want to get in again but Covid restrictions mean I am six or seven minutes over time.  I have to close the discussion with Mr. Lucas.  The next meeting is a private virtual one tomorrow at 4.30 p.m. where we will finalise the report for the forestry sector.  Is that agreed?

I thank members and witnesses for participating in today's meeting in line with the requirements relating to the exceptional circumstances we are experiencing under Covid-19.  I remind them that, apart from myself and the staff from the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are participating remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shanahan.</p> <p>  I am pleased that we are able to commence our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the employment permits (consolidation and amendment) Bill 2019.  It has been submitted by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  From the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I welcome Ms Fiona Ward, who is accompanied by Mr. Rob Walsh and Ms. Miriam Tracey.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal prosecution from proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Ward to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The Government approval included a request that this committee undertake pre-legislative scrutiny.  Officials attended the joint committee on business, enterprise and innovation for detailed pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme on 13 November 2019.  However, as the committee&rsquo;s report was not finalised before the dissolution of the Oireachtas in January 2020, pre-legislative scrutiny needs to be revisited.  We are grateful that the committee has agreed to give its time to do so.<br/><br/>In terms of the background to the proposed Bill, a review of economic migration policy conducted at the request of the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in 2018 indicated that the employment permits system, while robust, lacked flexibility and was in need of some updating in order to make it more effective and responsive to changing labour market needs.  The review's recommendations included the drafting of a new Bill to adjust the legislative underpinning of the system, as well as to allow for swift responses to verified changes in labour supply and demand or employment practices.<br/><br/>This Bill incorporates both specific and general recommendations made in the review, while retaining the core focus of a vacancy led employment permits system oriented to meeting of the skills and labour needs in the State.  The conclusions of the review endorsed the robust fundamental structure of the existing system.  The changes proposed are concerned with increasing its agility and effectiveness, while retaining the key policy focus of supporting the economy and the labour market through evidence-based decision-making.  The proposed Bill, therefore, does not represent a change in the Government's overall policy.<br/><br/>The 2018 review involved widespread stakeholder consultation and the key issues raised during that consultation are addressed in the general scheme.  There are two Acts and one amendment Act on the Statute Book, namely, the Employment Permit Acts 2003 and 2006, and the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014.  These Acts will be repealed following the enactment of the proposed Bill.<br/><br/>In addition to consolidating the existing legislation to make a more accessible statutory basis for our economic migration system, specific changes in this Bill include: the introduction of a seasonal employment permit; extensive revision of the labour market needs test to make it more relevant and efficient; the introduction of a scheme to deal with occasional exceptional circumstances where an employment permit may be granted despite not meeting all of the criteria for the general employment permit; a number of housekeeping changes such as clarifications of particular provisions, moving of operational criteria to regulations and the streamlining of a number of requirements to make the grant process more efficient; and providing for additional conditions for granting employment permits, such as training or accommodation support for migrant workers in some circumstances or making innovation or upskilling a condition of a grant where this may reduce future reliance on economic migration.<br/><br/>Ireland is an outlier, both in the EU and among many developed nations outside of the Union, in not having provision for granting seasonal employment permits.  There is evidence that some employers are disadvantaged <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>competitors in other jurisdictions in not having this form of permission.  Accordingly, it is proposed to design a short-term employment permit to cater for short-stay and recurrent employment situations in sectors, such as horticulture, where this type of employment is common.<br/><br/>Examination of systems of seasonal employment used by our international peers has been undertaken to ensure an accurate sense of both risks and benefits of this kind of scheme informs our structuring of the criteria for the permit type.  We would welcome any views that the committee might have in this regard.<br/><br/>Apart from those occupations on the critical skills list, or for intra-company transfers, employers must demonstrate that they have made a genuine effort to recruit from within the State and across the European Economic Area, EEA, before they apply for an employment permit.  This is called the labour market needs test, LMNT.  The way in which employers are obliged to advertise vacancies is prescribed in primary legislation and includes an obligation to use some outdated methods, for example, the need to take out advertisements in national newspapers for a set number of days, etc.  The proposed Bill, while continuing to require an employer to carry out an LMNT before seeking to recruit from outside the EEA, will remove the detail of how this must be done, allowing for the setting out in regulations of the requirements needed to demonstrate real engagement with the jobs market in Ireland and across the EEA.<br/><br/>The specific intention is to remove the operational requirements from primary legislation, instead allowing the media for advertising of vacancies to be prescribed in regulations and varied where necessary.  For example, some types of vacancies may be best advertised through social media, others in sector specific journals, or by a radio campaign.  Allowing leeway to employers to advertise as best fits their industry will improve the coherence and utility of the LMNT.  In tandem with this, it is intended to deepen the involvement of the Department of Social Protection in the LMNT process to maximise opportunities for resident and EEA jobseekers.</p><p>On the special circumstances employment permit, from time to time an employer will seek a permit for a position that does not neatly fall within all the usual criteria for granting an employment permit but where the granting of the permit would clearly benefit the company and, by extension, the social or economic development of the State.  Up to the present, when such a circumstance arises, we generally have no option but to refuse the permit.  The circumstances in which such a permit might be granted will be clearly prescribed in regulations, and a limited number of such employment permits might be granted in any calendar year.  Anchoring the prescription securely in primary legislation and setting the criteria precisely in regulations, so that this permit type cannot be used routinely to waive the requirements of the system, will be a priority. </p><p> The broad criteria we propose to prescribe are as follows: where one or more of the criteria for the granting of a permit cannot be satisfied but no training for the occupation is available in Ireland, and where it requires an unusual skill set; and for niche employments that do not occur with sufficient frequency to attract individuals into training or for which no formal training exists where the expertise is highly specialised and where training may not be replicated in Ireland, and where it is evident that the employment of the specific foreign national would benefit the competitiveness or development of the employing organisation and economy as a whole. </p><p> Overall, there has been a general welcome from interested parties for this consolidating and amending legislation.  The development of this general scheme into a final draft Bill will evolve through further consultation and in line with advice given by the Attorney General's office.  We readily acknowledge that a number of the suggested changes currently set out in a general indicative format will require considered further drafting to ensure that their parameters are in line with current jurisprudence, especially in the context of ensuring that the prescription of variables in secondary legislation, necessary to give the system the agility to respond quickly to changing conditions in the economy, should nonetheless remain securely anchored in primary legislation.</p><p>  While the ongoing Covid pandemic has severely impacted the labour market and economy as a whole, Ireland will continue to need skilled migrant labour in certain sectors of the economy, including the medical sector.  This draft Bill is designed to enable us to ensure that it is capable of adapting to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market of the future and to fluctuations in demand contingent on the economic cycle. </p><p> Once again, we appreciate the committee's attention, and would welcome any guidance during the drafting process that would support the policy objectives underlying the general scheme.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee might have on this general scheme.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

That permit is linked to our critical skills occupation list.  This includes occupations we know are in short supply in the State.  Regarding the other avenue to a critical skills employment permit, there is a remuneration threshold of &euro;64,000.  That is a proxy for a degree.  For the general employment permit, the remuneration threshold is generally &euro;30,000, but there are some other remuneration thresholds for specific occupations.  For example, regarding contact centre staff the remuneration threshold pertaining to those with a non-EEA language is &euro;27,000.  For meat deboners, the remuneration threshold is &euro;27,500.  Regarding the agri-food pilot for meat-processing workers, horticulture workers and dairy farm assistants, the remuneration threshold is &euro;22,000.</p></speech>

There is also the ineligible occupations list.  In respect of the latter, evidence suggests the resources are available in Ireland and across the rest of the EU to fill the vacancies.</p> <p>  We review the lists twice per year.  There is a review ongoing.  A review involves an evidence-based process.  We examine research undertaken by the skills and labour market research unit in Solas and the expert group on future skills needs, which falls under the remit of my Department, and we refer to the National Skills Bulletin and the Vacancy Overview report.

There seems to be satisfaction at Department level that this list is what it is but no effort is being made to ensure the Department of Education is intervening to upskill people where those skills will be required.  Certain skills needs will not be met.  If a skills requirement has been on the list for ten years, surely at some point an alarm bell would have been raised in the then Department of Education and Skills or in the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to indicate there is an issue.  Clearly, the groups are meeting and reviews are happening but I do not see anything emerging from that.  However, I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  Some people in my constituency from the Middle East and Africa have raised the issue of jobs on the critical skills occupation list, particularly for sales roles, requiring a fluency in a particular language that is obviously not English.  They have fluency in the language but do not have the required sales experience.  It is easy to train a person to work in the area of sales but it is difficult to train somebody to speak a language such as Farsi or Zulu.  Is there scope or is any effort being made to take account of people who have language skills who would require training in sales?  People with language skills are coming here to work and they would need a small amount of training in sales, which is relatively easy to do compared to learning a language.  Has consideration been given to taking such an approach and if not, could consideration be given to doing that?</p></speech>

The Departments of Education, Justice and Social Protection are represented on it, as well as the various policy Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department with responsibility for tourism.  In reviewing the occupation list, we apply a whole-of-government approach to ensuring the employment permit regime is focused on meeting the skills and labour challenges in the economy.  Government policy, in the first instance, is that we would seek to fill vacancies from within the Irish labour market and across the European Union.  The Department of Education is a very active member of the economic migration group.  In our consideration, we examine what skills and training are required and the college outputs for the various occupations.  It is an evidenced-based process.  Ireland is a leader across the European Union in linking labour market intelligence to our economic migration policy.</p></speech>

It is important we take account of the skills that already exist in the domestic market.  I do not think that is happening.  That is my assessment from talking to people who have some of those skills and live in my community. From my reading of this, it will move from legislation into regulation.  It would only require a short miscellaneous Bill every so often to come before the House, which would provide an opportunity for us to have a discussion and scrutinise it.  This is an area that has not been scrutinised heavily enough.  I have a concern about moving it into the area of regulation and while I do not suggest it would deny or prohibit us, it would mean we would not the opportunity to debate it.  It is not an overly onerous task.  It is what we are paid to do.  We have a role to play in having that level of oversight.  If it is moved into regulation it would be moved further away from scrutiny.  Ms Ward might indicate the thinking behind moving it into regulation.  </p></speech>

It is underpinned by the primary legislation and the methods it requires are quite outdated in terms of requiring an employer to advertise a vacancy in a national newspaper for three days.  They have to advertise it in a local newspaper or on a local website and on the Department of Social Protection's <i>jobsireland.ie</i>website across the European Union.  These days, most employers do not advertise in that way to fill job vacancies.  There are many different ways to advertise, for example, through social media, LinkedIn and sector specific journals.  Also, not to have one size fits all in terms of recruitment, the proposal to move it to legislation was to give that flexibility and maintain the absolute requirement to test the domestic labour market and the EEA labour market, while giving flexibility to employers to advertise in a method that is more suited to their particular occupation and sector.</p></speech>

It is not a massive item of legislation and would not take a great deal of time to draft.  It is important we would have regular engagement on this because it is an area that is open to abuse and where abuse was uncovered previously.  It is also an area where there could be a serious issue with regard to workers' rights and so on.  It would not be a deeply onerous task to debate this legislation as and when required.  That flexibility could be there by maintaining it as part of the legislation and not necessarily moving it into regulation, which would take it out of our hands and would mean we would not get the opportunity to regularly debate it.</p></speech>

It has been difficult for employers to navigate the system because of the prescription in primary legislation.  The intention is not to in any way reduce the requirement to undertake a labour market needs test or to ensure the labour market is not fully tested within the domestic and EEA labour market before recruitment of a non-EEA national.  That is not the intention at all.  We want to make sure it is anchored in primary legislation but that flexibilities are given to allow for a differentiated approach depending on the occupation regulation.   That is the thinking behind it.</p></speech>

Will the move to regularise the position of undocumented people in Ireland require additional changes in work permit legislation?  Primary responsibility falls probably to the Department of Justice.  Will we need to do that?</p> <p>  I would like to follow up on areas of scarcity where initiatives to develop apprenticeships have been tried.  How extensive has the developing of apprenticeships in areas of shortage been?  One for butchery was developed but recruitment for it was not that successful.  How much is the Department doing in that area of developing apprenticeships in areas of skills shortage?</p> <p>  What rights do seasonal workers obtain?  In the current climate where undoubtedly there is big pressure on care needs, is the Department applying seasonality, or will people who come here meeting care needs have permanency?  How does that work?</p><p>I note the restrictions on special circumstances permits.  There is a proposal to cap this and have the prescription published.  Will there be transparency <i>ex post </i>to see how this is applied in practice?  While competitiveness is used, will the Department apply tests like compassionate needs to applications for special circumstances permits?</p></speech>

We are guided by them when addressing the issues of undocumented workers.  The matter is not provided for in the employment permit in this general scheme.  However, we have what we call the reactivation employment permit, which was developed under the previous legislation, as the Deputy would know, to resolve issues regarding people who came in originally on an employment permit but, through no fault of their own, have fallen out of permission.  The reactivation permit allows them to regularise their situation and we work with our colleagues in the Department of Justice on that.</p> <p>  On developing skills and apprenticeships, as I said to Deputy O'Reilly earlier, we work closely with the Department of Education and Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on that.  With regard to any changes that we would make to the list, we are cognisant of ongoing apprenticeship issues.</p> <p>  In respect of the agricultural permits, the pilot scheme was the first time that we opened up the regime to lower wage workers.  One of the conditions for extending the permit was that they would engage and work to develop the career structures and skills of people who work in those occupations.</p> <p>  On seasonal workers and seasonable permits, we have looked at what happens in other jurisdictions that have seasonal workers.  We are looking at putting in place a structure around that to protect their employment rights but also to facilitate the employment needs of those sectors that use seasonal occupations.  We are examining, for example, whether to designate sectors that have seasonal workers, what duration the permit type should be, what the remuneration should be and what conditions should be attached to those permit types in respect of the obligations on employers regarding the provision of or access to suitable accommodation.  We are also looking at fines for overstaying or for problems that attach to that. and also to ensure a labour market needs test is undertaken beforehand so that our labour market and the European Labour Authority market are tested in the first place.</p> <p>  On carers and care needs, healthcare assistants and home carers are currently ineligible for an employment permit.  We engage with our colleagues in the Department of Health on this matter, as it is the policy Department.  Until now, the Department has made submissions to the twice-yearly review.  The evidence and information on the churn in care needs has to do with retention and recruitment issues rather than, necessarily, labour challenges.  There is a review ongoing on this issue and we are meeting our colleagues in the Department of Health on that.</p> <p>  On the special circumstances permit, we have had instances where a special niche type of occupation has turned up that would have no disruptive effective effect to the economy and for which there is no training in Ireland and unlikely to be any training because the occupation is so specialised, but we have had to refuse that permit.  The example we often use and cite is the heart strings butcher.  Butchers are ineligible for an employment permit generally but a heart strings butcher is a specialist who makes musical instrument using heart strings.  There is no training available for that type of work as it is a very specialised role.  The permit is to cover those types of niche occupations.  I hope I have covered all of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

This is one of the areas that has proven to be very frustrating, chunky and difficult to administer.  For both employers and prospective employees coming from abroad, it has often been a source of huge frustration so I welcome the proposal to make the system more nimble, flexible and user-friendly.</p> <p>  I will focus on intra-corporate transfers.  EU Directive 2014/66/EU was signed up to by all countries except Ireland, Denmark and former EU member state, the UK.  The directive refers to the conditions of entry on residents of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra-corporate transfer.  Article 18 of the directive refers to the right to equal treatment, Article 20 deals with intra-EU mobility, Article 21 deals with short-term mobility and Article 22 deals with long-term mobility.  We have not signed up to that directive.  Now that the UK has left the European Union, is there a proposal to examine this directive or take on board some of its provisions and the thinking behind them?</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the fact that in some European countries when somebody transfers into the country using an inter-company transfer, his or her partner or spouse is allowed to work.  I have come across a case involving a highly-skilled person who came here and whose partner, who is also highly skilled, is not allowed to work.  It is very difficult and awkward under the current regime for that person to get employment.  I know it is possible but it is very difficult and challenging.  Maybe the officials can revert to me on this matter.  Will consideration be given to including in this legislation a right to work for partners, spouses and perhaps dependants of those who move here to work under inter-company transfers?  I ask this on the basis that many European countries are very generous in this regard and providing for such a right could make Ireland a more attractive place for highly-skilled people to move to and use their skills in various companies.</p></speech>

I assume that was to do with issues concerning the common travel area.  We are not giving the issue of whether to sign up to the directive any consideration at the moment.  We would have to work with our colleagues in the Department of Justice on that.</p> <p>  On access by the spouses and partners of inter-company transfer permit holders to the State, the way the system is configured at the moment is that our premium permit is the critical skills employment permit.  As I said, that is linked to the critical skills occupation list and they are occupations that we know are in shortage in the State.  We want those highly-skilled workers when they come to the State to settle here.  As a result, there are additional benefits attached to that permit type, including immediate family reunification and the facts that the spouse or partner has broad and wide access to the labour market immediately and also has a fast track to long-term residency.  After two years, spouses and partners can work without the need for an employment permit.  Those options have not been extended to other permit types, including inter-company transfer.  Obviously inter-company transfer permit holders are still on the payroll of the parent company when they are transferred in.  They do not have a long-term ambition to stay in the State.  While our colleagues in the Department of Justice, who look after family reunification, provide for immediate family reunification in such cases, they do not provide access to the labour market for spouses and partners.</p> <p>  Many of those spouses and partners, as the Deputy said, are highly skilled and may qualify for an employment permit.  That sometimes happens.  In addition, sometimes when the inter-company transfer permit holder comes over, he or she transfers to a critical skills permit which means his or her spouse or partner can then access the labour market.</p><p>That said, one of the recommendations of the review we carried out in 2018 was that we should look at that issue.  We have not viewed it yet, but doing so is on my to-do list.  We prioritised the drafting of the general scheme but it is certainly something to which we will be giving consideration.</p></speech>

I note that in the last three years, there were 1,000 people, on average, involved in the inter-company transfer.  Obviously, in most cases they would have had partners or spouses as well.  Rather than splitting families up or having people here and not allowing them to work or having to go through a very difficult process involving critical skills, as Ms Ward outlined, it would be beneficial if they could work as well, as happens in many other European countries.  There may be constraints in that regard, but I look forward to Ms Ward referring back to us with some further thoughts on it.</p> <p>  Also, there are the other articles I mentioned in the directive.  I am interested, for example, in Article 18 and the right to equal treatment.  We have not transposed the directive for the reasons Ms Ward outlined, but have we mirrored any of the rights and thoughts in the directive?  Should we be looking at that?  Perhaps she will refer back to us on that as well.</p></speech>

I wish to make some general comments and then to put a question.  First, the legislation as envisaged is problematic, fundamentally for two reasons.  One is the point that Deputy O'Reilly made about shifting from a legislation-based system to a regulation-based system, which diminishes the democratic oversight of the D&aacute;il.  It makes it easier to make changes.  That has a real impact in providing less certainty and security for migrant workers because their circumstances can be changed by virtue of employer lobbying or an economic downturn, without a need for legislation.  Effectively, it copper-fastens the concept of a type of guest-worker system with lesser rights.  One can say they are entitled to all the same rights, and that, strictly speaking, is true, but their employment conditions can be changed overnight by regulation and then they can be forced to leave the country.</p> <p>  The second and substantive issue is that the general scheme does not propose to do what was recommended by this committee previously, which is that work permits should not be tied to a particular employer.  This is the central issue.  The reason it is inaccurate to say that they have the same rights as everybody else is that their continued life in this country is tied to the continued agreement of their employer.  It creates a massive and bigger power imbalance than normal between workers and employers.  It definitely leaves them ripe for exploitation.  Why was it decided to keep that crucial point of the permit being tied to a particular employer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.382" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021021600002#E00700"><p>The employment permit system is a vacancy-led system.  Before there is an employment permit there is a job and a written contract of employment.  It is expected that an employee will remain with an employer for approximately one year before the employee can move to another occupation.  The reason for that is to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the employer's expectations that the foreign national will stay for a reasonable period of time, given that the employer has a job vacancy, has incurred costs in recruiting that person and, generally, has paid for the employment permit, which costs about &euro;1,000 per permit, and, on the other hand, not unduly tying the employee to that employer.  At the end of the 12-month period, in the normal course of events the employee can move to another employer and apply for another employment permit.  During the 12-month period an employee can move to another employment permit if the job's terms and conditions are not what the employee expected when he or she came here, for example, if the employee was made redundant.  In addition, if the terms and conditions are not as outlined in the written contract of employment, the employee can move within that 12-month period.  We were trying to balance the needs of the employer without unduly tying the employee to the employment permit and to the employment.</p> <p>  We looked at other jurisdictions to see if any of them had a sectoral type of arrangement.  We have not identified a jurisdiction that has a regime on that basis.  In all the jurisdictions we looked at within and outside Europe the employer-employee link is part of the employment permit systems across the globe.  Germany allows somebody to come to the country and look for a job but it is confined to the very higher end of the labour market.  It is somewhat similar to the occupations on our critical skills list.  Again, Australia has it for very tightly limited exceptions and it is linked to areas and locations in Australia which are not densely populated.  It is not something that would be replicated in Ireland.  We have not been able to identify any jurisdiction that operates on that basis.</p></speech>

With regard to the seasonal employment permit, there is reference to providing for a non-EEA national to work in the State temporarily, while retaining a legal domicile in a third country, for the purpose of employment in a sector of seasonal activity.  What is the implication of having a legal domicile elsewhere?  Does that have any consequences in terms of employment rights?  Is it equivalent to a posted worker?

In fact, we are going to draw up a consultation paper.  We have done some research and we propose then to consult with the sector, policy Departments and the trade union representative bodies.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has asked for that in its submission on the legislation and we will be happy to talk to its representatives about it.</p></speech>

That was related to the atypical working scheme and the huge exploitation of migrant workers in the fishing industry in Ireland.  UN rapporteurs wrote about it.  I have spoken to a former employee of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the forerunner of the WRC, Mr. George McLoughlin, who spoke about seeking permission to investigate these issues and to go on the vessel and not being given permission, and then the employers effectively being tipped off by them being contacted.  There is a wider issue there in respect of a lack of resourcing of inspections and so forth.  We see it with regard to Covid.  Is this something that had to be taken into account in drafting the general scheme?</p></speech>

I have some statistics on the work of the WRC in 2020.  I am trying to dig them out so I apologise for the delay.</p><p>It has 45 inspectors at the moment, divided into five teams.  In 2019, they undertook 4,800 inspections and secured the recovery of some &euro;3.9 million in unpaid wages.  In 2020, many of the inspectors were involved with the return-to-work health and safety protocol and they carried out some compliance checks, but they also undertook approximately 7,680 workplace inspections, resulting in the repayment of some &euro;1.7 million in unpaid wages.</p><p> In respect of migrant fishers, that scheme does not have anything to do with the employment permit regime and is managed by our colleagues under the atypical work scheme in the Department of Justice.  The WRC works very closely with the other inspection bodies in regard to that area, including the Marine Survey Office, the Department of Justice and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have inspected almost all vessels within the scope of the scheme &ndash; 169 out of 171 at this stage - and they say they maintain a risk-based inspection compliance regime which is informed by intelligence.  That is what I can say on that issue.  The resourcing of the WRC is always kept under review to make sure it is sufficiently resourced to undertake its role.</p></speech>

I want to begin by checking one point she made when she spoke to my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly.  If I am misquoting her, she can correct me.  I think Ms Ward said that issues like workers&rsquo; rights and a living wage do not come under the scope of this scheme.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

All migrant workers are protected by the employment rights protections that Irish employment rights law confer.  As I said, we have additional protections built into the employment permits scheme to protect the employment rights of migrant workers.  This includes the fact they must have written contracts of employment, there are remuneration thresholds that have to be met, they get the employment permits themselves and they hold on to those and only copies go to their employers.  They can move after 12 months and they can also move within 12 months if the employment does not comply with the terms and conditions of that written contract of employment.  The employment permit itself has information on how to contact the WRC, with the contact information on the permit.  When they contact the WRC, information is provided in a number of different languages.</p> <p>  What I was referring to was the development of the sick pay scheme that is currently under development in the Department.  That is managed by a completely separate area than the area in which I work and it is not part of my current workload.</p></speech>

Can Ms Ward explain who sets the wages?  Let us take the example she gave earlier of the agrifood workers on &euro;23,000 a year, which is the princely sum of &euro;423 a week to do some of the hardest, most back-breaking work that anyone ever does.  Who sets that rate of pay?</p></speech>

In the context of the broader review, the review agreed seven guiding principles that would underpin the employment permits regime going forward, one of which is that the employment permit holders be net contributors to the economy and the State, and that they would not have recourse to social welfare and social security benefits.  In terms of addressing and identifying that particular wage threshold, we had regard to what was the minimum wage at that time and where that wage would leave the permit holder.</p></speech>

Let us talk about meat factory workers.  Some 90% of workers in meat plants have no sick pay.  Irish meat plant operatives work an average of 4.7 weeks per year more than their EU counterparts and they rank bottom of the list on actual hourly wages received.  Those are statistics from the SIPTU trade union.  My point is that the Department set this wage without any recourse to the outside world.  One of the recommendations from this committee previously was that the Department would involve bodies like the Labour Court so we could have a public airing of these terms and conditions.  The reason that is so important, and I can speak personally in this regard, is that meat factory workers in many cases have no say whatsoever at work, they have no recourse to union representation in two thirds of the factories and they are very open to exploitation.  Can Ms Ward please address the issue of the lack of transparency in terms of that wage-setting process and the extraordinarily low levels of pay on offer for those workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021021600002#F00800"><p>What I can say is that the remuneration threshold for those operatives was set and agreed in consultation with the economic migration interdepartmental group, which, as I said, is a cross-government, whole-of-government approach to management and oversight of the employment permit occupations.  It was done through the auspices of the review and we consulted with the Low Pay Commission at the time.  I know the committee previously recommended that the Labour Court would have a role in that but it is not actually a role for the Labour Court, in that setting wages is not a role for the Labour Court.  There are what we call sectoral employment orders and that might be a mechanism that could be used.  However, we consulted our colleagues on the Labour Court and that is a matter for them.</p></speech>

Surely, that should be a threshold in regard to work permits.</p> <p>  On another point, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, compiled a really devastating report, Working to the Bone, on the meat industry just last year.  Has Ms Ward read the report?  Has she taken note of what is in that report in terms of the manner of exploitation in this industry and the manner of fear in this industry?  It concerns me.  Ms Ward mentioned that most interested parties welcome this legislation.  I do not believe the Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomes this legislation and I do not believe my union, SIPTU, would recommend this legislation.  These people are in dreadful conditions at work.  I can tell Ms Ward that from first-hand experience, having tried to organise them and having seen them fired any time they try to join a trade union.  I wonder why the Department does not appear to have taken any of these factors into account, particularly when they were raised by Peter Rigney, among others, at the committee just two years ago.</p></speech>

What I can say is that the employment permits regime does have protections for migrant workers, but as I have outlined them before, I do not propose to outline them again to the Senator.  In addition to those normal rights and protections that are there for general employment permit holders, in respect of the pilot scheme for the agrifood sector, employers are obliged to ensure that employees have access to suitable accommodation and access to training, especially language training.  The WRC is the authorised body to ensure compliance by employers with the employment rights of migrant workers and, indeed, all workers, and it has authorised officers under the Employment Permits Act to protect the rights of migrant workers.</p></speech>

As she has acknowledged, there are just 45 inspectors in the WRC.  Again, another recommendation from this committee a couple of years ago was to ensure that the WRC was properly resourced but, to be frank, it is absolutely not properly resourced.  We will probably find there are more dog wardens in the country than WRC inspectors.  Why has that issue not been addressed as part of this review?</p></speech>

In the context of enforcement, how many employers have been found to be in breach of the requirements in this area and what are the levels of associated penalties?  I ask that because it strikes me as being somewhat academic for us to have a conversation about updating legislation if the existing legislation is not being used.  I ask Ms Ward to outline the number of breaches and the penalties in that regard.</p></speech>

I can get that information, however, and will send it to her.  I can provide some figures regarding inspections by the Health and Safety Authority of meat processing plants if that might be of any use.</p></speech>

This group of workers come here for very short periods in some cases and anyone who has worked as an organiser in the union movement will confirm that it is very difficult to organise them.  They are very often frightened and conditions in which some of them work are horrendous, as we know from reports by the MRCI.  Regarding this group of workers specifically, who looks after their employment rights and entitlements and how many employers have been found to be in breach of those rights and entitlements?  It seems that there is not a major obligation on employers in this regard.  How many employers have been found to be in breach of terms of work permits?</p> <p>  A good point was made by a previous speaker concerning these workers being tied to one employer, which makes them different to all other workers in the State.  It makes these people more vulnerable.  Who is looking after these people under the existing legislation?  I do not think we can in good conscience ask employers to look after these people, because I think the State has an obligation to them.  To address how that is being done, let us assume for a moment that not all employers are angels, no more than are all workers.  How many employers have been tackled for breaches of this legislation, even in the past year or two?</p></speech>

Officials from the WRC inspectorate are the authorised officers under the Employment Permits Act 2006.  They have the role of ensuring that employers are compliant with their obligations under the employment permit legislation and to confirm that workers' rights are being protected and not being impinged upon.  I do not have data on the inspections they have carried out in the meat processing sector.  I will have to get that for Deputy O'Reilly.  However, the impact of Covid-19 and associated issues has meant that fewer inspections have taken place this year as a result of people having to stay at home, etc.</p></speech>

I would be very interested to have a look at that information.  It strikes me as very unfortunate that the Department is not a little more curious about this issue.  Given that we were going to have this discussion today about the necessity of updating the legislation, I would have thought we would get some indication from the Department officials concerning the state of play regarding rogue employers.</p> <p>  The figure which Ms Ward quoted in an earlier answer to Senator Gavan - he might nod if this is correct - works out for the lowest-paid workers at approximately &euro;423 per week.  That is the minimum wage rate, effectively, and it is not really giving those workers anything to which they do not have a legal entitlement in any event.  It strikes me that the closeness of that rate to the minimum wage is disturbing.  I would like Ms Ward to get that information regarding inspections, if that is possible, because of the insights which we may derive from it.  With the greatest of respect to employers, most of whom I am sure do their best and observe all the regulations, we all know from talking to the MRCI and other organisations that abuses and breaches of the legislation do happen and it is unfortunate that the Department is not more curious about that situation.</p> <p>  Turning to the list of ineligible occupations, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists are included on it.  Has consideration been given to relaxing that stricture, given we have a shortage of skills in this area?</p></speech>

On the WRC, I would not want the Deputy to think for one minute that we are not interested in ensuring that the employment rights of those who have employment permits are not protected and scrutinised.  We certainly do that and, as part of our processing of employment permit applications, we forward information and complaints we receive and we also do pre-employment checks on employers.  We send applications to the WRC for pre-employment checks as well to ensure that everything is okay with the employer in respect of ensuring that the rights of employees are protected.  There were 7,000-----</p></speech>

When she states that employers undergo pre-employment checks, is it then the case that employers remain in the system once they pass those checks?  Are those employers routinely checked afterwards in an unannounced fashion?  We know that is the best way to find out if anything untoward is happening and that the rights of the workers are being protected in the way we hope they are, but we know they are not.</p></speech>

If we get information, or if the processors get some information or look at an employment permit and are not entirely happy with what they see, we would send that information to the inspectorate for it to undertake an inspection.  An operation was undertaken in the meat processing plants in 2019, I think.  It was a multi-agency operation, involving garda&iacute;, WRC inspectors, social welfare inspectors and, as far as I know but I am not entirely sure, Revenue officials.  Therefore, an operation was carried out in the meat processing sector at that time and I will get some information on that aspect for the Deputy.</p> <p>  Turning to the ineligible list, as has been said, that is part of our twice-yearly review.  We are guided by the evidence presented regarding where labour shortages are by the national skills bulletin, which identifies where there are skills shortages in the State.  In addition, we also get submissions from various sectors.  We then work with the relevant policy Department, which in the case of speech therapists would be the Department of Health, and with economic migration interdepartmental group to identify where the shortages are.  If there is evidence of a skills shortage in an area, we would then remove that category from the ineligible list and applicants would then be eligible for employment permits.</p></speech>

It was stated that there is still great demand in some high skills areas.  It seems likely that is in the IT sector, but it would be interesting, however, to see what is happening in other areas.</p> <p>  It was also mentioned that if an employer is found to be in breach of the conditions of an employment permit that it is then possible for the person coming in on that employment permit to make a change.  Will Ms Ward clarify how easy it is to do that?  I have heard anecdotal evidence that it is quite difficult to get that acknowledgement.  I wonder if that process can be streamlined to ensure that people cannot be trapped in conditions where the proper rules relating to workers' rights are not being applied.</p><p> My final question relates to family reunification rights.  I am interested in how it is decided who gets family reunification rights.  Is there unequal treatment between people who might have high skills and those who do not have such high skills but nonetheless come in on a permit?  Should we be moving to some level of equal treatment of different people in respect of family reunification rights?</p></speech>

Despite the Covid crisis, the numbers did not reduce.  We were able to reduce our backlog because we introduced an e-type of temporary permit arrangement with our colleagues in the Department of Justice.  We had a backlog of about 2,800 applications and that is down to less than 900 at the moment.</p> <p>  In terms of the sectors, 31% of the permits were in the health sector.  We have been prioritising those permits for processing since the Covid crisis commenced.  The next highest sector is the ICT sector.  About 28% of permits issued to it.  The next highest sector is the agricultural sector, which got 11% of the permits.  They are the three sectors with the highest number of permits issued in 2020.  The agricultural quota scheme is exhausted at this stage and there are no permits available for that pilot scheme at the moment.</p> <p>  Reunification is not really a matter for this permit.  It is a matter for our colleagues in the Department of Justice.  The only area we are involved in is the critical skills employment permit.  The additional benefits were added to that permit to seek to ensure that workers in occupations where there was a shortage in the State would settle here.  As I said to Deputy Stanton, as a result of a recommendation of the 2018 review, we intend to look at that area and it is definitely one we will examine.  If we make any changes to it, legislative change will not be required.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Walsh, assistant principal with responsibility for the employment permit operations, who should be able to deal with the question on whether there is an issue with changing employment permits within the 12-month period.</p></speech>

In those circumstances, a person can move on within the 12 months.  As Ms Ward said, normally, there is no restriction on changing employment after 12 months, but the protection is there to try to strike a balance for both the employer and the employee.</p></speech>

If someone is in a somewhat vulnerable position, are the witnesses happy that it is relatively easy to do this?  Would the Department consider issuing sectoral permits rather than tight permits so that a person would have a little bit more freedom within the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.417" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021021600002#H00500"><p>It is not that onerous to change.  The processor gets the information from the permit holder and he or she might contact the old employer.  It does happen that people move within the 12 months.  I do not think it is a huge issue to be able to change, but if Deputy Bruton has any instances he wishes to raise, we would be happy to have a look at them.</p> <p>  Regarding sectoral permits, what is covered in the general scheme is that we have a vacancy-led scheme.  The primary policy of the Government is to recruit from within Ireland and across the EEA and it is only in circumstances where an employer cannot find the available resources within the State or the EEA that he or she can recruit from outside the EEA.  For every employment permit, there is a written contract of employment.  Moving to a sectoral-type arrangement would completely change the way the permit system is operated, but it could also serve to undermine the need to ensure that the domestic labour market or the market within the EEA is first tested before we move to other areas.  It could also lead to increased challenges in terms of protecting the rights of the migrant worker.  At the moment, a worker has a written contract of employment which details salary, the maximum hours worked, etc.  We looked to other jurisdictions to see whether they had a similar sectoral type of arrangement and we could not identify any jurisdiction that had such an arrangement.  In all jurisdictions across Europe and outside Europe the employer-employee link is in place.  The only exception is Germany where it is linked to the type of occupation covered by the higher and critical skills employment permit and when a job is found the link between the employer and employee is put in place.  In Australia, very specific qualifications are required for it and, again, it is linked to occupations in very remote areas of Australia.  We could not find a jurisdiction where it was operating and working.</p></speech>

I wish to ask her about the various sectors where the work permits operate.  Let us go back to the meat industry again.  Does the Department take into account the profitability of the sector before granting work permits?</p></speech>

I will repeat the question.  Does the Department take into account the profitability of a particular sector before it agrees to introduce work permits?  I mention the meat industry because we know, for example, that the biggest company in the industry had a turnover of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019 and the second biggest company had a turnover of &euro;2.2 billion.  This is a massively wealthy industry.  Why not encourage the industry to pay better wages rather than just allow it to recruit people, as my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, said, at just above minimum wage?</p></speech>

We are guided by the research undertaken by the skills and labour market research unit, the National Skills Bulletin, the Vacancy Overview report, reviews, submissions, public consultation and the input of relevant policy Departments and the economic migration interdepartmental group.  We look at where the labour challenges are.  We seek to ensure that where occupations are eligible for an employment permit, that is based on evidence that there are genuine labour challenges in terms of recruitment and that it is not linked to terms and conditions or retention issues.  Sectors make submissions to the twice-yearly review on an ongoing basis and unless the evidence is there and we are satisfied by the whole-of-government approach that the shortages are genuine and there are not any structural issues, we will not remove an occupation from the eligible list.  It is an evidence-based system.  The ESRI did some research through the European Migration Network in 2015, which found that Ireland is one of the leaders in Europe in linking labour market intelligence to our economic migration policy.</p></speech>

What I asked was whether the Department examines the profitability of firms.  It is well known that these factories are hugely profitable.  In fact, their profits are often hidden offshore.  Does the Department gather data on the profitability of these firms before sanctioning work permits because my concern is pretty simple; it is that rather than go down the work permit route, these firms should be paying a decent wage, which frankly they are not doing at the moment?  They are certainly not paying a living wage.</p></speech>

We want to make sure that those labour and skills challenges are genuine and relate not to terms and conditions of employment but to genuine skills shortages in the labour market or the particular sector.  That is where we focus our attention.</p></speech>

It is an extraordinarily low sum of money.</p><p>I certainly could not live on that amount of money per week, yet the Department seems happy to sanction work permits at that rate for one of the most profitable industries in the country.  There is something distinctly unfair about that.</p><p> I will move on because I am conscious of time.  The nice word used in this Bill is "agility".  It is a very popular word in business sectors at the minute.  Can Ms Ward tell me how this proposed Bill will increase agility for the workers concerned?</p></speech>

Is there a danger of regulatory capture?  I do not see any evidence of agility for workers in the proposed legislation.  I see that a whole host of recommendations was made two years and Ms Ward has confirmed today that each one of them has been rejected.  There has been no increase in the number of workplace inspectors, which is far too low.  No role has been given to the Labour Court in setting wages.  There has been no openness and transparency on how those wages are set.  Does Ms Ward understand my concerns?</p></speech>

This will benefit both the employer and employees.  A general employer permit is initially given for a two-year period and then can be renewed for up to three years.  At the moment, the employee has to go through the same application process as if he or she was applying for a permit in the first place.  We hope to streamline that process so it will be quicker for both the employee and employer.  We will simply ensure the conditions on which the permit was received continue to be in place.</p> <p>  We also are considering the duration of employment permits.  For example, in respect of the critical skills employment permit, we hope to move that to regulations.  One has to have a two-year employment permit before applying for a critical skills employment permit.  As I stated earlier, it is our premium permit.  However, if an occupation is on the critical skills list but the contract on offer is for less than two years, the permit holder generally has to apply for a general employment permit.  Such people then do not get the attendant benefits attached to the critical skills permit of immediate family reunification and immediate and broad access of their spouses and partners to the labour market.  We are hoping to have a duration of one year, which would allow those permit holders to come in and to bring in their families immediately. </p> <p>  These are examples of some of the flexibilities we hope to bring into the system.</p></speech>

I am concerned because we will come into a period of mass unemployment at the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am concerned the Department still seems determined to have recourse to these work permits in that situation.</p> <p>  The following point was made in a committee two years ago.  If there is a case for seasonal workers, surely someone in the sector should have to go to a forum of the State where he or she can explain why that is needed.  Why is there a lack of transparency in that process?  I will give a final example.  There are masses of students looking for summer work at the minute.  Why are we not first giving those people the opportunities to take up these seasonal jobs, as opposed to reaching for the work permits?</p></speech>

I know, from talking to the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI, and others that the system is open to a level of abuse.  As I have said, many employers are fine employers who do a good job and look after their workforce and there are some who are not.  This scheme is probably like manna from heaven for those employers who are not, for all the reasons we have discussed.  I refer in particular to the issue of the introduction of seasonal work permits because that simply means the workers will be here for a much shorter time.  It makes it virtually impossible to organise them and so on.  Ms Ward is aware of all of this.</p> <p>  Employers may breach the rules by, for example, holding a worker's passport, paying below the minimum rate or making reductions for accommodation.  I have seen some of that accommodation and it is disgusting that anyone would take any money from meagre wages for it.  What happens to an employer who breaches the rules?  Do they go onto a list whereby they will not be issued with work permits again?  Is it a wrist slap?  Are they referred to the Garda?  What happens to them?  How many of them are there?  Can we be sure the flexibilities Ms Ward referred to will not be extended to them again if they have proven themselves to be poor employers or if they have breached the rules?</p></speech>

The WRC obviously tries to get employers to comply but it can and does take employers to court for breaches of the employment permit legislation.  If an employer is found in breach of the employment permit legislation or other employment rights legislation, that employer, upon conviction, can be precluded from applying for an employment permit for five years.  They would not be able to apply for a permit for up to five years.</p></speech>

In my opinion and experience, breaches of this nature happen to low-paid workers.  They happen to the most vulnerable workers whose first language is not English.  It is fine if Ms Ward does not have information on the specific industry.  I will welcome that information when we get it.  However, does this happen, for the most part, to workers who have degrees?  I know the term "low skilled" is used in a pejorative way.  I am not suggesting Ms Ward uses it in a pejorative way but it can be used as such.  Clearly, these workers are essential.  We would not be revising the system to ensure we had them if we did not need them.  It is my opinion that breaches are happening to low-paid workers.

I will not go through all of the reasons but Senator Gavan and I have personal experience of trying to do that.  It is extremely tough.  Clearly, if I am coming from another country, I will not be familiar with my rights and entitlements as a worker in this State.  Who has the responsibility to advise them of their entitlements to the minimum wage or their other legal entitlements?</p><p>Is there a check on whether workers have been informed of their rights and entitlements in a language that they understand?  One of the issues raised at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response was the practice of distributing health and safety announcements and information in English but not in a language that is easily understood by the workforce.  It is one thing to hand employees a piece of paper that lists their rights and entitlements but another thing entirely to hand them a piece of paper that contains information they can actually read. </p></speech>

I know the WRC has information in 11 languages but many workers do not have English as their first language and they are reading information in English.  I will not get into how workers are kept separate in these places.  However, they are not really being directed to the WRC if that information is not in a language that is easily understood.  Can consideration be given to ensuring people have access to information on their minimum terms in a language they can understand?  While it is welcome that they get this information, if it is not in a language they can understand, it is the same as not getting it.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, I do not know how we would even arrange that operationally.  We issued 16,500 permits last year.  It would be extremely onerous to print permits in different languages.  We have never had any complaints from people saying they had not received the information.  The website is clearly available and people can log on to get that information.  I respectfully disagree with the Deputy.  Permit holders do get information relating to their rights.</p></speech>

I want to follow up on the point raised by Deputy O'Reilly.  As a union organiser, my personal experience with meat factories is that these people cannot translate their contracts.  They have no one available to do it for them.  They do not understand English in many cases so even finding the website is not practical for them.  The factories actively discourage workers, to the point of firing them, from joining a union or seeking union support.  Can Ms Ward understand the reasons for my concern about the likelihood that these people would be exploited?</p> <p>  I will give an example.  At the end of a 39-hour week, the boss man might say to an employee, "You have to do overtime, regardless of whether you want to, because we are your employer and you are not allowed work anywhere else."  That happens.  By the way, it is not overtime paid at time and a half or double time; it is flat rate overtime.  Does Ms Ward understand my concerns?</p></speech>

It is our view that because we provide them with the information on the permit, they have access to the WRC which has all the information in the various languages.  They can access the information they need to ensure their rights and entitlements are protected.  We are always open to suggestions on how we might improve our system.  If the Deputy has any suggestions on how we might improve or that might assist to better disseminate information, we would be delighted to take them on board.</p></speech>

Why not ensure, before the Department issues work permits, that there is a collective bargaining agreement in place between the employer and the trade union of the workers' choice?  That is a simple way to ensure there is a third party to protect the workers.  To be frank, and we have gone through the numbers, the WRC does not have the inspectors or the time and resources to do this.  I can tell Ms Ward from first-hand experience that it is not happening.  Why not ensure, as a bottom line, that there is a collective bargaining agreement in place?  That is something an employer can easily put in place to ensure protection for workers.</p><p>One of the big features of this system is employment agencies using work permits.  Ms Ward said she had read the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland report published last year, and I am delighted she has.  The report stated that an emerging feature of employment in Ireland was EU workers being employed through agencies rather than directly by meat processing companies.  The companies, it continued, were able to deflect responsibility on to agencies and <i>vice versa</i>.  While this is not directly related to work permits, it describes a work space that is highly different from the traditional way that Ms Ward and I have experienced work, for the most part.</p><p>Ms Ward will be relieved to hear this is my final question.  She will acknowledge that these are essential workers.  Why is it okay for her Department to sanction, for these essential workers who are keeping our country going, a rate of pay as low as &euro;22,000 a year?  I find that offensive.  Surely to God, after all we have come through on Covid, everyone, regardless of party politics, and everyone in Ms Ward's Department would acknowledge that the figure of &euro;22,000 is disgracefully low.  At the very least, do these workers not deserve a living wage?  Is it not within the scope of the broader Department to ensure that this happens as a recommendation?</p></speech>

EU workers come here under freedom of movement in the EU treaties.  Under the employee permit system, employment agencies are not allowed to apply, and are precluded from applying, for employment permits for non-EEA migrant workers.  For the employment permit system, there has to be a direct employer-employee relationship in place.</p> <p>  In relation to remuneration for employment permits, it is a matter of striking a balance between ensuring the employee is attracted to work in the State, while also ensuring it does not have a disruptive impact on the domestic labour market.  That is the balance we strike in relation to remuneration.</p></speech>

He is protected by absolute privilege regarding the presentation he makes to the committee.  That means that he has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything he says at the meeting.  However, he is expected not to abuse the privilege and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if his statements are potentially defamatory to any identifiable person or entity, he will be directed to discontinue his remarks and it is imperative that he comply with any such direction. </p> <p>  Our meeting this afternoon is to engage with the Minister regarding consideration of the report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and matters raised in previous correspondence concerning the report and the destruction of records and audio files by the commission of investigation.  I invite the Minister to now deliver his opening statement and that will be followed by a question and answer session with members.  I will call on the members in the order in which they indicate, if they wish to start doing so now.  I also remind members that they have a full seven minutes for their contributions today, but I will have to cut everyone off at the end of that time.  I call the Minister.  </p></speech>

The committee provided a comprehensive list of topics for discussion during today&rsquo;s engagement.  I will endeavour to address some of these matters in my opening statement,  but we have a lengthy period of time today to discuss these issues in significant detail.</p> <p>  The Government published the commission&rsquo;s report a month ago.  It was followed by an immediate State apology from An Taoiseach for the wrongs that we as a nation visited on our most vulnerable citizens and that was an acknowledgement of the fault on the part of the State and its failings regarding these vulnerable citizens.  I know and understand that many survivors have been disappointed and angered by the report, finding its tone and language cold and overly legalistic.  I recognise that some of the conclusions, which were grounded in a legalistic approach and analysis of 1.3 million pages of evidence, can feel removed from the grief, the breach of human rights and the trauma of the lived experience of many former residents.</p> <p>  I recognise that, and I am committed to continuing engagement with survivors on ways in which we can bear witness to their experiences through future research and memorialisation.  To that end, I am also clear that the report does not represent a conclusion.  Rather, it represents the backdrop for the State&rsquo;s apology to those who have suffered and it also represents a starting point from which we can seek to move forward and the State can seek to start rebuilding that relationship of trust so badly broken by the State's failure.  It is imperative that we build, without delay, on the spirit in which the apology was given and take action and make appropriate reparation.  The Government has accepted the report&rsquo;s recommendations and has responded with a commitment to develop a strategic action plan spanning 22 ambitious actions.  Initial work is already under way on the action plan and across many of the actions.</p> <p>  Access to birth and early life information, including the birth certificate, is a fundamental issue and a top priority for me as Minister.  My officials are working intensively with the Office of the Attorney General to advance information and tracing legislation, with a view to having the heads of Bill ready by March or early April.  I look forward to engaging with the committee on this crucial legislation.</p> <p>  I have established the interdepartmental group on restorative recognition.  This interdepartmental group has already held its first meeting on 4 February and it has been tasked with reporting back to me by the end of April.  It has also been asked to develop detailed proposals for a restorative recognition scheme.  The work of this interdepartmental group must take account of the specific groups identified by the commission, but importantly is not limited to those groups.  Its work will be underpinned by a human rights focus and informed by strong stakeholder consultation and an understanding of criticisms made of previous schemes.</p> <p>  Restorative recognition encompasses more than just financial compensation.  One strand of the scheme will involve the provision of an enhanced medical card similar to that provided for former residents of Magdalen laundries and the interdepartmental group proposal will also encompass this element.  In the immediate term, counselling services are available for all former residents through the national counselling service in the HSE.  This includes telephone and face-to-face counselling through an established nationwide network of counselling locations.  Additional resources have been made available to the national counselling service to support this commitment.  Access will also be provided to a patient advocacy liaison support service.  A targeted programme of health research will also be undertaken to assist and inform the development of future service provision for former residents, and preparatory work on this research study has begun. </p> <p>  I am also working to advance other actions committed to by Government.  For example, my Department has appointed an archivist to lead the work on the preservation of, and public access to, the relevant records within my Department.  My officials have also initiated work with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and the Irish Research Council, IRC, on the creation of several scholarships in memory of the children who died in institutions.  In collaboration with the IRC, we are funding a research project in the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, relating to terminology, representation and misrepresentation and this work will shortly commence.</p> <p>  The overarching theme for all this work is a commitment to progressing it in a survivor-centred manner, characterised by continuous engagement with former residents and their representative groups, as well as with survivors living around the world.  This can only happen through an enhanced model of engagement, with the requisite scale to support the multiplicity of voices and perspectives in this space.  I am committed to establishing such a model, following consultation.  I met with the collaborative forum twice in the past two weeks, and this was one of the issues which we discussed. </p> <p>  Finally, I am conscious that one of the items referenced in the invitation for today&rsquo;s meeting was the deletion of audio recordings relating to the confidential committee of the commission and I note that I have written separately to the committee on this matter.  I am sure we will discuss that issue further in the question and answer session.  I look forward to further discussions today, especially concerning working with the committee in respect of implementing the significant 22 action points I referred to earlier, which I and this Government believe will make a significant and tangible difference to survivors.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#A00900"><p>I thank the Minister for appearing before the committee today and for his ongoing engagement on this matter and the important work we have ahead of us.</p><p>Like many of the survivors and advocacy groups, I am deeply uncomfortable and disappointed with how the mother and baby homes report has been handled to date, both in terms of the lack of consultation with survivors and previously the rush to get the legislation through the House, the leaking of the report to the Sunday newspapers in advance of its publication and also the continuing issues relating to the access to records.  Having spoken to the members of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance, I wish to raise their concerns that their voices are now being dismissed.</p><p> How does the Minister intend to recover the testimonial evidence?  Are duplicates available?  When was he aware that the tapes would be destroyed?  Survivors indicate that they were not aware before, during or after their interviews that their recordings would be destroyed.  They signed no paperwork to that effect.</p><p> There is obvious targeting of survivors by members of the legal profession.  It is depressing to note that advertisements are being placed in newspapers inviting those affected to contact them.  I have been contacted by Breeda Murphy, PRO of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance.  This practice is illegal.  How does the Minister intend to challenge such behaviour?  I ask him to discuss this with his Cabinet colleagues to ensure the practice is stamped out and survivors can get on with their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I recognised during the discussion on the database legislation that I had not reached out enough to survivor groups prior to that.  Following the passage of the legislation I met approximately 50 survivors via phone calls, which is a substantial number, during November and December and I continue to meet them.</p> <p>  In the context of the publication of the report, in the past two weeks I met twice with the collaborative forum, which is a body appointed to represent the diverse groups of survivors.  We arranged to have two meetings because I understood that there would be a significant amount of material on which we would need to engage with them.  I will meet other survivor groups in the future to discuss the various elements of the action plan.  I am also aware that in the medium and long term there needs to be a better mechanism in place for engagement between survivors and the Government.  We have committed to an enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.  I made a suggestion to the collaborative forum.  I am engaging with it in the first place as the body that is currently in place and following that engagement we will broaden the discussion.  I am very much aware that the scale of the actions that have been set out by the Government needs some sort of external voice to ensure that I, successor Ministers or Ministers in other Departments are adhering to the commitments.  That is very important.  We do not have the mechanism to do that at the moment.</p> <p>  As regards the deletion of records, I became aware of the deletion of the taped testimonies of those who had given personal accounts before the confidential committee when I read the report.  It was stated in one of the chapters that outlined how the commission functioned.  There had been a reference in the debate in the Seanad to some deletion of tapes by one of the Senators who said it was stated clearly in the text of the report what the commission had done.  In the report the commission indicated that it had done this in compliance with what it understood were its obligations under data protection law.  I know that since the report has come out people who gave testimony before the confidential committee have argued that they did not understand it as the commission did.  The commission circulated a document that stated it would seek permission to tape the personal accounts before the confidential committee.  That document did not reference deletion.  The commission has stated in all correspondence with me that it asked for consent for the deletion of these tapes.  However, I acknowledge a number of survivors have come forward to say their consent was not sought.  It is problematic when survivors say they are not being listened to.  The Deputy raised the case of a survivor with whom I and the Department have engaged who says they are not being listened to.</p> <p>  In the context of what we can do next, I have outlined a range of actions in terms of the action plan but what is fundamental is to ensure that we can take what actions are possible, - as Minister and soon as data controller of the archive - that are within the power of the data controller.  People have a range of rights under GDPR.  One of those rights that I have mentioned on a number of occasions is a right to rectification, which is if a person feels there is incomplete information about him or her on a particular file, he or she can seek to have that rectified.  In terms of the very significant responsibility that my Department will have as data controller, we have been looking into the right to rectification to see whether it provides a mechanism.  The lived experience of survivors is crucial both in terms of what is in the archive, but also how we as a country remember what happened in these institutions.  I also believe that in the context of the national records and memorial centre there is a very real capacity to use the personal accounts of those who gave them to the confidential committee but also the much wider range of survivors because, as we know, 550 gave their personal accounts before the confidential committee but there is a much bigger number overall and I believe we can use them as part of the response.</p></speech>

I wish to quote from the statement she issued last week.</p> <blockquote> 	As many will be aware, I am the child of a mother and baby home. I was born in Bessborough Mother and Baby Home.  This is a fact I never shied away from.  I have come to know my birth mother and consider myself to be very fortunate. But I know there are many who have not been so fortunate. </blockquote> <p>She goes on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	It&rsquo;s almost a contradiction for me to issue an apology on behalf of an organisation that I was myself a survivor of; and now a member of.  But I want all survivors to know that I mean this truly and sincerely.  I know that while these actions took place in the not too distant past, as a society we have transformed entirely.  But we must never forget the part we played in this painful past, never forget what happened and ensure it never happens again. </blockquote> <p>I want to acknowledge her words because it is important to listen to somebody who is a public representative who was born in a home.  She wants a process and wants us to move on, but the process must be a robust one.  That is the reason we are here today.</p><p>My first question for the Minister is a technical one.  Are the minutes of the collaborative forum recorded?  &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#B00400"><p>I have attended two meetings with the collaborative forum.  The minutes of the two meetings will be recorded and will be provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#B00500"><p>The second question relates to narrative.</p><p>The Minister, I think it is fair to say, has described the language of the executive summary as being cold.  In the absence of us having recourse to questioning the members of the commission - they have refused invitations to be here and I am not going to pass judgment on that - the Minister is the person in the firing line for questions on the narrative.  The process of correcting the narrative has yet to be fleshed out.  If I understood him correctly, what he is saying is that through the interdepartmental process that he is going to seek some mechanism that he has called a right to rectification.  I would like to know the following, in very simple terms.  Will he consult with external bodies, such as the Collaborative Forum on Mother and Baby Homes, about what that will mean in real terms for people like the following?  Today, I spoke to a lady that I will call Mary.  She said to me that she gave evidence to the commission, not the confidential committee.  She said that she did receive her transcript.  She said it was reflected in report but she tells me that there were inaccuracies.  Normally, politicians are good judges of character and when I spoke to this person today I knew well within a minute or two that this was a reasonable, rational person who, crucially, did not give evidence to the confidential committee, she gave it to the commission but there are inaccuracies.  No matter how small or big those inaccuracies are, they are inaccuracies.  What can I tell this person in respect of a process that the Minister will now create in the absence of, we assume, the commission not being reconstituted again although we would support calls for that?  What process can that person rely upon now to ensure that her story is accurately reflected in this report?</p><p> The Minister, dare I say it, has to give a simple, clear answer in respect to the right of rectification.  Will there be a restorative process?  Will he open up a whole chapter again in respect of people such as I have described?  There are many of them out there, we all have testimony of it and the Minister has acknowledged those people and the fact that there has been no correct interpretation of what they said to the confidential committee and the commission.  What will the Minister do to ensure that the narrative is corrected for people?  We cannot talk about burials legislation, and information and tracing, until there is confidence that the narrative has been corrected.    </p></speech>

On a point of clarity, the interdepartmental group, IDG, is not related to the right to rectification.  That is dealing with restorative recognition, the financial payments.</p> <p>  As regards the immediate avenues for the individual who contacted the Deputy, the commission's archive will move over to my Department fully by 28 February, as we know, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, applies to that.  Any individual who believes that they have personal information within the archive is entitled to rely on all of the rights of GDPR, including the right to rectification.  That person can then contact the information management unit that my Department has set up specifically to deal with the subject access requests, ask for the information and if they feel there are inaccuracies then look at the use of rectification, or other rights within GDPR to rectify the specific issues as regards their particular personal account.</p></speech>

Those figures are being adjusted and that is part of the work of the interdepartmental group.  As I have said before, it has been given a very tight timeframe to get back because I am aware that I want to provide these benefits to survivors as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I know he is in a difficult position because he is answering questions on behalf of the commission.  That is unfortunate because my preference would have been that we could have put our questions to the commission.  They has declined to come in and in their absence I will put some questions to the Minister on the work that was undertaken.</p> <p>  The commission's report specifically states that 550 witnesses were asked for permission to record their evidence and then all such recordings were destroyed.  Section 43 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 says: "all evidence received by and all documents created by or for the commission" have to transfer over to the Minister.  We are in a situation where there was evidence recorded.  The Commission states that consent was given.  There is no record of that consent and some survivors are saying that they did not give that consent.  So there is no evidence of such consent being given.  With the information that we know now, does the Minister believe that the commission was within its legal remit to destroy this data?  Has he sought legal advice on that?   </p></speech>

Someone is looking into this and gathering information on this matter.  It is clear that this is a very time-limited and time-sensitive situation, as the commission will be dissolved in a few weeks' time.  The Minister is still trying to establish the legality or illegality of its action.  The survivors have said they did not give consent and many have gone to the Garda and the Data Protection Commission, DPC, about this.  There is an obvious need to provide time to allow survivors to get answers to these questions and to allow for any examination or investigations to take place.  I have asked this of the Minister before now but things have moved quite quickly in this regard.  Will he please consider extending the term of the commission?  The commission previously sought to extend the time provided for the provision of its reports and that time was granted because the commission sought it.  The Government has extended the timeframe for which the commission was operational because the commission and the Government wanted it.  This time, the survivors want more time.  Will the Minister please extend the commission's remit by one year to allow his questions and the questions of the Attorney General, the DPC, the Garda and survivors to be answered?</p></speech>

The biggest concern for me is the transfer of the archive to my Department.  I have set out on a number of occasions how my Department has undertaken a very significant amount of work to prepare for the transfer of the archive, in order that we can properly address the subject access requests that we are going to get and provide significant personal information to people who have personal information within the archive.  We all regard that as a positive step.  One of the considerations we have to look at is that, if the commission's lifespan is extended for the purposes of an investigation by the DPC or other bodies, in order to be able to answer that investigation the commission would have to have its archive because the DPC and other bodies would be looking at the material contained within the archive.</p></speech>

That is unless it is on a computer somewhere and the Minister has already sought that information.  This is the problem.  The Minister stated that this did not represent a conclusion but it will represent a conclusion because once the commission is dissolved, there will be no answers for people.  This will just be swept under the carpet again and we cannot allow that to happen.</p></speech>

If that were the case and it still had access to its files, we would not have provided the archive and the commission would still be holding on to all the personal information.  As we know, the commission has not undertaken subject access requests, SARs, up to this point.  We are first looking to ensure survivors can get access to their personal information, which I am committed to doing in the context of the information management unit set up by my Department.  In the context of the audio material being destroyed, we are also looking to provide a right to rectification and, again, my Department has put some time into ascertaining how that could happen.  We can get a better outcome for survivors in the context of access to information and potential use of rectification in a GDPR compliant way.</p></speech>

This an important point and I hate to have to do this but we have gone over time.  I call Senator Seery Kearney.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#D01100"><p>I thank the Minister for being here.  I find it hard to fathom how the commission of investigation arrived at some of the statements and findings of fact that it did, as well as the language it used.  Given the commission members' qualifications, experience and knowledge, I cannot comprehend how they made some of their statements at all and in some cases without qualifying or contextualising them.  I equally do not understand their methodology.  I have conducted numerous investigations over the last number of years and I always have a methodology that requires verification by contributors of their statements before I can make findings of fact out of them.  We are dealing today with the destruction of the audio recordings.  I completely understand deleting the audio recordings where there is a transcript but in the absence of that, which is the purpose of making the recording, I do not understand how that has come about.  I acknowledge that I heard about this during the Seanad debate on this matter and it did register with me.  Additional hurt has been caused and I acknowledge that.  It is unfathomable that the commission members were not minded to the implications of what they did.</p> <p>  There have been calls to extend the life of the commission in order that we can have accountability for the anomalies and the, at times, downright hurtful absurdities involved.  As desirable as that is, I am not confident that it is the way forward.  One of the big concerns is that we might go to all the trouble of extending the life of the commission and then the members could just resign.  We would then have an empty commission with no way of questioning and no method around it.  It is an independent statutory body of finite duration.  It made flawed or very weak findings of fact when stronger findings could have been made and there are mistakes that clearly need to be rectified.  Should we return to it or run it all over again?  That would cause significant delay in the release of information, access to information and the Department's control of that information and anything like that would not be acceptable.  If the report were amended or we were to run it again and have it say the things I believe it should say and make the suggestions it could make, the key question is whether that would alter how the Minister and the Government responded.  There are 22 action points.  If we had a different report that drew absolute conclusions, as people would want it to and as could have been drawn, would that have strengthened the response or changed how the Government is responding to it?  I am hoping to hear that it would not.  The Government has been in a process of listening to survivors and their families and has taken part in the collaborative forum so in that context, the response the Government has given has been the strongest one possible.</p> <p>  We then come down to a number of key questions.  How will we ensure that justice is seen to be done by the Government as regards telling people's stories, getting them on the record and being heard?  How will the State validate that?  That needs to be done in an official manner whereby we listen to and archive the stories and make them available to the public.  We must validate that by our actions in order that we have the opportunity to call out the humanity, show leadership and facilitate a healing of sorts.  When will we have the legislation on access to information and tracing?  What sort of timeline is there around that?  What timelines are in place as regards recognition, tax relief on inheritance, care packages and supports?  That would give reassurance that we are progressing with the matters over which the State has control.  What progress has the Government made with the institutions and seeking contributions from the religious orders?</p><p>We also discussed the Minister contacting GlaxoSmithKline.  Where are we at in that regard?  On the matter of the audio tapes, what actions can we take to ensure that the contributors, not only to the confidential committee but wider than that, will have the opportunity to have their stories told and on the record of the State?  I would appreciate answers to those questions.</p></speech>

Like her, I acknowledge the additional hurt and anger that these actions have caused to survivors.  In terms of the actions that I, as Minister, and the Government might take now, foremost in my mind is how we can most benefit survivors.  I believe we can do that through the provision of a well-resourced unit that can give them the access to the information many of them have sought for decades and in the context of answering subject access requests, SARs, in a manner that is compatible with GDPR, aligned with the potential rectification elements that we can apply as well.  That is crucial to giving survivors information that we do not have.  It is key.  We will provide from the archive information that they do not have and we will buttress that for groups of people outside of this particular group of survivors through the information and tracing legislation.  I discussed this a number of times during the debate on the database legislation.  We now have a commitment to heads of Bill being available by March or early April.  Regarding the scale of that legislation, that is an extremely tight timeline, but we have put in additional resources with the support of the Attorney General's office.  We have external counsel working on that legislation.  Once the heads are ready, we can bring to this committee for extensive debate.  Central my approach to that is the right of an individual to access personal information, including birth certificates and early life information.  That is the position of Government on this particular issue.  It is a GDPR-centred approach, not an approach anchored in previous drafts of legislation in this particular area.</p> <p>  The Senator referenced engagement with the congregations.  I have written to them and there are a number of meetings with some of the congregations in place.  She also referenced GlaxoSmithKline.  I will write to the company and ask that it reflect on the chapter on vaccination and the lack of an ethnical framework and its breach of the regulatory framework in terms of how vaccination trials took place.  I hope it will respond on that question.  I have the ability to do that because of the content of the report.  I can speak to the religious organisations and ask them to contribute to restorative recognition because we have the evidence from the report that 9,000 babies and children died in the institutions that they were running.  We have clear evidence that GlaxoSmithKline breached ethical and regulatory standards.  There are very legitimate criticisms of language that have been put forward, particularly about the executive summary and also other parts of the report, but the report gives the Government the basis upon which many of the 22 action points can be advanced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister for attending.  I have two questions for him now and I may come in again later if there is an opportunity to do so.</p> <p>  The commission of investigation terms of reference required it to establish a confidential committee to provide a forum for people who were formerly resident in the institutions under investigation or who worked in these institutions during a relevant period to provide accounts of their experience in these institutions, in writing or orally, as informally as possible given the circumstances.  The Clann Project and others have argued that the destruction of the audio files is, as already mentioned, a breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 and section 31 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which states that it is an offence for a person to destroy information in any form relating to matters within a commission's terms of reference before it is dissolved.  This commission is not dissolved yet.  We have heard from witnesses that the report does not reflect the severity of their experiences and that it is not an adequate record of the testimonies they provided.  More than 550 witnesses gave evidence to the confidential committee.  The Minister has defended the commission's decision to destroy the audio files on the basis that it was done to protect people who wanted to speak in confidence to the inquiry.  My questions follow on from Deputy Whitmore's questions.  When did the Minister seek the advice of the Attorney General on this matter in terms of the commission's responsibility under the Data Protection Act 2018 and Commissions of Investigation Act 2004?  Did he do so before or after the audio files were destroyed?  </p> <p>  My next question relates to a matter that comes within the remit of the Minister's Department.  On page 11 of the report of the confidential committee, it is stated that an electronic repository of information was set up to record the information provided by witnesses to the confidential committee.  This repository contains the application form of the witness and the account of the experience described by the witness to the committee.  The commission proposes to redact the names and other identifying information before submitting this repository as part of the commission's archives to the Minister.  Unless the witnesses wants his or her name retained, the person's full story is retained in this process.  Only a full transcript of each person's oral evidence, anonymised where instructed, can meet the threshold of retaining the person's full story in the confidential committee process.  Can the Minister confirm whether a full transcript of each individual's oral evidence to the confidential committee was retained and submitted within the electronic repository of information submitted to his Department?</p></speech>

On the second question dealing with the issues covered in the database legislation passed by the Oireachtas last year, my understanding is that the documents that are referred to and protected under that legislation are summaries undertaken by those who were listening to the personal accounts before the confidential committee.  They are summaries of the individual personal accounts given by the 550 people who appeared before the confidential committee.  My understanding is that they are not a verbatim text of those meetings; they are a summary document.  That is my understanding of what is provided for and protected under the database legislation.</p> <p>  In regard to my engagement with the Attorney General on this issue, I do not have the specific date but two or three weeks ago I wrote to the Attorney General in the context of concerns that were being raised as regards the confidential committee and the status of the commission of investigation.  As well as my engagement with the Attorney General, I have engaged extensively with the Data Protection Commissioner to get an understanding of concerns that she had raised and on working with the Data Protection Commission to ensure that when the archive transfers to my Department its procedures are GDPR compliant.  My officials and I met with the Data Protection Commissioner a number of weeks ago to address issues around GDPR compliance in my Department going forward.  That is important.  I am very conscious of the need, once the archive transfers to my Department, to answer the subject access requests from survivors in a way that is GDPR compliant.</p></speech>

When was the decision made to summarise the personal testimonies provided orally rather than record them verbatim?</p><p>The testimonies and oral transcripts were not done verbatim - the Minister used that word.  When was that decision made?  Why was the decision made at that stage?  I do not understand why these important testimonies from witnesses were summarised.  Who made that decision?  What right had anyone to summarise another person's lived experience in the mother and baby homes?  I would be interested to find out the answer to that.</p></speech>

Neither me nor my predecessor could answer because all of those decisions on how the commission would operate were taken some years ago around the time of its establishment, I imagine.  They would not have been shared with the Department or with my predecessor.  That is the manner in which a commission of investigation operates.  It is set up as an independent body and is given in its terms of reference the power to apply its own internal workings.</p></speech>

The reports the Minister has are summaries and not verbatim or full testimonies of the oral hearings.  I believe that, in respect of what was said already and the dissolution of the commission, we need to resolve some of these matters at this time.  These are the questions people are getting in touch with us about.  They do not believe their testimonies have been reflected in the report.  The absence of something verbatim or a full transcript of oral testimony amounts to a big gap in the report.  It is something I will follow up on.</p></speech>

I have set out in my reply to other Deputies how the wider story of what happened in these institutions can be reflected in the memorial and records centre as well as other actions the Government is taking to ensure the real stories of people who were in these institutions get heard.  I imagine the Deputy will agree that is the most powerful element of the report.</p></speech>

All of us have many questions to ask.  I have been contacted by survivors in recent days looking for the commission to be extended because of all the unanswered questions.  I thought what one particular survivor wrote was really sad.  She said she was tired and she wanted her history.  I thought she deserved that.</p> <p>  Why were only 18 institutions covered by the commission's terms of reference?  The commission had five years.  The term was extended up to five years.  We all know there are county homes in our areas, including Carlow, in respect of which questions need to be answered.  It reminds me how if someone hands another person a book, the book is only half a book rather than a full book.  That is a major concern.</p> <p>  I understand the commission is an independent body.  However, I was disappointed that two members of the commission refused to attend our meeting.  I have concerns about that.  It is important that we get all our answers.</p> <p>  What efforts were made to trace and interview survivors in America, the UK and other countries?  We have a vast number of questions.  I have been asked that several times recently.</p> <p>  Other issues jump out at me.  Why did the commission recommend redress be given only to those who had spent more than six months in the mother and baby homes and only up to 1973?  We cannot have limits if we are to offer redress.</p> <p>  I have another question on unauthorised adoptions.  I have spoken with survivors who were wrapped in blankets, handed to an attendant on an airplane and flown 7,000 miles to be given away to a new family.  There were no paperwork or records.  We know that thousands of children were adopted in the USA without legal paperwork in the middle part of the previous century.  Why was this missing?  Why was even part of that not in the commission report?</p> <p>  I have concerns that there is no recommendation in the report that would honour the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Every child should have, as far as possible, the right from birth to know his or her parents and to preserve his or her own identify, including nationality, name and family relations.  To me, that is so important.</p> <p>  I welcome that we are bringing in legislation.  I believe it is important to ensure that legal and illegal adoptions can be traced.  This is a major issue and we have to get this right.</p> <p>  I wish to comment on one of the major questions I have been asking and everyone has been asking the same question today.  In October, we had a major vote on the mother and baby homes to protect files.  We were there to protect them, yet today we are being told that in the report from the commission information and recordings were destroyed.  Can the Minister explain what exactly we voted for in October when we voted to protect information on the mother and baby homes?  There has been confusion about this.  These questions need to be answered.  I call on him to come back to me on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#F00600"><p>I hear what the Deputy is saying about the constituent she spoke to who wants her history.  I believe that the information and tracing legislation we have committed to providing at rapid pace is the key element in giving people their history and in answering for so many people the questions of their birth, parents and early life information.  That is why the information and tracing legislation is central to the Government's response to the commission.  I believe by doing that we will meet the requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  Like her, I was not in the House when the terms of reference of the commission were set out.  I understand that originally the commission related to the 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes that were picked.  I gather they were picked because they were the homes where it was believed the greatest number of full records and files were available.  One issue we have been clear about in our response and in the consideration of the interdepartmental group is that all survivors of county homes are considered to part of what the Government is responding to.  This ties in to the second point made by the Deputy about the start of recognition and her concerns about the 1973 cut-off point.  The Government took an important decision when it set out the action points.  The decision was that the interdepartmental group would not be limited to simply looking at the three categories that the commission set out.  It can recommend the provision of redress for a wider category.  We recognised that concern held by the Deputy about the use of that arbitrary cut-off time.</p> <p>  Another important point relates to what we voted to protect last year.  When the commission wrote to my predecessor in January, it proposed to delete the database that links mothers and their children.  We voted to protect that database and the related records.  When SARs come to my Department, in less than one month the officials in my Department will be able to use that database to provide information for people who have been denied information up to this point.  I believe that is significant.</p></speech>

That is helpful information.  What about the efforts with survivors in America, the UK and other countries?  That is important.  I have been contacted by survivors.  I believe they feel they have been forgotten.  This has to be survivor-led.  I know the Minister understands that.  We have to ensure that the survivors are heard.  They have gone through enough hurt and pain and we cannot allow this again.  I call on him to give a guarantee that this will never happen to the survivors again.  We cannot leave them again.  They are so vulnerable and have gone through so much.</p></speech>

Some moved subsequently and some are out of the country as a result of the adoption practices that the Deputy described.  Some of these groups are represented on the collaborative forum.  At our latest meeting, we specifically discussed issues with regard to survivors living outside the country.  I will continue to engage.  I have committed to meeting groups from the UK and the USA to engage with them and get a sense from them of how the Government can better support them.</p></speech>

He said as much to us in the Seanad and said it again here.  We are all disappointed with the contradictions.  The executive summary does not relate to the testimony in a way.  It is cold, as the Minister rightly said.</p><p>This is an independent report, not a Government or Oireachtas report, but the Oireachtas now has responsibility to deal with it.  Is there a way that we as a Government and the Department can make an official statement about the executive summary stating that we accept the veracity of those testimonies and to give some solace to the women after the fact?  Nobody expected the report to give justice.  Justice will come in many different ways and justice for one survivor is not justice for other survivors.</p><p> Is there a structured mechanism to take in considerations of groups that are not part of the collaborative forum and to move to next steps, redress and all those recommendations?  Many groups choose not to be part of the collaborative forum.</p><p> Is there  a way that we can help and support women who had intellectual disabilities who had children in those mother and baby homes and still survive to this day?  Can an independent advocate be appointed?</p><p> My priority now, and the Minister has referred to this on several occasions, is the Act.  We are disappointed about the destruction of the tapes.  I would be interested to hear the opinion of the Attorney General on that.  We are not going to find out the methodology behind the report but let us look to the future and see how we can help these women.  The survivors are here and we need to act.  I would appreciate if we could start now and get the institutional burials legislation and the adoption legislation passed.  I reiterate how glad I am that we passed that legislation last year.  If we did not, it would be an entirely different conversation today.  We would have a blank database and the adoption and tracing legislation would be much more difficult.  It was difficult when some members of the committee voted against the protection of that database.</p><p> What have we been doing in the past while to move forward with recommendations and even to go beyond the recommendations and have a proper holistic approach to taking care of the needs of these women, survivors and adoptees?  What is being done to make sure that we hold up this period of our past and say that this will not be done again and that we cannot let it happen again?  What is being done so that we stand not in front of or behind the survivors but beside them to say that this is about them and their memorial?  How has the Department moved forward with that?  That is the priority and time is of the essence.</p></speech>

It is something that survivors have brought home to me with regard to being able to avail of the enhanced medical card or any sort of recognition scheme, and also the time to get the information that will be so valuable to them, which is why we all need to work swiftly together.  I want to work with this committee on the information and tracing legislation.  I have set out the timeframe for that.  There will be much work for all of us when that comes up for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The institutional burials Bill is coming before the committee soon.  I look forward to seeing what members have to say on that and I take an open mind to improving that Bill on foot of the pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>  The collaborative forum was picked by a good process to ensure that a wide range of interests was represented, but I think it would note itself that it does not represent everybody.  I have tried to engage with as many groups as I can but there is a limit to my ability to meet people because we know that there are so many groups in this sphere.  One proposal that I have spoken about, which is listed in the 22 action points, is the idea of a new method of stakeholder engagement in order that there is a better, resourced focal point for engagement between all the survivor groups and Government.</p> <p>  I had the experience of meeting 40 or 50 survivors in November and December, which was incredibly good, and they taught me so much.  Doing that on a sustained basis to know it has been done regularly and to keep tabs on Government to ensure that all 22 action points are being put in place requires something more structured and organised.  We have an idea about that in the Department but we will not have a monopoly on this issue and we are engaging with the collaborative forum on it.  The Senator spoke about the idea of an independent advocate for one group of survivors.  Perhaps there will be an advocate for a wider group of survivors, going beyond just women with an intellectual disability, as the Senator highlighted.</p></speech>

I am substituting for Senator Lynn Ruane.  The Minister will be aware from debates in the Seanad that Senator Ruane and I have strong concerns about the method of operation of the commission and especially about the confidential committee.  I want to focus on two sets of concerns.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned in his statement that he has no role or knowledge of the operational decisions taken by the commission.  Does he expect that when these documents and the archive are transferred to him that he will, at that point, have knowledge of the operational decisions taken by the commission?  Will he be given the answers or information that he needs about the processes employed by the commission in its work?  I say that in the context of the serious concerns about the confidential committee and the actions and decisions it took, which may be in breach of section 31 of the 2004 Act.  The 2015 statutory instrument that established the commission explicitly stated that the confidential commission should provide in its procedures for individuals who wish to have their identity remain confidential during the conduct of the commission.  The commission should provide for a consent-based exception for those who wished confidentiality rather than having the imposition of privacy, which seems to have been the practice.  In that context, will the Minister get the information that he needs?  Is he confident about that?  Will the Data Protection Commission get the answers that it needs about the processes?</p> <p>  I have mentioned the statutory instrument and the 2004 Act.  The most crucial aspect of EU law and the GDPR is the right to consent in processing.  Deletion is one of the strongest forms of processing in GDPR.  The right to rectification is also crucial, as others on the committee have highlighted.  Does the Data Protection Commission have the answers it needs from the commission of investigation?  Does the Minister or will the Minister have the information that he needs from the commission?  If he is not confident that he will have all of that information, does he not think that we may need to extend the terms so that the commission can be extended and be available to give that information as it might be required?</p> <p>  To follow on from Deputy Whitmore's point, he is in many cases receiving duplicates of at least half the files, which may not perhaps have been protected by him except for the changes that we made to the legislation.  Could he not still get copies of the archive and maintain the commission for a period so that it is available to answer these important questions?</p></speech>

She has flagged up the concerns about the operation of the confidential committee and my own reflection, having looked at the report, is that there are questions about the appropriateness of trying to accommodate an investigative, judicial process and a truth-telling process in one inquiry.  The difficulties of that have become apparent.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about details of the transfer of the archive of the commission.  We will be receiving all information, including information on all of its administrative processes.  All of that will be transferring to me, as part of the commission's archive.  I hope that the extent of that information will be such that it will be able to provide me and my officials with a full account of the actions that were taken by the commission.</p> <p>  The commission of investigation and the Data Protection Commissioner have been engaged in correspondence as regards the procedures undertaken by the commission.  I know that within that correspondence, and in the commission's correspondence with the committee, it has sought to draw attention to the fact that it believes its processes have been legitimate.  I have written to the commission to urge it to engage as fully as possible with the Data Protection Commissioner because I am conscious that it is important that clarity is provided on the various processes that were undertaken by the confidential committee.  As I said when I met the Senator on this issue, I have also engaged directly and met with the Data Protection Commissioner to reassure her that we were urging the commission to engage fully with her office and also in the context of ensuring that the actions we take when the archive transfers to the Department at the end of the month are conducted fully in compliance with the general data protection regulation, GDPR.</p></speech>

There is a legal responsibility and potential legal investigation.  Section 45 of the 2004 Act states that if a tribunal is established to inquire into a matter that was within the commission's terms of reference, all evidence received by and all documents created by or for the commission should be made available to it either by the specified Minister, who would be this Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, if the commission has been dissolved, or by the commission if it is not already dissolved.  It seems that the Act envisaged a situation in which a tribunal was to take place and a commission had not been dissolved.  I am conscious of the investigations and tribunals we may well need regarding vaccinations, forced and unauthorised adoptions, and potential criminal or legal investigations.  Will the commissioners be available?  Will those who were involved, for example, in the tasks of the confidential committee and the summarising of testimonies be available?  Will the hard materials, the hard drives and electronic devices used, be available to the Minister if he has to give them to a future tribunal, or indeed if he has to provide them in respect of a criminal investigation or a statutory investigation by the Data Protection Commissioner?  I ask those questions because those are crucial issues and the Minister might answer them.  We will have opportunities to engage in the future on the information and tracing legislation.</p> <p>  I will also mention the redress scheme.  This points again to the fact that there must be no waivers or gagging orders.</p></speech>

The report from the commission was always destined to disappoint and has caused more upset and hurt than anybody would ever have wanted or intended.  It has also caused a lot of anger.  Its failure in tone, as the Minister has articulated, and failure to recognise basic human rights are what we have all found most objectionable on behalf of the survivors.  That is why we are all struggling with this and opposed to the acceptance of the report.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's point that there is value in the fact that the report provides evidence upon which the Government can act and upon which it has made 22 recommendations.  I accept and recognise that value and we all need to try to salvage something from this for the survivors.</p> <p>  We voted to protect the database and the records so that they could be transferred to the Minister's Department.  My colleagues and I would like to see that done as soon as possible.  Our only objective in wishing that to be promptly addressed is to allow survivors access to their own information so they can, hopefully, begin to reclaim their identities and begin to achieve some healing.</p> <p>  We wanted the State apology which was provided by the Taoiseach but the job now is about trying to deliver some justice.  The Minister has spoken about some of the actions that have already been taken.  Other speakers have alluded to the fact that the commission is being dissolved and its members are going to somehow disappear and not be available.  We invited them to come to the committee in a constructive way because we wanted to progress the issues and had serious questions about the report on behalf of survivors.  It is hugely frustrating and disappointing that they did not come before and engage with the committee.  We would ask the Minister, in his communication with the members of the commission before it is wound up, to specifically ask them to make themselves available on an ongoing basis, to contribute to the healing that has to take place and the effort to give some justice to the survivors.  They have given five years of their lives and work to produce the report but it really cannot end here and we would urge them not to allow that to happen.  I would also ask the Minister to ask the members of the commission to give a statement of the methodology that was used because it is not clear.</p> <p>  I will not repeat all of the questions about the destruction of the testimonies and statements but it is a serious matter.  The authorities that were charged with protecting evidence have a job to do.  Can the Minister advise the committee when he expects the Attorney General to respond on the questions he has asked and the advice he has sought on the legality of the actions that were taken in that regard?</p> <p>  I took from the Minister's language that he is going to ask the pharmaceutical companies to reflect when he contacts them.  I would ask him to go further.  I ask him to ask them to make a contribution and propose how they think they can make reparations, contribute to the healing and provide some justice to the survivors.</p><p>They have a role to play in that.</p><p> Regarding the information unit and resource being created, the sustainable, structured, survivor-centred approach that the Minister of State speaks of is very welcome, but how is the work on the establishment of a national archive progressing?</p></speech>

We all agree about the failure of language and tone.  When I first read the mother and baby homes report, I focused on the confidential committee.  If one takes away the executive summary, the level of hurt and trauma that emerges from the confidential committee will always stick with me when I think of the report.  It is the stories I read there that chilled us, as they did so many people, to our core.</p> <p>  The evidence that the Senator mentioned in the report, particularly relating to death, is enabling me to engage with the religious orders.  The evidence relating to the pharmaceutical companies is different, as is the initial engagement, but I take the Senator's point.  I am structuring it in asking them to see what engagement and reparation they feel is necessary, in light of the very clear statements of failure to adhere to international ethical standards and regulatory standards.  Some of these vaccine trials happened in the 1930s and 1940s but there were both regulatory and ethical standards at play then that were very clearly ignored.  There needs to be a recognition of that.  I hope to see the Attorney General reply in the near future.  He has always been extremely good and efficient in coming back to us quickly.  The information unit, as the Senator said, gives us the opportunity to start to provide very real and badly needed information for survivors.</p> <p>  As regards the national archive, my Department and other Departments will engage with the Department of the Taoiseach on how that project is progressed.  Again, when we speak of the tone and language of the report, we wish to create a space where we can reflect, in the words of survivors, what happened to them in arrange of ways and where people can come and deposit the real testimony of what happened to them, be it oral or written.  The national records and memorial centre gives us the opportunity to honestly reflect the lived reality of the survivors, women and children, who were in these institutions.</p></speech>

I know there a lot of concluding remarks, but time is short.</p></speech>

If a summary is presented without a full recording or transcript, and the recording is destroyed afterwards, that is a huge problem.  There are many questions about how close a summary it was.  Why was this done?  Why was this chosen?  There are questions about the informed consent of the participants and so on.  We can only get those answers, to echo what everyone says, if the commission was to provide the committee with the details of the methodology, as was requested.  The Minister is here answering for somebody else's homework which puts him in a difficult position.</p> <p>  The reality is that there is potential for a large gap between what people said and what goes on the official record.  The right to rectification is only a part of that.  It is important to understand how that gap happened and to prevent it happening again.  A couple of issues arise from that.  The reason this has caused so much hurt is that so many things have been hidden in the past.  I have concerns that I have addressed to the Minister already.  However, many people hope that the institutional burials Bill can be a source of information and can answer questions.  We all need to be very careful with that legislation and ensure that it helps survivors and helps answer questions where information is missing.</p> <p>  Are the Attorney General and the DPC likely to report soon?  How much investigation will they do into this?  There are wider questions to be answered regarding this data and their destruction.  There is a large overlap here, hopefully not with the next commission, with other areas where information is recorded and summarised and a recording or field notes might subsequently be deleted or destroyed.  That is a huge picture that impacts on so many other areas that we need to get to the bottom of.  A lot of unintended consequences from this are coming to light. </p> <p>  I said I would be quick, and I am conscious I am not.  An official response or a shadow report, as mentioned by Senator McGreehan, is a positive idea.  A shadow report from NGOs is very common at international level.  Something like that, perhaps through the collaborative forum, would be worth exploring and the Minister's thoughts on that would be welcome.</p> <p>  I am conscious that he said that his Department is coming up with a way of implementing and monitoring the 22 action points.  This committee also has a role in that.  I ask him to keep the committee informed as much as possible.  We are all in difficult times and no committee can get space to do the work it wants, but quarterly updates from the Department on the progress of a clear timeline that could be picked over in our correspondence would be very useful.  It would save the Minister time in coming before the committee as well as keeping it fully informed, given the strains on all committees in getting work done in these difficult times.</p></speech>

I find it beneficial to come to this committee for the range of experience and expertise that it has.  However, I am happy to provide written reports.  I have, on this point, provided detailed reference and I am always happy to engage with the Chair on issues.  I think the Deputy is right that the committee has a role in keeping pressure on the Government and I to implement all 22 actions and to support us in the pre-legislative processes.</p> <p>  On the issue of the institutional burials Bill, we have heads of Bill coming before the committee.  I look forward, as I said, to the presentations and the advocacy that will take place on that.  I want to make it good legislation that is survivor-centred.  I am happy to engage with the report that the committee brings forward on that legislation.  I cannot speak for the DPC, but I know it is engaged in ongoing correspondence with the commission.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point that the right to rectification can only do so much to bridge the gap between what was said and what goes on the record and I accept that.  Since these tapes are fully deleted, all I can do is seek to bridge that gap in the way that I can.  We are looking at the right to rectification.  If we do that in the context of a clear statement from each person who has been before the confidential committee, that will be a powerful piece.  It is part of the response to concerns about the cold and legalistic nature of the language.</p></speech>

He is very committed to this process and, rightly so, because there are many hurt, angry and upset victims at the heart of this matter.</p><p> The summary report and commentary to date have centred on women.  Most of the homes were run by nuns and, by virtue of their sex and the fact that they were carrying babies, it was women who went into these homes.  It was, therefore, a very female environment.  Very little has been said - these are the unwritten chapters of Irish history - about the men.  As this issue emerged on the airwaves, I heard far too many stories of the guy down the road who bought a ticket and went to Birmingham for two years, just absconded, because he had got a local girl pregnant.  There is a lot of soul-searching still to be done by men in Ireland, most of whom now are moving on in years.  They really need to look at this and ask themselves if they became the first cog in this process when they bought a ferry or airline ticket and absconded or ran for their lives from their responsibilities, and whether that was the right thing to do.  Some people still have time to address and atone for their wrongdoing.</p><p> I agree with others that the language in the commission's report is cold and clinical.  It is a report of an investigation and has many shortcomings but it is what it is.  The commission's work has wound up but the actions must now commence.  That will be the litmus test for the Minister, his Department and the Government overall.</p><p> We have all received umpteen emails from people who are extremely upset stating that the audio recordings of 550 testimonies have been destroyed.  Is that the case?  Have the testimonies made their way through the cogs of administration and the Civil Service where they await destruction and can they be salvaged at the eleventh hour or have they been destroyed?  I ask the Minister for a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

It is very important to dig deep and immediately establish the position in that regard with certainty.</p> <p>  The staff in my office draw up a list of people I have to call back and WhatsApp it to me.  I received a call from a lady in my home county and I phoned her back when I left Dublin one day.  I was still on my phone when I reached the Barack Obama Plaza.  We were an hour and a half on the phone and it was a call I will not forget.  She told me her birthday each year is the day she regrets most because it is the day on which she becomes aware of her lack of identity.  She said she had delved into the whole process of establishing who she is, who her mother was and tracing her backstory.  She is acutely aware there are shortcomings in the Irish system in terms of social workers.  We do not have enough social workers.  Britain is two decades ahead of us in how it deals with people who have been adopted and those who are trying to trace their life story.  It involves much more than sliding a brown package across a desk to reveal to someone who he or she is.  There needs to be a whole process of supports thereafter.  We need some assurances from the Department that there will be increased recruitment of social workers so that supports continue long after people establish who they are.</p> <p>  Is the Minister giving direction to local authorities?  I ask because it came as a surprise to me that local authorities had a function in mother and baby homes.  They had an oversight and inspection role in the homes.  Clare County Council in my constituency had a function with regard to Kilrush mother and baby home in which 168 babies died.  We have seen mayors and chief executives of various local authorities stand up in council chambers and apologise.  Have guidelines been issued on this?  Local authorities were a major player as they were the eyes of the public and performed an inspection role?  Is guidance being issued by the Department on the role of local authorities in this process as it continues?</p> <p>  In the days following the summary report being issued, the breaking story in the news was about mother and baby homes in Northern Ireland.  It is conceivable that a young girl growing up in a Border area or community could have spent time in both jurisdictions.  Has there been engagement between the Minister and his counterparts in Northern Ireland to seek justice for these young women who are now old?  Is there cross-Border co-operation on this?</p> <p>  What is happening with religious orders and financial redress?  We cannot take "No" for an answer.  There must be no ifs or buts.  They have to pay up and the cost cannot all fall on State coffers.  There is a dual responsibility on the State and church.  The church has to pay up and we need to know how that is panning out.</p> <p>  I will end with a human story.  Leaving Leinster House about four months ago, before lockdowns began, I encountered an elderly woman and a younger woman at the front gate.  I established that they were mother and daughter.  The elderly lady had spent time in Tuam and now lives in Dublin with her daughter living a short distance away.  The mother was a survivor of a mother and baby home.  She told me she had had a hard life in her early years but has had a good life since.  We moved on in our discussion and I established that she needed certain things to make her life a bit easier.  She had applied for a housing adaptation grant.  I give credit to Senator Mary Fitzpatrick.  The mother and daughter live in her local area and the Senator came out to speak to them.  We can show that lady at the front gate and many more like her around the country real kindness in the latter years of their lives, whether it is in housing or by providing all the other supports they may need.  I know I have asked a lot of questions but I would the Minister to make a brief comment.</p></speech>

It must have been really difficult for Councillor Linehan-Foley, as a survivor, to stand up last week and apologise.  My thoughts were with her last week when she did that.</p> <p>  The witnesses who gave evidence to the commission will be very disappointed to hear that the evidence taken down was summarised.  I have no doubt that, once again, they will feel this is a slap in the face and that they are just a footnote in the pages of history.  I am really disappointed to learn that their testimony was summarised.</p> <p>  I, too, have received emails from very many people seeking an extension of the commission.  We are here to serve the survivors.  As I said last week at a meeting, there is a fine line between what this commission is to do and what the Government is to do.  Our foremost duty must be to the survivors and whatever happens must be survivor-led.</p> <p>  The transfer of the information to the Department will enable the survivors to get their information quicker.  Before the information goes to the Department, have the 550 people who gave testimony been contacted by the commission to say their documents are to be forwarded to Tusla?  If so, how many have been contacted?</p> <p>  On the issue of GlaxoSmithKline and the church breaching ethical standards, the Minister stated he would write to them.  Why has he not written to them to date?  He has had the report for nearly three months so he should have written to them.  I urge him to do that tomorrow.  We need to find out what role the GlaxoSmithKline and the church had and what documents they may have on the vaccination programme.</p> <p>  The survivors need restorative and reparative justice.  I welcome Deputy Crowe's point on ways that we can support the survivors into their old age.  Anything that we can do to make their lives easier we must do.  So many people are responsible for this.  I read the report and cried for many hours.  I cried at the naivety of the young and not so young women.  They had no sex education.</p><p>We have moved on as a nation and learned from the mistakes we made in the past, but the wounds will not heal until the survivors can access those documents.  The wounds are theirs.  The public and their hunger for righteousness can sometimes overshadow the needs of the survivor.  Those people have suffered for decades and their wounds have been open for so long.  They want those wounds to be closed and those scars healed.  The sooner we get that information through the Department, whether redacted or not, the better.</p></speech>

In a reply to a parliamentary question issued last week, the Minister stated he had "sought further information from the Chair of the Commission to clarify whether it may be technically possible to recover any recordings or notes made by the Confidential Committee."  He went on to state that he was "liaising closely with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure these matters can be appropriately addressed by the Commission prior to its dissolution."  He asked the commission whether the information that people have given can be recovered.  Should the commission be the one to answer that question, given that it has breached its duty to the people who gave evidence to the commission prior to this?</p> <p>  What was the Data Protection Commissioner's response to the talks with the commission?</p> <p>  If the Minister does not get satisfactory answers, will he still go ahead and dissolve the commission at the end of this month?</p> <p>  Will the Minister publish all the correspondence between himself, the commission and the Data Protection Commissioner over recent months in order that the committee can be fully aware of the details and support him in his response?  That is vital, not least to rebuild trust with the survivors, who gave evidence to the commission in the belief that it would be treated properly and who have been very disappointed up to this stage.  The entire debate has been about how to recover the testimonies rather than about how we can help the survivors to move on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#L00900"><p>As I stated in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question, I wrote to the commission.  It was a technical inquiry about whether the information could be retrieved.  As I noted in response to one of the Senators, the commission replied today, stating that it did not believe that the material can be retrieved.  I have no basis to say that answer was provided to me in bad faith and I assume it is a technical answer to a technical question about what can or cannot be done.</p> <p>  That ties in with the Deputy's third question about the dissolution of the commission.  Again, I am not dissolving the commission; it will dissolve on 28 February, under the legislation as currently stated.  During the meeting we have discussed the reasons we might not seek to extend that timeline.  I am examining the range of considerations that need to be taken to be account in making that call.  My greatest concern is what I can do for survivors to try to rectify what has happened in this regard.  I have stated what I think may be possible under the right to rectification, but there are also the tangible benefits that the transfer of the archive to my Department will give.  I have put on record my concerns about whether that would be possible if there was an extension of the commission's lifespan.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission has had its own engagement with the commission.  That is ongoing, as far as I know, and I do not wish to speak for it.  As regards my correspondence, I will consider the Deputy's request.  I do not want to make a call on it now.  I assume that everything is available under freedom of information in any event but I will consider with my officials the issue of publishing the correspondence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021021600002#L01000"><p>There is a passion on the part of the committee to do the right thing by survivors.  We all have different political backgrounds but we are all united on it.  We want to do everything in our power to ensure that, finally, there will be some justice, and that is where some of the questions are coming from.  We were very disappointed, to say the least, when the commission did not accept our invitation because we felt there were genuine questions to be asked, including about the extension of the timeline.  Part of the hurt and the anger about the report was because people had waited for so long, and when it was finally published, it was underwhelming, which is the most respectful language I can think of to describe it.</p> <p>  Whatever we have to do has to be done.  This generation of politicians has to be the one to finally get justice and closure.  During this Oireachtas term and previous ones, there have been so many sympathetic and emotional speeches, and everyone is very sorry, but people want action.  Part of that relates to questions about the report was handled and how it reached it conclusions, such as the finding that there had been no forced adoptions when, clearly, testimony indicated that there had been.</p><p>Other issues include action on access to records, redress, medical cards and counselling.  That type of action would be important but serious questions about how the report was conducted cannot be dismissed.  One of the suggestions made earlier is that this commission be extended.  Perhaps in two weeks, it will be found that there was no need for that but this action should be taken now so that if there is a need for it, that mechanism is there for people to use if they want to take cases or do any follow up.  There should be a body there for them so that they are not left without an entity.  That mistake could be made if it is not extended.  I understand some of the arguments against extending something indefinitely or the potential for people to resign but that needs to be looked at as an option.  Regarding all of the other action points on which people have been waiting, unfortunately, many people have passed away without getting any sort of justice, access to their records or information about what happened to their children.  The committee will not be found wanting.  I am very proud of the committee because we have been so united on this issue and want to do everything we can to help.  We want to work with the Minister, which is why those questions are coming forward.  We understand that he is not the commission but our frustration comes from the fact that we could not have the commission appear before us and that it would not come forward.  We are appealing to the Minister to do everything in his power and one element of that is to seriously consider extending the commission.</p></speech>

I want to work with them and was very happy to come in today to engage with them on these issues.  I have engaged a lot in the D&aacute;il and I will take a third Seanad debate later this week as well as private sessions with this committee.  I have no problem with any of that.  I am glad to do it because it is important that we get into the detail of these issues.  I hope that what is different between now and previous times is that we have this very comprehensive action plan that sets out not just one issue.  From my engagement with survivors, it involves the range of needs they have.  Survivors have different priorities.  For some, that information and tracing legislation is core while for others, it is about getting an enhanced medical card or making sure the stories are reflected in the secondary school curriculum.  The action plan is comprehensive.  I said earlier that the commission's report is not a conclusion.  The action plan is not a conclusion either.  It is something that we can develop it if we see there are elements that are not fully addressed.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe referred to supports from local authorities.  We reference local authorities in terms of engagement.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, felt very strongly that support for survivors with housing issues was something local authorities could focus on because she identified that a large part of the community might have needs in that area.  It is a plan that can be flexible to respond to the specific needs of survivors, which is important.  </p> <p>  I will discuss some issues noted by Deputy Crowe.  Both he and Deputy Sherlock flagged the importance of the apologies by local authorities.  This is very significant because, like Deputy Crowe, before I read this report, I was not aware of certain issues.  I understood that county homes were linked to local authorities but I did not understand how mother and baby homes were linked to local authorities.  Most of us come that route and have a very nice understanding of what our local authorities do.  They were so intrinsically linked to what was happening in these institutions so those apologies from Cork, Galway and other local authorities are very appropriate.  We are happy to engage with local authorities, which can step up themselves.  We know where these institutions were and we know the involvement so local authorities are very capable of setting a standard within their own areas.  </p> <p>  We have a very comprehensive range of actions to take.  The timelines are tight, particularly with the information and tracing Bill.  We will look to bring it before the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny by April.  We have the institutional burials Bill as well but we have other non-legislative elements such as the work of the interdepartmental group on the restorative recognition scheme.  When I met with the group at the commencement of its work, I made two things very clear.  I wanted a human rights-based approach to its work and I wanted it to learn from the mistakes of earlier redress schemes.  I spoke with staff from the Christine Buckley Centre for Education and Support.  Senator McGreehan had asked me to reach out to them.  The centre put a very human face on the failings of previous redress schemes, which is something I want to be very aware of to make sure that even in the terms of redress, we do not end up retraumatising survivors.  I look forward to working with this committee to address these issues.</p></speech>

I am joined by the clerk and assistant clerk.  I remind members and witnesses to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment even when in silent mode.  I refer to all meetings held from 30 September 2020 to 11 January 2021, inclusive, which were previously agreed in private session.  Are they agreed in public session?  Agreed.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome: Dr. Joseph Ryan, CEO of the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA; Professor Vincent Cunnane, president of Limerick Institute of Technology and chair of THEA; Mr. Paul Hannigan, president of Letterkenny Institute of Technology; Dr. Patricia Mulcahy, who I know very well and who is president of Institute of Technology Carlow and deputy chair of THEA; and Professor Maggie Cusack, president of Munster Technological University, MTU.  Our witnesses are here to discuss the future expansion of the technological universities.  I will invite Dr. Ryan to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by questions from members.  Each member will have a six-minute slot to ask questions and for the witnesses to respond.  I will ask the relevant member and witness to conclude after six minutes.  I accept that this is more difficult to do while we are on Microsoft Teams.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the precincts of Leinster House and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present.  Witnesses have already been advised of that and they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by myself to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with this direction.  I call on Dr. Joseph Ryan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We will not retrace the recent Covid-19 discussion other than to say that we are working closely with relevant stakeholders to negotiate our way through this in a manner that supports learners and protects our communities.  Our desire is to realise some managed and early limited return of identified cohorts.  Our institutions have offered their facilities and expertise to support the scaling of the vaccination programme.  We are also working with the HSE locally to put in place whatever additional logistical framework is required.</p> <p>  I am pleased to introduce our delegation.  We are led by the chair of THEA, Professor Vincent Cunnane.  He is joined by the deputy chair, Dr. Patricia Mulcahy; the incoming president of MTU, Professor Maggie Cusack; and Mr. Paul Hannigan, president of Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  With the recent commencement of MTU, we anticipate having five technological universities in the coming year.</p> <p>  The pathway to the technological universities, TUs, was set out in the national strategy for higher education.  It recommended that a network of TUs should be established within the higher education landscape.  Following the enactment of the statute in 2018, THEA worked with stakeholders to craft what has become known as the TU Research Network, TURN, report.  It can be argued that this report documents more thoroughly the objects and character of a technological university than does the 2018 Act.  It was a strength that the consideration was located within the integrated policy context framed by Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  These envisaged the role of the TUs in responding to Government priorities and societal challenges through the deepening of the talent pool and driving applied research and innovation.  As provided in the TURN report, these strategies highlight the central role of developing digital literacy, skills and expertise across the entire workforce as a prerequisite for adaptation to and mainstreaming of digital technologies across all sectors of the Irish economy.</p> <p>  This committee will soon weigh the economic advice from the European Commission on the Cassells report.  Determining a sustainable solution for the future funding of higher education at a level that can reflect the demographic demand and meet the ambitions laid out for the sector remains the major challenge.  The TURN report has resulted in an injection of &euro;90 million over three years.  Continuing this scale of investment will be required in order to ensure the continuing integration and development of these universities.  In a recent D&aacute;il reply, the Minister reaffirmed the centrality of higher education to our progress as a country.  All of the options within the Cassells report foresee a significant lift in Exchequer funding.  Given the current pandemic and the anticipated consequences for the economy, it is not envisaged that there can be any increase in the student contribution in the foreseeable future.  We have consistently advised against the introduction of student loans on grounds of equity and practicality.</p><p>Central to that argument is the passionate belief that access to higher learning should be available for all who would benefit.<br/><br/>The final leg of the funding stool is the contribution from enterprise through the national training fund.  While disbursals from this fund in the 2021 budget have fuelled the July stimulus and the skills package, there remains a sum of &euro;700 million.  Utilising a portion of this money to invest in the infrastructure of a TU sector, equipping laboratories and facilitating digital technology would respond to the recommendations within the TURN report and better position a growing sector to compete globally.<br/><br/>The landscape change we are experiencing will necessitate further reform of the funding model.  Building on TURN, the most recent THEA pre-budget submission proposed a ten-year research and innovation capacity-building fund.  A sum of &euro;5 million was made available in 2019 and again in 2020.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, review of the allocation model recommended that this be increased over time to 5% of the overall recurrent grant funding for the sector.  For comparison, the comprehensive university sector receives a research and innovation allocation of 10%.  The THEA submission sought a phased increase in this allocation to &euro;40 million in 2023.  Committee support would be significant in realising the step change in high quality research concentrations, developed with a particular focus on industry collaboration and innovation.<br/><br/>In this context, it is worth reflecting on the baseline position.  In October 2016, the HEA published a financial review of the institutes of technology.  The review stated:</p><blockquote>	The sector has faced significant challenges, with the state grant falling by 34% between 2008 and 2015 while student numbers grew by 24%.  This has led to total income per student contracting by 25.5% over the same period. </blockquote><p>This spoke to an unpromising foundation for the embrace of the scale of change envisaged.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, there has been a dearth of capital investment available from the State coffers.  This is not a level playing field.  The traditional universities have access to the borrowing framework as provided for in their legislation.  We have similar facility, but it has not been enacted.  As of 30 September 2019, the borrowings of the seven universities amounted to &euro;741 million, provided predominantly and cost-effectively by the European Investment Bank.  On a positive note, the State has a public private partnership programme that is providing for 11 buildings in the TU sector.  It cannot be stressed sufficiently how vital these projects are.  We ask that these continue to be given priority from the Government to ensure their timely delivery.<br/><br/>Research is identified as the key signifier of the step change demanded of the TUs.  Building capacity enabling a transformation of research performance is the prerequisite to positioning the TUs as major engines of innovation and economic growth.  This entails developing human capital, facilitating research activity and opportunities for existing staff and implementing a new career development and employment framework.  Linking this to a focus on societal challenges of the 21st century consistent with the objectives of Innovation 2020 and its successor, and the Climate Action Plan 2019, is what can be expected of modern and dynamic centres of learning and research.  This is consistent with equipping Ireland to compete for funding from Horizon Europe, helping to deliver on the sustainable development goals and leveraging the opportunities that are there, post Brexit.<br/><br/>Our institutions are grounded in their communities.  The detailed socioeconomic profile data published by the HEA provides a valuable insight.  In the most recent data set, our institutions demonstrate a negative deprivation index score.  The HEA states that institutes of technology are effective in providing higher education to the population profile of their regions.  Indeed, the overall profile of students enrolled in the sector matches the national population profile more closely than any other set of institutions.  It points to the role of the technological sector in support of equity, opportunity and social cohesion.<br/><br/>The sector has been recognised for its close links to further education and for building pathways for progression and the integrated nature of the new department should assist further in this.  A goal of the TUs is to facilitate a regional lifelong learning system with seamless transitions and pathways from a range of different starting points, transfer and progression within and between TUs and other higher educational institutions, HEIs, and progression to employment, further learning and participation in society.  TUs will become centres of recognised quality and the focus for regional lifelong learning where people can learn at their own pace, anywhere, anytime, without barriers.<br/><br/>We will work closely with legislators, Government and its agencies to identify and agree a sustainable funding model for higher education.  We will contribute to the development of legislation to realise what is likely to be the Higher Education Commission.  Related to this is the consideration to be afforded reform of governance which the Minister, Deputy Harris, has signalled as a priority.  Equipping our universities with appropriate organisational design and a suitable academic career framework will be essential to fulfilling the ambition invested in TUs and is consistent with the implementation of TU-apposite career structures which is the seventh in the focused recommendations from the TURN report.  This technological sector with its links to enterprise, its unique balance between research, pedagogy, and skills, and its regional connectedness will be central to our collective national endeavour to recover from the ravages of this pandemic.  With targeted investment, we can deliver on the Government&rsquo;s resilience and recovery plan.<br/><br/>We highlight and recommend three priority areas for focus.  The first is sustainability.  To deliver on the recommendations set out in the TURN report, this includes reconfiguring the existing HEA landscape funding arrangements so that a dedicated funding stream is put in place to support TU development and organisation change in management.<br/><br/>The second is solidarity.  This sector is cohesive and its institutions are closely integrated into their communities, which is key to broadening access and thereby affording opportunity to all.  There is a well-documented ambition for this sector set out in national policy but first, we, as a society, must negotiate a period of recalibration and recovery.  With targeted investment, our institutions can be central to this.  We can assist the Government to achieve national goals.<br/><br/>Support is the final priority area in order to deliver on the capital investment through schemes such as the public private partnership projects and to afford our institutions access to them borrowing framework.  Allied to this, research capacity should be enhanced through increased funding directed at developing researcher human capital in TUs.</p></speech>

The first thing I want to do is to thank Dr. Ryan and all the other guests for attending.  All of us on this committee can agree that when one looks at the 2011 national strategy, the 2018 Act and the 2019 TURN report, we are involved in a significant transformation of higher education in this country.  I commend the people before us this afternoon for the role they are playing in transforming higher education.</p> <p>  My own vision for it, and I will ask a couple of questions in respect of it, is that the technological universities will become engines for the transformation not only of innovation in the education system in this country, but also as engines for regional development.  I know that point of view is shared by the people at the meeting this afternoon.</p> <p>  I will raise three issues and I do not know who can answer them so I will let our guests decide that.  One of the issues that we all hope technological universities will be able to ameliorate is the significant problem in Ireland and Europe when it comes to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, graduates.  There is obviously a significant proportion of STEM graduates who come from the eastern part of the world, including China and India.  There is a problem in Europe and Ireland with STEM graduates, particularly when it comes to younger women.  How do our guests see the technological universities trying to meet the requirement of society and innovation to grow the number of STEM graduates that we are producing in this country?</p></speech>

I will say at the start that we hold with his analysis that the sector is heavily involved in the transformation of higher education as it has been down through the years, but this particular step change is significant in that transformation.  We see ourselves as engines of innovation change and, as the Deputy rightly said, regional development, which is close to all our hearts and which we can articulate strongly.</p><p> In regard to STEM graduates, that sector is very well represented here today by Dr. Mulcahy and Professor Cusack.  The issue of attracting young women into the STEM area is very much to the forefront of what we are trying to do.  I will hand over to my colleagues to expand on that.</p></speech>

We are very excited and enthused by that agenda but it was not the start of efforts in this area.  There are a lot of initiatives by our colleagues in the STEM area, including female lecturers, academic staff and others, to promote increased participation in STEM.  However, the EDI initiative will help greatly in that effort.  The HEA has established a centre of excellence for EDI.  All institutions either already have obtained or are in the processing of obtaining Athena SWAN accreditation and will seek to move over time from bronze to silver to gold.</p> <p>  To bring it down a level, my institution was successful some two years ago in getting an institutional Athena SWAN accreditation which laid out a very ambitious gender equality action plan, published on our website, containing more than 60 actions.  Importantly, the next step is to drill into departments.  We have prioritised four departments, including two in engineering, one in computing and one in humanities.  They are all doing their own detailed action plans and looking to achieve the bronze accreditation.  It is not so much the badge that is important but more what it signifies.  We would expect the three STEM departments to have those applications in, with lots of new initiatives, and the institution is supporting that.  This is happening across the institutions; I am offering my institution as one example.  Interestingly, the fourth department, humanities, is the one with the flip difficulty, namely, the lack of participation by males in humanities and social studies.  There is a large benefit in seeking to redress that imbalance as well.  It is a very active programme, we are committing a lot of resources to it and I think it will make a difference in time.</p></speech>

I have led quite a few Athena SWAN initiatives over the years.  It is quite a blunt instrument but it brings about really positive conversations that change the landscape in a positive way.  At MTU, I am really keen to have equality, diversity and inclusion at our top table.  It is a very important signal to send about how important EDI is for the university.  We all have a responsibility to challenge ourselves in every decision we make as to whether we are inadvertently excluding anyone.  It is not about any one approach.  Rather, it is very much a multipronged approach and it is about continuing to ask ourselves those questions about inclusion and whether there is anything built into our systems that somehow excludes people.</p> <p>  I will give the committee one example.  We have just launched, under pillar 3 of the human capital initiative, our iEd Hub initiative in collaboration with the college of medicine and health at University College Cork.  We are bringing together bioscience aspects with engineering at MTU to look at innovation and different ways of learning.  In my welcome address for the initiative, I specifically made the point that we have more female students in bioscience and that this was an opportunity to be a beacon and really drive change.  It is really important that people see examples of women being involved in STEM subjects and having successful careers in the area.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Ryan for his presentation and all the witnesses for attending the meeting to discuss this really important subject.  I very much welcome THEA's stance in opposing any increase in fees or the student contribution charge as well as any plans to introduce a student loan system.  Its submission states that the sector has faced significant challenges, with the total income per student contracting by 25.5% since 2008.  The national strategy for higher education to 2030 was published in 2011, setting out the pathway for the institutes of technology to become technological universities.  It seems very much as if the institutes are being asked to do more with less.  What has this meant for them in terms of making the transition to technological universities?</p> <p>  We all accept that building research capacity is a prerequisite for the technological universities.  Dr. Ryan rightly highlighted that competing for Horizon Europe research funding is a key objective.  I completely agree with that.  Since 2014, Ireland has drawn down more than &euro;1 billion in research funding under Horizon Europe, &euro;618 million for third level institutions and the rest for private companies.  Am I right in saying that less than 10% of that total, or &euro;53.7 million, has gone to institutes of technology and, of that modest amount, almost all of it went to Waterford, Cork and Dublin?  To highlight the issue further, the institutes that make up the Connacht-Ulster alliance, namely, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, have been successful in drawing down only &euro;1.9 million collectively since 2014, which is just under 0.2% of the total funding drawn down by Ireland under Horizon Europe.  How do we go about fixing that imbalance?</p> <p>  Finally, how might the expansion of the technological universities change how we provide apprenticeships?  Could some of the apprenticeships be awarded with third level qualifications?  In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, for example, master craftsman qualifications are offered which provide pathways to higher-level technical qualifications within the relevant professional fields.  This allows qualified apprentices, often with work experience, to acquire a higher level of professional skills through a free-standing examination following participation in the courses.  Is this an approach the witnesses think could work here?  If so, would the technological universities be best placed to support it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Vincent Cunnane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021021600002#C00900"><p>I will respond first before inviting my colleagues to come in.  Dr. Ryan might have some numbers to offer.  The Deputy identified several key issues.  The first was about having to do more with less.  We have got very used to that but it cannot continue.  It is no longer sustainable or tenable to go on in this manner.  We believe the Government is going to proceed on the basis of what is set out in the Cassells report.  That report will be back before the committee, it is hoped, by the end of quarter 2.</p> <p>  A sustainable funding model has not been found for the higher education sector.  That is particularly so in the case of the technological sector.  There are differences in the way the overall budget is distributed between the traditional university sector and the technological sector.  That budget covers our day-to-day business and everything we do.  The money is distributed in a particular way and we do not have enough of it.  That has led to particular issues.  In regard to transitioning, our laboratories and workshops - the face-to-face side of things - are very poor based on European comparators.  There has been no investment in capital equipment on the scientific side of things for many years.  Our funding has been augmented in very recent times in respect of the apprenticeship training model.</p><p>That has had a major impact on the mechanical, electrical and other craft apprentices who are now benefiting from state-of-the-art equipment.  Nevertheless, the underfunding year after year has had profound impacts on our equipment base.  Has it impacted on the quality of the students?  No, we have compensated for that.  How much longer can we go on with that?  That is the question.  I would place systemic and sustainable funding as a top priority for us, irrespective of institutes of technology.  In the transition to technological universities it is of paramount importance.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh rightly referred to the percentage of funding and the higher education research and development, HERD, survey, which covers the technological sector and has a concentration on several research-led institutions.  That has traditionally been the case but it is changing significantly.  Dr. Ryan might have the figure from the HERD survey - I cannot remember it off the top of my head.  The last HERD review noted an increase by approximately 38% in terms of funding, although I may need verification of that figure.  It has grown significantly in any event.  That is the main point.</p><p> There has been a great widening of the research side.  Those numbers are on research expenditure.  The numbers for contracts won under Horizon 2020 and contracts co-ordinated by our various institutes have grown significantly in recent years.  This has arisen in parallel with the technological university activity of growing research.  As we have grown our research, we have grown our ability to compete for research funding.  We have utilised increased State funding for research to grow our competitiveness on a European basis.  It is growing but it is still a problem.  We still need to see significant increases in that funding.  As Dr. Ryan outlined, the recurrent grant allocation model for distribution of funding to the institutes of technology had no dedicated research funding.  This changed only in the past two years and only a small amount - &euro;5 million in total - is for distribution among us to recognise the core activity of research.  That has to grow significantly.  We have asked for the figure to grow to &euro;40 million in the coming years.</p></speech>

The Deputy rightly identified the progression from traditional apprentices into higher education apprentices.  This is what we are embarked upon.  The first graduates of this have actually come through in the past year.  The advanced electrical qualification went from a craft apprentice to a level 7 qualification.  This week Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology is outlining advanced manufacturing from a traditional base and into level 7.  There are other examples in Sligo and elsewhere where we have transitioned craft apprentice qualifications into a higher education attainment.  It had been an endpoint and there was little activity beyond that.  Now, those involved have the ability to go on from level 6 or 7 to level 8 or 9 and PhD.  The new apprentice model drives that but it is at the legislative heart of the technological university exercise.  My apologies for going on and for not bringing my colleagues in.  We have touched on emotive subjects.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Ryan, Professor Cunnane and the team.  We only recently heard from them so it was good to get an update.</p><p>I will comment on the opening statements.  I welcome that Dr. Ryan mentioned digital skills and increasing expertise in this area.  It is important in regional areas, especially for the digital skills divide.  Dr. Ryan referred to three elements, specifically sustainability, solidarity and support.  The first point relates to sustainability and reconfiguring the funding arrangements.  I have engaged to get further information on this in terms of the Cassells report.  From what I am aware, the Department officials and the Minister, Deputy Harris, are meeting the European Commission this week and engaging with several stakeholders.  They anticipate a final report from the European Commission will issue by the end of quarter 1.  The Commission will then present the outcomes to the Minister in quarter 2.  These are timelines in respect of the Cassells report.</p><p>There is another aspect to sustainability.  I was delighted when I saw the reference to Science Foundation Ireland funding for research centres.  This relates to 17 higher education institutions and in particular is linked in with institutes of technology.  We could see that GMIT is linked in and was getting funding.  Limerick Institute of Technology was there with the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software, known as Lero.  It was excellent to see that the funding coming from SFI is also coming through to the institutes of technology.  I note Athlone Institute of Technology also benefited from research funding.  It is important that our institutes of technology are able to step up.</p><p>I take on board the points made about research capacity.  Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe funding are complex.  The programmes are seen as the <i>cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me</i>and the height of excellence of science throughout Europe.  This is about research capacity.  In other words, for every member of the research staff, a total of 30% of time is dedicated to research.  The idea is that we have strong research offices that are supporting researchers and lecturers to apply for funding.</p><p>What is the plan of the Technological Higher Education Association?  How is THEA linking in with Enterprise Ireland?  Another aspect of this is competitive industry.  Some of the funding that comes through Europe is for the partnerships that each of the institutes and technological universities have in place.  The institutes are already in a strong position as they have good relationships with industry and companies in their areas.</p><p>The last point relates to the societal impact of Horizon Europe funding.  Reference was made to solidarity and how the institutes are integrated into the communities.  We are already at the Pobal deprivation index for some of these areas.  It is important to see that rolled out and I am highly supportive of that in the west.</p></speech>

We are seeing outcomes now in terms of the improved performance under HERD, as Professor Cunnane outlined.  The different collaborations allow us to get involved with bigger partners and this, in turn, allows us to access more funding.</p> <p>  Letterkenny Institute of Technology has been able to avail of INTERREG funding through interactions with the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast.  This does two things.  It allows funding to come into the institute to enable us to develop our own embryonic stage research.  It also allows us to engage with more experienced partners and that builds capacity within our institution.  That is happening throughout the country.  We can see institutions taking on leadership roles in specific programmes.  It is a journey we are on.  We see it improving in each institution throughout the country.  There is no doubt about that.</p> <p>  We also see real opportunities for the future and real prospects in terms of the technological university research network report, what the report saw for us and what is ahead of us as technological universities.  We are mindful of what is expected from us.  We are also conscious of the pathways that we have already started down and on which we will continue to build.  We will see greater integration and interaction over a period.</p> <p>  I will come back to the connectedness point.  Senator Dolan mentioned the deprivation index, etc.  There is probably a fear among some people that as technological universities emerge, they may move away from their initial focus of dealing with the people in their communities.  That is far from where we are.  The legislation is clear that we need to be connected to our original mission as well as developing research activity and other activities that are necessary.  The point Dr. Ryan made was important.  The institutes reflect the populations in which they operate.  What we are saying is we are lifting all boats in the context of the programmes we are providing.  We are giving everyone the opportunity to step up.  That is having a significant impact.</p> <p>  I will go back to the question Deputy Jim O'Callaghan asked about regional development.  I had a meeting this morning with the country lead for Tata Consultancy, which is about to take over Pramerica in Letterkenny.  Let us consider IDA Ireland employment and the Border region.  Approximately 8,500 jobs have been created there, including some 4,000 jobs in Letterkenny.  They would not be here if we were not here.  We were here before those companies came in.  That success has been built up over time.  What we need to see is more jobs coming in on the back of that expertise.  We hope the technological universities will continue to do that.  As we have seen, Sligo has been successful recently in attracting several different companies.</p></speech>

How the teams are supported in building their research capability is crucial.  The people who attract the investment are key.  How they will be recruited and retained within the technological university will also be crucial because they will win the funding at international level, including European level.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for attending.  It is great to see the regional spread of the delegation.  It is critical that the institutions make provision in this regard, as outlined very well by Dr. Ryan.</p> <p>  I met Mr. Hannigan previously.  It is very clear from all the evidence I have seen that the witnesses' institutions are continuing to serve their communities.  For me, one of the clear ways to do this, considering that we are looking to the future, involves climate action.  Climate action is one of the key reasons my party went into government but everybody across all parties will agree it represents the future economically and socially for communities.  Quite rightly, there has been a lot of focus on research because more funding streams are required for the institutions, but one of the key ways to stay in touch with areas is through job creation in a very localised way.  In order to do all the work we are committed to under the programme for Government, we need a major ramping up of apprenticeships.  Where do all the representatives of the third level institutions see their role in that regard?  Do the witnesses believe they are adequately supported in that role?</p></speech>

We talked about the traditional craft apprentices, and we also talked about the new apprentices.  Certainly in respect of craft apprentices, my institution and, I am sure, all the others feel very well supported.  We are currently facing challenges because of the nature of the craft apprenticeship programmes and the off-campus circumstances associated with Covid but we are seeing a very significant increase in craft apprenticeships across a number of areas.  In my institution, the number is up by 50% in respect of electrical instrumentation.  There are similar increases sector-wide in areas in which we are not necessarily involved but in which others are.  I am aware, however, that there is a great deficit.  All the institutes are examining it with the HEA to identify short-term and longer-term strategies to address it across the traditional areas.  That will require investment.  The big bottleneck concerns the actual building rather than the equipment, which has been extremely well supported.  It is a matter of the infrastructure itself.</p> <p>  On the public private partnership projects that were talked about, six of the 11 went to tender recently and the next five are due to go to tender.  That is right across the country.  While they might not all be focused on apprentices, the decanting and the knock-on effect could very well free up space elsewhere to help.  That is really important.</p> <p>  We talked about new apprenticeship programmes.  These pertain to the computer and ICT, medical technology, insurance, finance, accountancy, logistics and hospitality sectors.  In my institution, there is a new apprenticeship programme in geodrilling, for example.  There is a lot of movement and focus in this area, but a lot more effort needs to be put in.</p></speech>

I cannot remember whether Dr. Mulcahy or Professor Cusack mentioned it.  It is a blunt instrument.  Having served on a governing authority, I believe that despite everything put in place, it really comes down to the individual institution and the work it does.  I offer my encouragement.  We are keeping an eye on all this, and we are aware that the delegates are doing so also.  It is important to see progress.</p> <p>  I have spoken to Mr. Hannigan about consent.  This is an issue that everybody is taking very seriously.  I thank Mr. Hannigan in this regard.  Quite recently, we have seen things in the media, not in respect of Mr. Hannigan&rsquo;s institution but in respect of others.  We would like to do anything we can as a committee to support the work in this regard.</p> <p>  Let me return to climate action.  We have heard presentations from those involved with education and training boards in which they referred to the need to consider climate and sustainability in respect of every subject.  Obviously, this is a different matter but I would be encouraged to hear that climate and sustainability are not just focus points in apprenticeships but woven through every single course so every single student will be fully equipped to deal with what is the most important issue of our time.</p></speech>

We are committed to educating for sustainability, whether it is in engineering or humanities.  It is right across the board.  Every five years, we have a root-and-branch review of all our programmes.  There are certain themes that we want to embed across all curricula.  At present, we are going through a programmatic review, which will be completed this year.  This is when educating for sustainability will be brought right through all the programmes.  We have well-established processes and mechanisms to do that and, indeed, to address other important issues, such as internationalisation and equality, diversity and inclusion.  That is what we are doing.  I am aware that other institutions are doing the same.  One can always have standalone programmes or standalone initiatives but we are really looking for a cultural change.  That is the way we are approaching it.</p></speech>

I can confirm that my captors are treating me very well here in Leinster House.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I will keep my comments as brief as possible.  Professor Cunnane mentioned a very inspirational discussion on funding, the Cassells report, etc.  I was hoping that others will also get an opportunity to touch on that.</p> <p>  What has been learned from Covid in the sector?  What has it exposed?  There is a temptation for people to say "When we get back to normal" but for many people and many sectors, normal was the problem.  Could the delegates speak to what normal was the problem in their sector, what can be learned from it and how we can make sure we do not waste a good crisis?</p> <p>  I am aware that the delegation has already touched on the engagement on equality and ensuring the existence of a student body that is representative of Irish society, including new communities, disadvantaged communities and the Traveller community?  Could the witnesses speak to that?  Could they refer to gender equality, which is also important?  Could they speak about funding, what has been learned from the pandemic, the normal to which we do not want to return, and the issue of inclusivity?</p></speech>

Perhaps I will ask Professor Cusack to comment just after I say a few words, if that is acceptable.  She may comment on funding.  She is new in the system so she is used to a better-funded system.  Therefore, she may have some parallels to bring into play.</p> <p>  People want to have definitive outcomes from Covid at a point where we are really just living with it.  It is a little dangerous to make profound statements on what will happen in the future.  There are definitely many learnings.  On teaching and learning, the way that we were able to move to an online environment, or to remote emergency teaching, as we have been calling it here, was incredible.</p><p>It was backed up by good IT systems and we have learned a great deal.  We want to capture the very best of that and ensure that the lessons become part of what happens in future.</p><p> It has been less than a year since we moved into this space.  Students have learned to deal with it, but would they want to do it this way for the long term?  The sense of place, student experience and collegiality is missing.  We are able to deal with the learning side.  We provide learning environments and we teach.  The students get learning outcomes, which we can test.  We have adapted everything to that.  However, what about the rounding of the individual and the soft skills that industry asks for so much?  None of us would say that we have learned from this situation and that its lesson will last for years.  We must be careful.  I am already hearing rumblings from the Department asking why we need lecture theatres if we have all gone electronic.  That is loose talk, but we must think about this issue deeply.  It is giving us an opportunity.  We have not been able to reflect yet; reflection can only come when we are out of the crisis.  We are still in crisis management mode.  We want to get back so that our students can complete their necessary face-to-face practice.  I have no idea what "normal" is, but we will work out what is best for our students and staff.</p><p> Turning to the issue of engagement disadvantage, I have been before this committee a number of times.  We do not get praise for what we do on a daily basis.  We are access institutions.  Consider the report showing the Higher Education Authority, HEA's statistics on spatial and socioeconomic profiles.  This is our job and we do it every day.  We provide opportunities to those from non-traditional backgrounds, for example, first generation students, who would benefit from them.  We take pride in this.  If the evolution of technological universities meant that we had to abandon those student cohorts, none of us would have stepped up to the mark and left people behind in order to get technological university status.  Our journey must take everyone with us.  I might have been emotional on the issue of funding, but the committee should hear me talk about disadvantage.</p><p> I will hand over to Professor Cusack.  Mr. Hannigan might wish to contribute as well.</p></speech>

No system ever considers that it has sufficient funding.  It would be important to have strength in a mixed portfolio of funding.  Much of the conversation about funding relates to funding for undergraduates.  We have spoken about the challenges for the step change in research.  It is important that we work with colleagues, support them and help them to build the scale of the research projects we are leading and for that to become a significant part of our income, as well as the work we do with industry.  There is strength in that mixed portfolio as well as benefits for our students in terms of employability.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the climate and the economy.  They are often presented as enemies that go head to head.  There is an opportunity for us to overturn that notion and, as we address the major climate challenge, ask how we do that in a way that upskills our learners and ensures that they contributing to the economy.  That is the challenge for us all.</p> <p>  Professor Cunnane is right, in that we should not waste a good crisis or pandemic.  Learning is ongoing.  I have been amazed by the challenges that people have faced and what they have been able to do.  There has generally been a great deal of positive feedback from our students about how online learning is better for some because, for example, it suits them to go back to asynchronous learning, listen to something again and think about what happened.  Professor Cunnane is right about that sense of connection and community that we have worked hard to maintain when we are working virtually.  We can come to a point where we will benefit from the best of both and make good use of the space, which was a topic that Professor Cunnane also raised.</p></speech>

Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan would be the next questioner, but Senator Flynn is online.  She is not on the precincts of Leinster House, though, so she has given me two questions to ask.  Since this is her speaking slot, I will ask those questions for her and hand over to whichever witness is most appropriate to reply.  Before I do, though, Professor Cusack spoke about the sense of community and collegiality.  Many third level students with whom I chat miss their college communities.</p> <p>  Senator Flynn's first question relates to how the pandemic has had a negative impact on the learning and leaving certificate experience.  The newly imposed blended style of learning and the challenges it poses to students, in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not have access to adequate digital resources, have meant that students might not achieve their full academic potential.  Will attempts be made by technological universities to carry out early interventions to encourage disadvantaged students to apply to and attend them?</p> <p>  The importance of apprenticeships and vocational education for disadvantaged students means that these are sometimes their only route into third level education.  Will the witnesses speak to the strategy that THEA is working on to ensure the inclusion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds?</p></speech>

Living in Donegal like me, she is well aware of the circumstances that she is raising in her questions.</p> <p>  The question on the leaving certificate experience ties into the previous question.  At the beginning of this academic year, we encouraged the students who entered college in 2020 to come to college.  Some were talking about deferring or taking a year out.  Everything that used to be available to them had been taken away, for example, their sporting and social outlets.  Our advice was to come to college and engage with the programme.  Most had to do their courses online, but we told them to make use of the year instead of wasting it.  For us, the initial wish was to get as many students on campus we as could.  The public health guidelines determined how many we could, so we had to reduce our September numbers to a lower number in December before moving everything online for the moment.  I hope that we will return in March.</p> <p>  Students have been resilient in how they have engaged.  The funding from the Department that allowed us to provide laptops to up to 400 students was important.  They were signed up for immediately and taken on board quickly by the students involved.  Now that the first semester has been completed, we are seeing a positive engagement by students with their course content, their examinations and their performance at same.  We are not losing sight of the question.  It is one that we must work on continuously.  I am sitting in an office in Letterkenny but there is not a student anywhere in this place.  I have not set eyes on many students at all this academic year, which is disappointing because, as everyone has stated, having community, engagement and life around the place is important.  We want to get students back on campus as soon as we can, but only when it is safe to do so.</p> <p>  Regarding vocational education and apprenticeships, we must also consider that, in one way or another, all institutes provide access programmes and foundation programmes in various areas to allow different access routes into college, including through their full-time offerings.  One access programme tends to get a higher profile than others, which is a source of annoyance for some of us around the table because we are doing this day in, day out.  A few people around the table have heard me giving out about this previously.  The access programmes that our colleges run are innovative and good at getting people back into second chance education.  I will provide a statistic that came across my table again this morning and that I am seeing more frequently.  We have had a significant number of mature students in full-time programmes in our 23 years plus, but that number is dwindling nationally.  These people are in jobs and are now coming to us on part-time or flexible learning models or whatever that we could not provide previously online.  The nature of the part-time student is changing to a certain extent.</p><p>We are adapting, modifying and leading that to a certain extent.  I get the questions that have been asked.  It is a constant challenge day to day, but all of us in our own way are addressing that challenge.  The issue is high on the agenda for THEA and all of the institutions as we move towards technological university status.</p></speech>

There are many routes for disadvantaged students.  It is important to signify the close links between our sector and the further education sector.  The technological universities will maintain and grow the relationship with the further education sector.  Many students come through that route.  As a sector, we find that when students have been through a PLC or further education programme, they are more suitable for higher education at that point.  They are ready and their retention rate within our systems is high.  I would disagree with the Senator regarding apprenticeships being the only route into higher education.  Apprenticeship is an important route for disadvantaged students but there are multiple entry points.  As a sector, we recognise multiple entry points.  As pointed out by Mr. Hannigan, we are there for mature students as well.</p> <p>  We would highlight to Deputies and others that there are multiple routes of entry into higher education in the context of access and for disadvantaged students, be that traditional craft apprenticeships or new apprenticeship levels 6 and 7 and level 8.  The link and the recognition of credits from the further education system is also a key component of access.</p></speech>

Dr. Ryan is a member of a transition group on leaving certificate reform.  One of the issues that we have to face as a result of the pandemic is that particular learnings will not be completed at second level.  We will need to identify these gaps, which have occurred through no fault of the teachers, the schools or the students.  Students have been on campus for a limited time only and so certain tacit skills as well as learnings which we would expect students coming in from the leaving certificate to have across a broad variety of areas will not have been achieved.  It is important that there is early identification of the gaps in order that we can bridge those gaps and not assume that knowledge is there.  This will be part of what we will have do, particularly for the cohort which comes in this year because they were disrupted in fifth year and are again being disrupted in their final year.  It is part of what we need to do and we will do that.  As a sector, we sit at the same tables on the issue of leaving certificate reform.  Would Dr. Mulcahy like to come in on this issue?</p></speech>

There is a great deal of talent and experience that can be brought to bear by our sector in terms of that discussion.  Teachers work on this issue daily.  I have two 15 year old daughters who have been through the junior certificate under Covid.  With all of the changes that have happened, there is an opportunity to rethink the leaving certificate.  Whether discussions provide for that is something we are all very interested in.  THEA and the representatives from the institutes have many ideas that can feed into that process, but we do not have time to go into individual idea at this point.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, focused on the larger quality issues, I will be a little parochial and direct my questions to Professor Cusack.  As this is my first engagement with her, I congratulate her on her appointment.  The Munster Technological University is very historic.  It is very exciting for Cork and I wish all involved the very best of luck.</p> <p>  On the transition to technological university status, Professor Cusack's predecessor, Barry O'Connor, would have made the point that pound for pound the funding per student in the IT sector, now technological university sector, represents incredible value for money but ultimately that was unsustainable.  The amount that universities were given per student then was much lower than is being provided now for the technological universities.  I ask Professor Cusack to comment on that.</p> <p>  I understand there is a memorandum of understanding in regard to the agreement to implement Munster Technological University.  Can Professor Cusack provide a timeline for full implementation of that memorandum of understanding?  As I understand it, there are some outstanding issues in the context of phases 3 and 4.  I would welcome an update on that issue and also on the Cush report and its implementation, particularly as it relates to contracts.</p> <p>  My final point is in respect of the learnings for other institutes of technology that want to transition.  In Professor Cusack's view, what challenges lie ahead of the technological university as it builds up steam and what are the learnings for other institutes of technology as they make the transition?</p></speech>

The value for money is an issue we have already touched on.  It is a really important point.  I think we are providing incredible value for money but there is a cost there in terms of staff time and effort to deliver real quality in the context of the learner's experience.  We have set ambitious challenges as a technological university in terms of upscaling the research and innovation.  It is clear that more funding is required in the system for us to achieve all of the ambitions that we are keen to achieve.</p> <p>  On the memorandums of understanding and working through them, we are doing exactly that.  We are working through them and addressing all of the points.  We are working hard to bring everybody with us to realise the ambitions we want to deliver.</p><p> The question of contracts was raised.  I was asked in general terms about the challenges that we may see in technological universities and lessons that others could learn.  There will be opportunities for professional management and support staff.  Hopefully there will be career opportunities for them as we develop a different type of organisation with different endeavours or additional endeavours and priorities.</p><p> The development of an academic employment framework is important for the technological universities.  There is a point about contracts with researchers and this is an integral part of it.  We are helping to support and develop early career colleagues in all aspects of academic endeavour, including learning and teaching, their own research and how they interact with industry and companies.  The idea is to have all those aspects strongly all the way through.  That is a really essential point to realise the full potential of staff.  We all agree there is an extraordinary amount of exciting potential.  That is certainly one of the steps that would really help us to achieve this.</p><p> There are other points around digital infrastructure.  We heard mention of the technological university research network report earlier.  The primary recommendation is about having outstanding digital infrastructure.  We spoke about learning from Covid-19.  We have learned many lessons from what can be done there.  This has been a real opportunity for us to do things even better in terms of other teaching, how we engage and do research, interacting with companies and how we can do things in a virtual way to great effect.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh gach duine anseo.  I have met many of them before.  I wish Professor Cusack the best in her role as well.</p> <p>  I wish to look back at what Deputy O'Callaghan raised in respect of STEM courses earlier.  The answer was given, as I recall, in terms of diversity.  Is it simply a question of diversity?  This is a question coming from me rather than a statement.  Is it simply a question of diversity or is it also one of quality?  Is this connected with the question of whether we are losing ground in our education system at second level?  Is it something connected with the subject we hope to have the witnesses in on in due course, namely, the question of leaving certificate reform?  Does THEA see those as connected issues around assessment, the syllabus, attracting students and getting quality results?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  I have one other question I want to ask.  Why is THEA so against student loans?  I can understand that there would be a revolution now if it were to be proposed in the context of the diminished student experience but we are facing major financial challenges in the country.  I would have thought a student loan system does not automatically mean higher charges for students.  What is so wrong with such a system if repayment, the start date and the rate of repayment is tied to the future income level of the graduate and to his or her ability to pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Vincent Cunnane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021021600002#H00500"><p>I will address the soft question at the end.  Perhaps Dr. Mulcahy may look at the quality issue but I will take the second question.  Others may come in after me.  On the issue of student loans, we came out against it strongly for several reasons.  First and foremost, the student body that we talk about includes first-generation students, access students and disadvantaged students.  The idea of borrowing is not endemic in that group.  I do not like to speak in generalities but it is a particular issue.  We see this as a way in which fewer students would come in to higher education.  When the matter was before this committee previously in respect of the Cassells report, I asked one question.  I asked that we not do anything that would limit access.  We hold by that statement.  I appeal to members not to do anything that would limit access as they reflected upon the Cassells report.  That includes the student loan aspect in particular.  Our deeply held view, backed up by research from Trinity, is that the loan system would inhibit access.  It is often quoted that in the first years of the student loan system in the UK and other places, access to higher education increased.  That must be counterbalanced by the fact that in the years after that, the numbers dropped off significantly with debt accumulated to those students.  Professor Cusack will be able to come in on aspects of this that pertain in the UK.  We do a great deal of work in the social areas, including social sciences, early childcare, nursing and the caring professions.  The graduates cannot clear their debts.  It has been shown in the UK that many of the graduates in these areas are never in a position to clear their debts, never mind attract other funding such as mortgages etc.  This is because they are poorly paid relative to others.  Actuaries and those working in aspects of engineering and science will get good jobs that are highly paid but our sector has a large percentage of people in the caring professions.  Again, it has been shown that it is difficult for them to repay loans and to have a life thereafter.  We remain committed to the fact that student loans should not be part of the Cassells side of things.</p> <p>  This is a State investment on which the State receives many multiples of a return.  When the committee comes to discuss the Cassells report, the issue of access should be to the forefront of the thinking of members.  Aspects of our sector, including many first-generation students and many people in caring professions should be part of that consideration.  Dr. Mulcahy might come in on the quality side of things and Professor Cusack might say something about her experience in the UK loan system.</p></speech>

I have over 30 years of experience in higher education.  As a biochemist with a deep passion for all things STEM for a long time, it puzzles me why more people are not attracted into STEM.  Many studies have been done on it.  It is a challenge.  Delivery of science subjects in secondary schools has improved significantly.  I see the kind of curriculum they are developing and so on and I do not believe that the issue necessarily resides there.  Therefore, it must be elsewhere.  There is a disproportionate number of male students coming in to some of the STEM areas as opposed to female students.  There is a need for strong role models.  I wonder if ultimately the difficulty is the attractiveness or identification with careers and future prospects in a number of STEM areas.  Many efforts are going on right across the country to get companies more involved and to show students the types of career possibilities and what the day-to-day work of a scientist, a computing technologist or whatever it might be looks like.  People can relate to games development and other things like that.  It is more difficult when it comes to analytical science.  Given the pandemic and the focus on science and the wonderful achievements in science in the past year, I wonder whether we will see a surge in people coming into the sciences.  I really hope that is the case.  It is a rewarding career but we have to get better at promoting it.</p><p>The regional skills forums that are scattered across the nine regions are working hard on that.  I chaired the forum in the south-east region.  The future of careers is attempting to do that.  We are liaising with and supporting schools and their students to make this choice.  It is a mixture of things.</p><p> I would also say that the facilities in the colleges are a part of that.  If the laboratories are not modern and up to date when students come into the university and they see other areas that are shinier and newer, that is also an issue.  The public private partnership projects are really important.  Carlow's public private partnership is a science building and that is very much geared towards increasing students and graduates in that area.</p></speech>

I echo Mr. Hannigan's comments about welcoming the continued commitments of the technological sector to providing access to education.  I understand that much profile is often given to one access programme but the institutes of technology and technological universities, TUs, have a very strong emphasis on access and always have.  It is fair to say, across a variety of matrices, that Letterkenny probably has one of the best records, if not the best, and that should never be lost.</p> <p>  I will ask a number of questions of our guests, starting with Professor Cusack.  I congratulate her on her appointment.  We are talking here about the future of the TU sector.  The creation of Munster Technological University, MTU, has provided an opportunity for the Cork and Kerry regions and will be transformative.  Those of us from the south east are looking forward to similar developments, as are others in other regions.  We are looking forward to chatting around that issue.  To be slightly parochial, I will come to Dr. Mulcahy and talk about a concern I know that the Chairman shares.  Dr. Mulcahy might provide us with an update on the Wexford campus.  We, across parties, are happy with the progress that is being made towards the TU in the south east.  I certainly think it will be beneficial.</p> <p>  I have a more general question that Professor Cunnane or Dr. Ryan might want to address around the sector.  As they are aware, the national development plan, NDP, is currently being reviewed.  What messages would they be giving to Government on priorities around the review of the NDP?  They will also know that a review is going on around the role of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and university governance.  What are the major changes that our guests would like to see happen in that sector?</p> <p>  I will also follow on from a question asked by Senator Mullen.  We have continued to expand the sector but if additional public funding is not made available, should we then look at a cap on the numbers of students in higher education or allow continued expansion and the possible impact that has on quality?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Maggie Cusack" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021021600002#J00400"><p>I will answer the first of the Senator's questions.  As we said at the start, I consider MTU an incredibly exciting opportunity, with all the changes that we are describing today in the landscape towards TUs.  MTU has a lovely combination of the urban and rural and real synergy can play out in those two sectors in terms of the expertise of individuals, those different communities we serve and all of those industrial links that we have to benefit those across the entire MTU.  I think it will be more than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>  I have received feedback from people on the ground in Cork city who are talking about the level of excitement that we have MTU here and now.  We have University College Cork but there is a different flavour to the offering of a TU and we can really pick up on excitement for the opportunity.  The situation is similar  in Kerry.  A number of people have said to me that people have left because there is no university in the area.  The establishment of MTU really serves Ireland 2040 and its ambitions as they apply to the rural economy and the stickiness in allowing people to stay in the area, be a part of that community and contribute to society and the economy.  There are many positives across that regional footprint and everyone is absolutely committed to building on the strengths of the institutes of technology so that connectedness in the community links with industry and companies and how we can take that and grow it, without diluting it in any way.  We will grow that offering through the cutting edge research and innovation we deliver in co-production with companies.  That will be to the benefit of all of our students and staff now and for generations to come.  That is what we are building here so that long after we are all gone, there are great technological universities delivering in Ireland.</p></speech>

It has been a very long pilot study.  Over that time, we have been operating in leased facilities which have been good as a pilot arrangement but, obviously, at this stage we have outgrown their capacity.  We have almost 1,000 part-time and full-time students currently, with 100 part-time and full-time staff and 250 graduates per annum, up to master's degree level.  The reason I am pointing that out is because I have heard all of the radio dialogue and sometimes when one listens to it, one would think there is nothing in Wexford.  Wexford has that facility but it is time to move it on.</p> <p>  Approximately five years ago, we made a successful case to move it from the pilot stage and to purchase a greenfield site on which we could build a customised campus.  We have, at the moment, a detailed proposal and business case for the Wexford site.  The proposal is with the local authorities in higher education and we are awaiting their decision.  I have seen the Minister's support for that and witnessed it in meetings with him.  He strongly supports it.  I would say that this is the third time we have been here.  We had contracts signed and a deposit paid three years ago but the vendor withdrew.  That took two years out of the five years.  We have looked at many different sites, made strenuous efforts to get a site, and one would hope that we are now very close.  The signs are good and I hope we will have a good result.</p> <p>  I must also say that we would not have been able to get to this point without the support of Wexford County Council.  We will need its support as we take development to the next stage.  We have included the build as part of our submission to the NDP through the HEA.  The HEA took information and priorities from all higher education institutions and the Carlow Institute of Technology has included the Wexford site and the build on it as a part of that.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for the questions.  We have done a substantial submission on the NDP that I will happily share with the Senator.  It obviously links in to the TURN report and determinations.  As the Senator knows, there will be a look at governance.  The Minister has flagged that and I have referenced it.  There are decisions to be made around size, competency and representation and we will be making a contribution to that.</p></speech>

She is not.  It is down to me in that case.  I again welcome the representatives of the TUs before the committee.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke at the outset of the meeting about the transformative effect of TUs on third level education.</p><p>I agree with him on that.  Having the witnesses appear before the committee twice in recent months highlights the importance of what the TUs are doing.</p><p> A question was asked about reform of the leaving certificate.  In the coming weeks, the committee will begin a body of work on reform of the leaving certificate.  This comes at a time of considerable debate on the leaving certificate of 2021 and 2020 as a result of the Covid pandemic.  The leaving certificate has served us well, but we now have a different cohort of students.  I believe the leaving certificate is outdated, beyond its sell-by date and needs reform.  Dr. Ryan may have been offline when Professor Cunnane called on him to come in on the matter.  I would be interested to hear Dr. Ryan's views on reform of the leaving certificate.  In particular, I believe we need to look at ongoing assessment.</p></speech>

I was caught by gremlins and I missed some of the questions.  I will listen back and if there is any follow-up, I will contact members directly.</p> <p>  At the recent launch of Education Matters, the Taoiseach spoke about leaving certificate reform and express the view that the leaving certificate was too inflexible and used a very limited range of assessment.  One of the things the pandemic has taught us educators is that the assessment concentration of the leaving certificate did not sustain in a time of crisis.  This crisis gives us a chance to reflect on this as an instrument and as a measure of what people have achieved, and also as a measure of potential for going on to further education.  We would be very happy to work with the committee on that and we would be delighted to get an invitation to come back to discuss it with the committee.</p></speech>

I am being somewhat parochial in asking about the technological university in the south east and the Wexford campus.  Is Dr. Mulcahy confident that the group will have its application ready for the technological university by the end of April and that it can be in place by January 2022?</p> <p>  On local radio yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Harris, spoke about the TU in the south east and also about the Wexford site.  Buying the site is one thing, but the follow-on investment for infrastructure is required.  The next stage in setting up the TU is deciding what courses and programmes will be available in the Waterford, Carlow and Wexford campuses.  This is a fantastic opportunity for the TU in the south east and, more importantly, for the Wexford campus.  I thank the president of IT Carlow, Dr. Mulcahy, for that institution's commitment to County Wexford over many years.  I have attended all the graduation ceremonies in recent years.  They are absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>  Carlow has given Wexford students the opportunity they would not otherwise have had, had IT Carlow not had the foresight to put in the campus there.  It was a pilot programme 25 years ago; I will not call it a pilot programme now because it has its successes and is absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>  I understand much of this needs to be worked out in the application, with the Minister and through the European assessment on the infrastructure investment, the future programmes for County Wexford and the site in County Wexford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patricia Mulcahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021021600002#K00400"><p>The Chairman has been a great supporter of this development and has been at every conferring during my time in this role at the magnificent Wexford Opera House.  It has always been a wonderful occasion.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, there is a commitment to purchase the site.  Once that is done, we can start the work of designing the first phases and the phased development of the Wexford campus.  That is a critical point to get to.  As I said earlier, all higher education institutions gave details of their priorities under the review of the national development plan and we have included a significant amount for that first phase.  We have made a business case on it to the relevant authorities in education, including the pros and cons of remaining in the leased building and the need for this new development as soon as possible to provide additional facilities to the students to accommodate even our existing 500 and to allow for a threefold increase in the number of students there within the coming decade.  That deals with the build on the site.  </p> <p>  There is much talk about a faculty being located on a particular campus.  That is not the way we are thinking at the moment, but it will be a matter for the new organisation.  We envisage faculties that are cross-campus so that one discipline is not confined to a particular campus but that it can serve the needs of the region.  We already have a good portfolio of programmes available in Wexford that do not exist in our Carlow campus or in our Wicklow campus; they have been customised for Wexford.  That kind of approach will be taken forward.  How the programme portfolio is delivered across the campuses will be a critical decision for the new organisation and will take some time to develop.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's third question, we are fully committed to achieving designation on 1 January 2022.  A number of steps need to happen before that, including the submission of the application.  Both colleges, Waterford IT and IT Carlow, are fully committed to making that deadline.  A significant amount of work remains to be completed in that time, but we are all committed to doing that.  All the staff and students involved in the two colleges are very supportive.  We also have good support from stakeholders.  At this stage we are trying to demonstrate integrated activity and integrated thinking not just across the colleges but across the region.  We are working on that with the help of all the stakeholders in the region and that will make it a success.  As long as that can continue and we can build on that, I would have the confidence that the Chairman asked me about.  </p></speech>

I also thank Senator Byrne for organising the briefings in recent months which have been very beneficial for all the Oireachtas Members from County Wexford.</p> <p>  We will have time for other members to come back in; I do not want to be seen to be hogging the meeting.  I ask Professor Cusack to compare her experience in Scotland with her present position as president of a TU in Ireland.  What are her views on the direction of the TUs?  What can she bring to Ireland from her experiences overseas?  This is a new learning experience for all the TUs and other universities, which is absolutely fantastic.

There is so much that I see that is integrated and part of the fabric of the technological universities about which I am really passionate.</p><p>I am very much from what one might describe as a rough-and-tumble secondary school in Glasgow and my view is that education is genuinely transformative.  This is a passion I have that everyone is committed to delivering.  </p><p> I grew up in an academic system where I would be required to teach, carry out research and do administrative work.  All these things would all be valued and one would be expected to have that broad portfolio.  A lot of things that come through the TURN report that really speak to the highest ambitions of the technological universities are to enable our staff.  The greatest benefit we can achieve is when our staff are self-motivated and driven, not by the hours they work but by what they can achieve and having that possibility to research, develop new knowledge, innovate and make a difference.  The more we can follow the recommendations of the TURN report and get ourselves to a position where we are really delivering on the full potential of the technological universities, the more it will be a really exciting situation for Ireland to find itself in.  I feel very privileged to make my contribution to those endeavours.  </p></speech>

I am at looking at this topic through the lens of the TU in the south east and the opportunities that are there, be they through foreign direct investment, more jobs, allowing people to be educated and work in their own regions.  This is what the TUs are all about.  How do TUs increase and improve their relationship with the IDA in terms of getting more foreign direct investment into the regions?  When companies come to a region, the first thing they look at the educational status of the region - whether there is a university or a technological university there.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Hannigan and Professor Cunnane's views on that.  TUs are all new to the regions.  Where can we and the TUs improve on that?  How can we, as Members of the Oireachtas, improve on that in assisting the witnesses?</p></speech>

It is quite clear that the educational profile of the region is really important from the client's perspective.  The possibility of retaining people in the region is really important as well in terms of giving people a first start and then offering them opportunities to develop within those companies.  The Connacht-Ulster alliance, CUA, consisting of ourselves in Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and GMIT will make an application for TU status imminently.  We believe the growth and strength of the larger organisation will allow us to put even more support behind attracting foreign direct investment to the region.  We have a very strong track record as institutes of technology in terms of our engagement with the companies.  The example I gave earlier was interesting in that we have had no new foreign direct investment client in Donegal for about 20 years but the companies that came in 20 years ago have grown from very small companies that might have employed 100 to 200 people to having over 4,000 people employed in that area.  To me, that is a really strong indicator of the transformative impact of education and the possibility of retaining people in the regions.</p> <p>  The TUs will bring regions closer together.  I know we have always been very competitive with one another throughout the country in terms of the individual institutions competing for students and resources.  As we come together as the bigger technological universities, hopefully, that will dissipate and we will come together stronger as regions to get more resources into the regions.  There is no doubt that we will retain more people from our own regions.  If we look at the current make up of the population of any of our universities or institutes of technology, we can see that it is becoming increasingly a local product in terms of the retention of students within the regions.  This will be even more pronounced once the technological universities are developed.  That will be a really strong sign point for any of the regions regardless of which technological university it is.  </p></speech>

We await the outcome, hopefully some time in March.  We got very little feedback on that but we did get one bit of feedback from the international panel, which met a lot of stakeholders with whom the panel was very impressed because the engagement of the potential of a technological university with external stakeholders is so high.  Mr. Hannigan made a very important point.  The technological universities are redefining the regions of Ireland.  In a sense, the midlands and the mid-west will become a new region that nobody will call the mid-west or midlands.  Whether it is the south east or the CUA, these things are being redefined based around not geographical limitations but access to the technological university sector and what that means.  Ask Joe McGrath of Tipperary County Council about the impact of hopefully soon having university towns in Clonmel or Thurles or ask Clare County Council about the impact of a university town in Ennis, never mind Athlone - Limerick obviously already having a university.  As these are real, deep, meaningful and transformative outcomes of technological university activity, a new chapter remains to be written in terms of regional development in this country.</p></speech>

Mr. Hannigan might comment on cross-border possibilities in the development of the CUA.  I see Brexit as an opportunity for higher education and research even though there are challenges as well.  Mr. Hannigan might talk about that.</p> <p>  In his opening remarks, Dr. Ryan made reference to the borrowing framework.  When we talk about capital development, can we also talk about the development of on-campus student accommodation?  Obviously, this has been quite a big challenge.  Professor Cunnane referred to these university towns and what will make a heart of that will be the development of much-needed on-campus accommodation.  </p></speech>

I noticed the number of people who mentioned EDI, which is really encouraging.  I thank members for that.  It is a priority for all our institutions and our sector.  We are completing a propel project on consent, which we will launching next month.  We see that as being very significant because it has been an integrated and cohesive response from the sector.  We have also set out on delivering the first part of race training, which is around the broader understanding of the race background.  We see this and intersectionality as really important work over the next while.  I acknowledge the work of colleagues on that.  I am delighted to hear Professor Cusack say that this will be sitting right at the top table.</p> <p>  Professor Cunnane addressed the learnings from Covid, which were mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan.  We see that the impact of that has been disproportionate.  The disadvantaged are more impacted.  A lot of very good work has been done cohesively by the sector working with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and its agencies in delivering things like devices etc. for students.  What we also see is disadvantage in terms of broadband access.  I know there is very good work happening through my colleagues in HEAnet and EduCampus to extend that capacity throughout the country.  We should also say that our staff have been hugely supportive with regard to the broader pastoral support for students even at a distance.  We should not forget the professional and management support functions have been hugely important in this role as well.</p><p> Senator Dolan referred to Horizon funding and the disproportionate access to that by our institutions.  She is absolutely right.  That is exactly what the legislation is about.  It is to build the capacity to compete better for European funding.  It is worth noting that over the past few years, 33% of our funding has come from Europe.  Our institutions are performing better on this front.</p><p> In response to Senator Byrne, I would not like to end this meeting without referring to the question that he and Senator Mullen raised about that part of the funding and the balance between quality, access and whether there is a universal right to access higher education.  Ours is a wealthy society and there is a question of what we prioritise and invest in as a society.  Professor Cusack used a lovely word, "stickiness", earlier on.  If we are to empower regions and stay in regions, we will have to invest in that.  The key aspect of what we are doing here today is a plea to the committee for an initial injection of funds to ensure that these technological universities can do exactly what we propose they can do.  Professor Cunnane can answer the Senator's question.</p></speech>

Unlike the university sector, we do not have access to funding to build student accommodation.  All of us would gladly build commercially oriented student accommodation which would allow for on-campus accommodation.  We do not have that privilege because we lack borrowing capacity.  We will never take our seat as equals until the borrowing capacity issue is addressed.  Some &euro;700 million is tied up in the borrowing capacity of the universities.  It has allowed them to diversify their income streams, to attract more international students and to take necessary and innovative steps to increase their funding sources.  It would help with Senator Mullen's approach too.  When members highlight accommodation, they highlight a deeper issue, which is lack of borrowing capacity for this sector.  Even though the capacity is provided for in legislation, it has never been implemented.  It needs to be implemented and it is a key requirement for us to fully realise the technological university ambition.</p></speech>

A benefit of Brexit is that it has brought political focus back to the Border.  There is not much benefit to Brexit, as everybody can see, but from our perspective, being selfish about it, it has brought our focus back to the Border.  We are focused on it in the north-west city region with Letterkenny and Derry city.  We also see that it can pay off with an ongoing injection from the Connacht-Ulster Alliance.  That level of activity will continue and we are involved very much in cross-Border activity.</p> <p>  Senator Mullen referred to student loans.  I accidentally came across a tweet from somebody last night, which states: "After 10.5 years and roughly &pound;21,000 of debt- I finally paid off the last instalment of my student loan today."  That is a fairly strong argument.  The person who wrote the tweet goes on to develop it further but it gives an indication of the level of debt that people can incur.  He goes on to suggest that with the increase in fees in the UK, that debt could be around &pound;50,000 or &pound;60,000 for students leaving now as opposed to when he was going to college.</p></speech>

It is important to make clear that it is not a question of one possible model or no model at all.  Professor Cusack was invited by Professor Cunnane to address this as well but I had run out of time.  If Professor Cusack has some thoughts on this, I would like to hear them.  In response what Mr. Hannigan said, I would have thought it was possible to tailor a system so that lower-paid graduates in areas such as nursing are not penalised.  One can imagine a system where repayment comes into play once certain income levels are reached and that the rate depends on the income level a person has attained.  The glaring problem in our country is probably not so much that people will be unable to pay back student loans but that graduates will not be able to afford houses.  That is a significant question but it does not take away from the merits of considering the question of student loans in a suitably tailored form.  I am not doctrinaire on this point.  I am interested in a free-flowing debate on the issue.  Perhaps Professor Cusack might have something to say.</p> <p>  On the issue relating to STEM that I raised when I asked about quality and whether our education system is in some way lacking, I note what Dr. Mulcahy had to say.  Do people have a view on whether aptitude tests at an early stage of the second level experience are a good indicator of people's capacity?  The witnesses are already telling me with their heads.</p></speech>

To categorise people at early stages in their lives, whether it is the eleven-plus in the UK or other matters, is totally contrary to the ethos of the regional technological colleges, the institutes of technology and the new technological universities.  We do not believe that people reach their potential at a particular age.  We believe that they reach it at various junctures in life due to life experiences and financial and other reasons.  We as a sector are always there for them when they are ready for us.</p></speech>

I will speak personally.  It is my firmly held belief, which I will try to back up with evidence, that that is not how we should do things.  The Senator rightly says that we should try to get more girls into STEM.  They are subject to other external forces at that time of life.  Why do girls give up sport when they come to second level?  External peer pressure is a factor.  These issues cannot be resolved by a simple test but are complex and societal in nature.  We should hold open the opportunity for people to explore all avenues until they are ready to make that decision.  The beauty of the leaving certificate, for all its limitations, is that it is a broad-based examination which explores that and allows people to see where their real aptitude is, but that comes later.  I do not like the idea of categorising people and limiting opportunities at earlier stages.  We will look into that as a sector and come back with some evidence.</p></speech>

My experience is of the Scottish system.  Education is a devolved matter and is not reserved for Westminster.  That means that we have a complex situation where Scotland states that students will not pay fees but can have access to a loan.  They have the bond for their accommodation and living expenses, so students still finish with debt but it is not on the scale that students south of the border have, where, when they came in initially, the fees were &pound;9,000, the highest in Europe.</p><p>We then had a complex situation where we had home students, EU students, who are in a similar situation, and then what are described as "rest of UK" students.  There were, therefore, all sorts of fee structures going on there.</p><p> I spoke about my passion and the fact that education is genuinely transformative.  That is a debate for a society to have.  We must ask if we genuinely want to have a meritocracy and is that what we are willing to support.  I hope the answer would be "Yes".  We must think about how we best achieve that.  This is a huge topic and one that warrants a lot of careful discussion to really understand as a society which direction we want to take.  In England, the decision was made, as the committee knows, almost over a weekend.  It is not as if the situation there is similar to the one in the United States where people can decide when their baby is born if they are going to invest for college fees.  That was not an option.  One then starts to see real differences in who can and cannot access quality education.  That is a big societal debate.</p></speech>

I look forward to seeing it in mid-March.  On education being open for all, I spoke to the regional skills forum recently, which pointed out that our education model is quite open.  The graduates who come through the system have a very broad understanding of many subjects which is then pinpointed at third level.  It must be open for all and I very much appreciate the apprenticeship model in further education and reaching NFQ level through many different ways.  The advanced manufacturing in GMIT was mentioned as was how we can support students to reach career choice by many different paths.  That is what is so amazing and wonderful about the TUs.</p></speech>

The committee may rest assured on that.</p> <p>  If I could say a last couple of words, I thank everybody for their involvement.  As Dr. Ryan said, there are a number of issues on which we will follow up.  This sector that has transformed not just Irish education but Ireland.  It has been in existence for more than 50 years, having started as regional training centres, RTCs, before becoming institutes of technology and now technological universities.  We have responded to the needs of Ireland and shaped the type of Ireland we have today.  We are still doing that through our access and other issues.  We have remnants of the RTCs still in operation and as we move forward, those remnants must be eradicated if we are to realise the full ambition.</p> <p>  On finance, we must ensure we have money for research and a borrowing capacity.  There are contract issues that need to be resolved but we also have no academic promotion within our sector.  These issues are related and hugely important.  This whole session is about the future of the TUs and how we realise our ambition for them.  There are limitations on us, which were imposed by historical issues that were never fully addressed.  Until those issues are addressed, our ambition and the committee's ambition for the technological sector experiment will not be realised.  Let us ensure it turns out to be a highly successful one.  We are all behind it and thank the committee for its time and effort in this space.</p></speech>

Growing up in the UK system, there was no doubt the UK punched way above its weight in terms of securing research funding from the EU.  That provides an opportunity.  Nothing is automatic but I emphasise everything we said about using the technological university transformation fund to upskill and support staff and to use any pump-priming initiative that might come from the Irish Research Council to help technological university staff compete for funding.  That would have multiple benefits in upskilling researchers and then putting them in a position where they can be really competitive to lead on large European grants.  The sector could then realise the benefits afforded to it.</p></speech>

We would prefer if witnesses could attend in person but hopefully when we all get our vaccinations, we will be able to gather in person once more.</p></speech>

I welcome European Commission Vice-President Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi to our meeting today.  We welcome our engagement this morning and the opportunity to ask questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the Commission triggering Article 16 before it made a U-turn on the decision.</p> <p>  Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give.   </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask that all members participating via Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making a contribution.  </p> <p>  I call on Vice-President &Scaron;efovi to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will begin with a very general but also fundamental remark.  Members understand best that the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union presents unique and significant challenges for the island of Ireland.  They will also know very well that the United Kingdom not only decided to leave the European Union but also the Single Market and the customs union.  We have been working very hard to find all the solutions to the problems which these decisions have brought about.</p> <p>  The solution that we found to address these challenges is the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is the only way to protect the Good Friday-Belfast Agreement in all its dimensions, preserving peace, stability and preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland while preserving the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, that is, the entire island of Ireland, has been the core of the discussions on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom and it remains the centrepiece of the new relationship of the Union with the United Kingdom as a third country.  This was clearly the most difficult part of all the Brexit negotiations, especially on the withdrawal agreement and only the complete unity of all EU member states and the European Union actually guaranteed the success in concluding the withdrawal agreement and developing the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  I assure the committee that the full, faithful and effective implementation of the protocol is of paramount importance to the Union and it constitutes a top priority for EU-UK relations. </p> <p>  There can be no doubt that the Union is and remains fully committed to the protocol and its full and faithful implementation.</p><p>Nothing, including the events two weeks ago, can put into question our commitment and determination to make this one solution work.  When we speak about Article 16, particularly with regard to 29 January, I would like to be very clear.  The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision and we deeply regret this.  However, in the end, in a matter of three hours we got it right.  Article 16 was never activated.  I reassure the committee that the Commission has learned its lesson and it will do its utmost to protect peace in Northern Ireland, as it has done throughout the entire Brexit process.  I am sure committee members will ask me how can I prove or guarantee this.  The best proof is our track record of unwavering political, economic and financial support for the peace process since the Belfast Agreement was signed and agreed upon.  There is also how we conducted the entire Brexit negotiation process.  I would like to underscore the fact that Ireland and Northern Ireland were not only on our minds all the time but also in our hearts.  Therefore, I believe we achieved a very good result.</p><p> We should also look forward, and this is what our discussion should also be about.  We need to make sure that mistakes are not repeated.  To this end, the European Commission has set up a clearing house where all of the issues with an impact on the UK, Ireland and Northern Ireland will be assessed and evaluated.</p><p> There is also the commitment that I will continue permanent contact with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and representatives of Ireland.  Together with Mr. Michael Gove, we decided to establish a hotline so we can be in frequent touch and, hopefully, deal with problems when they are still at a technical level so they do not reach a political dimension.  I realise the relationship between the EU and UK and proper implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland require day-to-day care.</p><p> I also want to highlight that my priority is still the same as it was throughout the last year, which is that the protocol must work well on the ground.  As committee members know, I received a letter from Mr. Michael Gove a couple of weeks ago in which he presented a high number of requests for additional flexibilities.  Here again, I want to stress that our commitment to the protocol is unwavering but we must also understand that implementation of the protocol is a shared responsibility and it must always be a two-way street.  Therefore, we also have to recognise the fact that we knew from the beginning that the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, customs union and Single Market is a massive operation and it is not possible to prevent all of the disruption.  We do our best, and we are working on it, to minimise the negative impact on the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland but it was quite obvious from the beginning that there will be teething problems.  I believe we can resolve them if we work very well together.</p><p> This was my response to various proposals coming from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. Gove.  I wanted to underline that before any discussion of additional extended flexibilities took place we also needed to make sure that the UK does its part.  We would like to see more information on how border crossings are being built and when they will be finally operational.  As we still do not have real-time access to the IT systems, it is very difficult for us to judge whether the trusted trader scheme, which the United Kingdom has insisted upon, works or not and how many businesses actually benefit from it.  Because we do not have access to the IT system, we still do not know whether the simplified export health certificate is being used and how complicated it is. Therefore, I decided, together with Mr. Gove, that we will have direct outreach to Northern Irish business leaders and Northern Irish civic society representatives.  These meetings will take place on Thursday.  I am very glad the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was kind enough to organise a meeting with a Brexit stakeholders group by the end of this week.  We want to listen and learn and work on solutions.  I also would also like to make clear that for overall success, we need close co-operation with the UK.</p><p> I will now make some points on what we agreed with Mr. Gove at our last meeting in person.  We adopted the joint statement and I am very happy about it.  It went in a very constructive way.  We have been very open and frank with each other, as we always are, but we agreed first and foremost to reiterate full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and proper implementation of the protocol.  We also made clear that we would spare no effort to implement the solutions mutually agreed on 17 December because they form the foundation of our co-operation.  We also agreed that we would intensify the work of the specialised committee on the protocol in order to address all outstanding issues, with the shared objective of finding workable solutions on the ground.  Therefore, the meetings, which we planned for the end of this week, will be very important for Mr. Gove, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and for me.  We also want to have the joint committee, which is the proper body to address all of these issues, meet no later than 24 February.  As I speak, our expert teams are talking.  I hope we will have a specialised committee on the protocol doing its work by the end of this week so we can be well prepared for the discussion of the joint committee next week.</p><p> I know the committee has limited time for introductory remarks.  I will stop here because I know the Chair and committee members will have questions and comments.  I am, of course, very eager to hear them.  I hope this will be one of a series of meetings we will have where we can discuss issues linked to Brexit, the implementation of the protocol and the later stage of what I hope will be successful implementation.  I thank members for their invitation and for their attention.</p></speech>

I will go straight into questions and, with the agreement of members and Vice-President &Scaron;efovi, I will take members individually and ask the Commissioner to respond to each member on an individual basis.  I encourage everybody to keep it tight, specific and efficient and we may get a chance to come in a second time.</p></speech>

Commissioner &Scaron;efovi is very welcome to the meeting this morning.  We appreciate his time with us today.  I listened very carefully to his opening comments and I fully appreciate and accept that he understands the importance of the Northern Ireland protocol.  He referred to it as a centrepiece of the Brexit negotiations.  He accepts and understands that a mistake was made on behalf of the Commission and that that mistake was colossal and had huge political implications for the island of Ireland, North and South.  We hear the Commissioner on that point.  What we are still trying to figure out, and what we are very keen to hear from him this morning, are the events that led to the Commissioner making that decision.  Did he make it alone?  Did he consult with his Commission colleagues, with the President or other Commissioners?  When did he inform the other Commissioners of his intention to invoke Article 16?  This is the crucial piece of information we require from him this morning.</p> <p>  To move on from this point, the Commissioner referred to the joint partnership council and its work in implementing the Brexit deal for the foreseeable future.  Concerns are being raised in Northern Ireland and I want to make the point strongly that the election lines have now been drawn in Northern Ireland.</p><p>We now know the key issue on which the Assembly election in Northern Ireland will be fought, namely, the question of whether one is for the protocol or against the protocol.  That will be a key factor in the next election.  While I think that would have happened in any event, the Commission's seeking to invoke Article 16 has certainly brought that issue into clear focus.  The concerns that have been raised concern trade in Northern Ireland and the clear problems there in importing goods into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.  I believe - I acknowledge Mr. &Scaron;efovi himself has said this - that those issues are fixable, that they are teething problems, but we would like to hear from him this morning what the Commission and the European Union will do to address those concerns and difficulties that we can address and fix.  Can he assure us this morning that he will make addressing those trade issues for Northern Ireland a key priority?</p><p> Does the Commissioner believe that a member state should be consulted in advance of invoking Article 16?  Does he think Ireland should have been consulted before the Commission made that decision?</p><p> My final point is that we now have an impending vote on the consent mechanism in the Northern Ireland protocol.  I want to know, from Mr. &Scaron;efovi's perspective and the Commission's perspective, what the Commission will do to ensure that that vote is successful and in favour of maintaining the protocol.  As we have all said, getting agreement on that point was the most difficult part of the negotiations.  Without the protocol there is nothing else to avoid a border on the island of Ireland.  That is all that is on the table.  If it is removed, there is nothing left.  We therefore need to do everything we can to address that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021021600002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Chambers for her questions.  I was noting them down so I hope I will not skip any of them.</p> <p>  We did not take the decision.  Article 16 was never triggered.  To describe a little to the Senator the situation on that fateful Friday, the primary objective of the day's work was to make sure that Europe was getting its fair share of vaccines.  We are the major producer of the vaccines and we had a feeling we were not always getting our fair share from the production, which takes place in the European Union.  We felt we had this very important agreement signed, we had invested a lot in the vaccine development and we simply did not have enough transparency as to where these vaccines were going.  That was the idea behind the export authorisation scheme and, therefore, this was the thrust of the proposal which was on the table.  As I said, the mistake was made but once we realised it on the political level, and there had been immediate contacts with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well as with the UK, we corrected it before it had been activated, before it was adopted, within three hours.  We made a mistake, we acknowledged it and we corrected it.  Therefore, this also has to be viewed in this context and, as I pleaded in my opening remarks, on the grounds of our track record.  We have always been very loyal in the EU with Ireland and Northern Ireland in supporting the peace process and stability.  Looking at the withdrawal agreement negotiations, I hope I am not exaggerating when I say 70% or 80% of the time was devoted just to find a solution in the form of the Northern Irish protocol.  In addition, it is now the key point upon which the future relationship with the UK and with Northern Ireland will be based.  We made the mistake but I ask the committee to take it into the perspective of how close the relations between the EU and all EU member states that supported this very complex decision have become and how strong the support Ireland and Northern Ireland always got from the EU is.</p> <p>  Coming to the other issues concerning trade and, as Senator Chambers rightly pointed out, the issues linked with the daily lives of the citizens in Ireland and Northern Ireland, here we did our utmost to the extent possible to limit or minimise the disruption or negative consequences of the UK leaving not only the EU but also, as I said, the Single Market and the customs union.  It seems to have come as a surprise to many that the UK, as of 1 January, is a third country.  Different suggestions we have made throughout the negotiation - remaining part of the Single Market and remaining part of the customs union - have been rejected, so we had to find a new solution based on the United Kingdom's wish to have a relationship as between sovereign equals.  Therefore, we are now in a much more complex relationship.</p> <p>  If the Chairman will allow me one additional point, we look, unfortunately, at the protocol very often as an obstacle and a problem.  I am 100% convinced, being part of these negotiations, that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is the only solution to resolve to the best possible level the problems on the island of Ireland linked with the peace, stability and the avoidance of a hard border.  I hope our next session with the committee will allow us to focus on the future and on the fact that, as I see it, this protocol is an opportunity for Northern Ireland business leaders to benefit from the fact that they are part of the Single Market and at the same time, of course, part of the UK internal market.  I think that represents a lot of opportunities.  Now, however, we are at the early stage, where the adaptation of economic life is needed, certain rules are just kicking in and we see that it is administratively extremely challenging.  We are fully aware of that and, therefore, when we had this very intense negotiation with the UK in December, we fully understood that it is not that easy to change or develop the IT database from one day into another.  Therefore, we had full understanding of the export health certificates and even some additional experience because we realised that they need time to adapt.  This is the time to adapt because they insisted on a particular state of our co-operation and on a particular model.  Therefore, it is the joint responsibility of the UK and the EU to make the protocol work and to be very pragmatic.  I am solution-driven and can promise the committee I will do my utmost to look for a workable solution on the ground which will be good for the people but which, at the same time, will of course protect the integrity of the Single Market and be supported by the member states and the European Parliament.</p></speech>

Without intervening at this stage, I will say there has to be some clarification.  There is an acceptance that the President, Ursula von der Leyen, apologised for triggering Article 16.  I know that the language being used today is that it was never activated.  We all accept that it was not fully implemented but there has to be an acknowledgement that Article 16 was triggered.  We are grateful for everything the European Union and our partners have done to get us to where we are in terms of the Northern Ireland protocol and the deal that was done, but we are trying to focus today on the process that led to the decision that Friday afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.706" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021021600002#C00400"><p>I thank the Commissioner for his comments.  I will not add to the Chairman's remarks or to those of Senator Chambers other than to say I agree fully.  Interestingly, the Commissioner said in his remarks that he would like to look to the future.  Part of that - and this was alluded to by Senator Chambers - is the possibility, when it comes to Article 16 and a potential future triggering, of an early warning system for the member state most affected, namely, Ireland.</p><p>Senator Chambers asked the Commission Vice-President if he would commit that a member state would be made aware.  However, for clarity, can the Commission Vice-President guarantee that an early warning system is being prepared?  We have heard reference to it from the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney.  That is crucially important.  Everyone makes mistakes but, as the Chairman stated, it is how one learns from those mistakes that is important.</p><p> The Commission Vice-President mentioned the need at the next meeting of the joint implementation committee for the United Kingdom to follow up on its responsibilities.  I welcome that and fully agree with him.  However, would he agree that, in future, it would be opportune if the European Commission and the United Kingdom agreed a set timetable of meetings between him and Michael Gove, as well as set meetings of the committee itself?  This is so these meetings are not, as is sometimes portrayed in media outlets, watershed moments where everything is hyped up, the drama is increased and people are waiting on tenterhooks.  If we knew that every month the Commission Vice-President and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, were to meet, be it virtually or in person, that would be really important.</p><p> Senator Chambers alluded to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I accept fundamentally the Commission Vice-President's responsibility as a member of the European Commission is to the European Union and to us as parliamentarians of a member state.  However, the Northern Irish protocol directly impacts on Northern Ireland.  Would the Commission Vice-President commit, as Senator Chambers said, to engaging to point out the positive benefits of the protocol in Northern Ireland?  It would be really useful, as he is appearing here this morning, and we are very grateful for his presence, if he met with the executive committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I appreciate that it is Michael Gove's remit, but there is a huge opportunity for the European Commission and the European Union to play a very proactive role.  It is something that would be welcomed.  Many people who have concerns about the protocol, or are flat-out against it, have said they feel that their voices are not being listened to in Dublin, Brussels and elsewhere.  However, if we provide them with the opportunity to have their voices heard, even though strictly it should be provided by Michael Gove, that could go a long way to de-escalating much of the tension relating to the protocol.</p></speech>

It is very kind of him.  I thank him for his question and the subsequent questions from the committee.  First and foremost, I would like to say that all channels are open.  After that Friday, I was ready to have immediate meetings with First Minister, Arlene Foster, and deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill.  At the same time, having fully realised how sensitive and political all these issues had become, I consulted with Chancellor Michael Gove to make sure that we would have a proper meeting organised.  I clearly underlined my availability at any time.  In the end, the suggestion from the Chancellor was that we should meet on Wednesday, which was a couple of days later.  I was hoping for an earlier meeting to discuss all these pertinent and very sensitive matters, but we had a very open and frank discussion about which I am sure the committee is very well informed.</p> <p>  I can tell the committee that since then, if I am not mistaken, I was in the European Parliament seven times explaining our action and proposing the way forward.  I met three times with the ambassadors of all the member states and this issue has also been discussed with the ministers for foreign affairs.  I am in almost daily contact with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, for whom I have very high respect.  What I can promise the committee is that any mechanism we establish will be based on this horizontal overview of the clearing house within the Commission, where not only our Irish partners but also the political level of the Commission will get the early warning about potentially difficult issues.  We are communicating with our Irish partners on a daily basis.</p> <p>  The outreach suggested by the honourable member was also my suggestion to Chancellor Gove when we discussed these issues over the phone for the first time.  It is very important to hear from Northern Irish business leaders and civic society how they see the protocol, to convince them that we are absolutely convinced this is the best way forward and to listen to what they see as the key issues.  It is then our joint responsibility, along with Michael Gove, to be very honest with them about what we can fix or repair which would still be in line with EU legislation and the fact the UK has left the Single Market, the customs union and the EU.  If there are practical, pragmatic possibilities on how to solve the problem, I am sure we will find them.</p> <p>  However, it is also important to get support from Ireland to make it clear to our UK partners that it is a two-way street.  There has to be engagement and delivery from their side.  They knew very well that 1 January was coming.  We proposed an extension of the transitional period which was not accepted.  Therefore, we are now in the difficult implementation period where the border crossing points are not fully operational and we still do not have access to the IT customs system, which makes it very difficult for us to carry out all the necessary checks and controls.  However, I am extremely thankful for the good co-operation on the ground between our experts on customs phytosanitary controls and their Northern Irish counterparts.  The inter-human, professional relationships are very good.  They are learning from each other and they are working together.  I am glad that we found a way to resolve the security and safety issues so they can carry out their duties because they are very important for the future of our relationship.</p> <p>  I am also ready to engage with the Irish Brexit stakeholder group.  I think it will happen this week.  As I said, we will be meeting the civic society and business leaders of Northern Ireland this Thursday.  As regards the Northern Ireland Executive, I am open to all the meetings but am trying to follow good order in organising things and respecting all the internal arrangements of the UK.  Therefore, the counterpart for the EU and for me is Michael Gove.  If he engages in organising such a direct exchange with the Northern Ireland Executive, I will be there for sure.  I am ready to listen, to explain what we can do together and look for the best solution for the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland.</p></speech>

There is an absolute understanding and an enormous appreciation of the solidarity the member states of the European Union have shown to Ireland during the Brexit negotiations.  That is absolutely understood.  It underscored the degree of shock that happened, politically, when it was announced late on a Friday evening that Article 16 of the Northern Ireland treaty was to be enacted.  That really sent shockwaves.  Unfortunately, the harm done continues.  It was not a single event and I know that is appreciated.</p><p>Forgive me for going back to trying to understand the process.  In his presentation, Commissioner &Scaron;efovi said mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision.  We are trying to understand what mistakes were made.  Commissioner &Scaron;efovi went on to say that it was undone when political level awareness happened.  How can such a fundamental issue happen without political awareness?  Who made the decision and who signed off on it, politically?  We need to understand, so that the processes of decision making will improve into the future.</p><p> I refer to the clearing house mechanism Commissioner &Scaron;efovi.  Who constitutes that clearing house?  Where is it?  How will it be put into operation, in reference to member states and Commission members?  How will that work?</p><p> I refer to the Commissioner's ongoing dialogue with Michael Gove.  He rightly talked about the future because the protocol is a settlement that will not be removed.  We need to work out the detail of its implementation.  Commissioner &Scaron;efovi mentioned real-time access to UK customs being an outstanding UK action.  What other UK actions in the protocol are yet to be implemented?  What technical issues has Commissioner &Scaron;efovi discussed with Michael Gove that can be sorted?  Is it in Commissioner &Scaron;efovi's mind to have a further derogation in the timelines for the full implementation of the protocol?</p><p> I wish to expand on Deputy Richmond's question on how we achieve ongoing dialogue.  We have been grappling with the UK leaving the European Union and how we can have much closer political interaction.  One of the processes is the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I do not know if Commissioner &Scaron;efovi is aware of it.  It may be useful for Commissioner &Scaron;efovi or the Commission to present to the economic committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly the benefits to Northern Ireland of being part of the Single Market and the United Kingdom's internal market.</p></speech>

I repeat that no decision was taken.  Article 16 was not activated.  It was a draft proposal which was quickly corrected.  It would be better not to engage in the blame game anymore.  We acknowledge the mistake was made and we have apologised.  It is important to look to the future and at how we can work constructively together to guarantee the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland the benefits and possibilities the protocol presents for new business opportunities, jobs and economic growth, if one focuses on that aspect.  </p> <p>  The clearing house is the structure we are setting up in the Commission.  It is also because of the enormity of the trade and co-operation agreement.  The implementation of the agreement requires 19 specialised committees.  For example, transport will be covered by three of them.  There will be massive implementation work to be carried out.  Of course, it has to be co-ordinated and properly organised.  Therefore, we need several things.  </p> <p>  Each Commissioner will now have one cabinet member who will look after our relationship with the UK and implementation of the protocol.  The Commissioners, the Directorates-General, and our secretariat general will serve as a clearing house to have horizontal oversight and make sure we are well co-ordinated.  Once the issues are properly identified, they will be brought to the attention of the political level.</p> <p>  We have regular meetings with member states.  There are expert meetings of an EU-UK Brexit working party.  I am in the European Parliament on a biweekly basis, in briefings and discussing the issues with the UK co-ordination group.  This now an almost regular item on the agenda of ministers for European affairs and will continue as such.</p> <p>  What are the shortcomings I pointed out to Michael Gove in our conversation and my response to his prior communication?  The first thing which is very important for the integrity of the Single Market is the border control posts.  I have to say they are not yet fully operational.  Official controls at the border control posts, BCPs, are not performed in compliance with the withdrawal agreement protocol and European Union rules.  We see few identity checks and a limited number of physical checks, other than on live animals, fish and plants.  We agreed on certain packaging labels, including UK health certificate declarations and so forth, which, again, is not done as we agreed.</p> <p>  It is very important for everyone involved in trade to work on making customs clearance and operations as smooth as possible.  We need fully operational border control posts, BCPs, but also access to IT systems as agreed and as the UK unilaterally declared it would do in December.  We still do not have access to real time operations in IT systems.  The most important ones for us are import clearance systems, CDS, which would help us to better assess how the trusted trader scheme or simplified health certificates are being used.</p> <p>  The trusted trader scheme was one of the key asks of the UK in our November and December discussions because it believes it will be possible to guarantee supermarkets in Northern Ireland are fully supplied through this scheme.  We agreed to that but we do not know how much this scheme is used.  We agreed on a simplified version of the health certificates but we do not know how this flexibility is being used, due to non-access to IT systems.</p> <p>  We have been creative when it comes to exports from Northern Ireland to Great Britain.  We agreed we would use the ferry documents but they had to contain the equivalent information, which the export declaration would usually have.  This is also not happening.  I could go on and on about parcels, mail and so on.</p><p>This is also an odd happening.  I can go on and on about the parcels, the mail and so on.  There are many things that we agreed we would do.  We did our utmost on our side.  Now we also need the response from the UK authorities so we can really assess how these flexibilities are working.  Have they been sufficient?  What is the problem on the ground and how can we find the solution?</p><p> Concerning the ongoing dialogue, as I said, it is quite clear that the EU-UK-Ireland-Northern Ireland relationship requires day-to-day care.  We must all be focused on it and we need to do our best.  An important part of that is having frank and open communication.  I am ready to be part of such discussions.  I have already mentioned several times the meetings and discussions we will have this week.  If there is an invitation to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of course, I would be very happy to participate and provide the necessary answers.  That is the response to Deputy Howlin's questions.</p></speech>

Like all my colleagues I acknowledge the record of the Commission in supporting Ireland since the Brexit vote.  Indeed in 2017 Mr.  Barnier spoke in this Chamber and addressed a joint session of the D&aacute;il and Seanad which is a rare honour.  It was a recognition of his role and also the importance of the matter.  In his remarks the Vice-President said that Northern Ireland was on the mind and in the hearts of the Commission during the negotiations.  While that is true, it was not so on 29 January.  I know he does not want to engage in that and does not want to engage in what he sees as a blame game.  Our job here is parliamentary scrutiny of our relationship with the European Union institutions.  We would be remiss in our job if we did not pursue what happened in the days leading up to 29 January.  I am concerned that he has not engaged with my colleagues who have previously asked about those issues.  It is part of our job to try to get there.</p> <p>  The Vice-President said Article 16 was never activated.  With complete respect I say he is splitting hairs because the signal was given that it would be activated.  Were it not for the intervention of the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, it probably would have been activated.  However, giving the signal was enough to do the damage my colleagues have mentioned.  Who inserted the signal into the documentation?</p> <p>  We are led to understand that notification was given to Commissioners and their cabinets half an hour before it became public.  Will the Vice-President confirm if that is true?  Was notification given to individual commissioners or their cabinets before it was published?  Was it the Vice-President or the president who was involved in inserting the original signalling of the article in the document?  The export process was signalled for a number of days.  Therefore, presumably the intention to trigger Article 16 was being discussed beforehand.  It is our job to try to understand that so that it does not happen again.  That brings me to my second question.</p> <p>  I accept the Vice-President has very strong personal relationships with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and other officials.  However, particularly in politics, people move on, as we know.  Article 16 will still be there and the protocol will still be there.  I welcome the Vice-President's reiteration of support for the protocol.  We need a permanent mechanism that will withstand the changes in personnel and will withstand the changes in relationships between the Commission and a potential future government.  Senator Chambers and other colleagues have put it to the Vice-President that there should be a formal mechanism involving the Irish Government, and dare I say it the Northern Ireland Executive, such that when Article 16 is to be discussed, and it is to be hoped it will never be triggered again, the Commission cannot do so on its own and cannot even signal that it will be done without the co-operation and consent of the Irish Government and by consultation with the Northern Ireland Executive.  I ask the Vice-President to give us his thoughts on a more permanent solution that is not based solely on personal relationships, which are important but transient.  If we are to avoid the damage that has occurred on our island as a consequence of what happened on 29 January, we need a permanent reaction.</p> <p>  I reiterate that we acknowledge the support.  However, the committee's job is parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the Vice-President and of the Commission.  We have a responsibility to our colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the people we represent to get to the detail of what happened on 29 January and on the days leading to that date so that the committee can make recommendations to ensure it does not happen again.  It is not a blame game; we are doing our job.</p></speech>

I think I repeated myself several times and I can do it here.  What happened in that week was that we had been under enormous pressure to ensure the European Union gets its fair share of vaccines.  I will put it into perspective, and I ask the Deputy not to take me wrong here.  When it came to the latest crisis triggered by Covid-19, within just a few months we adopted more than 1,000 legal acts.  Therefore, it might happen that mistakes are committed in this way.  This was the case also on that Friday.</p> <p>  In the draft which was presented where purely the vaccination element was covered, an administrative mistake was made.  I want to make it 100% clear that this article was never activated.  There was immediate communication between the Taoiseach, the President, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and me.  I fully respect the committee's right to scrutiny and that it is doing its job.  I understand that and therefore I am participating in this discussion and doing my best to explain to the committee the state of mind and how the decisions were taken on that date.</p> <p>  I also want to reaffirm once again, as I did on that occasion, that the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland remains unaffected by the European measures to ensure transparency of vaccine exports.  These measures will never entail a hard border on the island of Ireland.  In addition, this has been acknowledged several times today by me and by the President of the European Commission in the European Parliament and on multiple other occasions.</p> <p>  At this stage what is important is to ensure that we avoid anything like this happening in the future.  Therefore, we are setting up the new mechanism within the Commission.  I can absolutely promise the committee that we will respect fully all the elements linked with Article 16.  I agree with the Deputy; we also hope that we would never trigger it.  For that to happen, there are very precise ways how to do it, what the consultation time should be and how it should be discussed.  Of course, Ireland will always be consulted on this issue especially if there are sensitivities concerning the Northern Ireland protocol.</p><p>If asked, the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs would confirm that we have absolutely open channels of communication.  Ireland's permanent representatives in Brussels are fully informed about what we do.  We are working together to get out of the current situation and to ensure the protocol is properly implemented.</p><p> Speaking of scrutiny, I will be very happy to meet the committee again at a time it finds convenient to outline how we have learned from the mistakes, how we are implementing the protocol and how we are dealing with many challenges.  The change is fundamental.  The transition that is needed is massive and the number of issues for which we need to look for solutions is enormous.  It is a also a matter of having a standing relationship between the Irish Parliament, the Commission and me.  I would also be very happy to facilitate interaction with the Commissioners who are leading on certain files and areas that are important to the implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement.  I would very much like to underscore our willingness to have permanent engagement, to ensure we understand each other well, and to have the lines of communication always open in order to discuss any matter the Irish Parliament or the Irish feel is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.717" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021021600002#G00200"><p>I thank Vice-President &Scaron;efovi.  I welcome him warmly.  His presence is very much appreciated.</p> <p>  Everyone agrees that the decision by the European Commission to invoke Article 16 as part of the vaccine export authorisation scheme was a huge error of judgment.  It would not have happened had the Commission taken the time to consult any of its Irish colleagues.  I listened to Mr. &Scaron;efovi's comments to the effect that mistakes were made.  Regrets have been stated and apologies have been offered.  I commend Mr. &Scaron;efovi on attending today.  It speaks volumes about the commitment of the EU to the Irish protocol and its protection.  It is imperative that the Commission examine the decision-making process to ensure what happened does not happen again.  This meeting is an integral part of that process.  While Mr. &Scaron;efovi outlined some of the measures that will be put in place and touched on the clearing house mechanism to ensure that what happened will not recur, it is unfortunate that he did not answer the key questions that a number of my colleagues have put to him.  The questions concern learning from the mistake and the matter of who made the decision to invoke Article 16.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi outlined the rationale as to why it was considered, but the critical part has not been addressed.  I look forward to our ongoing engagement on the structures that will be put in place, such as the clearing house mechanism, and I hope we will have Mr. &Scaron;efovi before us again to scrutinise these measures.</p> <p>  It is unfortunate, but all too predictable, that forces have seized on the error of judgment for local political purposes in the North.  The DUP has always been opposed to the Good Friday Agreement.  This is part of the reason for its support of Brexit and its opposition to the protocol.  It is also the reason for the opposition to the protocol, for wider strategic purposes, of the British Government.  It is crucial that action be taken to de-escalate the situation as it stands.  It is time for calm heads to prevail.  We need to stabilise the circumstances in the North and to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is protected.  The experience of the Irish when dealing with the British has been that they are fundamentally untrustworthy.  It is their practice to reach an agreement and immediately ignore key parts of it.  Examples are the non-implementation of the citizenship provisions of the Good Friday agreement, the language Act section of the St. Andrews Agreement and the legacy proposals of the Stormont House Agreement.</p> <p>There is a tendency to start negotiating the dilution of agreements immediately.  Therefore, I urge vigilance in the implementation of all agreements, including the withdrawal and trade and co-operation agreements.</p> <p>  Not all issues in Ireland have been resolved.  Some of these have been discussed here this morning.  The all-Ireland economy is still being damaged by the removal of the free movement of EU nationals, limits to cross-Border services and, indeed, divergence on labour standards and workers' rights.  Given the likelihood of an Irish unity referendum in the coming years, it is important that the EU be prepared for it.  Part of this involves keeping the North as close as possible in regulatory terms.  This will make it easier to bring the North back into the EU if there is a successful referendum on unity, as I believe will be the case.  The EU needs to work with the anti-Brexit parties in the Northern Executive.  In this regard, there is a particularly significant role for Ms Michelle O'Neill, the joint First Minister, who is from the largest anti-Brexit party.</p> <p>  I have a number of proposals that I would like to put to Mr. &Scaron;efovi for his consideration.  I would appreciate his comments on them.  The first concerns the granting of MEP observer status to representatives from the North of Ireland.  Representatives could also participate in the European Committee of the Regions.  We should consider MLAs in this regard.  I propose representation at the European Economic and Social Committee.  Representatives could include employers and representatives of trade unions and other bodies from civil society.  Allowing Executive Ministers to participate in Council of Ministers meetings as part of the Irish delegation could be considered.  I would appreciate Mr. &Scaron;efovi's views on those proposals.  What are his views on allowing civil servants from the North of Ireland to participate in relevant Council working groups and on the creation of an office for representatives from the Northern Assembly in Brussels?  These are key areas that need to be considered.  I would appreciate Mr. &Scaron;efovi's views on them.  I  thank him again for engaging with us this morning.  I look forward to hearing his views.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Brady for all the questions.  I wish to highlight that we have obviously been doing our utmost to de-escalate or calm down the situation.  The tone of my letter really shows that we have been doing our utmost to be constructive in responding to the communication from Mr. Gove.  We have demonstrated we are working on some of the issues that are pertinent to the all-Ireland economy, such as the issue of steel, and many other elements.  We will continue to do so.  I was very pleased that in our meeting with Mr. Gove, we agreed on the joint statement.  De-escalation, stabilisation and the reiteration of our utmost commitment to the proper implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland were clearly underscored.</p><p>We are very much focusing on all outstanding issues on the table with a view to finding a solution to them.  Of course, the solution will have to be in accordance with the agreements we have signed, with EU law and with the understanding we agreed upon already in December.</p><p> We are all for any step forward to calm the situation, de-escalate it and show a constructive spirit.  We are also ready to engage with business leaders and civic society in Northern Ireland, to listen to them carefully and to present this transformation as a possible business opportunity, given the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the Single Market and part of the internal United Kingdom market.  Northern Ireland actually operates in two markets.  I believe that for business leaders, this is a major opportunity.  Yet, I understand that until we get to the opportunity part we have to make it through all the adjustments and adaptation to the new reality that was brought about by the UK leaving the customs union and the Single Market.</p><p> As I said, I am open to any consultations and communications.  However, in all our contacts we have to respect the constitutional arrangements, how we signed the agreements and the treaty signed between the EU and the UK.  This involves our counterparts for the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and, as recently announced, the partnership council for overseeing the implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement, including the UK's Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr. Gove.  Of course, we are always ready to engage in discussions with everyone who can contribute to ensure that we are looking for a good solution, but it is on the basis of partnership between the UK and the EU.</p></speech>

It shows the interest that the European Commission has in dealing with this issue.  I welcome what he says.</p> <p>  We all accept that Brexit was going to be a disaster that needed to be mitigated, and the Irish protocol was a major part of that.  I accept the support of the European Commission in ensuring that no hard border will be re-erected on the island of Ireland and its support for the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  I note that Mr. &Scaron;efovi does not want to go into the individual acts which led to the mistake around the threat to trigger Article 16.  If this body is not going to be given that information, that is one thing.  I would like to get clarity from Mr. &Scaron;efovi that the European Commission will absolutely investigate and break down how that happened, because we all get the absolute seriousness of it.  We need to look into exactly what the mechanisms are to ensure it does not happen again.  I welcome the comments of Mr. &Scaron;efovi about a horizontal overview and a clearing house.  I assume that would also involve checks with Dublin and Belfast.  Can Mr. &Scaron;efovi give any indication of how this would work?  If not, can Mr. &Scaron;efovi come back to this committee and others?  I believe it is vital that this information is put out.  To a degree it might lessen some of the concerns that exist.</p> <p>  I am keen to get some information on the interaction of Mr. &Scaron;efovi with Michael Gove.  Obviously, the British Government has threatened several things at different times.  I welcome what Mr. &Scaron;efovi says in respect of his conversations with Michael Gove.  They have been useful in respect of support for the Irish protocol and the fact that it is part of an international agreement that is not going anywhere.  What has Michael Gove said in respect of Mr. &Scaron;efovi asking questions about the real-time access to customs databases and the issue the European Commission has with border control posts?  This fits in with what the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Transport say to the effect that one major issue still is the lack of preparations in Britain.  This extends to the lack of preparations by British firms and that is impacting on this situation.  In fairness, Mr. &Scaron;efovi spoke about 24 February being a major date.  What does he expect at that point?  Will we have dealt with a considerable amount of any modifications or leeway that are necessary in respect of the movement of freight and other issues?  These are all issues that we want to see dealt with.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that Mr. &Scaron;efovi is open to ongoing dialogue with stakeholders and dealing with modifications.  Political unionism has made its decisions on how it will play its hand in the next election.  To a degree, it is operating a playbook it used in the 1980s and the 1880s, and that is unfortunate.  If the European Commission wants to sell the Irish protocol to businessmen and farmers from a unionist and nationalist background, it may need to aim above political unionism.  I would welcome any interaction with the necessary stakeholders.  I am seeking some clarity from Mr. &Scaron;efovi that he will engage with some groupings in Ireland who have been engaged in campaigning against Brexit and for mitigations.  I would like to think that Border Communities Against Brexit is one of these organisations.  If not, it should be considered in that regard.  I would welcome any information that could be given in respect of what Deputy Brady has asked about Northern representation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear.  The argument that Irish unity is the only solution to dealing long-term with the issues of the British Border in Ireland is being understood and believed by far more people now.</p> <p>  If we finally get to a better time, post pandemic and post vaccinations, I would like to think we could invite Mr. &Scaron;efovi to visit the Border region.  Obviously, the most important part of the region is where County Louth, my constituency, touches the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021021600002#H00400"><p>My thanks to the Deputy for the invitation.  I hope that, Covid permitting, progress on the protocol will allow us to have that visit as soon as possible.  Of course, it would be an occasion to come again to the committee.  I would prefer to do it in person rather than via my computer.  My thanks to the Deputy for the invite.</p> <p>  One of the questions concerned the mechanism.  As I said, we want to ensure that we learn from the past and, therefore, we want to introduce a horizontal oversight mechanism, including the clearing house and the central role on the level of services that is played by the Secretariat General.  This will ensure that it will have proper assessment of the situation and that the proposals for political decisions are properly done and assessed.</p> <p>  Another question concerned the work of the joint committee or specialist committee.  Before we arrived at any decision of course we discussed it in great detail with member states.  I can tell the committee that Ireland is one of the most vocal, active and engaged member states.  We talk to our Irish friends and partners frequently at expert level, at ambassadorial level and at the top level of political representatives, including the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p><p>This will continue in the future and the high quality relationship the Commission has with Ireland prevented us from making that mistake graver because, as I said, we never activated Article 16 thanks to the intense interaction which took place between the Irish top-level representatives and the European Commission.</p><p> Concerning the border crossing points and IT systems, we agreed with Chancellor Gove - and this should be the topic for the next joint committee - that we will get the proper overview of where the UK is with the implementation of the protocol and the commitments and engagements agreed upon in our meeting in December.  For example, for border crossing points we agreed a so-called open book approach, which has worked well since last summer.  This approach means that UK authorities have been transparent about how construction works are continuing, the roadmap to completion of the works and when the border crossing points would be fully operational.  We aim to achieve that in the summer of this year.</p><p> We agreed it would be good to have the same approach when it comes to the IT customs systems.  We understand it is a massive undertaking to adjust the database to this new kind of relationship and we would like to hear - and this is also, I understand, a commitment from Michael Gove - what stage we are at in terms of making IT access available to the European Commission and the European Union and what are the major problems.  There are issues with the migration of the IT system, which we understand.  When will these things happen, what are the problems and when and how they will be fixed?  This is the information I hope we will get and hear from our British partners and counterparts.  That is the best way to proceed on all issues listed in both of our letters.  Currently, our experts working in the specialised committees are frequently in touch and we hope to have more clarity on these issues, which will open the possibility of moving closer to full implementation and the resolution of other problems that are popping up.  These problems are natural in such a massive relationship as that we are building and forming into a new shape and which was triggered by the UK leaving the European Union.</p><p> On different stakeholders, when we have a joint committee session it is the norm and there have always been interventions from the First Minister of Northern Ireland, Madame Foster, and the deputy First Minister, Madame O'Neill.  It is the standing practice that both representatives intervene in our deliberations.  Often, representatives of Ireland intervene in these discussions and we usually have the presence of most EU member states in such discussions.  That is a good practice which we will definitely continue with so the voice of Northern Ireland is properly heard when we discuss issues in the joint committee. </p></speech>

We all appreciate how much time he is giving us.  He will be blue in the face by the time the session is over from being asked the same question over and over.  It is because we are genuinely frustrated at not getting the response we expected.  The announcement made on 29 January was, for us, probably far greater than a mistake.  I believe the only reason it was rowed back upon was because of the enormous response and backlash it received.  It is obvious to all of us that it was a decision that was made emotionally.  The Commission was peeved - I use that phrase but it was probably far stronger than that - at what it perceived to be a fast one with regard to the supply of vaccines in the European Union versus the United Kingdom.  It was an emotion-based response but it was also a rookie response.  It is difficult to understand as none of us associate the word "rookie" with the European Commission.  None of us associates a disassociation from what invoking Article 16 would have done to the island of Ireland versus the painstaking determination of the negotiations of the previous four years to ensure that exactly that did not ever happen to the island of Ireland, its people, its economy and, most importantly, our peace.  Until we understand how that rookie mistake came about, it is difficult for us to appreciate and accept the new protocols the Commissioner has described so eloquently today and his assurance that it will never happen again.</p> <p>  A number of my colleagues are still to speak and I fear the Commissioner will be asked the same question by every one of us.  We need to understand how that mistake happened rather than mincing words as to whether the article was invoked or not.  A clear statement was made on 29 January that the Commission was invoking Article 16.  We are all well aware that the only reason it was pulled back from was the massive backlash that came from that statement.  I do not know if there is something stopping the Commissioner or he is protecting someone in the office or the Commission, but it is important for every member of this committee and every citizen on the island of Ireland to understand how that happened so we can be assured it will never happen again.</p></speech>

I understand the importance underlying our discussions today and the political developments since the Friday in question.  I already gave all the answers I could.  We are all working in administration.  There was a draft proposal made and the draft was corrected by the political level.  I was describing, as I think the Senator understood very well, the intensity of the moment where the Commission felt that despite all our efforts and investment in the vaccine's development, we were not getting our fair share.  We wanted to introduce more transparency.  We did not want to block the vaccine's export.  We simply wanted to know where the vaccines are manufactured and where they were going.  That was the primary purpose of that proposal.  As I said, the mistake was made.  We apologise for it and therefore we are introducing all these internal controls - the clearing house and horizontal oversight of our activities - to make sure we do not make such a mistake in the future.  That is the best assurance I can give the Senator and it is the honest answer.</p></speech>

I also thank him and his team for the work they have put in to getting the Northern Ireland protocol agreed.  He said it took up a lot of his time so he is obviously a patient man.  We appreciate the work he and his team put into the protocol.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the political fallout from the attempted triggering of Article 16.  There is no point in going over that again, other than to say that the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland now has a five-point plan to free Northern Ireland of the protocol.  Sectarian tensions are rising.</p><p>Senator Lisa Chambers referred to forthcoming elections in Northern Ireland.  The protocol has to be agreed by the Northern Ireland Assembly in four years.  We need to sort these issues out.<br/><br/>We are all agreed that we need to ensure that using the protocol never happens again.  Could the Commissioner elaborate more on communications between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Michael Gove, the clearing house arrangement and overview mechanisms?  Will there be formal structures in place or structures of any kind to ensure this does not happen again?  What about the role of the Irish Commissioner in this?  Commissioners take an oath to the European Union and do not have a mandate for their national countries.  Would part of the clearing house process, communications or overview involve consultation with the Irish Commissioner and his or her office?<br/><br/>The problems the protocol is causing for businesses and civic society in Northern Ireland have been exaggerated for political reasons among certain political parties.  There have been post-Brexit administrative delays and problems with supply chains, as well as increased transportation costs.  Northern Irish supermarkets have experienced shortages of time-sensitive goods such as fresh produce and chilled meats.  Other issues have arisen with, for example, the movement of seed potatoes and family pets.  Is the Commissioner confident that practical and sensible modifications can be brought forward for the operation and the implementation of the protocol, having regard to the issues I have just outlined?  Can there be an extension to the grace period?<br/><br/>A recent article in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>reported that Michael Gove is considering an alternative mutual enforcement plan to the protocol that would remove the border from the Irish Sea and restore the land border in Ireland, which would require the UK and the EU to apply checks at the same level as each other.  Obviously this is unacceptable to us in Ireland.  I assume it is unacceptable to the European Commission as well.</p></speech>

I hope that we will not need four years to resolve these practical issues.  I was hoping we would have resolved them in December.  That was the point of our super intense negotiations during which we were discussing the grace period for meat exports, health certificates, special authorisation processes for medicines and so forth.  At that time what I understood from our UK partners was that the grace period was very much welcomed by the UK Government.</p> <p>  At that time also, it told us that the unilateral declarations were sufficient to do the necessary adaptations.  We also have to be honest.  The decision to leave EU, Single Market and customs union entails dramatic transformation of our mutual relationship.  I thank the Deputy for those kind words about the intensity and the length of the negotiations on the protocol.  We were looking to square the circle and I think we succeeded for the sake of all-island prosperity, stability and peace.  It was not easy to do but we found the solutions.</p> <p>  I am glad that in our joint statement that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, clearly reiterated his full support for the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  There are clear obligations on both of us.  I assure the Deputy that on the EU's behalf that we will do our utmost.</p> <p>  At the same time, it is also quite clear that certain adaptations will be needed in economic life and distribution chains.  The UK decided to become a third country as of 1 January.  This is demonstrated in all the complications we are discussing today.  We are there to solve the problems and look for all possible solutions.  We signed agreements into EU law.  Our UK counterparts know EU law very well because they have been members of the Single Market for 47 years.  They know very well our flexibilities and possibilities.  We are ready to work with them.  Regarding the protocol, it will be seen as an opportunity for Northern Ireland and Ireland to actually benefit from the unique solution we found in it.</p> <p>  On the concrete issues of supply chains and the shortages in Northern Irish supermarkets, we knew that this might happen.  We were discussing, therefore, discussing this with our UK counterparts over the past year to be ready for 1 January.  We offered an extension of the transition period to have more time for this transformation.  In the end, the decision was taken about 1 January, this grace period and being ready.  That is the situation where we are right now.  I will listen with great care and attention to the business leaders and civic society representatives of Northern Ireland as to how it is on the ground and what we can do to ensure the protocol is seen for what it really is, namely, a solution for peace, prosperity, as well as the positive and prosperous future of Northern Ireland and the whole island of Ireland.</p> <p>  That is our common task and we will be able to do this both ways.  The UK is committed to adapt, adjust and accept its new relationship.  It is crafted because of its insistence on being two sovereign equals and having it enshrined in the agreement.  We must also respect and deliver on our commitments, which have been clearly written when we were discussing how to implement the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  It is important and crucial for EU member states to hear and assess how the flexibilities, which we already agreed with the UK, are used before discussion about any further extensions.  These are concrete issues, which are now discussed by our colleagues under the umbrella of specialised committee.  I hope we will have an in-depth discussion on all of these issues next week.</p></speech>

It is a living arrangement.</p><p>Northern Ireland, in a sense, should be at the consultative table, at the very top, to express concerns and flag issues for Northern Ireland.  That is not possible at the moment.  Notwithstanding the constitutional sensitivities, would the EU explore with the UK, respecting the Constitution, giving Northern Ireland a voice in the heart of Europe?  Obviously, that would have to be done amicably.  The Vice-President might then report back to this member state because, if it is not a runner, that will certainly shape the minds of people in the Republic of Ireland.<br/><br/>I anticipate we would be very generous.  We would have to look at constitutional change to allow a voice for Northern Ireland at formal committee meetings here and in the two Houses.  That is something the EU will deal with and will have to face down the line.  I want to have that exhausted first.  What generosity is there between ourselves and the UK, recognising the international Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland's new position, to put Northern Ireland front and centre?  Northern Ireland's voice is not being heard properly at the moment.<br/><br/>I do not want to repeat what fellow Senators and Deputies have said this morning but I fully concur with it.  I want to approach it from a different angle, almost from an interest in history, if very modern history.  A spectacular own goal was scored by the EU but it could have been so much worse, to try to be optimistic about this.  I have never seen on the island of Ireland such spontaneous unison, although people might be coming from different constituencies.  We did not have that unanimous acclamation at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, when the DUP opposed it.  Every single voice abhorred what happened but mistakes happen, even of this magnitude.  The ground has been well covered.  We have to look positively at the fact people drew back from the brink.  The<i>Titanic</i>did not hit the iceberg.  It is never too late.<br/><br/>On a question that has not been covered yet, could the Vice-President put on record who I should thank, as a parliamentarian, for averting going into the abyss?  I would like to shake that person's hand, although it might not be possible in Covid times.  Is it the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or both, or the Irish Government?  If the Taoiseach did this, and he was vigilant and was not asleep at the wheel while we were riding into the abyss, it is the greatest single day of a living Taoiseach in protecting peace in this country since Bertie Ahern&rsquo;s clinching of the Good Friday Agreement.  I would like to know who I should thank.  I do not believe it is the EU bureaucrats.  If it is one of my fellow parliamentarians, I want to be generous and magnanimous, and say to the Irish Government, &ldquo;Thank you so much for avoiding a huge mess.&rdquo;</p></speech>

I assure him that when it comes to contact on Northern Ireland, at the expert level we are in frequent contact with them, and on everything that concerns the implementation of the protocol, we are discussing that with the experts.  We are in touch with the Executive.  When, for example, that video conference was scheduled, we were in concrete and very intense contact with the Northern Ireland Executive.  We very much appreciate, as I said, the great co-operation we have on the ground with the Northern Irish partners and with the Northern Irish police.  There are collegial and very friendly relations and a good atmosphere there between our customs and phytosanitary people and their Northern Irish counterparts.  There is really a lot going on.  The feeling, when I was talking to our people who are working in Northern Ireland, was very positive.  It was a mutual learning process, with strong working relationships, with people looking into ways to improve the performance, very often under very difficult circumstances.  Therefore, we very much appreciate all the close co-operation on the safety and security of our personnel there.  Again, that has been done directly with the Northern Irish representatives and we are very thankful for that.</p> <p>  The Northern Irish representatives are also part of all of our specialised bodies, and I am talking about specialised committees that are there taking part in the discussion.  As I said, they are also always intervening in our discussions on the joint committee, where the First Minister and Deputy First Minister always intervene and listen with great attention and great care, working together on finding appropriate answers.</p> <p>  On whom to thank, I can tell the Senator that in those fateful three hours, all of our phones were buzzing and ringing constantly.  I know the Taoiseach and also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, were in frequent contact with all of us and there was intense discussion between the Taoiseach and President Ursula von der Leyen.  My very good friend, the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, would confirm that we spoke at least five times, not only that afternoon and that evening, but also on the Saturday on Sunday and, I would say, every single day until we had that video conference with both representatives of the Northern Ireland Executive.  It was very good that a mistake was spotted so quickly and, as I said, within three hours, we corrected it.</p> <p>  My plea here, and I know I am repeating myself, is to look at this against the backdrop of what the EU and the Commission were always trying to do for Ireland and Northern Ireland, all the support for peace, all the support for different projects, how proud we were when we could inaugurate that bridge between two communities, built by EU financial support, and we named it PEACE because that was very important for all of us.  There is unwavering commitment for the success of PEACE, for the success of the withdrawal agreement and for proper implementation of the protocol.  Of course, we do it with the single objective of stability, peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland.  I know it is an enormous task but, here, we would like to work as closely as possible with Ireland, with Northern Ireland and also with our UK counterparts.</p></speech>

Will he please outline the current status of the Joint Partnership Council?  Is it currently operational and have members of the relevant sub-committees and task forces been appointed?  If, as I hope, it is operational, there would be limited chance of the invoking of Article 16 happening again.  I do not think the process was followed correctly to invoke that article.</p> <p>  Although nobody has asked about this issue this morning, I am going to ask about it.  What mistakes have been made with regard to the procurement of vaccines?  We have the third largest buying power in the world.  What mistakes have been made by the EU in procuring vaccines and has it rectified this?  That is very important for a country like Ireland that is on the periphery of the EU.  I am asking that this morning on behalf of our 5 million people on this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.735" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021021600002#L00600"><p>I thank the Senator for the question.</p><p>The current status of the partnership council is as follows.  As members are aware, I was appointed at the beginning of January to represent the EU in the partnership council, which is a body that was constituted under the trade and co-operation agreement.  A couple of days ago, Michael Gove was appointed to represent the UK in the partnership council.  We will have to constitute the partnership council as soon as possible and then the next step would be to set up a network of 19 specialised committees which would cover all the different aspects of the huge trade and co-operation relationship we have, and I believe we will develop with the United Kingdom in these new circumstances of the UK being a third country.</p><p> I am sure members already heard that one of the first tasks of the partnership council will also be to look at the ratification of the trade and co-operation agreement.  In the end the Council supported the position of some member states that we would need more time for a conclusion of the ratification process because of the need to have appropriate authentic linguistic versions finalised so they could give their approval for the ratification.  We are still waiting and working very closely with the European Parliament on the consent role.  All that should be completed by the end of April when there will not only be provisional but full entry into force of the new trade and co-operation agreement between the EU and the UK.</p><p> If members will allow me to mentally picture the situation if the EU did not proceed with unanimity, unity and solidarity, we can ask what would be the situation on the vaccine market, how strong the big member states would be and what it would mean for the smaller and medium sized member states.  We had just a small glimpse of that in the spring of last year when we suddenly discovered we had big problems with procuring health material and protective gear for health professionals.  Therefore, I think it was the right decision, and I am glad that we have huge support for that approach from all member states to act with unity and solidarity and to have a joint approach to acquiring the necessary vaccines and also to invest well in advance in the most promising companies.  As members can see, our assessment was the correct one because all the vaccines that are currently on the market were also supported financially by the European Union to develop them and to accelerate production.</p><p> What was perhaps not properly assessed at the time &ndash; this is not only the problem of the European Commission but also the companies with which we signed the advance purchase agreements &ndash; is that sometimes they were too optimistic about how they could scale up the production of the vaccines.  One executive of a pharmaceutical company said that last year the company produced 100,000 vaccines and now it needs to produce 1 billion.  This is a huge scale-up and it very often entails industrial adjustments to the production facilities.  What we learned is useful for the steps we will take in the future because we now have the transparency we need.  We know how many vaccines are manufactured in the EU and where they are going.  The pharmaceutical companies are now making sure that if there is any shortfall or if they are not able to supply the quantities of the vaccines they promised, the shortfall in supply is fairly distributed among those with whom they have contracts.  That is very important, as is the fact that there is a ramp-up in supplies.  We expect that in the second quarter the vaccine supply for the European market will be sufficient to meet our agreed goal of having 70% of the adult population vaccinated by the end of the summer.</p><p> I accept that we must be aware of the new variants, be they the British or the South African ones.  We are also looking at how we can accelerate the authorisation process for the necessary boost of the vaccines or an adjustment to the vaccines that already exist.  We have to look at this from the perspective that 26 million vaccines have already been delivered to member states.  If I remember correctly, something like 17 million people have already been vaccinated, at least with the first dose.  When one assesses the rate of the vaccination roll-out, European member states are among the top 50 countries in the world.  I am from Slovakia and I am sure that if we did not proceed as one with a unified approach, strong negotiation and the pressure we brought by being the biggest trading bloc, my country would not be among the top 50 because it would be extremely difficult to negotiate such a complex agreement with big pharmaceutical companies.  That is a little related to another topic, but I very much appreciate the question.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his contribution and also his willingness to engage with the committee on a more permanent basis in future.  I think he gets a sense from this morning's meeting that there is a desire and an appetite to do that.  It is very significant to have him with us today, albeit virtually, in our national Parliament.  We are very grateful for that.</p> <p>  Without going back over old ground, the committee does not want to enter a blame-game scenario, nor do we want heads to roll.  What we are specifically looking for is accountability, transparency and consequences.  I know Mr. &Scaron;efovi has emphasised time and again that Article 16 was not fully triggered.  It is a matter of language, however.  I assume a group of individuals, rather than one person, compiled a draft report of such significant impact and that those individuals knew the potential repercussions.  Senator Martin suggested that the iceberg was avoided, but a bit of damage was still done to the wing and we are still living with those consequences.  It is very important that the individuals involved in preparing the draft report know about the consequences and are spoken to at length about them.  As a committee we wanted to know who these individuals were and what their motivation was, but I will not go back over that ground again.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi stated clearly that he wants to focus on putting measures in place to ensure this does not happen again.  It is a missed opportunity to have more consequences, transparency and accountability but it is never too late.</p><p>However, my two questions are as follows.  What is the timeframe for the implementation of the early warning system?  Second, what is the potential for enhanced Irish representation within the Directorate General for Trade, or other Directorates General likely to make decisions under the protocol, to ensure that there is a proper understanding available in the decision-making process of the implications of the protocol for Northern Ireland?  </p><p> We will leave the final word to Leas-Uachtar&aacute;n.  Apologies for the Irish class today.  He has been introduced to new Irish vocabulary.  He can now introduce himself at the Commission as the Leas-Uachtar&aacute;n when he is meeting with our Irish MEPs.  T&aacute;imid f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och as an Leas-Uachtar&aacute;n as an bp&aacute;irt a ghlac s&eacute; sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo linn inniu.  We are most grateful to the Vice-President for taking part in this discussion today.  Ar&iacute;s, go raibh maith agat. </p></speech>

As I have told the committee, I am from Slovakia.  I will never forget what Ireland did for my country.  I still remember today, how warmly Slovakia was welcomed as a new member state.   In the good old times, there was a big party in the main square in Cork.  There was beer and a great atmosphere.  We all felt so proud when our flag was presented, for the first time, at Dublin Castle, as one of the flags of the new EU member states.  I remember it well personally, as do the other member states, because on that day we became new members of the European Union.  I thank Ireland for the atmosphere, hospitality and the graciousness it showed us that day.  I am making this point at the end of the discussion today because I wanted to focus, in my answers, on the questions asked by the committee members, and to respect the scrutiny and accountability which the members of this committee, as parliamentarians, Senators, and Members of the D&aacute;il undertake on a daily basis.  They ensure that democratic rules are properly respected, all decisions are properly scrutinised, and that they have all the information they need to make sure that they are doing the best job for their people.  I very much respect that.</p> <p>  The members have asked about the timetable for the introduction of the new systems in the European Commission.  As I said, we are introducing this clearing house, which is already happening right now.  It was decided that under the Secretariat General, we will have horizontal oversight of all the measures taken concerning the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  I can assure members that this implies even more focus on all issues related to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It was also agreed that Commissioners with the highest stake in this new EU-UK relationship will meet at least once a month to take stock of where we are heading and to provide important updates, to make sure that we have political ownership and oversight of the development of this most important relationship.</p> <p>  I was asked about my colleague, Mairead McGuinness.  I can tell the committee that she is an outstanding Commissioner and is responsible for a most important portfolio, namely, financial stability, financial services and capital markets.  I very much treasure our friendship, her intimate knowledge of the situation on the island of Ireland and her involvement in discussions of all the pertinent issues linked to the protocol or to the future development of the relationship between the EU and the UK.</p> <p>  Of course, it is always an honour and a pleasure to be invited to address this committee.  I will be happy to do so again in the future.  I hope that I will be able to do it in person the next time.  I hope that in the interim, good progress is made on the ground, as well as concrete results which lead to the full implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Once again, I thank members for the invitation, for the questions posed and for the fair hearing I have been given.  I appreciate it.</p></speech>

I welcome members and viewers who may be watching proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We are joined by Mr. Brendan Whelan and Ms Lorraine Corcoran from the Social Finance Foundation and Dr. Noreen Byrne and Dr. Olive McCarthy from University College Cork, UCC.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses with regard to reference that witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected by absolute privilege, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute.  If, however, they are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness physically present would.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to appear before it and to make the case for addressing what is, in our view, a morally unjust reality for many Irish people.  I might start by posing a question.  Would any Government today consider bringing a Bill to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that would allow lending organisations to charge rates of 187% APR on small loans to often vulnerable people?  Of course not.  It would be ethically and morally wrong for such rates to be charged to a borrower by any lending organisation.  There would be an uprising if banks or credit unions were to charge such rates, but that is what is happening today with home collection moneylenders.  If it is deemed wrong to introduce a Bill that would allow these rates to be charged, it is just as wrong to permit such rates to continue to be charged.  Our ask of the committee is for it to address this issue by introducing legislation that would impose a maximum interest rate for small personal loans by licensed home collection moneylending organisations and a prohibition on fees and charges.  We must stress that our goal is not to put moneylending organisations out of business; rather, it is to ensure that borrowers can have access to small personal loans at a reasonable cost.</p> <p>  I will now explain what very high interest rates mean for home collection moneylending borrowers.  A typical loan is &euro;500 and a typical period is six months.  In the course of a year, a borrower could take out two six-month loans of &euro;500 each, which would cost &euro;300 in interest.  That is &euro;300 to have &euro;500 made available to the borrower over 12 months.  The equivalent interest cost from a credit union would be &euro;30.</p><p>Comparing &euro;300 with &euro;30, it is a multiplier of ten.</p><p> Why are these organisations issued with a licence each year with permission to charge these very high rates?  It is because of the business model that the home collection moneylenders operate or, in other words, how they conduct their business.  Repayments are weekly and are collected by agents at or often in the borrower's home.  This is an intrusive, public and, importantly, a very expensive way of collecting repayments.  For the business to be profitable, it requires extremely high interest rates to generate sufficient income to offset the very high labour costs.  In spite of the very high cost and the dependency it creates, it is recognised that the model generates high satisfaction rates due to its convenience and reasonably assured credit.</p><p> Why is such a business model still operating in 2021?  I am old enough to remember my mother making cash payments in a working class area of Dublin on Friday evenings to the insurance agent, the milkman and the bread man.  Now that it is 2021 and we are living in an era of electronic payments, it is anachronistic that this method of repayment still exists.  Of course, it is a mechanism that works to the advantage of the moneylenders.  They have few marketing costs and get to know their borrowers intimately.  They often perpetuate their presence through each generation in the family.  It is important to note that they have no incentive to take a less costly approach to repayment collection or to manage credit risk differently so long as they are allowed to charge very high interest rates.</p><p> If a cap on interest rates were introduced, the moneylenders would have to change their business model to remain viable.  Intriguingly, they have had to do this already in 2020 and 2021 during the three lockdown periods, when they could not collect from borrowers' homes.  The written submission we provided to the committee does not suggest the level at which the interest rate cap should be set.  The territory of interest rates can be very complex, with annual percentage rate, APR, simple interest, compound interest, amortisation, etc.  It is important that any cap can be easily understood and facilitate comparability.  Some EU countries have adopted a cap based on a multiple of a market rate.  This concept, which is based on a simple interest calculation, could give a sound basis for a cap and would be easily understood.  The key question then would be the size of the multiplier, a number which, in my view, should be significantly less than the multiplier of ten I to which I referred earlier.</p><p> As already stated, we are not seeking to eliminate this source of credit.  We propose that the ultimate cap should be publicly declared and then introduced on a step-down basis over several years.  This will provide the time for all those impacted, and borrowers in particular, to adjust.  It will also provide time to manage the known implementation risks and any additional issues which inevitably arise in a change such as this.  In conclusion, we strongly believe that the Government owes it to some of its most vulnerable people to address this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Olive McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present on the Bill.  This opening statement was prepared by Dr. Noreen Byrne, who is also participating in the meeting, and I.  Our report on interest rate restrictions included a range of recommendations, one of which calls for the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges for moneylending loans.<br/><br/>As of 4 February, the Central Bank registry shows that there are 36 moneylenders currently licensed in Ireland.  Most of these are doorstep lenders who traditionally collect payments in person from borrowers at their homes or other locations.  Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions, there is evidence to suggest that this model has changed somewhat, allowing repayments to be made by phone or online rather than in person.  The highest rate currently being charged by licensed moneylenders is 187% APR.  This does not include collection charges, which can raise the APR to 287%.  The typical moneylending customers are seen to be those who can least afford the high interest costs relative to available borrowing alternatives.  The reasons people continue to borrow from moneylenders are multifaceted and often reduce the sensitivity of the borrower to the cost of the loan.  These may include family tradition, convenience, direct marketing, poor credit history and habit.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, credit unions and others are reporting &quot;client creep&quot; into groups of consumers on higher incomes who are struggling to cope financially, particularly since the previous financial crisis.<br/><br/>In Europe, there has been a clear trend towards the use of interest rate restrictions as a policy tool, with 21 EU member states now having some form of interest rate cap on high-cost credit.  The recommendations in our report call on the Government, in the interests of fairness to the most vulnerable in Irish society, to prohibit the currently allowed usurious rates of interest which licensed moneylenders are permitted to charge.  To be effective, an interest rate restriction would have to be coupled with restrictions on other fees and charges and a limit on the total cost of credit.  In our recommendations, we also advocate a redoubling of efforts to promote financial inclusion and education initiatives to support consumers in making better financial choices, especially where household resources are limited.<br/><br/>The amendment to section 9 of the Consumer Credit Act seeks to impose a maximum APR of 36% chargeable on loans issued by licensed moneylenders.  We agree with the need to impose an interest rate cap, supporting fair and reasonably priced credit for all, subject to the implementation of accompanying measures already outlined.  The main argument that is often put forward against the imposition of an interest rate cap for licensed moneylenders is the fear that a reduction in the availability of credit will fuel illegal moneylending.  The reported evidence for this appears to be weak.  Recent research we have conducted with social housing residents, which is due to be launched later this year, demonstrates that those on low incomes employ a wide range of coping strategies when they run out of money.  The New Economics Foundation in the UK has pointed out that a focus on reducing debt dependency is needed.  This can be achieved by reducing the cost of credit.  Every &euro;1 subsequently not paid in loan interest can then be used to build household savings and, in turn, household resilience, while reducing the need for future credit.<br/><br/>We recommend that, following agreement on the ultimate target cap, an incremental introduction of interest rate restrictions take place to allow for a phasing out of high interest rates over an agreed period.  This will facilitate the adjustment of all parties, the implementation of other supportive policy or legislative measures and fine-tuning in light of developments on the ground until the final target is reached.  It is important that the first move be the introduction of an interim rate in order to develop momentum.  If that is not done, the <i>status quo</i>will remain.  It is envisaged that this first interim rate restriction will prompt a re-examination of the moneylending business model.<br/><br/>Other considerations may include a tiered approach, allowing for somewhat higher rates on smaller loans over a shorter duration.  This recognises the costs associated with the administration of smaller loans and might serve to mitigate against any fears that consumers would move to illegal moneylenders in the absence of a tailored and widespread alternative in the shorter term or until such time as reliable alternatives are fully enabled, widely available and highly accessible.  It may also act to disincentivise an increasing loan duration or a larger loan which might go beyond the capacity of the borrower.<br/><br/>Consideration should be given to the introduction of a requirement for consumers who wish to continue to avail of repayment collections in person to opt-in for this service.  This would enable consumers to make more informed and conscious decisions about the cost of a loan that is collected in person versus a loan not collected in person.<br/><br/>Finally, there should be reflection on the potential of the US community reinvestment approach, which requires financial institutions to make a financial contribution in the geographical area in which they operate and to demonstrate that they meet the credit needs of those on low or moderate incomes.  A financial contribution from the banking sector could be used to resource a widespread preventative debt or systematic financial education service in addition to the curative debt advice service offered by MABS.<br/><br/>Steps need to be taken now to develop a phased implementation plan with a final target in mind and to demonstrate the will to finally change this unfair system that depletes the wealth of our most vulnerable communities and keeps many trapped in persistent indebtedness.  We will be happy to engage in a process that seeks to move this forward.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Whelan and Ms Corcoran from the Social Finance Foundation and Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne.  As the sponsor of this legislation, I thank my colleagues in the committee.  They have prioritised this legislative measure despite the many pressing matters we must deal with and the restricted amount of time the committee has.  Obviously, that follows up on the unanimous support the measure received on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  It is also my intention to make a submission as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny, if that is permitted, because it is something that probably chimes with our witnesses.  I believe we need to consider a more nuanced approach in terms of a tiered stepping down of the interest rate.  There are other issues I wish to address as well on foot of the engagement I have had with different sectors since I introduced the Bill in 2018.</p> <p>  With regard to the moral question of high interest rates, we know that what is permitted at this point in time is 187%.  Indeed, that could increase if the Central Bank wishes because there is no restriction on it in terms of the allowing of additional costs.  However, when the collection charges are included, it can increase to 288% for moneylenders that are currently operating in the Irish market.  In its opening statement, Social Finance Foundation says that it is a moral issue, first and foremost, and the question posed was how we would respond if the Government produced legislation that allowed a bank to charge these rates.  It is obvious that we would not accept legislation of that nature and, therefore, we should not accept the current practice.  Will the witnesses illustrate the financial implications of these high rates for borrowers and families?  Is it the case that these are predominantly families who have low incomes and that the borrowers are predominantly female?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.753" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Corcoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#C00600"><p>Absolutely.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend the meeting today.  Regarding the implications of this, let us take the very simple level of a &euro;500 loan.  If it is a credit union loan over a six-month period, the interest a credit union would charge, even at the highest rate, would be around &euro;16.  For a typical moneylender rate of 187% APR on a &euro;500 loan, the interest is &euro;150.  A person pays back &euro;650.  We are looking at a differential of ten times, as Mr. Whelan mentioned in his opening statement.  That is a massive amount of interest.  A person is paying &euro;150 for the availability of &euro;500.  Typically, when we speak to borrowers from moneylenders we see people who would borrow &euro;500 perhaps twice in a single year.  That means somebody is paying &euro;300 for the availability of &euro;500 over a 12-month period.  That is a large amount of money.</p> <p>  Over the years, in terms of how we have looked at this and working with credit unions to introduce the "It Makes Sense" loan and the personal micro credit initiative in broader terms, we have run a number of focus groups and surveys.  Yes, one would typically see a female, often with children and usually in rented accommodation.  That would be the typical profile, but also, and Dr. McCarthy mentioned it in her opening statement, we are seeing this creep into other areas and other sections of society.  In more recent completed surveys we have seen that not only does one see moneylender borrowers in the C, D and E socioeconomic category, one also sees them in the A, B and C1 category.  This is not something that is only prevalent in certain areas.  It is far more widespread.  We often find that where we would have thought initially that perhaps the proportion of people on social welfare would be far higher, it is not.  From what we can see, the disproportionate number of people who borrow from moneylenders are employed and working, so this is not only in one section of society.</p></speech>

I have a question for either Dr. McCarthy or Dr. Byrne.  The report they published in 2018 was excellent.  I understand it was commissioned and funded by the Central Bank and the Social Finance Foundation.  One of the recommendations in the report is that the Government adopt a policy that prohibits ultra-high rates of interest, in the interests of fairness and the most vulnerable in society, through the introduction of a restriction on interest rates and charges.  That was in 2018.  Do they describe the current levels of interest that are permitted to be charged by moneylenders as ultra high?  Do they believe they are?  Second, what has been the response of the Department of Finance since the publication of that report?  Has there been any engagement with Dr. McCarthy or Dr. Byrne in respect of adopting the recommendations in the report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.755" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Olive McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#C00800"><p>I am happy to respond, and I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will answer the second question first.  In July 2019, the Department of Finance issued a public consultation on interest rates for high-cost credit.  We responded to that consultation document.  There has been discussion on one of the recommendations of the report which would have originally also arisen from the credit union advisory committee.  I should state that I am a current member of that committee.  This arose from the 2016 report of the credit union advisory committee, which was before my time on that committee.  That looked to support credit unions in increasing the maximum rate of interest they could charge to 2% per month on the reducing balance, as opposed to the current 1% per month on the reducing balance.  I understand that received approval at Cabinet level at some point, but I am not sure where it is in the process at present.  However, things have been slow.  We are still awaiting a report from the public consultation that was completed in July 2019.  I understand that a draft report is available or is currently being examined.</p> <p>  As regards the rates, according to the registry in the Central Bank we still have moneylenders here that are charging the maximum rate at 187%.  Compare that with the alternatives to which most of the rest of us in this room have access.  This morning, I saw that my local credit union is offering a special rate of 4.99% APR.  There is just no comparison between that and 187%; it is a huge contrast.  It seems grossly unfair that anybody in my community would have to pay 187% when the local credit union is available at 4.99%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.756" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#C00900"><p>I agree.  That is the subject of this legislation.  To follow up on that, Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne wrote in their report that global interest rate restrictions have become more prevalent in both developed and developing countries in recent years.  They state that in Europe there has been a clear trend towards the use of interest rate restrictions as a policy tool to control the high cost of credit.  The report goes on to say that, to date, 21 out of 28 EU member states now have some form of interest rate cap on credit.  It says that Ireland is now in the minority of countries in Europe that has no formalised interest rate restriction on high-cost credit and points out that the only cap we have is on credit unions at 12%.  I agree with the report's recommendation and I will appeal to the Minister for Finance to use this legislation to do both, that is, reduce the interest rates that can be charged by moneylenders while, at the same time, marginally increasing the cap for credit unions.</p> <p>  According to the report, other countries introduced a cap because they saw ultra-high interest rates as unjust.  Germany says they lack moral legitimacy and Spain deemed them excessive.  Finland reported it as unconscionable.  However, in Ireland it appears to be fair game.</p><p>With interest rate caps elsewhere in Europe being legislated for or dealt with, what has been the international experience as a result?  I am conscious that there might not be the same type of strong credit union network in those countries such as we have in this jurisdiction.  Have the witnesses looked at the international experience of what happens when there is a cap on interest rates for high-cost credit? </p></speech>

If we look at the example in the UK, however, the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, has been extremely active in this area.  It introduced this cap on payday lending and not so much on home collection credit, and in the area of payday lending we are looking at interest rates in the thousands of per cent.  The FCA has undertaken that initiative while also having a systematic approach to measuring the impacts and also reviewing the impact of the restriction every two to three years.<br/><br/>The website of the FCA is a really useful one for anyone listening today to look to get detailed information.  The FCA also has a very proactive approach to measuring the impacts experienced, as well as conducting the aforementioned systematic and ongoing review of that interest rate restriction.  There is a very interesting report on the FCA website from 2017, which surveyed high-interest rate customers.  It looked at about 1,500 such customers who had been using such high-cost credit, and asked those people what they did now without access to such loans.  Of the respondents, only two had turned to illegal moneylenders.  The report found therefore that the rate at which people turned to illegal moneylending as a result of interest rate restrictions to be quite low in the UK.<br/><br/>I reiterate what I said in my opening statement concerning the argument about people turning to illegal moneylending avenues being seen as an unintended consequence of an interest rate restriction.  To my mind, that argument has caused a bit of paralysis in the Irish context.  We keep going back to that argument and using it as a reason to not make any changes and to just stick with the <i>status quo</i>here.  The provision of legal high-cost lending is seen here as the lesser of two evils <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>illegal moneylending.  We have often just decided that it is better to leave the <i>status quo</i>as it and to not do any damage in this area.  <br/><br/>Of course, that perspective is complicated by what the definition of &quot;illegal moneylending&quot; is, and it could be anything from a friend or a neighbour giving someone a loan of some money, right up to a scene from Hollywood movies involving with illegal moneylenders and people coming to front doors with baseball bats.  What is also interesting from our perspective, however, is that we did some research with social housing residents in 2020.  What was really noticeable was that we cannot just assume that because people have reduced or no access to legal moneylending that their default action will be to go to illegal moneylenders.  People on low to moderate incomes are enormously resilient and can find all sorts of ways to meet their needs when necessary.  <br/><br/>I am on the board of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and that organisation would also say that people are extraordinarily resilient and will find alternative ways of dealing with their situations.  In a way, therefore, I think we should try to move on from this argument about illegal moneylending.  It is important, however, if we do introduce an interest rate restriction here that we also put in place a method of systematically reviewing the impacts of any such measure, as has been done in the UK by the FCA.  Perhaps such a review could be undertaken every year or two to ensure that any unintended consequences can be managed.</p></speech>

I welcome that research, especially the research which was done in Ireland.  It is interesting following the two debates, while there were different restrictions in respect of payday lending, that the same types of argument were put forward regarding illegal moneylending.  I refer to the scare factor, and the impact that it might have had in the debate in the UK, but it did not play out that way ultimately.  Although people have access to credit union lending, we know that what is important in this context is ease of access, such as in situations where someone calls to people's doors to offer a loan or the ability to roll over an existing loan.  It is that ease of access that then causes people to use these channels and end up paying &euro;300 for a &euro;500 loan over 12 months, compared to &euro;30 for the same loan amount in the credit union.</p> <p>  On that point, and I direct this question to Mr. Whelan or Ms Corcoran, and regarding the changes taking place within moneylending operations as a result of the lockdown, what are we seeing as a result of moneylenders not being able to call to people's doors to collect money?  I refer to the online payment methods now being facilitated in this context.  The argument that used to be made concerning the reason for the high cost of such credit centred on the labour cost involved, and that was why costs needed to be that high.  Are we now seeing any changes happening in this regard, in Ireland or Britain, or in both, as a result of this current situation?  Does this situation now create an opportunity for us to begin a reduction of that first tier of the interest rates charged?  In the witnesses' view, should we announce the ultimate point to which we believe the interest rates being charged should be brought down and then step that change to the desired level over several years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#D00400"><p>I will take that question.  I am conscious that my video may not working, but there is nothing I can do on this side because I do have it switched on.  I will keep going anyway.  From informal discussions and soundings we have taken, we understand that during the periods of lockdown the moneylenders have contacted their customers.  As Ms Corcoran said earlier, the majority of those people concerned have bank accounts.  They have made their payments to the agents by quoting their bank account numbers, and those agents would then have a process where they could raise a debit on the bank accounts concerned.  We have also heard that meetings are taking place in locations other than homes, and in other cases we presume that the money owed may be being stored up until such time as the lockdown ends.</p> <p>  What is probably even more relevant in this regard, though, is the business of Provident Financial Group, PFG, in the UK.  It is a public limited company, PLC, listed on the FTSE100.  In its third quarter trading statement, the company reported that the proportion of collections in respect of home credit via remote methods was over 80%.  Back in 2019, Provident had announced that it was moving from manual collection of repayments via agents knocking on doors to electronic payments instead.  In a year or two, therefore, it looks like that company has managed to get 80% of its customers to pay electronically.  Provident also reported that the benefit to the company from that changeover was a reduction in costs of &euro;13 million.  The concept of moving to electronic operations and managing the credit risks that arise from not knocking on doors therefore looks to be something that the moneylenders have done successfully in the UK, and I see no reason it cannot be done here.  </p></speech>

I found their submissions very helpful.  I also commend Deputy Doherty on introducing this important legislation, and I hope we can enact it promptly.  That is of course the responsibility of the Oireachtas and of the Government.  The area of financial services is one that requires vigorous regulation, and it is surprising that we as a country have allowed a situation to develop where people can be subject to an annual percentage rate, APR, of interest as high as 187%.  What makes this situation particularly concerning, as the witnesses have indicated to us, is that to a great extent it is low-income borrowers who are impacted in this context.</p> <p>  I have a question that perhaps Dr. McCarthy and Dr. Byrne may be able to help me with.  There are obviously reasons low-income borrowers go to moneylenders rather than the credit unions.  Mr. Whelan gave us the example whereby if people borrowed from a credit union they would only be paying an interest amount of &euro;30, but would have to pay up to &euro;300 for the same amount of borrowing if they go to a moneylender.  What is the reason for that happening?</p><p>What can we do to encourage people to go to credit unions as opposed to moneylenders?  Is it simply a question of ease of access?  What recommendations could the witnesses make to credit unions in order to make their approach more attractive to borrowers than what appears to be the attractive approach being presented by moneylenders?  Dr. McCarthy or Dr. Byrne might be able to answer that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Noreen Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#E00200"><p>One of the primary reasons that moneylenders are an attractive option, as Deputy Doherty said, is ease of access and convenience.  Another point is that there is a tradition of using them.  People's parents would have used a moneylender in the past and now the next generation is doing the same.  Another aspect that makes it difficult to drive a change is that people have good relationships with the moneylenders.  It is usually not, as Dr. McCarthy pointed out, a baseball bat scenario.  The moneylenders are almost seen as family friends.  In addition, there is an aspect of keeping the agent in employment.  There is a bit of that going on as well.  These people are sitting in the borrower's sitting room or kitchen and the borrower knows them very well.</p> <p>  In regard to costs, including labour costs, one of the things on which the moneylender does not have a cost is marketing.  Moneylenders are in the family context and can prompt people and so on.  Marketing their services is a cost they do not have.  There are lots of issues involved.  Research we did some time ago involved talking to a credit union manager who had put a lot of work into getting people to switch to the credit union.  His building was across the road from a housing estate and he could see the moneylender heading back in there.  The moneylender had been moved out of the estate by the credit union offering services but people ended up, where they had funeral costs or whatever, going back to the moneylender and back into that relationship.  If we can change the context, as Ms Corcoran and Mr. Whelan noted in their submissions, then the model will change somewhat and it will be possible to transition people to a different way of operating.</p> <p>  Another important point is that the focus in terms of moneylending has always been on the individual.  Instead, the focus needs to be on the household and the community and looking at the where the drain of wealth out of a community is happening.  When the focus is only on the individual, we get into a scenario of people saying they are satisfied and it is a convenient service and all of that.  We end up in a place where we may ask who we are to tell someone from whom they should borrow.  If we can encourage individuals to think in a community context and to consider that moneylending leads to a massive drain of wealth out of the community, that can shift the conversation somewhat.  There may not be enough research done on this particular aspect.  We have done a few small bits but only on a geographical basis.  We tried to do that in the context of the social housing research we talked about earlier.</p> <p>  It is a difficult issue to tackle.  The transition idea is useful in terms of encouraging people to operate in a different way.  It is very convenient that somebody comes to the borrower's house and that person can buy a washing machine and things like that for the borrower.  That is the other point in terms of a drain of wealth.  If the moneylender is providing a washing machine, for example, it is probably purchased elsewhere, which means none of the money is staying locally.  It is all drained out of the community and there is no savings elements either.  Things need to shift towards a community wealth-building kind of conversation and space.  That encourages individuals to think differently and it encourages policymakers and everybody else to think differently as well.</p></speech>

We have found that to make it attractive and to move people from a very ingrained moneylending model is very difficult.  For that particular loan product, we organised a repayment method through the household budget scheme, which made the repayments very attractive, allowed for savings and allowed the credit unions to work with people who might have a default history or just were not used to dealing with the credit union.  Those people had the support to come into the local credit union, build up that track record and move on to standard lending.  We have some amazing examples of how that has worked really well.</p> <p>  However, we also found as part of this initiative that it was not enough.  That is why we called for the cap on moneylending rates.  It is not enough to have a really good and attractive option.  That looks fine on paper and makes sense for some people but, for others, it does not.  It is not necessarily intuitive that somebody would go to a credit union even if the loan it is offering is at a lower rate than that offered by a moneylender.  We have also found over the years that the people who typically borrow from home-collection moneylenders deal with finances on a week-to-week basis.  It is not a case of their standing back and saying that a loan is costing them X amount more per year.  It is a question of asking whether they can afford something in a particular week.  It might be an extra fiver and they will make a decision there and then as to whether it is worth it to know they have that line of credit and that they can repay it.  Those are the things we are trying to break down as part of this effort.</p></speech>

Is there anything that credit unions or other community figures can do to replicate what Ms Corcoran's organisation has done with the It Makes Sense loans in order to make people more aware of sources of income other than moneylenders?</p></speech>

We find that credit unions report to us when they offer those loans that sometimes people will come in and find they qualify for standard lending.  Sometimes a different initiative is not needed.  Credit unions that are not participating in the It Makes Sense initiative run a lot of local schemes.  There are sometimes referral systems, either through the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, or the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which is a huge player in this regard and would have an awful lot to add to this debate in terms of what it sees locally.  The society often works closely with credit unions to move people towards them.</p> <p>  An important point in all of this is that there are a lot of stakeholders who need to come together to make sure that we offer alternatives to people and enable them to avail of what is there.  In addition, if community welfare officers, through the Department of Social Protection, are more attuned to what is available and how we can help, that is another way of moving people on from moneylenders.  However, it is a very ingrained model and we really need to look at it from the point of view of that people are dealing with a service that is available in their own home.  We are trying to reverse from there.</p></speech>

The purpose of Deputy Doherty's Bill is to amend section 9 of the 1995 Act by inserting a new subsection (4).  Section 9 of the Act provides for a method of calculation of the annual percentage rate, APR, which is set out in the fourth Schedule to the Act.  It is a very complicated mathematical method of calculation.  When we get to Committee Stage, I wonder whether the Schedule may also need to be amended or if it is satisfactory just to include the new subsection (4).  We may not be able to come to a conclusion on that question today but it is something we might have to look at when we get to the next legislative Stage.</p> <p>  I thank the Vice Chairman for accommodating my questions and the witnesses for answering them.</p></speech>

From dealing with these issues in my own area, I am aware of the high numbers of people who are going to moneylenders.  It is key to our understanding of why people use this service that there is a community context to it and that the moneylenders know families well.  That is why it is difficult to change things.  The situation is different at the moment with the Covid crisis but the reality is that these moneylenders are sitting in people's kitchen and they know everything that is going on in people's lives.</p> <p>  MABS said recently that there is now a tsunami of household debt.  I know from people who contact me that they are increasingly going to moneylenders.</p><p>This is in order to pay for different items and as a result of Covid they have seen costs increase or have a smaller income.  Have the witnesses seen an increase with people moving towards moneylenders?  It was put very well earlier that the major cost associated with moneylenders really traps people in debt.  Is there a direct correlation between being trapped in debt and an impact on mental health?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.774" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Whelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021021600002#F00200"><p>We do not have any information at all on the impact on mental health arising from paying very high interest rates etc. so it would be very difficult to give an opinion on it.  From much of the research we have done with borrowers who use moneylenders, it seems a dependency on the moneylender tends to develop, and this is used very well by moneylenders lining up the next loan and so forth.  They tend to work in cycles.  In the first half of the year it is probably about communion and summer holidays whereas in the latter part of the year it is more about Christmas.</p> <p>  Although we are loath to generalise, the research on borrowers also tends to indicate that many have a weekly focus on expenditure.  When we say that during the course of a year they spend &euro;300 on interest and this could have been reduced significantly if the loan was with the credit union, they do not tend to see it that way.  They tend to see the expense as being &euro;5 per week extra and they say that is nothing or they can live with it.  If the requirement was for &euro;500 and they ended up paying &euro;300 in interest, it is clear that it is wrong that people are not fully aware that this could make a big difference to their borrowing requirements.  Does that help to answer the question?</p></speech>

When repaying a credit union loan, for example, part of the repayment includes a contribution to savings so the borrower is building up resilience.  When the loan is repaid, there would be a lump sum in savings that would support the borrower in not having to borrow again or slow down the rate of borrowing.  With the moneylending model there are no savings built in so at the end of repaying the moneylending loan, the borrower is not in a better position because he or she has not engaged in any savings through the repayment.  It is an important characteristic difference between more conventional finance and moneylending.</p> <p>  Of course, if a borrower is paying above the odds for a moneylending loan, this reduces a person's capacity to save anyway.  That is how a person can end up getting trapped in a cycle because the reduced capacity to save means there is no opportunity to build up any kind of resilience over the course of the loan to ensure the borrower does not have to borrow again as quickly or at all.  That is where the indebtedness element is relevant.</p></speech>

I am chair of the Credit Union Advisory Committee and I am familiar with how credit unions are performing.  Lending volumes have had an impact from Covid, and this was seen throughout all lending organisations over the course of last year and up to now.  We suspect that moneylending organisations probably experienced the same effect of a decrease in lending when restrictions took place as the ability to purchase goods declined or the likes of communions or holidays did not happen.  However, that volume has kicked back up again.  Provident's public statements indicate that although lending was down last year, it is beginning to tick up again.  We assume that pattern is being followed.</p></speech>

It is a stark visual when the witnesses say the moneylender is going back into the community despite all the different work done being done to try to get people to move towards credit unions.  It is clear this is not just about regulation but people's thinking or outlook.  Are there any kinds of regulatory changes that may be needed to promote credit unions or should the focus be simply on the psychology element?</p></speech>

That will change things.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has performed a very good function with curative debt advice but there is a need for a parallel system for preventative advice.  That should be at a local level and networked like a MABS arrangement.  MABS looked at this a number of years ago and it is an important function.  There is a big gap where we can help people build capability.  That could play an important role, particularly with respect to Ms Corcoran's comment about bringing all the different players together, including housing associations and community groups.  Everybody is plugging in at different points to help in this scenario.</p></speech>

We worked very closely with the regulator, the credit union representative bodies and individual credit unions to see what policy changes needed to be put in place.  We also worked with the regulator to ensure regulations were adhered to.  For example, a person with a default history can avail of an "It Makes Sense" loan.  Such things must be considered and those conversations are happening, which is great.  If they need to be wider, we have the right people around the table.  That is the important aspect of introducing a cap, declaring what is the ultimate cap and bringing it in on a stepped basis.  We can then work with all the stakeholders to ensure these different pieces are put together and work for potential borrowers.</p></speech>

All Members of the Oireachtas over the years have had to deal with cases of overlending or overborrowing.  If a person falls into difficulty with repayments, regardless of the borrowing source, the resolution should not entail recapitalisation of the loan.  That always leads to increased repayments.  If a person gets into difficulty in the first place with a certain level of repayments, he or she will not be in a much better position with an increased level of repayment.  They will be in a worse position.  When interest rates were higher, it was not possible to get out of that level of debt and there was no solution.</p> <p>  It is important to have structures, repayments and levels of interest determined by an outside body rather than lenders.  The lenders still have too much influence in putting up a proposal for resolution that would not be a resolution at all.  It would be a resolution to their advantage and the disadvantage of the borrower.  If nobody wishes to comment on that, we will proceed to hear Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>

When introducing this legislation, we made it clear to Government that we chose the 36% rate because that was the law before it was abolished many years ago.  This is all up for discussion and I, as the sponsor of the Bill, am open to engaging with Government about what the appropriate rate should be.  Part of this pre-legislative scrutiny is trying to determine that.  What do the witnesses believe the ultimate cap should be?  It is not the tiered, first, second, third or fourth step but where we should end up.  Should it be between 30% and 40%, should it be higher or should it be lower?</p></speech>

The question then is what the reference market rate is.  If the average market rate is about 8%, then one is talking about a rate of no more than 24%.  If it is 10%, then it would be no more than 30%.  The 36% APR in the proposed Bill should, in our view, be the upper limit, and it may well need to be lower.  It needs to be a multiple of the market rate to cater for the higher credit risk that exists with those customers, but we would have thought that a multiple of three would be the maximum ultimate rate.</p></speech>

The question of what the interest rate should be is probably the hardest asked today.  If we knew the answer, we would be selling it here today.  We are not experts in setting interest rates.  Mr. Whelan and Ms Corcoran have done substantial work in comparing it with other rates, looking at multiples of rates and so on.  It is tempting to say that anything lower than what is currently charged is surely a step in the right direction, but that would not be enough and it is important to set an ultimate rate.  In our submission to the public consultation conducted by the Department of Finance, we suggested an interim rate of approximately 42%.  We looked at the credit union sector in the UK, which is now allowed to charge up to 42% to cater for that market, but the situation in the UK is different from here.  We are certainly looking at a much lower rate than is currently in place, and 36% or lower would be appropriate.  What is currently charged is extremely high.  My local credit union offers 4.99%.  The rate has to be much closer to that.  I am answering but not answering at the same time.  It is a difficult question and there are people better positioned than us to work out what those rates should be, with more information, since we are working with imperfect information.</p></speech>

Members of the Oireachtas are attending this meeting remotely from their offices within the Leinster House complex.  It is not possible for them to participate remotely from outside the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  If there is unwanted microphone feedback, it may be necessary for me to ask participants to mute their microphone.  The person speaking may unmute his or her microphone.  I ask that participants keep their microphone on mute unless they are making a contribution.  </p> <p>  The meeting is being held in the Seanad Chamber.  We have a difficulty in that we do not have the capacity to have a private session today, so all our business must be conducted in public.  There are some administrative issues and correspondence which we can discuss at the end of the public session, even though we will still be in public session at that time.</p> <p>  As regards the rotation of members, I wish to be as fair as I can to everybody.  I appreciate we have a two-hour session, at the end of which we are obliged to cease our work.  If it is in order, I ask the parties to nominate their speakers.  I will begin with Sinn F&eacute;in, followed by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the SDLP, Alliance Party and DUP members who are present, and then the Green Party, the Labour Party and other members of the committee.  I wish to be flexible in terms of time because this is a very important meeting.  If there are no views to the contrary, we will go ahead with that approach.</p> <p>  Our engagement today is with Professor Colin Harvey of Queen's University Belfast and Mr. Mark Bassett, barrister at law, to discuss their paper The EU and Irish Unity: Planning and Preparing for Constitutional Change and related issues.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome them both to the meeting. </p> <p>    The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.  I invite Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

I look forward to our discussion.  The report was published in October 2019.</p><p>As members will be aware, there have been several significant updates since then and key developments.  It is our view that the key conclusions and themes of our original report still stand.</p><p> The context for the report and the discussion today is a broadening debate about the constitutional future of this island.  To assist the committee, we have submitted a range of background reading.  Members will be aware that not a day goes by without a new report, comment or initiative emerging around this debate.  In particular, we have given the committee some evidence about significant civic initiatives such as the work done by Ireland's Future.</p><p> The title and focus of our original report was deliberate.  The focus of our work is on planning and preparing in a responsible way for the change that we feel is likely to come on this island over the course of the next decade.  We very much welcome the growing recognition of the need for planning and preparation, along with the proliferation of projects and initiatives around this question, whether those are civic, academic or governmental.</p><p> We need to frame our report.  We intended essentially to mainstream and normalise the conversation.  The Good Friday Agreement contemplates reunification.  There is an international legal underpinning of the right to self-determination.  It is recognised in the domestic constitutional law of both states.  It is acknowledged in the Irish protocol and it has gained international recognition, all of which was comprehensively endorsed on this island on 22 May 1998.</p><p> We are essentially talking about commitments that have already been made.  We are talking about obligations that are there now.  We are also discussing taking forward what is an agreed process.  I am attempting to underline that what we are saying is rather a banal and boring point which should be of surprise to no one.  This is about taking forward things that have already been agreed.</p><p> The report was published in 2019.  Mr. Bassett, others and I have produced subsequent work where we have tried to help and assist those working in this debate by outlining the framework and answering some questions around principles.  We are trying to address what we believe a good faith interpretation of the Good Friday Agreement requires in an attempt to assist all of those who are increasingly involving in themselves in this conversation.</p><p> Our report also highlights the role of the European Union, its institutions and member states.  We very much hope that our work is in some way helpful to what is a growing conversation across this island, its future and constitutional change.</p></speech>

In the report, we have tried to identify the relevant aspects of EU law which concern Irish unity.  We have looked at the position adopted by the institutions and the matters which might require further work within them.  We have made some suggestions on how that could be addressed.  In the report, we set out that the EU has confirmed that the process of Irish reunification would be considered a matter of public international law, comparable to German reunification.  Ireland is a member state of the European Union.  In the eventuality of reunification, the borders of the State would change but there would be no need for a treaty amendment or approval by any of the institutions.</p> <p>  We have also set out some of the issues with which the European institutions could assist both the Irish and British Governments.  One important one is the rights of British citizens resident in a united Ireland under European Union law.  We make the argument that there should be no requirement that those citizens take up the option of Irish citizenship.</p> <p>  Another matter addressed in the report is the consequences for a united Ireland in the context of economic and monetary union.  We suggest that the institutions should identify possible problems and suggest necessary supports as well as exceptions from European Union law on economic co-ordination.</p> <p>  We have also looked at some of the ways in which the institutions, including the European Parliament, should consider ensuring the democratic rights of all citizens in a united Ireland are best addressed.  We have looked at possible changes in representation.</p> <p>  All of these are set out as suggestions at this point.  Some of the recommendations have made their way into the withdrawal agreement.  The report contains some recommendations that the institutions could take up and begin work on themselves in these certain subject areas.</p> <p>  I again thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to present this report.</p></speech>

This is a very timely discussion.</p><p>I was lucky and privileged to be in Europe the night Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett launched the report.  I thank them personally for their outstanding and dedicated leadership, the work they have put into this and the measured and inclusive way in which they have held all the discussions.</p><p> Much has changed since the report was launched.  Obviously, the institutions are back up and running, Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol have been implemented and there is the shared island unit.  Things have moved on considerably.  Against that background, will our guests give us a general assessment of the stage we are at with regard to progressing a united Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.799" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maskey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#C00200"><p>I again thank Mr. Bassett and Professor Harvey for their presentation.  I will keep my comments brief to allow others to come in.  Within the document, there is considerable mention of dialogue and communication with the different sectors in society.  If any lessons have been learned from the Brexit chaos and what we have seen over recent years, that dialogue did not take place among different sectors throughout the islands of Ireland and Britain.  Our guests might comment on what lessons have been learned from the Brexit issue and can be taken forward, in case a referendum on Irish unity is ever held.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.800" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Oacute;rfhlaith Begley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#C00300"><p>I extend the welcome to Mr. Bassett and Professor Harvey to the committee meeting.  Like Ms Gildernew, I was in Brussels for the launch of the report, and much has happened since then.  Both Brexit and Covid have reshaped how people view the concept of a shared island and that has accelerated the debate and discussion on Irish unity, while also introducing a fresh urgency in regard to the need to plan and prepare.  The document refers to the need for prudent and responsible planning and to the role of the Irish Government in that regard.  I understand that Professor Harvey attended the launch of the shared island unit.  While that is to be welcomed, the Taoiseach stated on that occasion that a referendum would not be on his agenda for the next five years and referred to it as divisive.  Many referendums are, by their nature, divisive but that does not negate the need to plan and prepare.</p> <p>  I would like to get our guests' views on the shared island unit.  How could it facilitate the discussion on preparing for a referendum and could it also be used post referendum?  If a referendum were successful, how could the unit be used to transition from partition to reunification?  When do those preparations and plans need to take place?  I refer in particular to the role of the Irish Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.801" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#C00400"><p>I thank Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett for their presentation.  My question relates to the broader role of the institutions, some of which were key players in the formation and creation of the Good Friday Agreement while others are part of the outworking of the agreement itself.  In the interim as we journey towards constitutional change, what role can the institutions, such as here in the Oireachtas, play to give voice to unionist and other traditions?  Seanad by-elections are due to be held soon, and while I am not asking our guests to comment on the finer details of that issue, it affords us a unique opportunity via the Seanad to amplify unionist and other voices here.  I am keen to hear our guests' views on the importance of the institutions acting in that respect in the here and now.</p> <p>  One of the other key institutions that was mentioned, not just in respect of the development of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement but which has also been vocal and active in the ongoing discussion on constitutional change, is the US Congress.  I am keen to hear our guests' views on what unique role the US could play in assisting and developing those conversations and the work towards constitutional change.  The Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union recently heard from Congressman Richard Neal, the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and the co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill, and it was a very valuable contribution.  In referring to the broader institutions, Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett might comment on what they consider to be the key role for the US.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#C00500"><p>I will work my way through the various questions before handing over to Mr. Bassett.  On the question about the stage we are at, we are obviously further on than we were in 2019.  As everyone will know, this conversation is gaining momentum every week.  More and more initiatives are coming on board, and I have mentioned some of the civic and academic ones, with major universities now engaging in some of this preparatory work.  I started by saying I think the island is on a trajectory towards these referendums taking place in the decade ahead but there is a need for more preparatory and planning work to take place.</p> <p>  As for the lessons learned from Brexit, where do we start?  Two issues stand out.  In the report and throughout the work we have done, we have placed an emphasis on responsible management and planning and preparing for constitutional change on the island, and that is not coincidental.  We have looked at what happened with Brexit and we do not want that to happen on this island.  We have placed enormous stress on advanced planning so that people will know what they are voting for or against when these referendums that we believe are coming take place.  That is why the planning and preparation needs to start now.  We have also emphasised the role of civic engagement.  It is notable, for example, that Ireland's Future has placed an all-island citizens' assembly at the heart of its proposals.  We do not need a top-down process; while we do need extensive Government involvement, we need to hear from people.  Too much of the discussion on the island at the moment is based on assumptions of what people think people think, rather than engaging with wider civil society.  We would very much like there to be extensive civic engagement.</p> <p>  On the questions about the Irish Government, I am disappointed to see the shared island concept being used and pitted against the idea of a united Ireland.  For me, a united Ireland is a shared island.  There is no either-or; these are not separate conversations.  The shared island concept is intrinsically linked to the notion of Irish reunification.  It is a new way of sharing the island.  I would really like the shared island unit and the Irish Government to take a much more proactive leadership role in this discussion.  It is at the core of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am aware of the argument about countering divisiveness but this should not be a divisive discussion.  This is absolutely mainstream within the Good Friday Agreement and if one respects the agreement in all its parts, one has to respect the right of the people of this island to determine their own future.  There is nothing divisive about that.</p> <p>  Turning to the institutions, it is notable that recent work, such as the recent discussion document published by Ireland's Future, has highlighted the role of legislatures throughout these islands in informing the debate.  Too often we go straight to talking about governments but legislatures, such as the Oireachtas and the Westminster Parliament, all have roles in carrying out the necessary planning and preparatory work.</p><p>Ireland's Future raised a basic question recently, which was to ask every institution on this island if they are prepared.  I ask this committee that today.  Is it prepared?  Is it ready?  Has the homework been done?</p><p> The committee will be delighted to hear two final points.  One is engagement, invitation and being welcoming and embracing.  We need to hear the diversity of voices that exist in the North of this island in the Oireachtas.  That includes unionist voices and an increasingly diverse range of voices here that are not heard.  The committee should welcome and invite people to come and speak.  It is fed up of listening to people like me so it should invite somebody else to come to talk to it and engage.  That is a way to extend a welcome to people from all communities in the North.</p><p> Regarding the US, we have deliberately focused on the international picture in much of our work.  We have talked about the EU but the US also has an important role in providing support in a number of ways.  There is now a supportive President in the White House.  We enjoy bipartisan congressional support from the US for some of the issues that we are talking about today.  It is important that bipartisan support continues into the future.  We have seen the US Congress support the Good Friday Agreement, including the right to self-determination.  It is important that friends in the US reiterate their support for the right of the people on this island to determine their own future and that should be a mainstream conversation.</p><p> What tangible international support will be available to an island that is undergoing constitutional change?  We could nudge that conversation towards asking what tangible support the US Administration will give both before and after the referendums that we are talking about today.  I hope that that conversation will become much more concrete in future.</p></speech>

We are kicking off what will be a lively debate.  It is good to get a perspective on this and kick off the conversation.  I note that there is correspondence from Ian Paisley that will probably be dealt with later.  I listened intently to the presentation by the witnesses.  I would like to get their perspective on a few matters.  For me, the Good Friday Agreement was hard-fought and took a lot to get over the line.  Many people see it in the context of those few weeks.  Much work went on behind the scenes over many years.  Why has the report not considered the impact of the US Congress and Presidency?  The Good Friday Agreement is a model that has worked for us on this island previously.  Why do the witnesses now think that we should work this through the EU?  What dialogue have they had with unionist communities and politicians and what are their impressions of the report?</p> <p>  Professor Harvey referred to the shared island unit.  I find that hard to take from an academic because some of the presentation sounds like it is only a matter of having the referendum and then we are away.  Let us not be that simplistic and let us remember how hard this was fought and won previously.  It is not as simple as having a referendum.  Much more dialogue needs to be held with unionist politicians.  Without them being on board, I do not see this happening.  My fear is that if there is a referendum tomorrow, it would not be won on either side of the Border.  There is much work to be done.  Reports like this and the language used in them make it much more difficult to achieve the objective that we are talking about.  I feel that we are putting the cart before the horse.  We have not had the necessary dialogue to bring unionists with us and create trust.  The idea of the shared island unit is to create that trust and start working with them.</p> <p>  We were at the beginning of a process and the Northern Ireland protocol came along.  As we know from meetings last week, relationships are at a delicate stage.  This is a delicate process.  I do not agree at all that it is comparable to Germany.  Those are my views.  I am interested in hearing other people's views.  I would love if it was that simple but it is not.  The majority of us, in our hearts and souls, know that.  We are here having a discussion and there are no unionists at our meeting.  There is much to do before we get to the stages that the witnesses are talking about.</p> <p>  The US is paramount in all this.  It was the key element in the Good Friday Agreement.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned that Richard Neal was presenting to us in the Seanad Chamber.  I mentioned to him that day that it is my opinion that, with the involvement of the US Congress, a similar agreement to the Good Friday Agreement will be needed to get to a shared future.  The more that we talk up a united Ireland, the less chance that we have of getting unionists to the table.  I do not like to think of what the future will hold in that scenario.  Peace has been hard-won on this island and I would not want to take steps back before we go forward.</p></speech>

The Good Friday Agreement represents a dramatic change in my life as a person from a Border constituency.  I never thought I would see it or to be able to speak to the committee about a united Ireland.  This conversation needs to be had in a sensitive manner.  We are on the hill of change.  We can all stay on that hill together and battle against the winds and the elements, or we can fall down like Humpty Dumpty and go back 30 years to where we were.  We do not want to go back.  Too many lives have been lost and destroyed.</p><p>Too much trust has been broken again and again to go back to those things.  The report is very interesting but the discussion about it being very like East and West Germany being put back together again is a bit too simplistic.  To me we are one island.  We have been one island since we left the Continent, probably 1 million years ago, but we are two jurisdictions.  I would love to be able to say we would have a border poll in the morning but what would be the price of a border poll in the next two years?  Is it that we will have a united Ireland but we will have left a whole pile of our population behind?  We did that in the 1920s and we do not want to repeat it.  We had a civil war over leaving people behind in the 1920s and we do not want to do it again.  We have to learn from our past and from our mistakes.</p><p> An awful lot of jurisdictional change would need to be done.  We are speaking here about the work the Oireachtas has to do, but what about the work the British Government or Northern Executive might have to do?  Where do we converge?  Back in the day as a student, I did a thesis on how north Louth, south Armagh and south Down could come together.  It was a very aspirational thesis on economic integration.  We can only go so far unless someone starts converging, even on the likes of bin charges, electricity or rates.  In five years' time, where will all of these come in?  A body of work needs to be done very much from the Executive side just as much as it needs to come from the Oireachtas.  I would love to see one island yet again in every sort of way but we must not forget the mistakes we made in the past as a country.</p><p> I thank the witnesses as this is a great conversation to have.</p></speech>

It was one in a series of reports that looked at issues such as the possibility of special designated status for Northern Ireland.  Another report looked at what rights were available in EU law.  This is the reason the report took the shape that it did.  It was also intended to answer the question on what the status of a united Ireland would be in the European Union.  During the Scottish independence referendum, the status of an independent Scotland in the European Union was an argument used by the Barroso Commission and the UK Government against a "Yes" vote.  One of the purposes of this report was to give as clear an answer as possible that EU law recognises the right to self-determination.  A united Ireland would be a member state of the European Union.</p> <p>  An analogy is drawn with German unification in 1989 and 1990 for a number of reasons.  There are also very important distinctions.  The report tries to show how EU law approached that question.  Even back in 1957, when Germany joined the then European Economic Community, it included a declaration that German unification was a possibility.  As a matter of EU law, trade between East and West Germany was a matter of German domestic law.  We can see a parallel now with the common travel area and the provisions of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol.  There was also a constitutional duty on the West German Government to work towards unity.  We see this echoed in our Constitution.  There was a clear constitutional path to unity in the German constitution.  This is replicated in the Good Friday Agreement.  It is a centrepiece of the Irish Constitution.  It is a centrepiece of the Northern Ireland Act, which is part of the UK constitutional framework.  It is recognised in international law in the British-Irish Agreement.  It is now part of the bridge between the UK and European Union.  It is in the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  There are other similarities in the citizenship provisions.  Residents in East Germany could avail of West German citizenship and did so.  There are some similarities with the availability of Irish citizenship for residents of Northern Ireland.  The other parallel was that West Germany was a member state of the European Union in 1989 and 1990.  Very early on, first the European Parliament and then the Commission took the view it was an exercise in self-determination and that a reunified Germany would be a good thing for Germany and for the European Union.  Many of the institutions used the phrase with regard to German unification that it occurred "under a European roof".  There was assistance from the Commission.  There was political support in the Parliament and the Council, which was chaired by Charles Haughey.  There was a clear endorsement of the position in international law that this was not the creation of a new state but a changing border in an existing member state.  We say this is similar to what would happen in the eventuality of Irish reunification.  There are important differences but they should not be insurmountable.  We state West Germany and East Germany were more different at that time than North and South are now.</p> <p>  In terms of the self-determination provision, the votes and referendums for a united Ireland are absolutely fundamental to the Good Friday Agreement.  This right of self-determination is not an ornament but an instrument.  The expectation is that it will be exercised at some time.  It is not rhetoric like the pursuit of happiness in the US declaration.  Preparatory work does have to be put in before the votes.  People voting in both jurisdictions are entitled to honest, credible and ambitious answers on issues such as healthcare, currency, employment and the administration of justice.  This preparatory work should be taking place now.  The Irish Government is particularly important in leading this type of work.  It is also true that the Oireachtas and the institutions in the North can assist.</p> <p>  With regard to some of the important work that could be undertaken, we imagine that in a united Ireland there would be an immediate continuation of Northern Ireland institutions and law subject to the Constitution.  The other matter would be that the Irish Constitution may have to be updated and possibly amended to take account of all of the obligations of the sovereign power which are set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  A piece of work that could be done in either institution would be an audit of what aspects of Northern Ireland law may have to change and an audit of Irish law, including what provisions of the Constitution, if any, would not be consistent with the duties of equality, parity of esteem and citizenship that would come with a united Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.814" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#F00500"><p>I will take a number of points that were raised.  First, in terms of the work that Mr. Bassett and I are doing, we recognise the complexity of the issues involved.  At no point have we ever suggested that any of this is easy; it is complex.  That is why we are calling for responsible planning and preparation and for that to involve civic society, but also to be government-led and resourced.  It is precisely because we know this is complicated that we need the advanced planning first.  I cannot reiterate that enough.  The homework needs to be done in advance.  Nobody is calling for a border poll next Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  People are calling for advance planning.</p> <p>  Second, when talking about the Good Friday Agreement we have to respect the right of unionists and loyalists in Northern Ireland to engage and participate in the conversation and, also, to engage and participate in the conversation about the maintenance of the union as well.  We need to respect both of those things.  There will be members of the unionist community here who are happy at a civic level to engage in either private or public conversations about the future of this island or these islands.  There will be people within the unionist-loyalist communities who would prefer to focus on the maintenance of the current union.  We have to respect that.  </p> <p>  We have to also acknowledge that the report we have produced is an independent, academic, legal report.  We have tried to frame the legal and policy space for inclusive conversations to emerge and develop.  One of the interesting things that we have noticed in the past while is the civic dialogue that is emerging and voices from within civic unionism that are increasingly participating in this debate.  For example, I was struck by an event organised last week by Ireland's Future where people from a unionist background were participating in a civic conversation about the future of this island.  It was marvellous to see that.  </p> <p>  In terms of going forward and Senator Blaney's point, there needs to be clarity from the Irish Government, this committee and the Oireachtas that unionists are welcome in the south of this island.  There is often a lot of talk about the North.  We started by emphasising the need for welcome and invitation, including to this committee.  That is work in progress.  We have to respect the different elements that I have outlined.</p> <p>  Senator Blaney also raised a question about the shared island unit.  I welcome the establishment of that unit, but I would like it to be more ambitious and to be properly resourced and facilitated to co-ordinate and do the type of work that we are talking about, with an emphasis as well on leadership and co-ordination.  Members will have noted, as we have, a proliferation of projects.  There is a lot of work being done now, but more work is needed.  At some point, there will need to be co-ordination of some of those projects to avoid duplication of effort in terms of some of the things we have talked about and are proposing.  I would like to see the shared island unit being more ambitious.  I would also like it to be properly resourced to take on a leadership role and a co-ordinating role in terms of some of the work that will be done.  </p> <p>  To reiterate the point I was trying to make, I do not see the united Ireland discussion and the shared island conversation as separate.  They are part of the conversation about how we are going to share this island in the future.  As we said at the start, all of this is about obligations and commitments that are already there which, as stated by Mr. Bassett, are not merely decorative and ornamental and at some point will be operationalised.  We would like everybody to get ready.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their engagement with the committee today.  Unionist members and all MLAs and MPs from all parties are welcome to be on this committee.  We wish they would participate, but I can imagine it is difficult for them when the conversation, as it is today, is dominated by an inevitability of a unity referendum.  It was mentioned that no date has been set but the witnesses are already on record as suggesting 2023 as a possible year for such a referendum.  That is very close.  I do not believe we are anywhere near ready for that.  I note that today that date has been mitigated to within ten years.  These are presuppositions that I do not believe are there.  I do not agree that the comparison between Germany and Ireland is valid, historically, constitutionally or in terms of identity.  I reject that part of the report.  I do not think it is the same thing.  In Germany, there was not a large group of people on one side who have a distinctly different identity and a different constitutional preference.  There is not the same work on identity and humanity over other constitutionalities that would need to be done here as in the case of Germany.  I reiterate the point made by Senator Blaney in that regard.</p> <p>  I find the report lacking in its concern in regard to not just the identity and political concerns of unionists but the rights-based concerns, despite that it focuses a great deal on that issue.  In regard to the constitutional structures that may be appropriate or relevant, either at an Irish constitutional level or recognising those rights-based concerns from an ECHR perspective, while pages 66 to 69 acknowledge it, I believe the entire report needs to be infused with this idea rather than the inevitability of the constitutional structure changing.  There is a supposition in the report that we must think about unity now and that because lots of people are talking about it means everybody is engaged in it.  I do not believe that is so politically.  As Senator Blaney said, to do so may be significantly counterproductive to those who would want an Irish unity referendum soon.  What are the consequences of having that referendum in 2023 or 2028 and people not participating in it and the turnout being low?  I appreciate and fully understand the constitutional and legal rules that are there, but what are the political ramifications of this?  What is the legitimacy of any such referendum?  What are the consequences of having such a referendum in those circumstances and losing?  What are the legal, political and social consequences of those things?</p> <p>  We do not have sufficient engagement with unionists at the moment.  To be honest, I think it is a bit premature.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' responses to my questions.  Senator Blaney asked about the engagement with unionist politicians on this report.  I am also interested in hearing about that.</p></speech>

I know Professor Harvey is based at Queen's University Belfast, which I attended.  It is nice to engage with him.  I have watched his presentations in the past and I have heard him speak a number of times.  It is nice to get the opportunity to connect virtually.  My worst nightmare is that we would have a border poll and we would lose.</p><p>My worst nightmare is that we would not have an inclusive island based on the visions of people like John Hume, Seamus Mallon and Austin Currie and that would alienate people.  I do not want to be in a situation where the shoe is on the other foot in terms of how our community would have felt in the 1960s and 1970s.  My worst nightmare would be a return to how things were in terms of losses of life and violence.</p><p> I do not believe people should apologise for being cautious about any of this.  One of my questions is about where Professor Harvey sees reconciliation in all of this.  I feel we have scratched the surface of the work that needs to be done regarding reconciliation.  Much of the time it is talked about but it does not feel like the biggest priority all the time, and to me it should be.  I would like to hear Professor Harvey's views about that.  I was interested in what he had to say about the terminology around the border poll and the language of the border poll.  I know he wrote this report in 2019.  I would like to hear how he feels about that now.</p><p> Professor Harvey has had a lot of engagement about the British Government and how a referendum would be triggered.  Perhaps he could give an overview of where he is with that.  There is a need here to separate out the electioneering around a united Ireland and then, at the same time, the preparatory questions and seeking of clarity on issues.  It is difficult to do that, however, without moving down the road of people starting to electioneer.  We already saw that in our previous general election.  There was no sense that a border poll would be in five, ten or 20 years; it was let us have a border poll now.  How does Professor Harvey make that distinction?</p><p> My message is that I do not believe it is wrong for people to be cautious whenever there is so much at stake.  Much work has gone into all of this.  I certainly feel that reconciliation must be at the core of everything we do.  The report was written in 2019.  I know Professor Harvey has engaged with many people.  How does he find the level of engagement from unionists in general, not just when talking about diversity and inclusiveness, but in actually having that engagement?</p></speech>

I remember when I was on Louth County Council in early 2017, approximately six to ten months after the Brexit referendum happened, that Sinn F&eacute;in had a motion calling for a border poll.  One of the points I made back then, which I still believe now, is that we are far better off having a border poll when we know we are going to win it rather than taking the risk of losing it narrowly or of there not being a huge turnout and the narrative of it being questioned.</p> <p>  What do Mr. Bassett or Professor Harvey need to see in Northern Irish or Irish society to know there is a very good chance of a border poll actually being successful?  What barometers are they are looking for to know there would be a credible chance?  I accept that many people are talking about and discussing it.  What key barometers are the witnesses looking out for to know whether a border poll would have a good chance of being successful?</p> <p>  One of the points mentioned in the report was about voting rights.  The witnesses said that we need a much more generous and inclusive franchise on both sides of the Border for this referendum when it comes along.  In Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett's views, what is a generous franchise?  South of the Border, for example, is that opening it up to non-Irish citizens who currently cannot vote in referendums?  Would it even mean opening it up to Irish citizens living abroad?  Perhaps the witnesses would expand on how wide they see that franchise of who could and could not vote in the referendum.</p> <p>  Mr. Bassett said that if a united Ireland was successful, we would have to have a continuation of the institutions on either side of the Border until we get an idea of what does and does not work.  How long would he envisage that happening?  What does he see in terms of an amalgamation of two parliaments on this island?  What does that look like?  When does that happen after a unity referendum has possibly passed?</p> <p>  I wish to back up what Senator Blaney and my colleagues, Senator Currie and Deputy Carroll MacNeill, said.  While I am not afraid to take on this debate and I do not mean to say that we are going too far ahead, because it is really important to have these conversations now and, as everyone agrees, to plan for this now, I would be fearful that we are leaving the unionist community in Northern Ireland behind where, with some of the dialogue and rhetoric they are seeing on this side of the Border, they are under the impression that a referendum might happen in the next year or two years.  What more are we doing to make sure those concerns are looked after and that we make this as least divisive as possible when the time comes?</p></speech>

We would both like to take some of those questions and make sure we both have a chance to respond, if that is okay.</p> <p>  The starting point is that this is the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Where we started in the report and in our opening statement is that this is central to that agreement.  I have been quite concerned both about the attempt to try to differentiate this out from the agreement but also the language that often follows it.  This is absolutely at the core of the constitutional provisions of the agreement.</p> <p>  In framing that as well, we have to mention the Brexit context.  Many committee members will know that this part of the island is now outside the European Union.  The provisions of the Good Friday Agreement offer people here across all communities an opportunity to return to the European Union.  It seems to me that it would be frankly bizarre if we were not having this conversation in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>  Brexit has also noticeably, tangibly and dramatically changed the nature of that conversation here.  Many of the arguments one would have traditionally heard around this are falling away and being replaced by new arguments and new people engaging in the conversation.  We must mention the Brexit context.</p> <p>  In terms of consequences and thinking about what happens before and after, what we have tried to do in our work is answer some - not all - of the questions, but to guide everything we do by urging this committee and others to do the preparatory and planning work in a responsible way so the referendums are managed in a way that addresses the concerns quite rightly raised by the committee and so that we also think in advance about the consequences and what happens next.  We do not want to be in the position that emerged around Brexit and we have tried to make that as clear as we possibly can.</p><p>We need to know, for example, what people will actually be voting for.  There is a lack of clarity around that and that must be addressed.  I do not see any contradiction between the concept of reconciliation and responsible planning for the referendums that are anticipated in the agreement.  In fact, the responsible approach to reconciliation on the island would be one that proactively has concrete and practical things to say about the referendums that are anticipated.  The irresponsible thing to do, and what would impede the process of reconciliation, is to pretend that these provisions of the agreement are not there.</p><p> One of the remarkable things about the provisions is the role of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in triggering the process.  Mr. Bassett and I have done quite a lot of work around that.  It motivated me to write a letter to the Secretary of State about his role and I am waiting for a slightly more detailed response to that.  It is something that we need to hear more about.  It is remarkable that fundamental constitutional change on the island of Ireland could potentially be triggered by a Secretary of State in London on a basis on which we do not have sufficient information.  That motivated my letter and I know others have also been trying to get a response.  It would be helpful if this committee could follow up on this matter after the meeting to see if it is able to get more help in answering those questions.  The committee might have more luck on this than I have had.  </p><p> On voting rights, on which Mr. Bassett will wish to speak, we have in our work suggested inclusive franchise.  We looked at what happened and is happening beyond the 2014 referendum in Scotland, such as the emergence of voting rights for those 16 years and over.  That is clearly an emerging trend and something we have suggested and recommended.  There is also a principled reason for that, particularly for the younger generation which will have to live with the consequences of all this.  It is important that they have a say in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Bassett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#H00200"><p>I thank members for their questions.  It is very helpful to get informed criticism and feedback on this report.  It was written in October 2019 and it should really be a starting place for looking at these issues.  As Professor Harvey said, one of the possible triggers for unity referendums would be the consideration of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that there is a pro-unity majority in the jurisdiction.  Last year, an important decision was made by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal on the circumstances in which the discretion to call that vote exists and also the circumstances in which the duty to call that vote would arise.  The court was very definite that the Secretary of State must approach that question on the basis of relevant evidence, in an honest manner and consistent with the duty of the UK Government to act with rigorous impartiality.  It is not to be approached in the way that we might see the current UK Government approach the Scottish referendum, which is one that could be characterised as "This is a problem; how will it be defeated?".  The UK Government's obligation is to give effect to the wishes of the Irish people.  A relevant consideration for that is that Irish unity is a route back to membership of the European Union.  That is something that the Secretary of State should be considering.  The European Union is good for Northern Ireland and support for it remains high.  There is little chance of UK reaccession under Article 49.  The more plausible route at this stage appears to be Irish reunification and that is something the Secretary of State must take into consideration.  If a decision to hold a referendum was reached by the Secretary of State, to be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement it would have to be matched by a concurrent vote or referendum in the Republic of Ireland.  It would be better if the Irish Government and State were ready for that.</p> <p>  On voting rights, the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act provide a choice to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on who will make up the franchise.  There are two obvious choices.  The first is the Westminster voting lists, which are Irish, British, and qualifying Commonwealth citizens.  The other, the more generous one which we hope would be used, is the assembly and European Parliament lists, which include EU citizens.  In the Republic, if the vote on unity is to take the form of a constitutional amendment, that is, a change to the text of the Constitution, that is currently a restrictive list, one that is limited to Irish citizens resident in the State and registered as referendum electors.  There is the possibility of a distinction between the franchises in both jurisdictions which is unfortunate.  It is particularly unfortunate that British citizens resident in the Republic of Ireland could be excluded from that vote in the South.  That is where we are at the moment so these are the issues that should be addressed.</p> <p>  Reconciliation and unionist engagement with this issue are very important but they are not absolute prerequisites in the Good Friday Agreement to the triggering of these referendums.  The only legitimate basis for the partition of Ireland at this time is an assumption that the majority of people in the North support that constitutional option.  That is the centrepiece of the Good Friday Agreement.  If someone supports consent, we would say that person should also support the right for that consent to be tested - that is the right of self-determination, to use the language of the agreement, without external impediment.  If there is a majority in both jurisdictions for unity, the obligation of the Governments is to work towards that.  </p> <p>  I agree that there are very big differences between Irish reunification and German reunification.  What the report tried to do was to set out the similarities in the legal and constitutional frameworks.  It is correct that they would be seen, in terms of EU law at least, as comparable.</p></speech>

I agree with the point they are making on consent and the technical point in relation to that.  The point we are making is that while that is the case, it is not without broader political ramifications.  As Senator Currie said, there is a concern that not acknowledging those could lead to just as many problems as before.  That is the impetus behind these concerns.</p></speech>

I have some technical questions arising from their submission and then I may ask a question arising from the Ireland's Future document.  Professor Harvey has put a lot of effort into trying to get a comprehensive answer from the Secretary of State on what he thinks might trigger a vote.</p><p>It will not surprise him to learn that I do not believe we are that point either.  The words that always come to mind are those of John Hume on Magilligan Strand when he said, "You may govern us, but you do not have our consent".  In the century of partition, as we think about the impact that had on Northern nationalists, that is why the issue is at the front of many people's minds.  I acknowledge that things are moving very quickly and that the context has been changed, and I agree with Professor Harvey that it is prudent to explore the issues.  I wish to follow up on Senator McGahon's question about what he thinks are the signals the Secretary of State should be considering.  I appreciate that there are both legal and political interpretations of that.</p><p> The second question is about external impediment.  Professor Harvey referred to one argument that was made, and it was one made by my colleague, the former Member of Parliament, Mark Durkan, about EU membership not requiring Article 49.  He had framed the issue of EU membership as a potential external impediment.  How broadly does Professor Harvey think external impediment should be defined, and does he have views resulting from that about the participation of the UK Government and what form that might take?  In addition, what are his thoughts about the benefits of trying to transition this conversation away from a win-lose, "Yes"-"No" border poll and making it a conversation about two positive campaigns for two equally legitimate aspirations, as the Good Friday Agreement defines the constitutional aspirations in Northern Ireland?  How do we make it a conversation defined by the principles and precepts of the Good Friday Agreement and not the type of binary win-lose conversation that we know is making some people anxious, rightly or wrongly?</p><p> I have another quick question.  The impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement is obvious, and Professor Harvey knows that the Supreme Court took a very narrow view of what came under the principle of consent in the Miller case.  His Queen's University colleague, Professor Chris Cotton, criticised that judgment for taking a blunt view, and I agree.  Are there other aspects of the agreement that have a mainstream understanding or interpretation, but which Professor Harvey believes might be vulnerable to a different legal interpretation if somebody were to challenge it?  I appreciate that might be a somewhat specific question.</p><p> My last question is for Professor Harvey wearing his Ireland's Future hat.  What does he envisage and advocate as regards the relationship between Britain and a theoretical new Ireland?  How does he propose to enhance what is currently strand 3 and the east-west relationship?  What does he see as the continuing role, or not, of the UK Government in the early years of a new Ireland?</p></speech>

One of the first questions was about the role of the Secretary of State.  It is important to point out two matters.  One is that the Secretary of State has a discretion to do this at any time.  That is sometimes neglected.  The other element of it, which Ms Hanna refers to as the duty on the Secretary of State, is when there is a duty to trigger this.  The McCord judgment gives the Secretary of State a considerable amount of flexibility.  There are other things in that judgment as well.  In other words, the Secretary of State is not legally compelled to spell out a policy in an answer to one of my letters or in answer to a question.  However, just because one is not legally compelled to do something does not mean it is not a good idea to provide further clarification as a matter of political judgment.  There is nothing in the McCord judgment that would rule out the Secretary of State providing more clarity about the evidence that is taken into account and how that system currently works in the Northern Ireland Office - how often that assessment is reviewed, what types of evidence are weighed in the balance and how often Brandon Lewis refreshes his knowledge of that evidential base.</p> <p>  As regards the evidential base, it is everything that people have already spoken about in terms of credible and reliable polling.  There is also electoral evidence.  In the context of post Brexit and the strong Remain constituency here, there is scope for a legitimate range of views on where we currently are in respect of that question appearing likely.  Ultimately, the reliable credible evidence that is available would trigger that duty, but let me just turn that around slightly.  First, we need to be ready in this conversation.  What we do not want is the Secretary of State triggering this in the next couple of weeks.  It is much better to focus the conversation on being prepared on this island first.  I wish to make a suggestion.  I believe that when we are ready on this island and when, for example, the Irish Government steps into this debate and signals it is ready, I believe, and I may be wrong, that the Secretary of State in London will not stand in the way of this process going forward.  That is probably where we need to anchor the debate at present.  Yes, we will eventually get more clarity from the Secretary of State about the type of evidence he is using, but ultimately I would prefer to prioritise getting ready on this island.  My feeling is that when we are ready on this island the British Government will trigger this process, although I might be wrong.</p> <p>  Regarding external impediment, spelling out in a supportive and helpful way the consequences of both the process and outcome is not an impediment to the right to self-determination for people of this island.  There is nothing in that which would prevent the European Union or the US from being very clear about the type of support that would be available to a reunified Ireland within the European Union, primarily for some of the reasons that Mr. Bassett stated.  Member states and institutions of the European Union are affected by this decision.  This would be a constitutional change happening in an EU member state.  The EU has an interest in the outcome.  In fact, we recommend in our report that the Commission and the European Parliament should already be engaged in that type of preparatory work, to think about the consequences.</p> <p>  In terms of the debate, everything we have done in our work is to try to suggest that we make this conversation as boring, technical and undramatic as is humanly possible.  That might sound bizarre, but Ms Hanna will notice that we have not used the term "border poll" today, for example.  We have tried to focus on the fact that we are talking about concurrent referenda on the island of Ireland in which we hope the sides in this debate will focus on what the agreement is ultimately about, which is persuasion about different constitutional options.  I would prefer people to concentrate at present on building a credible and persuasive case to persuade people here and all people on the island about what the future might look like.  I emphasise that the agreement provisions on this are about persuasion and convincing people of the merits of respective cases.  At present, however, not enough work has been done.  If people were to turn up on doorsteps, when we are ever allowed to turn up on doorsteps again, what would people be saying on either side of the argument now?  Does anybody have the type of document the Scottish Government had when it approached the 2014 independence referendum?  I would prefer if the focus was there.</p> <p>  There are two final matters, and one is the technical point in the Miller judgment.</p><p>I have been surprised at the way consent has been used inaccurately in some of the conversations concerning the Brexit discussions.  The principle of consent, as used in the Good Friday Agreement for these purposes, is ultimately a debate about constitutional change and Irish reunification.  It is in that context that we are talking about consent here.  </p><p> The question about legal proceedings and courts has been raised.  I do not need to tell anyone here about what can happen once things enter a courtroom.  Mr. Bassett could perhaps comment more on this aspect as he is a barrister, but while we may feel we have a convincing and persuasive argument as to what the provisions of the agreement mean, there can be unintended consequences of litigation.  A judge or a set of judges may take a different view.  I think it is as clear as it can be, however, that the headline principle of consent refers to the debate we are having this morning on reunification.</p><p> I will give another example in respect of litigation.  Regarding the McCourt case, in writing to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and in taking the case itself, one outcome of that would be a judge, the Judiciary or the Secretary of State setting the bar at a very high level.  Sometimes we get the answer we might not want from some of these interventions, and that is as true of politicians as it is of members of the Judiciary in respect of litigation concerning the Good Friday Agreement.  Some parts of the agreement are not written in a way that is similar to an Act of the Parliament at Westminster but are instead open to elements of constructive ambiguity or perhaps destructive ambiguity which might be the better way of putting it.</p><p> Although much of the focus of our report and the discussion today has been about how we share this island, we are going to be sharing these islands in future.  The agreement will frame the conversation we have before and after these referendums.  At the centre of our work is the need for strong, robust and good institutional relationships around these islands.  It is a good point whether we might be able to do more in the context of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and the British-Irish Council or to add to their institutional architecture to ensure the relationships around these islands are good and prosper in future.</p><p> Part of the argument for constitutional change that people often forget or sometimes neglect is that those involved in advocating for constitutional change think relationships will be better at the far end of all this and that the system and the relationships we have now are not working.  Many of those advocating change and constitutional change feel committed to working for that change because they feel we can do better across these islands.  Holding Scotland in a constitutional arrangement which it does to want to be a part of, for example, does not seem to be the wisest thing to do from the perspective of good strong relationships across these islands in the longer term.  I am thankful for the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.834" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Farry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#K00300"><p>It might be helpful at the outset if I recap the Alliance Party position on these discussions.  As people will appreciate, the party is not defined around the constitutional question.  We have some elected representatives, members and supporters who take a pro-union perspective and some who already take a pro-united Ireland perspective, while most of our people would probably have an open mind regarding the future and be prepared to listen to debates on this topic.  Having said that, we are conscious that many debates are happening, not just on the future of the island of Ireland but also regarding the future of the UK.  We are willing to take part in any rational constructive discussion on a without prejudice basis.  In that regard, I am pleased to take part in this session and in similar exercises.  I also stress that the Alliance Party recognises the mechanisms contained within the Good Friday Agreement for decision-making, including the thresholds that have been accepted, albeit they can be fleshed out in much greater detail, as Professor Harvey and others advocate.<br/><br/>I will make a few other points before I address the specific question.  It is important to stress that the emphasis now must be on dialogue and issues regarding precisely what the questions would be in any referendums, if they were ever to occur.  That matter is still to crystallise.  It is the same with issues regarding the trigger points for any referendums being called.  They also need to crystallise, if at a later point.  The emphasis must be on discussions and conversations happening to see where consensus can be built.  There must also be a teasing out of several of the practical issues which we must address and to challenge ourselves concerning many aspects of those issues.<br/><br/>If we were ever to see a referendum called, it would also be crucially important that it would be one that would have a prospect of success.  A situation where Northern Ireland were to end up in a succession of referendums on this issue would be incredibly difficult for our politics.  We therefore see a referendum being very much the end point of a process.  There is no guarantee that a referendum would be called, but at the same time, if it were to be called, it would have to be a process which would move and proceed with some degree of smoothness while recognising the great differences of opinion in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Turning to the example of German reunification, I wish to stress that happened very swiftly following the fall of the Berlin Wall, in less than 12 months.  The process of reunification in that context was eased, however, by what was then the West German government taking a major decision to bear considerable financial and economic costs, which may not be an option on this island at this stage.  Obviously, the differentials that existed between West and East Germany are nothing close to the differences between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland today.  However, there was almost unanimous support across both parts of Germany for reunification, which will obviously not be the situation in the context of Ireland.<br/><br/>My question for Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett in the context of having recognised the principle of consent and that being a binary choice is whether they nonetheless also recognise, at least academically and theoretically, that there are other models we can talk about.  I refer to being able to talk about different models within what would essentially be a single Irish state.  However, are there other models, even <i>sui generis</i>types of considerations, of some form of shared sovereignty that could be explored as alternatives?  What would be the views of Professor Harvey and Mr. Bassett on that aspect, especially if those concepts were potentially likely to generate a much greater sense of consensus?<br/><br/>In the same vein, to what extent is it useful, without prejudice to any wider political or constitutional change, that we in the short run fully exploit what are still untapped opportunities for practical economic, social and environmental co-operation on the island?  I am struck that we have had the North-South structures of the Good Friday Agreement for more than 20 years now.  Whenever I sat on the North-South Ministerial Council, it struck me that it was a perfunctory-type process and it was not really being used to its full advantage.  On a practical level, therefore, by building on the shared island unit, among other initiatives, to what extent is there scope to focus in the short term on building up those aspects of practical co-operation of which I spoke?  That could be an end in itself or it could ease some of the wider political and constitutional questions that people want to pursue.</p></speech>

It would not really be a matter just for the Secretary of State alone.  It would be taken by the UK Government, would have to be approved by the electoral commission and would have to take into consideration the question to be asked in the Republic.  It would be unwelcome if the answer to unity in the North was "Yes" and it was phrased in a different way in the Republic such that there were clashing messages or clashing information.  In the Republic we would expect the question to be ultimately identified in the Attorney General's office, approved by the Cabinet and then the Oireachtas.  Hopefully, it could be contained in one question in much the same way that the provision of the Irish Constitution giving a higher status to EU law was achieved.  That would prevent incompatible or conflicting provisions of the Constitution.</p><p> It should be remembered that the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland which are on the horizon are possibly shaping up as a referendum on the withdrawal agreement and, in particular, the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol.  There is the possibility of exiting from some of the provisions which have prevented a hard border so Northern Ireland's membership of aspects of the internal market and the free movement of goods is not set in stone.  It is to be renewed.  In that context, where there is an express recognition of the democratic consent for the continuation of those provisions, the more obvious question is whether Northern Ireland would like to return to the European Union as part of a united Ireland.  That is also relevant to the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.837" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021021600002#L00200"><p>I will follow up briefly with some responses.  First, what we have tried to do in much of our work is to outline the existing framework in terms of the agreement and existing law and policy and to frame our responses in relation to that.  It is notable that Ireland's Future has placed an all-in citizens' assembly at the heart of its proposals.  Too much of this debate is based on assumptions about what people want, including about what people might want to continue into the future.  Those assumptions need to be tested by the groundbreaking idea of asking people and having engagement with citizens about what they want for the future.  The question is likely to be closely aligned, as in much of this, to the Good Friday Agreement language but the role of a citizens' assembly, as has been done in the past, in clarifying preferences around different options would be remarkably helpful at this time.  A citizens' assembly is a vehicle whereby experts would come and give presentations, in which a range of options would be laid out and we would all have a clearer idea of what people on this island want to see in the future.  Some of the assumptions we are making in this conversation need to be tested by speaking to people on the island.  I think that is a significant proposal.</p> <p>  The final point Dr. Farry made is a great one.  Let me be clear: we do not co-operate practically enough on this island at present.  The shared island unit and others have a massive role in ensuring that practical co-operation on this island is stepped up.  Institutions on this island at the moment do not engage or talk to each other anywhere near as much as they need to.  The sort of support that is promised in the programme for Government in the South, New Decade, New Approach, needs to be realised to build basic infrastructure and create well-being projects for everyone across the island.  We are talking about the future but the shared island concept is hardwired into the here and now as well as the future and we could do much better here and now in improving practical co-operation in anticipation of where we might be going next.  The Irish Government has a significant responsibility to be much more forthcoming in relation to this debate.  It needs to, in some senses, catch up with civic society and the leadership that is being shown across civic society on this island and join the conversation in a practical way.  I thank Dr. Farry for the question.</p></speech>

Ms Gildernew is wrong to make such an accusation and I reject it.  Sinn F&eacute;in was asked to nominate its speakers.  I told them they had ten minutes.  Over all the meetings we have had, I have bent over backwards to make sure Sinn F&eacute;in was notified.  I talked to Ms Gildernew before meetings and her colleagues during meetings to make sure they were clear on the fairness of the procedures in the Oireachtas.  I call Deputy Costello to speak on behalf of the Green Party.</p></speech>

I will echo a couple of things.  Senator Currie said we have only scratched the surface in relation to reconciliation and I feel that is true in respect of almost everything we have been discussing around this topic.  I would be interested in hearing more - perhaps with the Ireland's Future hat on, as was said - in relation to the conversation with unionists and loyalists about the future that they see.  When we tried to have a joint meeting recently with the Assembly, some unionist voices refused to join the committee simply because we were there.  That is not a very helpful approach - let us put it nicely that way.  It is not a helpful approach to these fundamental issues.  What is being done?  What can be done?</p><p>I share the speaker's call for the shared island unit to be more ambitious and to have and lead these conversations and the outreach to a community that does not want to engage with these conversations one way or another.  That is really important.</p><p> We must acknowledge that the Irish Government and State needs to do more.  Are we living up to our commitment to support the shared institutions?  Many members here have spoken about the North-South Ministerial Council being simply perfunctory and not meaningful.  Has the Irish State lived up to its commitments regarding reconciliation under the Stormont House Agreement?  It has not done so at all.  What does that say about the Irish State's view of the shared island and both communities?</p><p> There has been much talk about a complete return to violence but we must give some credit and realise that we are a different island from what we were in 1968 and 1969.  Part of this comes from the rights-based perspective and international human rights instruments that we must put front and centre as part of any conversation.  Surely these will provide a shared language of how to best make decisions.</p><p> I am also conscious that this is an incredibly complex matter and reducing it to a binary choice of "Yes" or "No" is not only difficult but potentially dangerous.  All we have to do is look at the campaign and rhetoric around Brexit to see how taking a complex matter and distilling it into "Yes" or "No" can cause problems.  This suggests the importance of the conversations beforehand and building a clear picture of what that "Yes" or "No" would be about.  There is also the possibility of exploring multiple choice voting or other novel ideas.  If the witnesses have an opinion on that, I would love to hear it.</p><p> Ultimately, there will be much more uncertainty.  There are matters that do not give a damn about a line on a map that will affect everybody and I keep talking about climate change in that regard.  It is just one challenge we are facing, no matter what community or side of the line we are from.  We must also be really cognisant that the union that many are loyal to is starting to crack.  A border poll held next week versus one held the other side of a Scottish independence referendum that succeeds would be a very different prospect.  I do not know to what extent a Welsh independence referendum is on the agenda but there is growing talk about it one way or another.  There is much uncertainty and if we are not trying to at least have those conversations, we will really struggle in the face of that complexity and uncertainty.</p></speech>

Both statements were fantastic.  What I am hearing today is that it is absolutely vital that we plan and prepare for constitutional change.  It is so important that we advocate and promote debate and discussion, including the possibility or viability of new constitutional arrangements on the island of Ireland.  That is very much guided by the Good Friday Agreement, the protection of human rights and equality and the fostering of mutual respect between all views and traditions that share this island.</p> <p>  We know Brexit has dramatically changed the social and political dynamic on this island and that is what we must talk about.  We have heard quite recently Mr. Bertie Ahern saying there will be a border poll within the next five to ten years.  We must prepare for that and bring in people from all backgrounds.  Ireland's Future is an organisation that is being driven by civic society and it held a wonderful webinar called "A New Ireland: A Warm House for All".  The panel comprised unionist voices and we heard that unionists want to have this conversation in civic society and are open to it.  Mr. Trevor Lunn, MLA, one of the speakers, said he would love to come to speak before this committee because he wants this conversation.</p> <p>  I warmly welcome the witnesses today to speak about this matter of constitutional change, which must happen on the basis of the consent of citizens on the island of Ireland as informed by the Good Friday Agreement.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland could call a border poll at any time and we must be ready.  This committee must be able to constantly discuss planning and preparations for what a new Ireland would look like.  That is vital.</p> <p>  The witnesses may not get a chance to answer my questions and the time has gone very quickly.  What can we do as a committee to support that planning and preparation?  That is really important.  What can we do as a committee to support the message being given by the witnesses today in preparing for a new Ireland?</p></speech>

I have received messages from Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Black and Deputy Carroll MacNeill.  There is interest in the question of alternative shared sovereignty models and the practicalities of constitutional change and shared identity.  We have had difficulties but I regret that Sinn F&eacute;in made that charge against me, which was unfair and unwarranted.

We have one piece of housekeeping before I bring in witnesses, namely, the draft minutes for the meetings of 9 February 2021.  Can I take it that the draft minutes of our last public joint meeting and the decisions taken at our private meeting last Tuesday, 9 February, regarding today's meeting are agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I want to correct the public record arising from information given by the HSE to the committee at its meeting of 2 February on the organisations that attend the Age Action Alliance monthly meetings.  The HSE has now confirmed that Care Champions, Sage Advocacy and the Irish Association of Social Workers are not among the groups invited to attend the monthly meeting.  The initial response from the HSE was that these groups were part of the alliance and clearly this is not the case.</p> <p>  I welcome our witnesses on the issue of A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding.  The safety and protection of vulnerable people should be central to a well-functioning society and we welcome the work of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, which is examining what is needed to have a comprehensive framework in place.  We got a copy of their document this morning and I welcome it.  It helps to clarify the situation.  I welcome from the LRC, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, president; Mr. Raymond Byrne, commissioner; Dr. Andrea Mulligan, commissioner; Ms Rebecca Coen, director of research; and Ms Leanne Caulfield, principal researcher.</p> <p>  Before the opening statements, I point out to the witnesses that there is uncertainty if parliamentary privilege will apply to evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Justice Mary Laffoy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021021600002#A00300"><p>On behalf of the LRC, I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us here today to discuss our project, A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding.  I am joined virtually by two of my colleagues on the commission, Dr. Andrea Mulligan, who is the co-ordinating commissioner, and Mr. Raymond Byrne, our full-time commissioner.  I am also joined by Rebecca Coen, director of research, and Leanne Caulfield, the principal researcher on this project.  My colleagues will take questions from the committee when I have completed the opening statement.</p> <p>  The LRC is a statutory research and advisory body.  Our purpose is to review law independently and objectively and to make proposals for reform.  While our title includes "law reform", we cannot actually do law reform as that is, of course, a matter for the committee members as legislators.  However, we undertake research, consult widely and make recommendations that aim to make law modern, accessible and fit for purpose.  We are delighted that the committee has taken an interest in this project in the context of the committee's discussion on a regulatory framework for adult safeguarding and the relevant recommendation of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s project is aimed at making recommendations for a human-rights based, cross-sectoral regulatory framework for adult safeguarding that achieves an appropriate balance between empowerment and protection.  I emphasise that the commission is very much aware of the parallel work concerning the national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector, which is currently being developed by the Department of Health, and to which the Department intends to give legislative underpinning through the health (adult safeguarding) Bill.  The commission and the Department have been in regular contact since the beginning of our project to ensure consistency in approaches to and terminology in proposed policy and legislation, given the importance of an effective cross-cutting, whole-of-government approach to adult safeguarding.</p> <p>  It might be useful if I mention the genesis of this project.  As the committee is aware, the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017 passed Second Stage in the Seanad in April 2017.  It was discussed in further detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health during debates on adult safeguarding in October 2017.  That committee agreed that the issues in the 2017 Bill required further research, and the committee and the Minister for Health suggested that the LRC should consider undertaking that research as part of its fifth programme of law reform.</p><p>The commission was, at the time, engaged in public consultation on the development of its fifth programme.  The commission had also received detailed written submissions from the Department of Health and other bodies, including several State agencies and non-governmental bodies, suggesting the inclusion of this project in the fifth programme of law reform.  Having applied the relevant selection criteria, the commission concluded that the project was suitable for inclusion in the fifth programme.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, to which the draft programme was referred, was satisfied with the content of the programme, and it was approved by the Government in March 2019, in accordance with the Law Reform Commission Act 1975.  The commission has given priority to this important project, and our consultative issues paper on a regulatory framework for adult safeguarding, the book the Chairman has just picked up, was published in January 2020 and we have been consulting on it since.</p><p> I will say a few words on previous work undertaken by the LRC on adults at risk.  The commission previously completed work in this general area, including its 2006 report on vulnerable adults and the law, which recommended the replacement of the adult wardship system with legislation on adult capacity based on a functional test of capacity.  These recommendations are largely reflected in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  It is a matter of some concern that the key elements of the 2015 Act have yet to be fully commenced.  The commission is taking a keen interest in progress on the development of the decision support service and the commencement of the 2015 Act.  The commission was pleased to hear that the decision support service, established under the 2015 Act, received the funding required in budget 2021, and that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, expects the legislation to be fully commenced and services to be operational by mid-2022.</p><p> We have been told members have received the issues papers but it is a fairly big document, with 182 pages in all, so I will give a brief overview of it.  We are conscious that the committee has previously taken a great interest in the area of adult safeguarding and we have benefited from the reports of committee discussions on the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017 and the committee&rsquo;s report on adult safeguarding published in 2017.  Given the time constraints today, I will not go into detail on all of the issues raised in the issues paper.  Instead, I will give a brief overview.  Through a human-rights lens, the commission is seeking to identify who may need additional regulatory arrangements in the form of supports and, where relevant, protections under adult safeguarding legislation, and in what circumstances those regulatory arrangements may be needed.</p><p> The task that the commission has been set is substantial, and involves numerous intersecting aspects and areas of law.  Our work includes identifying regulatory gaps and recommending that additional regulatory powers may need to be conferred on an existing body or bodies, or that a new body may need to be established, as well as possible recommendations regarding regulatory oversight functions, such as whether a body should have the power to deal with individual complaints as opposed to regulating systems.  The commission is also considering possible recommendations on criminal offences where gaps in the law are identified, as well as specific measures relating to financial abuse, safeguarding powers and duties, and reporting models where suspected, and indeed actual, abuse or neglect are encountered.  We are also looking at independent advocacy, inter-agency collaboration and information-sharing, because we want to ensure that our assessment of the law in this area is comprehensive and that the recommendations we make are solutions-focused, practical and workable, and provide adults at risk of abuse and neglect with the best possible legal protections within a comprehensive regulatory framework.</p><p> The commission hopes to publish the report on a regulatory framework for adult safeguarding early next year.  We recognise that it will be up to the Government and the Oireachtas, including the committee, to decide whether the commission&rsquo;s recommendations ought to be implemented.  On behalf of the commission, I welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in this area.  My colleagues and I will be very happy to take any question that members might have.</p></speech>

As members are attending virtually from their offices and, therefore, cannot see the clock to monitor their speaking time I will advise them when they have one minute remaining, if I can.  I ask them to stick to their time allocation to facilitate all members participating in the meeting.  I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting.  While we wait for our first speaker, Senator Conway, I am conscious that there were 10,000 notifications to the HSE about this area in 2017.</p></speech>

I was trying new headphones but clearly they did not work.  I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and her colleagues on the LRC for attending the meeting.  I must commend them on the body of work they have done.  The report, of which I received a copy yesterday, is very comprehensive and certainly is a very good starting point for what is a critical issue.  Looking through the report, it is very worrying to see that 10,000 vulnerable adults are badly treated every year.  It is a striking figure.  I take comfort from the words of Ms Justice Laffoy that the commission is solutions-focused and wants practical and workable measures, which I think is what we all want.</p> <p>  I have several questions for Ms Justice Laffoy or her colleagues, whoever wishes to reply.  Do they think that really and truly it should be an overall collaborative Bill embodying various Departments?  We know there are challenges with financial services, and certainly older people can be blackguarded, often by relatives, when it comes to the use of their money.  Should we have one comprehensive Bill that addresses all areas of adult safeguarding?  Do the witnesses think there should be one agency to deal with all aspects of adult safety, similar to how Tusla provides a comprehensive service in terms of child safety?  Do the witnesses envisage that the end result, and the practical and workable solution, would be an overarching agency to cover all aspects?</p> <p>  Where did they see international best practice?  When they were preparing this body of work they looked at what was happening internationally.  Is there an area or country to which we should look, and to which the committee should look, as best practice?</p></speech>

Mr. Byrne will answer the first question and Ms Caulfield is probably best to answer the second question.  I hope she is with us.</p></speech>

However, as Senator Conway said, are other issues fall outside of that area.  The commission is working through the questions that were raised by ourselves in the issues paper and we have got a lot of help from people who have made written submissions to us.  I cannot say that we have come up yet with a final conclusion as to whether there should be a single regulatory body or a collaborative arrangement between existing bodies but in the final report we will certainly make as far as we can a conclusive and practical recommendation on that.  We are conscious that health and social care are vital component parts of the overall picture but there are other issues, such as financial abuse.  We are also conscious that there are new forms of abuse arising continuously.  Covid-19 has indicated the kind of online scams as opposed to maybe traditional offline analogue scams.  We are conscious that this is an evolving area as well and we need to have practical solutions that reflect that.</p></speech>

Within that 10,000, there is probably significant abuse and very serious abuse, and then abuse at a lower level.  Of course, abuse is abuse.  I would like some additional information on how that figure was arrived at.</p></speech>

That figure of 10,000 comes to us from the HSE national safeguarding office.  Each year, the office publishes the number of reports that were made to it in the previous year.  Those concerns can come from a variety of settings, including community and residential settings, and, indeed, hospital settings as well.  We are reliant on the HSE for those figures.  The HSE acknowledges that there could be under-reporting and under-representation, and, indeed, there are indications that there are instances of under-reporting, particularly in private nursing homes and where people perhaps are in family settings where they are reluctant to report a family member.  There is not a comprehensive data set but that figure is based on the number of reports to the HSE in a given year.  The commission is looking at the issue of data collection in its report in terms of how we can improve data collection and its accuracy.</p></speech>

It would be fair to say they have had legislation in place, in the form of the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act, since 2007.  We are keen to look at them because they have the longest experience of having legislation in place.  Our Scottish colleagues are undertaking a review of that legislation at present in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders to ascertain if there is any way that the implementation or effectiveness of that legislation could be improved.  We are keen to learn from that ongoing review.</p> <p>  The commission is part of a five-nation adult support and protection conference series, which involves colleagues from Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England and is providing the commission with an invaluable opportunity to learn from the experiences of our colleagues in those jurisdictions and to learn from the challenges that they faced and how they have addressed those challenges.</p> <p>  In terms of one country of best practice, it would be fair to say that there are areas of best practice across a number of countries.  The commission is keen to identify those different areas of best practice and how they could apply within the Irish context, and within the Irish health, social care and different sectoral models as well.  Bearing in mind we have a great deal of regulatory history with some of the jurisdictions, we would be keen to look to them because theirs might be more appropriate to apply in this jurisdiction where we have similar health and social care models as well.  We are also looking further afield, to Canada and Australia, in terms of successful provisions that they have there and how they might work in Ireland.  We are conscious of not only looking at our nearest neighbours but also looking further afield and gathering elements of best practice from all of those jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I hope she is well.</p> <p>  I wish them well in their important work.  It is an issue in which we on the joint committee have taken a keen interest.  As I am sure they will be aware, there were a number of examinations into nursing homes and residential care facilities in recent times, obviously, because of Covid, and there were a number of reports.  There was the expert panel report commissioned by the Minister, a HIQA report and a report from the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  Are all of those reports being examined by the commission in the work that it is currently doing?</p></speech>

The commission is keen to learn from the recommendations of those reports.  We are mindful that we have been living with the Covid-19 pandemic for almost a year and the reality is we must learn from the pandemic in how recommendations and learnings could be applied to crisis or emergency situations in the future.  The pandemic has highlighted the regulatory gaps in place that we were already mindful and aware of prior to the pandemic, but I suppose we really see in the midst of a pandemic how great an impact those regulatory gaps can have when we are faced with a crisis situation.  We very much want to learn from this and all of the recommendations in terms of improvement going forward.  Should there be a crisis or an emergency situation the future, the onus is on us to learn from this experience and how we could be best placed to address a further situation in the future.</p></speech>

I would support her statement that their assessment of the law on this area needs to be comprehensive and that the recommendations need to be solutions-focused, practical and workable, and provide adults at risk of abuse and neglect with the best possible legal protections.  Obviously, all of this has to be done in a timely fashion as well.</p> <p>  In her opening statement Ms Justice Laffoy referenced the Adult Safeguarding Bill 2017, but she also went back further and referenced the A Report on Vulnerable Adults and the Law in 2006.  In reality, this has been a long-standing issue.  It is worth noting the journey that many people have travelled.  Many people have looked at this long before I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and long before I was looking at these issues.  In 2007, the HSE established a social work elder abuse service.</p><p>It was set up to manage allegations of abuse and neglect in respect of over-65s.  In 2014, there was an "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme on &Aacute;ras Attracta.  My understanding is that the report into that investigation has still not been published.  We should seek answers about it from the HSE.  It led to the establishing of the HSE's national safeguarding office and the safeguarding and protection social work service.  Despite all of the investigations and commitments dating back to 2006 and 2007, we still do not have adult safeguarding legislation.</p><p> Has the commission engaged with the Irish Association of Social Workers, IASW?  It made a very lengthy, comprehensive and helpful submission to our committee on this matter.  I will read part of a paragraph from the submission that sums up how the IASW views this issue and the snail's pace of progress: "The IASW contends that the lack of progress both locally, in terms of a full, transparent and timely &Aacute;ras Attracta investigation, and nationally in terms of the development of a comprehensive policy and legislative framework is reflective of a consistent lack of organisational and political will to safeguard adults in Ireland."  Does Ms Justice Laffoy agree with this statement?</p></speech>

We also received a number of submissions from individual social workers and social work teams and services within the HSE and voluntary bodies.  Some of them may be members of the IASW.  Currently, the commission is conducting individual meetings with various stakeholders and it is likely that we will have further engagement with the IASW at some point before the conclusion of the project.  We are mindful of the need to learn from practitioners on the ground as well as service users, given that they are likely to be affected by the adult safeguarding legislation.  We are grateful for practitioners' input.  We understand that they represent the views of people on the ground and that they are the ones who will have to apply this legislation.  We are conscious of consulting practitioners and end users.</p></speech>

Currently, there is no legal right of entry for any independent inspector or social work team into a private nursing home.  This is one of the issues that arose in many of the investigations.  The IASW wrote in its submission: &quot;The HSE has further proposed that in future, safeguarding social work teams will have a 'quality assurance' oversight function only, and will no longer work directly with adults who have experienced neglect or abuse.&quot;  What is the commission's view on this statement?  Is it helpful and does it raise a matter that we should be considering?  The IASW does not agree with the HSE's proposal.  Its submission also reads:</p> <blockquote> 	The IASW suggests that Safeguarding and Protection teams have been given an impossible task, carrying responsibility to protect and expose institutional abuse within their own organisation, the HSE, as well as services funded by the HSE.  Yet they have no legal authority to even enter private homes or nursing homes within our current legislative framework. </blockquote> <p>Is this the type of issue that the commission will consider when making recommendations?</p></speech>

In previous work done by the commission in the financial services area, we recognised that effective regulators needed an effective set of regulatory tools.  That is to put it bluntly, but the powers of entry and inspection and the power to impose sanctions are the kinds of core power that any regulatory body must have in order to be effective.  That is something that we highlighted in the consultative issues paper.  We are conscious that the consultees who have responded to us have raised the kinds of issue mentioned by the Deputy.  In the issues paper, we posed a question about what kinds of core regulatory power ought to be in place in a single regulator or if existing bodies that did not currently have effective regulatory powers should be given them.  In addressing the point about practical solutions that Ms Justice Laffoy mentioned, we are conscious that those powers must be effective.  The core powers that are now being given to many regulators, be it the financial regulators or the Government's more recent proposals in respect of an online safety commissioner, are the kinds of important core power that all regulators need.  That will be a key part of the commission's final recommendations.</p></speech>

I wish everyone on the commission well in what it is doing.  These are long-standing issues and, as Mr. Byrne stated, there are social workers and others working on the ground who have direct experience of many of them.  The majority of care settings, include nursing homes and other residential care services, provide wonderful services, but there are instances of abuse and neglect.  We need to get the difficult cases right.  Our committee needs to follow through on the issue of adult safeguarding until we get the statutory systems and framework in place.  This issue has been ongoing for too long.  The commission has its job to do, but so do the Government, the Department of Health and the HSE in terms of legislation, including the adult safeguarding legislation that was promised in the programme for Government and the review of existing policy.  I look forward to the commission's report, which I believe the witnesses said would be published at some stage next year.</p></speech>

The commission adopts an approach that is end user focused.  This means considering the legal issues that arise from all angles - from the perspective of those who will be affected by any proposed legislation and the perspective of those who will be using it daily.  The point of view of social workers is something that we are considering closely.  We are not just thinking about these issues from an abstract and purely legalistic standpoint.  We are trying to identify the regulatory and enforcement gaps in adult safeguarding.  We are doing that in a practical way, which is about looking for workable solutions, as Ms Justice Laffoy stated.  We are not considering the end user through just a narrow focus.  Rather, we are considering the issue across the board - social care professionals, the Garda and regulators such as HIQA - so that the recommendations we will make will be relevant and practical.</p> <p>  We are also considering the regulatory framework in an holistic way because this project is not just about health.  It is also about financial abuse, physical abuse, neglect and deprivation of liberty.  We must think about it from a number of different standpoints.  Committee members will appreciate the complexity of this issue is such that, when it cuts across all of these agencies, it also cuts across various areas of law.  We are looking at the area of regulatory enforcement, data protection, information sharing and gaps in criminal, tort, banking and family law.</p><p>We are looking at those powers in a way that, hopefully, will make workable recommendations.  We very much value the input of people on the ground who can tell us about the barriers to them conducting the work of safeguarding, the barriers to effective inter-agency co-operation and information sharing and so forth.</p></speech>

It is very interesting, but I put my hand up and admit that this is my first time to go into this topic in a serious, meaningful way in terms of the research.  However, I like how accessible the issues paper is.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  I note one of the issues in the paper is the values and principles underpinning adult safeguarding and what the practices in Ireland are currently.  Then it looks at Wales, Scotland and England in the UK for comparison.  I have not had a chance to read through that.  Perhaps the witness could give a small potpourri of the differences there are, positive or negative.</p> <p>  My second point is about what has happened in the past year.  Obviously, with the Covid-19 pandemic the State and citizens would have seen themselves as making an enormous effort to protect the most vulnerable in society, probably from the point of view of being medically challenged and medically vulnerable.  How do the witnesses think those adults, who would have had other vulnerabilities which would have been awfully exposed in the last year and continue to be exposed, would have coped or dealt with that, or what lessons, given such a unique context, have been witnessed or learned from that?</p> <p>  They are my two questions.</p></speech>

In the issues paper the members might have seen that we set out some of the key principles that should guide the area.  These are for discussion, but they are well-established principles arising from the human rights norms in the field.  I will flag some of those, and the members will find that these are quite common across jurisdictions.  Within that, it is very important to have a focus on empowerment.  Indeed, a great deal of safeguarding comes down to trying to protect the individuals while empowering them at the same time.  There are sometimes tensions between those, but regulatory systems need to try to achieve both ends and to draw a balance between them.  Empowerment is a principle, as are protection and prevention.</p> <p>  An important way to achieve a balance between those is to have the principle of proportionality, whereby if one is going to make an intervention to protect a person, it must be one that is necessary, proportionate to the risk to that person and that person must have the right to be involved in any decisions relating to him or her.  The person must be participating in those decisions.  This area involves the use of State power to protect somebody, and that can be an intrusive measure.  It is therefore very important that the legislation is protecting the person's individual liberties and also makes provision for those involved in their care at the same time.  Those are the types of principles we see as being central to this field.  They are the ones we have built on in our colleague jurisdictions.  Ms Caulfield mentioned the Scottish jurisdiction, which is one of the leaders in this area.  It was very strong on the balancing of those principles, and we would have taken the lead from it.</p> <p>  In terms of differences, and Ms Caulfield can speak on this in more detail, I am aware there are differences in terms of the extent to which the State can intervene and the types of powers the State has, for example, powers for entry, inspection and investigation.  There are decisions to be made as to how robust the State can be in intervening to protect a person.</p></speech>

I note what Dr. Mulligan said about Scotland and I look forward to reading that.  I notice that Scotland leads in a number of these areas, such as with regard to women and legislation relating to the empowerment of women and the economic role of women in society.  I am not so interested in what Scotland does, but I am very interested in what prompted Scotland to be leaders in this area.</p></speech>

I will try to contain my frustration when I am speaking.  It beggars belief that almost 20 years later we are still talking about how we are going to safeguard older people.  There are very basic things that need to be done.  It is not reinventing the wheel.  There are clear principles that are accepted by the western world and by most other countries in Europe regarding what needs to be observed in terms of putting in place proper safeguarding arrangements in legislation.  There are models and the witnesses have referenced some of them.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why this is taking so long.  I wonder why, from the commission's point of view, this is going on for so long.  Perhaps it has a lot of other work on hand or it cannot afford to devote the necessary time to do it in an expeditious way.  Is it the case that it suits the powers-that-be that this is a long, drawn-out process, that we do not have product and it is taking an inordinately long time to come up with product on this?  The only conclusion I can come to is that it suits successive Governments and, indeed, it suits the system and the establishment.</p> <p>  I was struck by comments made by the Irish Association of Social Workers.  It talked about that type of culture and mindset in the HSE, for example, and in other agencies, which is more concerned with self-protection or the organisation than with protecting the clients they serve.</p><p>I am just posing the question of why it is taking so long and why, at a political level, successive Governments do not seem to have any appetite to legislate in the area.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses on this.</p></speech>

We are an independent statutory body with a particular job and we do that.  Frequently recommendations we make do not get implemented but that is the way it is.  It is not our fault and we do not know why it happens.  Mr. Byrne has been with us the longest and he has most understanding of the work done by the commission and what has happened to it.  Perhaps he might comment on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.907" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Raymond Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021021600002#F00300"><p>I will certainly try.  Again, from our perspective there has been a long-standing commitment to engage in the area going back, as Deputy Cullinane mentioned, to work we did on law and the elderly in 2003.  The commission has certainly made a number of recommendations and in this area there has been a high success rate if one waits around long enough I suppose.  The report on vulnerable adults and capacity eventually made it on to the Statute Book in 2015, again after much examination by various Oireachtas committees.</p></speech>

We know this has not been enacted.  That is a further indication that there is no real appetite to address the matter.  That is the problem.  I also propose that a different way of working be adopted so that the commission would not have to look at every aspect of safeguarding an older person but, rather, it could deal with this in sections.  Those of us on this committee, and people throughout the country, are acutely aware that older people continue to be seriously exposed in different care settings because of the absence of any proper regulation.  We just saw the tragic impact of that over the past year with the unregulated market-based approach to nursing home care, with 80% of nursing home care put out to the market with virtually no regulation whatever.  The other side of that is that home care remains completely unregulated.</p> <p>  I put it to the witnesses that there is a severe urgency in the need to regulate those particular areas because we know the price older people and families throughout the country have paid for the lack of regulation in nursing home care.  There is no statutory regulation for it at all and there are no ratios for staffing, for example.  We saw the tragic consequences of that over the past year.  Has the commission considered dealing with the two pressing health areas relating to nursing home care and home care?  Could it deal with those two areas separately instead of attempting to take on very wide-ranging work taking in every aspect of an older person's life, which further delays action in the area?</p></speech>

Has the commission considered a more effective approach that would break this into sections, starting with the assumption that there is a real urgency about the health and social care element and that it could recommend to the Government that it legislate in that area first?  It could deal with financial, family and other matters after that but the urgency is now in the health and social care area.</p> <p>  The witnesses are talking about producing a report but when will legislation be published or passed by the Oireachtas?  When would its provisions take effect?  Going by the history of this process over the past 20 years, we are realistically saying that the best we can hope for is a case of it taking years for the legislation.  As a legislator, I am simply not prepared to stand by that kind of approach.</p></speech>

That work has been done by the commission and we set out our recommendations for regulating professional home care.  I absolutely appreciate that this was incorporated into the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the commission is very grateful that this was taken up by the Sl&aacute;intecare committee as well.  We have completed work in that area and it would be a bit pointless for us to go back on that.</p> <p>  We were asked to examine the matter of the regulatory framework, and as Ms Justice Laffoy has stated, it is a priority project for this commission.  This is one of the projects on which we have spent considerable time, right from the beginning of this fifth programme once it was approved by the Government.  We pushed very hard to ensure we got out a good paper and we are again pushing very hard to ensure this project is completed in the shortest possible time, bearing in mind the very wide breadth of matters covered.  We regard today as an incredibly important part of that process of ensuring we get the right answers for that regulatory framework.</p></speech>

I am just restating the point that given the breadth of the process, in the meantime and in real time people are being failed by the lack of regulation.  Older people are dying and have died in substantial numbers over the past year because of the lack of regulation.  I am asking the commission to consider making a recommendation to the Government for health settings.  It should recommend to the Government that it deal with the area as a matter of urgency and the commission can deal with wider matters at a later stage.</p></speech>

The briefing documents were very helpful and I thank the witnesses for them.  The Chairman might give me some latitude in speaking about a particular cohort as it might follow some of Deputy Shortall's questions.  As I try to get to grips with what we are proposing, it is useful for me to think of this in terms of particular cohorts.</p> <p>  One cohort comprises people in accommodation for the homeless.  I am trying to get my bearings on how private providers interact in this process.  We have spoken a little about private nursing homes and the difficulty with this kind of legislation in getting into people's homes.  What is the understanding of access for safeguarding and protection that social work teams would have where there are privatised services?  Never mind staff trained for social work, as some of these staff may not even have Garda vetting.</p></speech>

Technically, I believe they come under the aegis of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive.  How does that work in other jurisdictions?  Dr. Mulligan has done work in this area.  Where there is increasing privatisation in the delivery of services, how does she think that safeguarding mechanism is triggered?  The teams do not necessarily have access to those spaces and the relevant staff do not exist in those spaces and are not correctly trained or vetted.</p></speech>

Looking at private providers is very much within the scope of the project.  Safeguarding necessarily takes in private entities but that may also include private homes.  The powers one needs will necessarily include powers of entry and account has to be taken of people who are living in private homes with their relatives and private providers.  That is very much on our radar.  The model we are looking at is one that can effectively protect people regardless of what setting they are in.  The whole idea is that those protective powers could be triggered regardless of whether someone is residing in a private or public context.</p></speech>

That is slightly different from the question of protective powers and adult safeguarding, which is what we are looking at.  Ms Caulfield or Ms Coen might speak more to this.  There may be a separate regulatory system that needs to regulate those entities.  It is not necessarily what we are looking at.  We are looking at the protective powers that would be able to protect people in those institutions.  That would regulate alongside a regulatory system.</p></speech>

I think we all agree that anything which is providing care in the State needs to be subject to appropriate regulatory oversight.  However, in some of the briefing material, the commission outlines that a vulnerable person should have access to independent advocacy for themselves, for example.  How would this legislation envisage that this be triggered in a private setting?  Could Dr. Mulligan outline the position in that regard?</p></speech>

I understand the vision is that independent advocacy would be important in supporting everyone who is potentially subject to protective measures.  That is a very important part of the empowerment prong.  The way to ensure that people are involved in decisions about their own care and the State measures are not too intrusive is that they have independent advocacy.  I understand that part of the vision is looking at whether that might be regulated as part of adult safeguarding and would be offered to people in a private setting as well as in a public setting.</p></speech>

This means that the safeguarding and protection teams and their social workers only have powers as regards HSE-run facilities.  As a result, they cannot access people within private nursing homes or other private facilities.  That is one of the core issues that this project is examining.  It is a regulatory framework that will apply cross-sectorally and also across all settings.  We are really conscious that we cannot only have protective powers for publicly funded or publicly run facilities, they must apply to all facilities in which there are people who are potentially at risk of harm.  That is a very important focus of this project.</p></speech>

Before I run out of time, has the commission considered a differentiation between a nursing home setting where people are in some sense in a congregated setting that is permanent and the more transient experience of homeless emergency accommodation where there might be people moving in and out of a system which in some cases is privatised and in others is publicly funded?  Has it considered how a safeguarding system would track vulnerable people in this context?  The word "track" is probably the wrong word to use.  Perhaps I should say to support such people.</p></speech>

The commission is very conscious of looking at the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and insuring that all recommendations are in line with that.  Where there is accommodation that is quite transient in nature, with people moving in and out, those service providers have a duty of care to people while they are in those services.  When they leave those services, however, the extent to which those providers can engage with those people might be limited.  If those individuals have capacity, they are entitled to make a decision regarding their lives; they are entitled to make unwise decisions, as we all are.  If there were potential capacity issues or concerns around mental health, that could come under other legislation such as the Mental Health Act.  While those people are living within those services, there is a duty of care there and the regulated service would have a duty of care in terms of the regulatory powers that are available to it.  Once the person would leave those services, it would depend on that person's needs in terms of how much the service could engage.</p></speech>

We are looking at it from a holistic standpoint.  There is value in that, because we are listening to the issues that are identified by professionals working across the board and people who themselves have experience.</p> <p>  On Deputy Hourigan's question about people moving between different bodies, information-sharing is a big issue that we are seeking to address.  We are keen to look at inter-agency co-operation and how that is working.  Sometimes there might be an agency which, at a local level, has excellent working relationships but they might not be replicated at a national level and maybe they would benefit from a more formalised and structured approach to inter-agency collaboration.  Information sharing is key there.  We are planning to meet with the Date Protection Commissioner to tease out issues relating to compliance with the general data protection regulation which arise in the area.</p></speech>

This is a subject that I am trying to understand and come to terms with.  My first question if for Ms Justice Laffoy and it relates to the two items of legislation we are discussing, one of which has not been implemented and the other of which has not been enacted.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was passed in 2015, six years ago, and the vast majority of it has not been implemented.  The position with Adult Safeguarding Bill is similar.  Were the Act to be implemented and the Bill enacted, what would be the position for people in residential care settings?</p></speech>

It was signed by the President at that point.  The issue is that it has not been commenced.</p><p>Various agencies are working on developing a system for ensuring that it is properly commenced.  For instance, the decision support service has already been set up, but it is not yet operational.  It looks as though it will not be operational until perhaps the middle of next year.  However, I am strongly of the view that it would definitely be most important and helpful if the 2015 Act were commenced as far as possible.  Perhaps some of my colleagues want to express a view on that issue.</p></speech>

Work in here can be slow but that is extremely slow.  It has been six years.  I am not asking for the witness's political opinion.  Why, in her legal opinion, does she think the Act has not been implemented?</p></speech>

There is a practical answer, which is that many structures must be put in place and systems set up, such as the decision support service, which is currently being led by Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn.  As I said in my opening statement, we derive a good bit of comfort from the fact that 2021 budget is helping the decision support service in particular.  However, it is a practical rather than a legal issue.</p></speech>

I missed an earlier part of the discussion due to technical issues.  It was mentioned that there were 10,000 correspondents in relation to possible cases of neglect, or situations where care was unsatisfactory.  Could one of the witnesses provide more detail on the scale of this correspondence?  Were the correspondents victims of physical or mental abuse?  In what setting did the abuse occur?  I am particularly concerned about adults and children in special needs provision.  That is a different situation.  For example, if an adult has learning difficulties, where does the division lie in that situation, when somebody wants to complain?</p></speech>

That includes concerns that were reported to the safeguarding and protection teams within the various community and healthcare organisations.<br/><br/>We are restricted to the breakdown of the data provided by the HSE.  It generally breaks down the data by age group and abuse type, and by the type of care from which the report was made, rather than the setting.  For example, it might specify that it is from healthcare or social care but it generally will not disclose the type of residential setting from which the report came.  Therefore, we are restricted in the number of complaints coming from disability settings, in which the Deputy is particularly interested.  The lack of a comprehensive data set is an issue.  It comes down to the referral pathways, and a lack of knowledge about who people should report to when they have a concern.  That is something about which the commission is most concerned and is why the commission is looking at the issue of data collection and referral pathways within the scope of the report.  It is most important to have clear reporting pathways and referral pathways, and clearer data collection measures that are limited not just to one body.  Interagency collaboration, whereby one body refers on to another, knows which body it should refer to and can identify the central data collector, is important.  That would ensure that we have a comprehensive data set.  In its absence, we are reliant on the annual data from the HSE national safeguarding office, which is helpful but is not comprehensive.  We are also reliant on <i>ad hoc </i>pieces of research that are commissioned and funded by various bodies, including Safeguarding Ireland or the Banking and Payments Federation, all of which are useful but which do not provide us with a comprehensive picture, which could be the case if we had a clear system for data collection in place and clear referral pathways.</p></speech>

Could the complaints of the correspondents be criminally investigated by other authorities like the Garda?  Is there a breakdown of something that could be of a criminal nature?</p></speech>

There is a statutory obligation to report a concern in the case of a vulnerable person or a person in an at-risk group.  In its 2019 report, the HSE outlined that it is improving its interagency collaboration in respect of reporting on to agencies like An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where there is a concern of a criminal nature.  Often, concerns are reported both to the HSE and to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where there are concerns that a matter may be criminal in nature.  There is a statutory obligation there in respect of groups that fall under the definition of "vulnerable person" within the relevant Act.</p></speech>

However, a number of issues come to mind.  First is the abuse of vulnerable people in public and private institutions.  Are we satisfied with the system in each?  What are the weaknesses in the reporting system and the follow-up?</p> <p>  On the issue of bullying, we have seen countless tragic cases of bullying over the past number of years.  Sometimes they have been reported effectively, and sometimes not but have ended tragically.  How do the witnesses see improvements being made there in order that immediate action and corrective measures are taken and provisions are put in place to protect the victims? </p> <p>  My third question concerns abuse outside of the family.  For example, not so long ago, I dealt with a case of a teenage girl being enticed away from her home by a middle-aged man.  I followed it up in all manner of ways - through the education system, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, everywhere.  I attended meetings with various stakeholders and so on.  It was impossible to intervene because although the girl was a minor, she had not made a complaint.  The complaint had been made by her parents.  The parents had to go to court to win their case, which they did.  Why should that be?  What do the witnesses think we should do, as legislators, to address that issue?</p> <p>  Finally, I believe that over the years, we have addressed a number of issues that needed addressing.  For example,  we decongregated mental institutions and rightly so; they were terrible places.  However, we put nothing place to replace them and to protect the people who were there.  Maybe they were wrongly institutionalised but they were there and we did not provide alternative support for them.  We addressed one issue but did not provide subsequent support for those who needed it.  What should we be doing there?  I have my own views on the subject but I will leave it to the witnesses.  </p> <p>  I would also like to congratulate the witnesses on the good work they have done.  I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and her team for engaging on this particular issue and on many other issues as well.  </p></speech>

One is a mandatory reporting model, whereby people would be compelled in certain instances to report concerns of actual or suspected abuse.  That could relate to specific harm or serious harm and could apply to certain professionals, for example, medical professionals, social work professionals, etc.  It would be similar to the system of mandatory reporting in place for children under the Children First Act 2015, which was commenced in December 2017.</p> <p>  We are also examining retaining the current system of permissive reporting, which relies on professional judgment.  That allows a professional to decide whether, in his or her professional opinion, it is necessary to make a report.  One option could be to put that system of permissive reporting on a statutory footing.  That would mean it would be provided for in legislation.  As we know, we could also introduce a form of protected disclosure, which would mean that if we retained a permissive system of reporting there would be protections for those who make reports in good faith.  The rationale for that would be that it may encourage greater levels of reporting because there may not be a fear of repercussions if a person made a report.</p> <p>  We are also considering a hybrid system, in which we would largely retain a permissive system of reporting, but for abuse that may happen in certain settings such as, for example, residential settings, or very serious types of abuse, it would be mandatory to report in those circumstances.  We are looking very carefully at all of the various models and evidence from other jurisdictions.  We also wish to speak with our colleagues in the Department of Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth regarding the effectiveness of the system of mandatory reporting as it has applied to children since it was implemented in December 2017 to hear what was learned, as well as hearing the opinion of the Department and Child and Family Agency on how the system has worked in the three-year period in which it has been in place.  It is important to take what was learned from the system of mandatory reporting as it applies to children and determine if there is anything in it which we could use if we were to implement a system of mandatory reporting for adults.  </p> <p>  The commission has given detailed consideration to all of the various models.</p></speech>

Recent additions to the Statute Book include the criminalisation of coercive control and so on.  The concept of legislating for emotional abuse is not new.  As I said, we are examining this in a holistic way and that includes consideration of where there may be gaps in criminal law.  The Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 was influenced in large part by the work of the Law Reform Commission.  It deals with a form of modern bullying and is reflective of the kind of appropriate criminalisation of abuse that is intangible.

This is a form of checks and balances that was incorporated in the Planning and Development Act 2000 to ensure that any exempted development proposals would be subject to scrutiny and approval by both Houses before they could be signed into law.</p> <p>  The consideration of the draft regulations will facilitate the delivery of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and they will assist schools in facilitating the continued delivery of education in the context of ongoing Covid-19 measures and pupil number demographic changes.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present both of the regulations to the committee.  If both these draft regulations are subsequently approved by positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, they will come into force as soon as they are signed by me, as Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  In this regard, it is my intention to sign these regulations into law at the earliest possible date.  I thank members for their time and attention.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty whatsoever with the EV regulations.  I have one question with regard to the temporary school buildings, however.  If I am right, the regulations talk about a period of five years.  I am keen to understand why that period of five years is locked into the regulations.  Obviously, none of us wants to stand in the way of the provision of much-needed educational facilities.  However, we also know that there are long-standing problems with temporary buildings lasting much longer than the temporary emergency they were originally put there for.  Perhaps the Minister of State could give us some reassurance that these are indeed temporary structures and explain why the five-year limit is there.</p></speech>

We felt the period of time was reasonable in the circumstances, having regard to the fact that when school buildings are being constructed, there can be considerable delays in terms of planning, design, etc.  It is a time-limited measure that is specifically limited to five years.  There is no intention that these structures would ever become permanent.  Basically, we felt five years was reasonable, proportionate and balanced in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Specifically relevant to the Bill, the Housing Agency has established an affordable housing unit to assist and support the Department with the implementation of the affordable purchase and cost rental measures outlined.</p> <p>  In the Bill there are two major measures.  One is the range of affordable home purchase measures and, second, there are the measures for cost rental homes.  I will take the affordable home purchase measures first.  It is very important for us all to understand that the key elements of supporting home ownership, as set out, are the shared equity arrangements.  That is fundamental.  This supports households to purchase a home in a fair and equitable way.  It is an effective way of the State investing in affordable home purchase and that equity investment, when it is repaid, can be used to provide support to future households purchasing an affordable home.  It is, essentially, a sustainable measure that will support both current and future generations, which is a very important principle.  The measures, as we have seen in the Affordable Housing Bill, that amends the 2009 Act, is the local authority shared equity scheme, and delivery under this scheme can be by local authorities, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency and others.  There is also provision for a national affordable purchase shared equity scheme using the open market.</p> <p>  In terms of cost rental homes, a key element of achieving affordable housing in many countries is the delivery of a cost rental sector.  Over time that sector builds up so it can provide housing that is affordable for a wide range of households.  Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands are some of the countries that have built up very effective cost rental sectors.</p> <p>  Cost rental aims to help households with moderate incomes access affordable and secure rental homes.  It is a model of delivery where the provider supplies accommodation and charges rent that is sufficient to cover construction and financing costs of the housing, and the ongoing management and maintenance costs.  So the costs are based on the cost of provision.  That aspect is very important and over time it becomes even more affordable.</p> <p>  Currently, the Housing Agency is assisting the Department with the introduction of a new cost rental equity loan scheme delivered by approved housing bodies.  Initially, there are 390 homes to be delivered.  This is in addition to 50 cost rental homes that are to be delivered in the next number of months in Stepaside on the Enniskerry Road in Dublin.  This is along with 105 social rental homes.  It is a collaboration between D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, the Respond and Tuath Housing Associations, and the Housing Finance Agency.</p> <p>  To conclude, the overall aim has to be to make housing affordable for everyone of all incomes.  We are pleased to support the committee and elaborate on any points raised.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Rachel Slaymaker.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to have an input into considerations around the Bill.  To do so, we will report our recent research studies that may help the committee's discussions in terms of an evidence base for interventions to address housing affordability.</p> <p>  All of this information must be contextualised by the fast moving economic developments relating to the Covid-19 pandemic and its ability to impact both the demand and supply sides of the affordability equation.  Two years ago we presented research to the joint committee on which households faced housing affordability challenges in Ireland.  We found that affordability pressures were primary among low to middle income private renters, especially those in urban areas.  In an updated study, that was published in 2020, we separated the rental market into two groups, those in receipt of State housing supports such as housing assistance payment, HAP, or local authority tenants, and those private renters without supports.  The latter group accounted for approximately 47% of the rental market and was the main focus of our research.  We found that even though this group's gross income was higher than the rental sector overall they face significant affordability pressures.  Indeed, one in four of these households was paying more than 30% of their net income on rent while almost one in three, or nearly 70,000 households, did not have sufficient income remaining after housing costs to cover a minimum standard of living expenditure before the pandemic.  Given that these renters were more likely to be employed in those sectors most impacted by Covid-19, it is likely that the economic fallout from the pandemic will exacerbate existing affordability challenges.</p> <p>  So if renting is so expensive then why have not more renters become homeowners in recent years?  Since 2011, the share of homeowners in Ireland has dropped due to many co-determining factors such as tighter credit conditions on the part of banks and the new macro prudential rules, labour market developments, high house prices and a limited housing supply.  Of these, the supply channel is likely the most important.  The number of housing completions in recent years is well below he estimates of structural demand.  Estimates by the ESRI and other commentators put the structural housing demand levels at between 30,000 and 35,000 units per annum, which is well above the current level of housing supply.  The disruption of the pandemic will only widen this gap between supply and structural demand.</p> <p>  In evaluating the efficacy of policies that target the demand side, so the borrower purchasing power such as shared equity loans or other instruments, it is critical to understand the extent to which households face credit constraints.  In a recent research paper we find the existence of both equity constraints, which is an insufficient deposit, and income constraint, which is insufficient loan size to income, in the Irish market among those renting households who wish to purchase a property.  The bulk income and equity constraints are evident and suggest that separate policies covering loan availability and deposit supports can be of merit.</p> <p>  At present, there are already interventions in the market that aim to address equity constraints with the help-to-buy scheme and income constraints through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  A shared equity loan instrument for lowering the required loan amount would also act to alleviate both income and deposit constraints.</p><p>Its benefit in theory would be to facilitate credit access for some constrained households.  However, the targeting of any credit market intervention is critical.  If the credit access supports are provided to those households which would have otherwise been able to finance the transaction, then the economic benefit is lessened.  For example, a review of the help-to-buy scheme data suggests that many households with large deposits have received support under the scheme.  It is likely these households were not constrained and would have been able to complete the transaction anyway.</p><p> Furthermore, and most important, this static approach does not take into consideration the fact that housing supply is so constrained in Ireland and that increasing purchasing power for households through a loosening of credit constraints will likely lead to higher house prices.  Such rises in house prices are likely to exacerbate affordability problems down the line.  These dynamics may or may not be observable in actual price data which will be affected by a multitude of other factors, coupled with scale of the intervention, but they are likely to occur.</p><p> Our research suggests there will be a considerable number of households in Ireland which will not be able to become homeowners and who will face high rental costs.  For these households, as well as those who do not wish to become homeowners, the introduction of non-market priced rental tenure in cost rental is very welcome.  Many countries have successfully incorporated longer term rental options into their markets which provide long-term, stable rents for tenants and this has been absent in Ireland on a broad scale.  In the context of the current Bill, the definition of cost rental would appear to be set to cover middle income households, a group our research certainly shows face considerable affordability pressures.  Indeed, as a supply-side intervention which will lead to the introduction of new units to rent, it cannot come quickly enough.  The success of this intervention over the medium term should be gauged by three metrics, namely, the number of units, the pricing and the eligibility criteria.  To have a meaningful impact on overall housing supply, the number of units provided would need to expand rapidly over the coming years.  On the price side, the initial level may reflect construction costs and ensuring that developments can be provided as efficiently as possible to minimise the subsequent rent levels is important.  Regarding ongoing price inflation, maintenance costs for property upkeep can often exceed the broad consumer price inflation.  How these costs are passed through to tenants is important to ensure continued investment in upkeep, maintenance and quality, but also to ensure affordability.</p><p> Affordability challenges in the housing market are a critical and long-standing issue for Ireland.  Addressing these challenges is difficult as increasing housing supply is problematic in the short run.  Considerable care must be given to interventions on the demand side given the supply concerns.  Credit market supports such as the shared equity scheme and other interventions may lower credit constraints by facilitating home purchase for buyers who otherwise would have been unable to enter the market.  However, on balance, with the current supply shortages it is likely these benefits will be outweighed by inflationary pressures.  The most successful interventions over the medium to longer term will be those that operate through the supply side not the demand side of the market.  Cost rental schemes are a very welcome addition to the market and their expansion over time will help to build a broader rental sector.  We thank the committee for its time and look forward to answering any questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Noel Cahill and I are members of the secretariat of NESC and are attending in that capacity.  If it is okay I will take the role of NESC as read as it is in our opening statement.  The first part of my statement will focus on NESC's role in housing.</p> <p>  NESC has produced eight reports on housing since 2004.  Aspects of housing affordability have featured in every one of those reports.  In our most recent report, Housing Policy: Actions to Deliver Change, NESC restated its consistent and long-standing position on housing and land-use policy, namely, that Ireland must bring about a fundamental change in its system of urban development, land management and housing provision.  It must evolve from a speculative and highly cyclical system to a permanently affordable, stable and more sustainable system of housing.  Pursuing that objective, our most recent report focused on two related issues, the supply gap and the affordability gap.  The report detailed the steps NESC considered necessary to bridge the two gaps by way of institutional adjustments, more effective use of existing policy and innovation to enhance the policy options available to the State.</p> <p>  With the Chairman's permission, I will ask Mr. Noel Cahill, who has worked on this area, to walk the committee through the three different aspects of that report and attempt to focus on the emphasis on cost rental in NESC's work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.977" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#C00400"><p>That recent NESC report on housing outlined the institutional changes which would ensure that key public actors have a strong developmental mandate and the capacity to drive sustainable urban development, including the provision of affordable housing.  These actions include establishing the Land Development Agency, LDA, on a statutory footing as a matter of urgency.  The second part of the report called for more effective application of existing measures to ensure more affordable housing happens in the near term.  These actions include, first, the establishment of a national cost rental programme at scale, with access to land on favourable terms, low cost finance, and conditions to ensure that homes remain subject to public ownership and that the rents are affordable; second, the tailoring of the application of Part V to make it more effective by increasing the proportion which must be affordable, but tailored on a county-by-county basis; third, the introduction, across the various funding streams, such as the serviced sites fund, of separate funding streams focused on developments which are high impact in terms of the number of affordable houses provided and the achievement of compact development; fourth, the examination of differences between the compulsory purchase regimes under different legislation and their respective usage, with a view to identifying the most effective and efficient regime; and, finally, the outlining of a programme of flagship projects to demonstrate how a system-wide approach can deliver tangible results.</p> <p>  In the third part of the report, the council recommended that time be devoted to finding new solutions or ways of working around long-standing challenges.  These areas include tackling the off-balance sheet issue for cost rental, examining how the State could acquire land in designated development areas at existing use value plus some premium, review and reform of the vacant site levy if it persists in being ineffective and considering further actions to reduce vacancy and the under use of existing property.  On affordability, the council has argued the goal should be permanent affordability.  The leasing of public land is a mechanism that can be used to reduce costs and improve affordability in the short term while preserving the value of the subsidy for future buyers and improving long-run stability in the housing market.  With this approach, the land could be provided without an upfront charge while the public landowner would retain long-term ownership of the land.  Others, including owner occupiers, could then own dwellings on the land.</p> <p>  Of particular relevance to our discussion today is the recommendation by the council to develop a national cost rental programme at scale.  The council first highlighted the need for Irish policy to consider cost rental in a 2004 report.  The different elements needed include land, low cost finance, a regulatory structure and organisations.  The new cost rental equity loan, in conjunction with long-term low interest loans from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, is a way of achieving reasonably low cost finance for cost rental.  The proposed legislation will be a basis for regulating a cost rental sector.  It is our understanding that the loan is initially being used for acquisitions of properties.  Over time, if we are to substantially add to the housing stock in a way that is not dependent on the development cycle, it would be desirable to create new cost rental developments on public land.  If cost rental, affordable purchase and social housing developments can be combined on large sites, this would facilitate having larger developments than would otherwise be possible.</p> <p>  The focus of the actions proposed by NESC on housing is on bridging the supply gap by actively managing land for the public good and bridging the affordability gap by engineering in permanent affordability.</p> <p>  We are happy to assist the committee in its discussions.</p></speech>

I confirm that I am speaking from the confines of Leinster House.  As the Vice Chairman of the committee I welcome all guests today.  I especially welcome Mr. O'Connor.  Some 18 months ago both of us launched a discussion document on the cost rental model in Dublin City Council.  It is particularly fitting that we are here now putting a legislative base on a cost rental model.</p> <p>  I believe there is broad agreement among the three submissions and among the committee that the cost rental model is really important.  I believe, however, that when we all agree, that is often when we need to be more critical.  We still have a long way to go in cost rental units to make sure they do not become middle-class enclaves, there is a social mix, and there is transparency around maintenance, governance and estate management.  I will let others raise those concerns later.</p> <p>  I want to focus on the affordability measures and affordable purchase.  My first question is to Dr. O'Toole from the ESRI.  While I read the institute's submission, I was not here when Dr. O'Toole spoke about the home ownership and shared equity.  Which of the two schemes was Dr. O'Toole referring to with regard to shared equity?</p></speech>

We were relating to the scheme that is to provide a shared purchase option loan for households to be able to purchase properties, and the State would provide an equity-based loan for households.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.982" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#D00400"><p>In reading the Bill there are a number of measures I am very pleased with, principally the resurrection of the 2011 affordable housing measures that were retired by the Government in 2011.  I would see one of the key measures of the Bill being a supply side instrument, which is the shared equity, local authority-led affordable housing scheme.  I imagine that this is one of the principal areas where supply will be increased.  It is also one of the principal focuses of the Bill.  It does not, however, seem to feature in the ESRI submission that was provided to the committee.  Does Dr. O'Toole have any comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.983" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#D00500"><p>In general, and to provide a context for our submission, the ESRI is hoping to be able to provide an overview of our recent research and to try to draw on that research to be able to give some evidence to the committee on the overall targeting and analysis of the various schemes.  On the type of work we have done historically, a number of our papers have looked at credit access for households and at the degree to which households are credit constrained.  These would be households that are or are not able to make transactions based on the level of leverage.  If a household is credit constrained, it is not able to make that transaction without having more leverage.  The balance of our submission was to attempt to provide some understanding from our existing research on the various economic channels that may occur with the development of a scheme, in the context of the broader range of schemes available in the market.  Where schemes are supply side in nature, they would not necessarily provide additional borrower purchasing power, which I believe is a key issue from our research.  We are very clear that the supply-side constraints in Ireland are the most binding constraints and the most difficult to deal with because it takes a long time for any supply measures to come on line.  Certainly, the development of any schemes that would facilitate additional supply would be very welcome from our side.  This is just to give a little insight into that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.984" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#D00600"><p>I welcome that.  I believe that the local authority-led shared equity scheme is a huge positive.  It sometimes gets lost because of the shared equity loan.  It would also be the cornerstone to building public housing on public land, which is a significant departure for the new Government.  It is a really important measure.  There has been some focus on the shared equity scheme, but would Dr. O'Toole accept the Department's argument that regional caps, to limit it to new builds, and it being a short-term measure for one year or two to stimulate the reluctance of the current market could actually act to stimulate it?  If it was kept with all of those limits of regional caps, new builds and short-term, could it have a positive impact on the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.985" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#D00700"><p>When one is trying to consider any credit market interventions, a number of aspects are especially important.  It is even more complicated when doing credit market interventions in the housing market because a multitude of factors affect house prices, including the labour market channels, credit access, and supply constraints.  There are a range of factors that impact the degree to which any particular credit-based measure would pass through to price pressures or to borrower purchasing power.  In a sense, the tailoring and calibration of these schemes is very important.  Naturally, any inflationary pressures can be reduced if the schemes are tailored to have the minimum need.  For example, this would be ensuring that the calibration of the scheme goes to those borrowers who are most in need, such as to the household that is credit constrained and needs that extra credit to be able to make that transaction happen.  In the alternative counterfactual scenario that transaction would not happen.  The effective use of calibration parameters can be used to mitigate those channels.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the scale of the intervention is critically important, as we said in the opening statement.  For example, how much of the intervention happens in what timeframe is very important.  The shorter the timeframe and the larger the intervention that is necessary, and when one considers the economic channels behind that, it would add more demand side pressure in a shorter space of time.  The longer the timeframe and the degree to which the intervention is spread out over time would limit the inflationary pressures.  When we consider these types of instruments we do so in a manner that takes all of the factors that would affect the housing market, which are multitude and co-determining.  If we hold all of these other factors constant on an all-new change to credit market access, that is naturally where we talk about the channels that would be happening in the market with regard to demand and supply side.</p></speech>

Due to the limited time I will go straight into questions.  I have three questions, one for each of our guests.</p> <p>  With respect to Dr. O'Toole's concerns that the shared equity loan for private purchases would push up house prices, I presume it is his view that the bigger that fund the greater the risk of inflation.  We know, for example, that the Government is currently in negotiations with the banks to increase the fund from &euro;75 million to &euro;150 million, with &euro;75 million of banking funding.  Is there a concern that the more funds that are available the greater the risk of house price inflation?  On Dr. O'Toole's concerns around targeting, I presume that, given the Government is talking about combining the shared equity loan with help-to-buy, there are no income limits on access and the upper limit for house price purchases in Dublin is about &euro;400,000, this would further exacerbate his concerns that there is an inadequate level of targeting.</p> <p>  I have a specific question for Mr. O'Connor on the shared equity loan and the interest that will be charged.  The Government has said, obviously, that it wants an entry-level interest rate from year six at 1.5% and then increasing.  We hear from some media reports that the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland would like a higher entry-level interest rate.  Is there a level of risk to the buyer that if the interest rate calculation is too onerous, the buyer could end up with a far greater level of debt, as was the case with the last shared ownership scheme?  The Housing Agency did for a report on this for then Minister of State, Jan O'Sullivan.  Will Mr. O'Connor elaborate on that potential risk to the buyer from the interest rate?</p> <p>  My last question is for Dr. Larry O&rsquo;Connell.  Deputy McAuliffe is absolutely right that there are three parts to this Bill and many of us, like the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, have long advocated for cost rental and for affordable, local authority-led delivery.  Given that we are only going to get 530 such units this year, confirmed to us by the Department officials last week, 700 such units are only guaranteed for the pipeline next year, and then 1,500, is that at the scale the NESC has consistently recommended and, if not, what is the level of scale?</p><p>Are we talking about thousands or tens of thousands of such directly delivered units rather than the hundreds the Government has made provision for over the next three years?</p></speech>

It is important to say that the research we have done historically shows that these types of credit-based interventions are with merit.  They can get to households that otherwise would not have been able to make the transaction and, therefore, these types of instruments can be very meritocratic in that context.  In terms of their impact on the inflationary channel, there are a number of aspects to the intervention that would, for example, exacerbate or lower the degree to which that price inflation may materialise.  The larger the intervention, the shorter the timeframe in which that intervention takes place.  The number of recipients of that intervention is also important.  For example, if it is spread among a large number of users of the scheme and all of those users have more purchasing power, that can have an impact as well as the general level.</p> <p>  In regard to the targeting of the measures, the targeting is important in the context of the constraints households face.  For example, is it that they have an insufficient deposit such that they are down payment constrained?  In that context, an equity-type scheme is more important.  If it is the case that their loan to income ratio is constrained, that would be much more an income constraint, which the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme would deal with.  The targeting is important in the context of, in particular, the parts of the income distribution that would be impacted by any particular intervention.  Work we did previously on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme showed that it was really good at getting to applicants who were at the lower end of the income distribution but underserved by the broader commercial market.  That is a case of trying to tailor for a gap in the market.  The tailoring of this measure is important.  To ensure the maximum economic additionality from the intervention, it is critical that it goes to those households which otherwise would not have been able to make the transaction.  That is complicated to get at, but there are a number of ways to do it.  For example, there should be a screening of the borrower's attempts to secure credit through the normal channels and an interrogation of the financial circumstances of the borrower.  It is important the income and savings picture of the borrower is well known in the context of the scheme to ensure that it goes to those households with the greatest need.  That will boost the economic additionality from a scheme like this.</p></speech>

In terms of the national scheme, the details of that have not been worked out.  In terms of controls and prices, it is important to make the point that the potential purchaser of the house will only pay what he or she considers to be value.  That is the first control before price caps.  In regard to charges that apply to the equity share that is provided by the State, it is important that it works for the homeowner.  It is important that controls are put in place such that there is an appropriate and fair burden on the homeowner, but nothing excessive.  The details have not yet been worked out.  It is a matter we will feed into in our discussions with the Department to ensure the homeowner is protected.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. O'Connor, Dr. O'Toole , Dr. O'Connell, Mr. Cahill and their colleagues to this meeting.  My first question is in regard to Dr. O'Toole's concluding remark in his opening statement that credit market supports such as the shared equity scheme and other interventions may indeed lower credit constraints by facilitating home purchase for buyers who otherwise would have been unable to enter the market.  In my book, that is a positive.  We all know constituents and other people who are paying exceptionally high rents and whose incomes are such that they cannot get a sufficient mortgage but, if they could, their repayments would be substantially lower than the rents they are paying.  These are the people that we are trying to cater for in the affordable housing Bill.  It is important to say that.</p> <p>  I put it to Dr. O'Toole that, as mentioned earlier by Deputy McAuliffe, he has ignored a significant part of the Bill, namely, the provision of affordable purchase homes on local authority lands.  That is ultimately a large supply measure that will impact the provision of homes.  I take it from Dr. O'Toole's thesis that he disagrees fundamentally with the Department's contribution to the committee last week by Mr. Barry Quinlan and Mr. Robert Nicholson that, according to the UK National Audit Office, which is the equivalent of our Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the equity-based scheme in the UK had led to a 14.5% increase in supply and a 1% increase on a like-for-like basis in house prices.  Dr. O'Toole says that supply is important.  I put it to him that this is a supply-based measure.</p></speech>

On the first point, I agree that these types of credit market interventions can be very positive.  Where one succeeds in providing credit market interventions to those households which otherwise would have been unable to make that transaction, that is a very positive thing.  Where there are critical gaps in the market that can be identified as gaps which these instruments can help to address, it is important to be able to facilitate that.  For example, in our review of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme we clearly stated that there was a clear gap in the market that that particular intervention was able to address and that there was a lot of merit in that particular instrument in doing that.  I completely agree that the ability to use these interventions to intervene in the market is an important policy lever to have.  As I mentioned earlier, in terms of the focus of our submission, we were trying to provide some insight to the committee that was useful by drawing on the research that we had done.  The research that we had done crossed over on the two elements of the Bill that I mentioned in the opening statement, first, the general credit market interventions and, second, the cost rental model.</p></speech>

From an Irish perspective it is particularly important to take note of that, given the particular supply constraints there are in Ireland.  The study also found that in the areas where there was a supply constraint and where there was no discernible increase in construction, they did see an increase of 6% in the price of new builds.  It is important to take that into account.</p> <p>  In the audit report, the 1% difference between people who were accessing the scheme and those who were not in terms of a similar property is not an analysis of the broader impact on house prices; it is simply looking at the price people paid whether they accessed the scheme or not.  That is not looking at the impact on house prices.  It is simply a case of whether there was a premium for people who used the scheme or not.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I raised a similar point last week because the first point I heard in the statements about numbers related to Dublin.  I am interested to learn about the supply in Limerick.  There is more to this country than Dublin.  The statistics relating to Limerick are the ones I am most interested in.  I am in construction myself.  I am based in a rural setting.  I welcome the cost-rental management system and the shared equity loan scheme.  The biggest problem we have in Limerick is supply and demand and we have a major problem with infrastructure.  Everyone is entitled to their culture in terms of where they are from and where they are living, and to represent that.  In the context of developing Limerick as a whole, industry is based in the city or along the Shannon Estuary and infrastructure is at its lowest in the east of the county.  How can we provide housing for people in villages and small towns where there is no industry?  People want to return home to live in the area they are from, but there is no infrastructure there.  We have forgotten about infrastructure other than in highly populated areas.</p> <p>  People who have been in rental accommodation as council tenants for 20, 30 or 40 years are not allowed to buy their own house once they reach pension age.  When those people pass on, they want to leave their house to their family members so they can stay in the area where they grew up.  From an infrastructural point of view, Kilfinnane recently got 21 houses, but only 15 of them could go on the main sewerage system.  Six houses on a housing estate had to have their own private sewerage system because of a lack of infrastructure.  There are 123 people on the housing list for more than ten years and there are no sewage facilities.  Those people have all been turned down for planning.  Askeaton has been waiting for a sewerage system for 30 years.  Raw sewage is going into the Shannon.  We can talk about supplying houses everywhere, but we cannot supply them if we do not have the infrastructure in key areas where people want to live.  This goes back to the local authorities and their failure to invest in towns and villages.  Housing cannot just go to people in highly populated areas.</p> <p>  Infrastructure is not only about sewerage; it is about bus services and connectivity.  Once one leaves a highly populated area such as Limerick city, all the infrastructure falls away.  Infrastructure only seems to follow industry.  All of the county needs to be represented.  I was part of the Limerick 2030 group when I was elected as a Deputy.  My brother-in-law, John, is on the board.  It is doing fantastic work.  It started in the city and now it is moving out to the county to try to do exactly what I am talking about.  The group is trying to get infrastructure in the places I have spoken about where there is no infrastructure so people can live in the entire county and not just in one section of it.</p> <p>  I would welcome a response first to the question on infrastructure and how to provide housing for people on housing lists where there is no infrastructure.  My second question is about people in rental accommodation for many years who cannot purchase their houses once they reach pension age.  That needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Our view is that housing needs to be approached as a system and we need to look at it in the round.  Today's meeting is focused on one particular issue, that is, affordability.  By and large, it is a problem confined to large urban areas due to the demand for housing.  That is not to say there are not other problems in other aspects of the housing system and I fully agree with the Deputy that we need to look at those other issues.</p> <p>  When we looked at transport-orientated development, what we were really trying to look at is how we use the land and put infrastructure into areas to make them more attractive.  That idea could apply equally to the areas mentioned by the Deputy, Kilfinnane and Askeaton, in terms of their connections to major urban cities and we could consider how they can be made more attractive.  I do not mean to not answer the question, but it is not what we were trying to focus on coming here today.  The Deputy's question resonates with the fact that housing needs to be seen as a system and that while the problems in areas will be different that does not mean they are any less urgent in terms of being solved.</p></speech>

There are many people who have worked all their lives and been in the local authority rental system who want to buy the home they have been in for the past 30 or 40 years when they get to a certain age and, for example, they have been paid redundancy.</p><p>Some of them want to leave their home to their children so that they can get a start in life in the more rural areas, and remain within the town, village or area in which they have lived.  Some of the local authority houses are actually not in towns or villages, but are in rural areas.  The people in these areas want to buy them.  However, the constraints are that when someone is over 65 years of age and is of pensionable age, his or her income is not taken into account and that person must be working to buy the property.  That is disgraceful and should be changed.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy has raised a most important point.  The question of how people stay in a rental market, not just the local authority market, when they reach pensionable age or when their income drops significantly, must be considered.

Their insight is invaluable.  I have three questions concerning cost rental, stock and permanent affordability.</p> <p>  As I have often mentioned in the D&aacute;il and in this committee, increasing our cost rental stock by developing new units on public land will eventually drive down rent prices going forward.  Based on the witnesses' research and expertise, what annual target should the State work towards to deliver enough cost rental units to drive rents down?</p> <p>  On permanent affordability, in the presentation by Dr. O'Toole and Dr. Slaymaker, they emphasised the importance of permanent affordability.  I completely agree with affordable purchase and rent, as it is very much at the centre of Green Party housing policy.  Do the provisions set out in this Bill in its entirety, including cost rental equity loan, CREL, putting cost rental on a statutory basis, the affordable purchase of homes provided by the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the affordable purchase schemes, offer permanent affordability in the long term?  What amendments or proposals would the witnesses strongly suggest that the Government considers?  To summarise, what annual target for cost rental units should the State be delivering to reduce rents?  Does the Bill offer permanent affordability?  What amendments would the witnesses propose to the Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1017" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#G00400"><p>It will be critical to deliver cost rental on scale for the reasons given by the Deputy in respect of providing affordable housing long term for people and helping to moderate and bring down rents in the market overall.  It is critically important.  On the delivery numbers, a few thousand units per year would be needed.  A very significant stock of housing needs to be built up.  One thing that is really important in respect of cost rental is seeing it as a long-term measure.  When it has been successful in other countries, it has taken decades for that stock of affordable rental and cost rental housing to be built up.  It is critical.  When it is built up on scale, the rents can be reduced significantly over time, so it is most important.</p> <p>  Another important point is that in most countries, cost rental is seen as being very similar to home ownership.  It is a home that is affordable.  I will tell the committee a secret that is not often understood.  In Vienna, for example, people have the right to buy.  Everyone in cost rental housing can actually buy their home, but they choose not to, because it is affordable, and it is seen as a home.  In respect of any organisation providing cost rental homes, whether they are approved housing bodies, local authorities or the Land Development Agency, the rent must be based on the cost of provision, so that any surpluses or limited profits that are made are actually used to keep down the rents.  We have been working very closely with the Department, and one thing that is most important is to keep the rents down and to make cost rental seem like a long-term home for households.  It must be seen that way.</p></speech>

Some 20% of the housing stock in Denmark is cost rental.  If that model is applied, we will get a very high number.  The limited profit sector in Austria delivers 23% of all new construction in the residential market.  Again, that model will produce a very high number if it is applied.  Property Industry Ireland did a piece of research that it showed to us.  The figures are worth checking, but they provided an indication.  The research looked at the number of people on incomes of more than &euro;50,000 but under &euro;90,000 and produced a figure of 400,000.  All of that supports Mr. O'Connor's point.  The scale of this is in the thousands, not the hundreds.  Going back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, I can see that figures of 400, 500 or 1,500 seem low.  However, the issue for Government is first that it has to prove the concept.  I can see that.  Mr. O'Connor has made the point that we must look at some of the regulations and what it would count in costs.  We have to look at how we put limits on returns for investors.  There is some work to do.  My feeling is, once we have proven the concept, the demand will be there to deliver at a much higher level than our current ambition.  I can see the tension between trying to test the concept and roll out the demand.  The international evidence suggests it is a very attractive concept.</p> <p>  The other point on cost rental, and I believe the Housing Agency has figures on this, is that it delivers an immediate impact.  In the models we looked at, there could be rents 20% below what the market is at.  By the end of 2030, rents could be 40% below what the market is at.  Therefore, there is a long-term benefit to cost rental.  We will see then how the equity begins to be used to supply more housing.  There is also an immediate short-term impact, and that is where we will see the scale of demand for this, if we can do it.</p> <p>  On proving the concept, the current cost rental model is bringing costs down because it has low finance. There are other levers with which to bring the cost down.  We need to begin to look at them in respect of using the land, for example.  As we use these other levers, we can bring the cost down further again.  That, equally, will boost the demand.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1020" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#G00700"><p>I agree with both of the previous contributors that the scale of this, in the medium term, will be in the thousands.  It is a very welcome development to have this tenure in the Irish mix.  There are two benefits to the pricing side.  One is the initial level, but also over time, if the price change is lower than household income growth, then the affordability will improve over time.  That is a critical aspect of this particular tenure that should be highlighted and leveraged.</p> <p>  Something we have not discussed today in too much detail is the impact of the pandemic.  In one of the pieces of work that we did, we found that the types of sector in which middle-income renters often work are those that have been disproportionately affected by the labour market shock, whether it is hospitality, retail or similar areas.  The income prospects for these households over the next period of time are very uncertain with the pandemic.  Therefore, having a tenure like cost rental that is able to come on stream over time and provide these households with an affordable rent, where they may not be able to access a mortgage because of the employment uncertainty, is a very welcome aspect in the Irish market.</p></speech>

The Government has used these figures.  Perhaps Dr. Slaymaker can comment on the impact that had on the UK market.</p><p>She stated that the likely impact of the shared equity scheme would be to increase prices, which might offset any benefits it might have.  The UK report stated that the payment went to house buyers who did not need assistance in the first place and 60% of the beneficiaries used the scheme to buy a bigger property.  Does Dr. Slaymaker consider that the Government has put control measures in the proposed Bill to avoid what happened in the UK, that is, people using the scheme to buy bigger houses or the fact that 20% of people availing of the scheme already had houses?  If not, what control measures would she propose that the Government put in place to ensure this is not simply a demand-led scheme and the assistance goes to the people who need it?</p><p> Everybody, across the board, has raised the benefits and positive impact of cost rental housing.  I want to probe cost rental a little more in terms of affordability.  It has been suggested that some of the rents in the scheme will be between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,300.  Will this meet the affordability criteria that our guests have previously examined for middle income households?  Is that the group the scheme is targeted towards?</p><p> The cost rental scheme seems to exclude people who are on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Dr. O'Toole talked about the people who are in the most insecure of tenancies, that is, those in the private rental sector.  Does he think that people who are on HAP should be included in this scheme?  It seems crazy to me that people who might be considered to be adequately housed by some local authorities because they are on HAP are left in the private rental sector while other people are able to avail of the secure system of cost rental.</p><p> I have a couple of concerns that the proposals for cost rental tenancies seem to be linked exclusively to costs.  What should happen to somebody who takes up a tenancy in a cost rental scheme but loses his or her primary source of income or whose source of income dips?  Should an element of the scheme include differential rent?  Do our guests have any experience of that?</p><p> Mr. Cahill touched on reform of the vacant sites levy.  Would he consider a vacant unit levy?  The Government seems to be attracting real estate investment trusts, REITs, such as Kennedy Wilson, into our housing system.  It is a build-to-rent and investor-led system.  My concern is that a couple of those key investors will dominate the housing and rental markets and we will see units being left vacant because those REITs do not want rents to fall and have financial calculations suggesting it is not in their interests for rents to fall.</p></speech>

The auditor's report in the UK is clear that areas with the greatest affordability challenges have experienced lower proportions of sales supported by the scheme.  That does not suggest that the scheme has been particularly well directed to the areas with the greatest need.  The report also suggested that nearly two-thirds of the buyers who availed of the help-to-buy scheme could have bought without it.  Almost one-third could have bought exactly the same property without the scheme.  It is important to take from that experience that if there were to be a scheme in Ireland, targeting is really important.  It needs to be targeted at people who have an insufficient deposit so that the scheme is beneficial.  It should be aimed at those most in need.</p></speech>

On her point about the national shared equity scheme, controls are important.  The Department is still working on the details and has to finalise them.  If a household can afford to buy a house on the market within the macroprudential rules, it cannot avail of the shared equity loan.  That is the first point and it is an important control measure.  The fact that purchasers will have a secondary shared equity element means they will be careful about what they are buying.  The Housing Agency is working with the Department to identify what are the risks, what happened with similar schemes in the UK, including Scotland, and what control measures can be put in place.</p> <p>  Affordability is very important when it comes to cost rental.  The rents about which we have been speaking to date have been of the order of &euro;900 per month, up to &euro;1,200 per month.  We need, over time, to get those rents down as much as possible.  Specific supports can be provided to households whose income changes or falls significantly.  People who become eligible for social housing can avail of the HAP and remain in their accommodation.  That is specifically provided for in the proposed Bill.  It is important that such households in rental housing are protected.</p> <p>  It is important that we control the costs.  The management, maintenance and other overhead costs are as significant as the costs of providing cost rental homes.  It is important that we push rents down as much as possible.  We should be focused on what is affordable for households as opposed to talking about the levels of market rents.  We need to make it affordable and give long-term consistency of payments.</p> <p>  Ms Perry may wish to add something on the cost rental side.</p></speech>

I have three questions, the first of which is for Dr. Slaymaker.  She referenced a study by the London School of Economics, LSE, and a 6% increase in prices.  What is the risk of a similar effect here?</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. O'Toole about the need for targeting measures or controls around any equity loan scheme for purchase of homes from private developers.  How problematic is the lack of income limits in the Bill?  Is it a problem?  Could the lack of income limits have the effect of driving up the costs of homes or is that not an issue?</p> <p>  I will ask the representatives of the National Economic and Social Council about its substantial evidence base and reports it has done over the years about cost rental land management.  It has done good work.  The goal is that affordable measures will mean permanent affordability.  With that in mind, how does the equity loan scheme for purchase of homes from private developers measure up against that goal?  Is there an evidence base, either from NESC in terms of shared equity loans for purchase from private developers or an international evidence base of which our guests are aware, that supports those measures at which we should be looking?</p></speech>

It is impossible for me to say what is likely to happen to prices here but the thing that would concern me is that there was an increase in the price of new-build properties in London, which is the most constrained area in terms of housing supply and has the biggest affordability challenges.  That would concern me in the Irish context, given the significant supply constraints here.  It is impossible to say what the actual impact would be on prices, given that so many factors would come into the determination of prices, but that is the concerning aspect I would take from the LSE study.</p></speech>

For example, there is always someone on the far side of the income limit who is likely to be just as needy as someone on the near side.  Schemes like this are not without their costs.  If we take a step back and examine the research that has been done over the past number of years, we will see that the affordability pressures are greatest at the lower end of the income distribution.  It is likely that targeting instruments that help those areas with affordability pressures would be best.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has a specific loan-to-income limit.  When analysed, it clearly takes the part of the market that the commercial banks do not.  In that context, we can see the importance of its calibration.</p><p> There are pros and cons to the introduction of any scheme and these need to be considered carefully in the context of the broader parameterisation of all other measures.</p></speech>

If someone can buy a property using the current market prudential rules and so on, that person will not be eligible.  As incomes change and people purchase at different prices, for example, &euro;350,000, the level of subsidy in terms of the equity share will vary depending on the income of the household.  The same income limit will not be applied to someone on &euro;80,000 as to someone on &euro;70,000.  It will vary to match people's needs.  This was stated last week, although I do not know whether it was fleshed out.  It addresses one of the ESRI's concerns about the scheme's targeting.</p></speech>

Importantly, there are three actions under the Bill that will do much to help with affordability.  NESC has always argued that we need to consider the three channels of delivery, those being, the private sector, local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  In this Bill, there is an attempt to engage all three channels in pursuit of affordability.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how the approach in the private sector lined up with permanent affordability.  We would view it as desirable if the approach was one of permanent affordability, but this is an attempt to support permanent affordability in the private sector to a degree.  The equity stake held by the State is available to be returned to a revolving fund for reinvestment in housing.  That is in line with the idea of permanent affordability.  While I am not saying it is the ideal, it is a compromise that will attempt to return funding to support future generations that are seeking to buy houses.</p></speech>

We have not examined the UK evidence and the reports that were mentioned.  That said, I will stray into the debate that is under way.  I keep coming back to the point that housing is a complex system and how it is difficult to judge what the impact of a single intervention in one part will be on the wider system.  It was interesting to note from the Department's appearance before the committee that, along with the measures that Mr. O'Connor outlined to target the scheme, there seems to be a deep commitment to monitor it as it proceeds.  We can then determine its impacts.  As Dr. O'Toole stated, though, it will be difficult even then because it will be just one intervention.  My view on housing is that we need to act.  There is a supply crisis.  We will never know what the perfect intervention is, but this one seems useful and some of the equity is returned.  The key is to monitor the scheme carefully over its first 12 months.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  We all accept that the crisis of supply and affordability in terms of housing is our single most immediate challenge.  I appreciate the work the witnesses are doing to help us address that challenge.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of specific questions, the first of which is meant to clarify something.  The ESRI's report identifies the pinch point for people in the rental sector.  The State supports 53% of renters financially to secure housing and the ESRI identifies the 47% who are not in any way financially supported by the State as being trapped in unaffordability from a rental perspective and locked out of homeownership.  It was concerning to read that the ESRI identifies as potentially inflationary an intervention to help these people to access affordable housing.  The ESRI's report states that the loosening of the credit constraints by a shared equity scheme would likely lead to higher house prices.  I believe I heard one of the witnesses from the ESRI say - I would appreciate it if this could be confirmed - that this statement was based on the ESRI's previous studies and did not take into account the supply side measures.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Does that mean that the ESRI did not take into account local authorities' shared equity, the AHBs' supply side or the co-operatives?  If so, will Dr. O'Toole confirm that the statement does not assume that this will be a time-based measure and will only be available to first-time buyers who are unable to secure a mortgage from the commercial banks and are cut out of home purchasing?  Does it not take into account any local price caps that are set for affordability?  Am I correct?</p></speech>

When we discuss a scheme like this <i>ex ante</i>, we consider what economic channels it may impact on and what side of the market it comes down on, for example, whether it is a borrow-based policy or a supply-based one.  A multitude a factors affect the housing market.  The Senator mentioned some of them on the supply side.  There are a range of developments in terms of the labour market, including households' incomes and employments.  All of these factors affect the overall level of house prices and house price inflation.  When we consider a policy like this ex ante, that is, it has not happened yet, we try to think through the potential risks and the potential channels through which it might operate.  Holding all of the factors constant, we ask what the impact would be if we were to add additional purchasing power for buyers.</p><p>That is the type of assessment we do in an exercise such as this, which is purely a short consideration of a scheme on an <i>ex ante</i>basis.  Naturally, the economics of the situation would always suggest that taking more purchasing power without a commensurate increase in supply will put pressure on the demand side of the market, which is what we are noting.</p></speech>

I am not saying these schemes are not without merit.  That is very clearly stated in the opening statement.  However, we are trying to look at the pros and cons of an approach like this and to think about the various factors involved.  This policy will interact with a number of other supports such as the help-to-buy scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which are already in the market.  In a sense it is about thinking through the potential channels through which a scheme like this will operate.  Of course, the calibration and the parameterisation will matter.  Good work on ensuring that the recipients of this are those households most in need of credit will help to limit the concerns.</p></speech>

That is not necessarily the point I am trying to make.  I was trying to say that with schemes such as this there can often be spillover.  Households change their preferences for the type of house they would like to buy and that can feed into their loan application and the demand that they would make on a scheme.  There are all these combinations.  I am not saying that they are the predominant factors affecting the scheme; it is just that these are the balance of the factors that we consider at the outset.</p></speech>

Thousands of other families do not qualify to go on the social housing list and are either in receipt of HAP or RAS.  Others again are not in receipt of any payment and are paying large rents.  Rents increased by 5% in Cork in 2020.  For the people I represent, access to affordable house purchase and affordable cost rental is a major issue and needs to be delivered now.  All the contributions seems to promise everything in the future.  People are looking for hope now.  People need us to deliver now.  How many units need to be delivered in cost rental and affordable housing to prevent rents increasing and make a difference to the people?</p> <p>  NESC produced a report recommending an examination of the compulsory purchase order legislation.  It also stated that the current vacant site levy is insufficient as we all know.  What would NESC do to change that?  There are 95 vacant sites alone on the Cork City Council vacant and derelict sites list and there are many more throughout Cork city and across all local authorities.

Some of the LIHAF developments are in Cork.  However, we need it throughout the country to deliver affordable houses for purchase and cost-rental homes.

We recommended having a review of the levy in the report.  There are concerns that it may not be working so well.  While we recommend a review, we do not propose what should follow.  There would be various options.  Compulsory purchase is one option.  There has been some use of compulsory purchase for vacant built properties, which have then been used for social housing.  We published a report couple of years ago with a suggestion that did not get much attention.  We floated the idea of a mechanism of having vacant sales orders.  Where a property had been vacant for a long time, there would be a requirement on the owner to sell it.  That would establish the real market demand for property.  We think it is something that needs to be reviewed.</p></speech>

What will the rent be for the cost-rental units in Cork?  He mentioned the LIHAF.  That is for a development in the Old Whitechurch Road, which I proposed for development in 2011.  Ten years on, people are saying, "Great news in Cork; 600 units are being developed on the Old Whitechurch Road site."  This is ten years after I proposed it.  This is my issue with trying to give people hope.

I welcome Mr. O'Connor's welcome for the local authority-led affordable purchase scheme and the shared equity scheme. In respect of Dr. O'Connell's and Mr. Cahill's presentation and reviews of their eight reports, they recommended everything from the established of the LDA, cost rental, the expansion of Part V, the expansion of the site services fund, CPO powers and a flagship project.  I am inclined to agree with everything they said and all of the other research on this.  While we might not agree on everything, I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Broin would agree with me when I suggest that Dublin Mid-West be looked as a key location for such a flagship project.</p><p>My first question for the ESRI relates to the criticism of the UK scheme.  One of the major parts of criticism was that it was open to all earners and that 60% of those who availed of the scheme did not actually need that support.  I know that is of concern to the witnesses from the ESRI and Senator Moynihan, who also raised it.  Do the witnesses from the ESRI accept that we have learned from the UK experience and that, under this Bill, someone will only be eligible for affordable housing if he or she cannot buy without that support and that as Mr. O'Connor said, this, in itself, is a control mechanism?</p><p>My second question concerns the supply constraints.  As both Dr. Slaymaker and Dr. O'Toole said, supply is the most critical part and is probably the hardest one to get right.  They described it as the most difficult to rectify and something that will take the longest time to materialise.  The two shared equity schemes in conjunction with the LDA, and it is quite that they look at it in conjunction with the LDA, which is also going through the Oireachtas, are aimed at becoming a catalyst for supply in the near future.  The witnesses from the ESRI outlined how key rectifying supply issues is in terms of delivering affordability.  Do they agree that when looked at in conjunction, the two different shared equity schemes and the LDA will together kick-start supply?  If those three mechanisms become that catalyst in supply, will that will offset any potential impact on inflation?</p><p>Following on from the points raised by Deputy McAuliffe and Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick regarding not looking at the local authority scheme, I know the witnesses said they do not have much research on this side of things.  Can they use this opportunity to acknowledge that their opening statement only deals with two of the three elements of the Bill and, therefore, could be misleading if it is read as a commentary on the Bill in its entirety?  We saw that on the front page of today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  If the witnesses are willing to take this time, could they put on the record of the Oireachtas their views on the full Bill, particularly the full Bill when it is looked at in conjunction with the LDA?  Do the witnesses accept that the Bill provides for people who cannot buy without support?  Do they agree that, taken in conjunction with the LDA, this will kick-start supply?  Does that alleviate any concerns in respect of potential inflation?  My third question concerns that holistic view of the Bill.  Could the witnesses start with the third one in case we run out of time?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, in respect of the evidence we are putting forward today or, certainly, the research we are trying to draw on, we felt we had elements that could help with the Bill where that drew on our existing research.  Where there are supply side elements in this, and this is a broad Bill, they are most welcome.  Focusing on and understanding those supply side challenges are critically important.  As we said on a number of occasions, any measures to increase the supply of housing are what we need so the range of measures in the Bill to do that are very welcome.<br/><br/>In respect of the eligibility criteria, learning from the UK scheme and the impact of any increase in supply on prices, as I mentioned, when we do this type of assessment <i>ex ante</i>, it is very difficult to say what exactly will happen to house prices given the range and multitude of factors that affect house prices.  It is important at the start to think about the benefits and merits of schemes like this.  It is also important to think about the risks.  Outlining and considering these are as important as anything else.  When a scheme like this takes place or the intervention occurs, one is able to say afterwards what happened if one has sufficient data and a good identification strategy to do that.  I mentioned two things in my opening statement.  The eligibility criteria, the targeting and the prioritisation are very important.  Ensuring these households are unable to get the credit in the market - they have demonstrated that they have attempted to borrow on the market and that has been deemed to be insufficient for the housing purchase they would like to make - is a very important screening criterion for this scheme.  That is critical.<br/><br/>In terms of the overall magnitude, naturally the UK is a very different market.  The dynamics at play in the UK are very different and the context in Ireland is very different.  The level of supply and balances is not the same here.  The macroeconomic context and labour market shocks are different here, which matters for understanding how much of the various different pressures will pass through this scheme.  It is not to say that what happened in the UK will exactly happen here.  That is not the case.  However, it involves thinking about what evidence we have in terms of the mechanisms and channels through which these type of interventions operate in terms of understanding the benefits to help facilitate home ownership for households that otherwise would be unable to able to avail of it-----</p></speech>

He has given us a dose of reality.  I have listened to the other political groupings and their commentary and I read today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Yes, the heading is &quot;ESRI claims shared equity schemes risk driving up prices&quot; but Dr. O'Toole is right to come in and bring a dose of reality to the situation.  I acknowledge his work in this area and I acknowledge the ESRI as being a very competent, able, fair and transparent organisation.  I do not believe Dr. O'Toole set out to upset people but I believe he has given us a dose of reality.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning is a wake-up call for many people in this debate about affordability.  Dr. O'Toole is right to talk about analysing and assessing <i>ex ante</i>the process relating to risk, merits and benefits.  He has done a good job and has done good service to this committee.  I acknowledge that because he has made an important contribution that I consider to be a commonsense injection of reality.</p><p>I have a few questions about the Housing Agency.  I welcome Mr. O'Connor and congratulate him on the 50 cost-rental homes in Stepaside and the follow-on 105 social houses in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  This is a welcome development from which we will learn.  It was very much a learning curve and we have all learned things about that.  I do not want to go into that.  I would touch on some things mentioned by Mr. O'Connor in his commentary, such as the serviced sites fund and the land aggregation scheme, which is one of the greatest scandals in this country in terms of how these lands were purchased, the exorbitant prices paid for them and the fact that they were offered back to the Department on a land aggregation scheme basis, the Department rejected many of these and they are still on the books of the Housing Agency and local authorities.  There is enormous potential in time and there is more out there in the context of a longer-term focus.</p><p> A final issue is the LDA.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the serviced sites fund, the land aggregation scheme and the LDA and how that can feed into their plans and vision in terms of affordability.</p><p> I have a question for Mr. Cahill.  I was interested in his proposal regarding a vacant sale order, something I had not heard about.  We do not have time to discuss it today, but if he did more work on this issue, the committee would be interested in it.  I would certainly be interested in hearing more about it.  Perhaps he could send the committee some details on that.  It is an imaginative and progressive scheme with potential.  I would like to hear if there is any additional information on that, and he might share it with the committee.</p></speech>

On the purchase side it is one way of reducing the cost for the purchaser, along with the use of land.  That would involve the continued and perhaps more flexible use of the serviced sites fund, which is currently primarily focused on infrastructure.  If local authorities are given more flexibility in its use, which the Department and Minister are considering, that will be important.  Its use in the future will be very important.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to the LDA.  Delivery on State and local authority lands, supported by the LDA, will be very important.  It ties into the land aggregation scheme.  Lands which were purchased by local authorities are now being fed into the LDA.  There are three specific sites that between them will deliver around 1,500 homes.</p> <p>  The price paid by local authorities was the price of land at the time.  The important thing now is that we utilise land and start delivering on scale on those lands.  The major advantage of the LDA is that it is able to deliver on big developments and can deliver mixed-use developments.  A major focus for the LDA will be affordable housing, namely, cost rental and affordable purchase housing.</p></speech>

I refer to the ESRI conclusions that, given current supply shortages, it is likely that benefits will be outweighed by inflationary pressures.  I read with interest the report on mortgage credit access and State intervention.  It concludes by stating that:</p> <blockquote> 	[P]ublic policy mechanisms to subsidise rents, such as affordability or cost rental measures, are viewed as tenure end-points for recipient households, however such measures may provide a platform by which recipient households accumulate a deposit and become home-owners.  Exploring the dynamics of affordability and tenure choice could provide useful insights for the calibration of housing affordability and related policy interventions. </blockquote> <p>Coming back to the point made by Deputy Higgins, the wider context needs to be analysed.  This includes the LDA, the focus on improving supply, the interventions which focus on improving access to affordable housing and credit and existing schemes.  The interplay of all that will assist in easing demand and increasing supply.  I am interested in hearing the comments from the ESRI  on that.  I acknowledge the wider circumstance in the context of the statements today and how they have been represented in the media.  I would like Mr. O'Connell to expand on his comments that we need to focus on supply as a solution.</p></speech>

As I have mentioned, the housing market has many co-determining factors, such as the level of credit market access with supported schemes and broader lending activity by the general banking sector and the demand side, labour market and supply channels.  Ultimately, the overall impact on inflation would be a combination of all of these factors.  They all co-determine the degree to which house prices will move up or down over the coming years.<br/><br/>It is important for us to understand their varying impacts over time.  It is very difficult to stand here today <i>ex ante</i>and say what the impact of any one scheme would be before it has taken place.  In a sense, we need to think about the benefits and risks.  As I said in the statement and discussion today, where there are interventions to provide credit constrained households with the finance to make transactions, those policies certainly have merit.  There is a role for them where they can be clearly identified to help with the deposit or income channel.  Our research is clear on that.<br/><br/>In terms of the risks with these policies, in general with any intervention on the credit market side where there are rises in purchasing power and supply is limited in the short run, the tendency is to have upward pressure on the demand side.  That can be offset by changing other components on the supply side, and that may alter the market.  It involves a combination of factors that all affect each other.  The outcome is the price of inflation in the market.</p></speech>

I suggest that the opening statement from the ESRI needs to be updated because it confined itself to two factors rather than the wider context, all of which needs to be acknowledged.  There may be a very short-term inflationary element, but that can be augmented by all of the other wider context interplay.  It is necessary, given today's media coverage, for the ESRI to address the fact that its statement has been taken without the wider context being examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1072" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor O'Toole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021021600002#M00700"><p>In the statement we balanced and walked through the factors and outlined the fact that supply interventions are very important.  The Senator can note that we concluded that interventions which help the supply side of the market are what would be important in the medium to long term.  That is very clearly outlined.</p><p>We walk through the various impacts and channels through which measures operate and we contextualise the scheme in terms of the other schemes that are available in the market.  All of this is important for understanding the context.  Above all else, we start the opening statement by saying that all of these supply and demand factors are significantly affected by the very fast-changing nature of the pandemic's economic effects.  The opening statement reflects our research and our thinking around that research's development over the past number of years and speaks to where we feel we can make a comment on the housing market.  It walks through the benefits and risks of these types of intervention.  In dealing with the bottleneck in market supply, interventions that do not go to borrower purchasing power but to the supply side channels are what will be most important for the overall market.  The statement reflects the fact that it is difficult to determine <i>ex ante</i>what the impact will be on inflation down the line.</p></speech>

If he believes that the opening statement covers everything, that is fine.  If he feels that he wishes to add more to it based on today's questions and discussion, though, we would accept that.  We are trying to feed into the Bill and take all of the expert advice.  Adding more advice and information will assist us in that.  We would welcome it if the ESRI wished to make another submission or elaborate on its submission today.</p> <p>  We have one or two minutes left for the third Fianna F&aacute;il slot, but I do not know who will take it.</p></speech>

What the Chairman suggested would be useful.  Twenty of 23 of the Bill's heads deal with the local authority affordable purchase scheme.  We would welcome the ESRI's comments on that element.</p> <p>  Deputy Gould mentioned that he had been proposing affordable housing for ten years.  I suggest that, if he voted for Fianna F&aacute;il, he would start to see that being delivered.  That aside, can we discuss the time element?  We all know that supply is the major issue.  Our efforts must be focused on the time involved in planning, funding, getting permission and construction if we are to increase supply and maximise the affordability that can be achieved through the use of public lands to deliver public housing.  Will Mr. O'Connor speak to what we can do to accelerate that element?  I appreciate that there needs to be proof of concept of the cost-rental approach, but what can we do within the next four years to achieve scale?</p></speech>

Economists can only put forward the views they hold and I accept that the contribution that was made was limited to one area, but it was right for us to consider the broader issues as well.</p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing about scaling up cost rental.  It was right to say that the current supply was limited, given that the model is only being legislated for now.  How can we scale it up?  Will the witnesses also answer the question about social mix?  We would not allow any other sort of mono-income or mono-tenure criterion.  Therefore, there should at least be a percentage of social housing in every cost-rental block to provide mixed-income developments just as there would be in a private or social housing estate.</p></speech>

Focusing on large sites would have the greatest impact.  Many deliveries are on smaller sites, so we need to get larger ones going.  Alongside the LDA and the work being done by local authorities, that will make a significant difference.</p></speech>

Tr&iacute; na for&aacute;lacha agus na caighde&aacute;in a eascr&oacute;idh astu, beidh mapa b&oacute;thair againn chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an m&oacute;rcheist seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil an Rialtas an-tiomanta don Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar a sonra&iacute;tear sa chl&aacute;r Rialtais.

Cialla&iacute;onn "&Oacute;" from agus cialla&iacute;onn "O'" gur garmhac at&aacute; i gceist.</p><p>Is athr&uacute; suntasach &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; m&iacute;ni&uacute; difri&uacute;il ann.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna f&iacute;or nuair a athra&iacute;tear seolta&iacute; daoine.  Uaireanta cuirtear isteach s&iacute;nt&iacute; fada n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh siad ann.  B&iacute;onn siad ar an litir mh&iacute;cheart n&oacute; ar litreacha nach guta&iacute; iad.  T&aacute; an bealach ina bhfuil daoine in &Eacute;irinn tar &eacute;is caitheamh le m'ainm &oacute; rugadh m&eacute; maslach.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar an gc&eacute;anna do a l&aacute;n daoine eile.  Tuigim bot&uacute;in ach n&iacute; thuigim an masla a dh&eacute;antar nuair a dh&eacute;anann duine bot&uacute;n agus an t-ainm litrithe go sonrach os a chomhair.  N&iacute; tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; dom thar lear.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th go dtarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; anseo?

Nuair a rinne m&eacute; gear&aacute;n, d&uacute;radh liom n&aacute;r fh&eacute;idir leis an mbanc s&iacute;neadh fada a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  Is bloody meais&iacute;n at&aacute; ann.

Is ionann Sean &Oacute; Murch&uacute; agus Old Murphy, m&aacute; t&aacute;thar chun B&eacute;arla a chur air agus a bheith ag magadh.  Cad chuige nach f&eacute;idir linn d&iacute;reach a r&aacute; go bhfuil dualgas ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; glacadh le hainmneacha agus seolta&iacute; i gceachtar den d&aacute; theanga oifigi&uacute;il agus &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh i gceart seachas comhlachta&iacute; a fhorord&uacute;?  T&aacute; a fhios agam gur cuireadh &eacute; sin ag na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it gan &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agus d&uacute;shl&aacute;n an Aire St&aacute;it a thabhairt.  Beifear ag dul &oacute; eagra&iacute;ocht go heagra&iacute;ocht ag &eacute;isteacht le leithsc&eacute;alta d&iacute;obh&aacute;lacha maidir le r&iacute;omhair&iacute; agus chuile sh&oacute;rt eile go dt&iacute; L&aacute; Philib an Chleite.  Beidh muid ag dul ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus beidh s&eacute; ag r&aacute; nach f&eacute;idir leis tada a dh&eacute;anamh faoi mar nach bhfuil an forord&uacute; ann.  Is &eacute; sin an tuiscint at&aacute; agamsa air seo.  Seachas sin, ba ch&oacute;ir a r&aacute; go bhfuil ceart ag duine a ainm a &uacute;s&aacute;id i nGaeilge agus gur fadhb don chomhlacht &eacute; sin.</p> <p>  Thug an Breitheamh On&oacute;rach Hardiman breithi&uacute;nas iontach sa Ch&uacute;irt Uachtarach.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go gcuireann an St&aacute;t dualgais throma ar an saor&aacute;nach &oacute; thaobh foirmeacha, iarratais agus mar sin de a dh&eacute;anamh agus, mar sin, go bhfuil s&eacute; go hioml&aacute;n ceart go gcuirf&iacute; ualach ar an St&aacute;t agus nach f&eacute;idir leis an St&aacute;t casadh a dh&eacute;anamh mar cuirtear ualach ar dhaoine ruda&iacute; a fh&aacute;il ceart i nGaeilge.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil iarracht d&eacute;anta ag an Aire St&aacute;it, a th&aacute;inig isteach sa sc&eacute;al seo deireanach sa l&aacute;, ach creidim go bhfuil an fhor&aacute;il &aacute;irithe a cuireadh isteach r&oacute;chasta.  Is cuireadh &eacute; ag eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; gan rud a dh&eacute;anamh agus a dh&uacute;shl&aacute;n a thabhairt.  Beidh Air&iacute; eile i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag iarraidh cead gan forord&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar cib&eacute; eagra&iacute;ocht toisc nach bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta glacadh le hainmneacha i nGaeilge agus go bhfuil s&eacute; ag tabhairt leithsc&eacute;il.

Deputy Shanahan is substituting for Deputy Lowry.  The matter at hand is Review to Renew, the public consultation on the national development plan, NDP.  The purpose of our meeting is to examine the national development plan with a view to making a submission to the consultation process.  From Irish Rail I welcome Mr. Jim Meade, chief executive, Mr. Peter Muldoon, director of capital investment and Mr. Barry Kenny, corporate communications manager.  From the Port of Cork Company I welcome Mr. Eoin McGettigan, CEO, and Mr. Henry Kingston, port engineering manager.  I welcome also Mr. Frank Ronan, chief executive at the Port of Waterford, Mr. Colin Dunne, joint managing director at International Warehousing and Transport and Mr. Glenn Carr, general manager, rail freight and Rosslare Europort.  I thank the witnesses for attending at such short notice.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful that domestic law could be applied to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House campus.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contributions, to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  For those watching this meeting online, Oireachtas members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only the Chairman and staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Meade to make his opening statement.  As the meeting is limited to two hours due to Covid measures, I ask that he limit his remarks to five minutes.</p></speech>

I will briefly recap on our operations, progress to date on projects funded under the NDP and our engagement with the consultation process of Review to Renew.</p> <p>  Our team of over 4,000 colleagues in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is responsible for maintaining a network of 2,200 km, operating 4,900 train services each way across 144 stations nationwide, transporting almost 1 million customers per week pre-Covid, transporting almost 90 million tonne-kilometres of freight by rail and bringing 130,000 freight units, over 800,000 passengers and over 21,000 trade cars through Rosslare Europort - for which we are port authority - annually.  I reiterate that those are pre-Covid numbers.  While Covid is not the subject of the discussion today, I wish to place on record my appreciation for our team of essential workers for ensuring that we have continuously delivered a safe and sanitised service to those whose travel has been essential throughout this pandemic.</p> <p>  The NDP is funding a range of critical projects to cater for existing demand to allow us to expand the role we play in meeting transport needs and to deliver solutions to environmental sustainability, congestion and balanced development for Ireland.  I will summarise our major projects and their current status.  On the infrastructure of the DART+ programme, all phases of the electrification and network capacity enhancement under the programme are now in planning, with DART+ West which is the Maynooth to M3 Parkway line public consultation under way and consultation for DART+ South West, which is out to Hazelhatch and coastal, namely, Drogheda to Greystones, commencing in 2021.  Railway order applications will also be progressed this year, beginning with DART+ West.  On the DART+ fleet, a framework order for up to 600 electric and battery-electric carriages over a ten-year period will be placed this year, representing the largest and greenest order of fleet in Irish public transport history.</p> <p>  Construction of a new national train control centre at Heuston Station is under way.  This will yield safety, punctuality and efficiency benefits.  It will be our national control centre co-located with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Dublin City Council, thereby enhancing co-operation and emergency response.  Construction will be completed this year and phased transfer of operations will be completed in 2023.  On additional intercity railcars, 41 carriages have been ordered and are under construction, with delivery from mid-2022 for commuter and intercity services.  A range of other enhancements are continuing, including: lift and accessibility enhancements at stations; station development, with a new station opening at Pelletstown this year; the Cork line rehabilitation project has commenced, with track relaying to enhance safety and facilitate journey time improvements through increased line speed and enhancement of car and cycle-parking facilities.</p> <p>  In our engagement with the Department for Transport as part of the Review to Renew consultation, we have highlighted further opportunities to develop the role of rail in meeting the future needs of our economy, environment and society.  These include enhancing the role of rail in meeting the transport needs of our regional cities, aligned with the ambitions for our regional cities under Project Ireland 2040, the framework which will guide the Review to Renew and the NDP.  This includes: advancing the ambitious plans for Cork commuter rail, including higher frequency, and new stations under the Cork metropolitan area transportation strategy, CMATS; developing the possibilities for rail in the Limerick area, as part of the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area strategy, LSMATS, based on the existing network of lines around the city; double-tracking Athenry to Galway, to build capacity and frequency for both commuter and intercity and delivering the relocated Plunkett Station, providing for public transport integration and further frequency improvements, as part of the Waterford North Quays development.</p> <p>  Further such opportunities include: building climate resilience into our rail infrastructure, with specific focus on the Dublin to Rosslare Europort line and the necessary coastal protection and other works needed for the long-term resilience of the route, as well as more comprehensive review of potential climate change impacts and risk reduction measures around the network; further investment in our inter-urban routes to decarbonise inter-urban travel, including line-speed enhancement; capacity enhancement, including options for double-tracking at locations such as Portarlington to Athlone, and Limerick to Limerick Junction; and the development of proposals for further electrification of the network, with sustainability and journey time benefits.  We are also port authority for Rosslare Europort.  Mr. Carr will address our engagement on Rosslare separately.</p> <p>  It is clear that as a country and a society, the sustainability of our economy into the future and the impacts on our environment are becoming a greater concern for citizens and our customers.  Covid-19 will change aspects of the way we live our lives and move about, but it also presents an opportunity to change habits and reset methods of travel.  Sustainable transport can be a key driver for the recovery of growth and rail travel is an essential pillar of any modern sustainable public transport network, with a significant opportunity to strengthen its role to support Ireland's wider recovery.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann looks forward to engaging further on the Review to Renew process.  We are happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Since we last attended the committee, the transformation at Rosslare Europort has gathered pace as, together with our shipping operators, we have developed new and expanded direct services between Rosslare Europort and the Continent of Europe.</p> <p>  There are now 16 direct sailings to Europe each way per week, offering 32 services between Rosslare and Europe.  These services have played a vital role in ensuring continuity of the country's supply chain, which has faced the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid-19.  For time purposes, I have outlined our services in our statement. </p> <p>  Increasing connectivity, the frequency of shipping services and developing Rosslare Europort as an offshore wind hub for Ireland are the key objectives in growing the port and maximising its potential for the region and country.  Our figures for January clearly show the demand for these services, with the key highlights of January 2021 versus January 2020 as follows: ship visits up 37%, combined freight traffic between the UK and Europe up 43%, continental freight up 447% and UK freight down 49%.  The growth of services to mainland Europe has been essential to protect our export and import supply lines to avoid the disruptions that the UK land bridge now brings post Brexit and to support the new supply chains created directly with Europe.  We are very confident that these direct services will be maintained and we are in ongoing discussions and reviews to accommodate potential additional frequency and capacity to Europe, such is the ongoing demand for these services.</p> <p>  Extensive planning and significant investment in infrastructure and resources has gone into Rosslare Europort from all of the Government agencies and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as a port authority, so that the port is in a position to meet these challenges.  I would like to thank the Ministers, Secretaries General and their teams from the Departments of Transport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health, the Revenue Commissioners, the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council for their enormous support and guidance in our preparations.</p> <p>  There is still further potential to develop Rosslare Europort for the region and the country, and our plans and the opportunity provided under the review of the NDP can ensure this is realised.  Our strategic plan for the port is progressing and master plan works have commenced, with an investment of circa &euro;35 million in port facilities, infrastructure and technology over the next number of years to support the future roll on-roll off, ro-ro, freight and passenger services.</p> <p>  Rosslare Europort has also completed an extensive review of the potential of the port being developed as an offshore wind hub for Ireland.  As the committee will know, significant offshore wind developments are planned in the Irish and Celtic Seas and Rosslare Europort is best positioned to be developed to meet the port infrastructure needs of this industry.  A detailed design plan and business case for Rosslare offshore wind development has been submitted and we believe the proposal offers the offshore industry and the State the best investment and future required infrastructure to ensure that Ireland maximises the opportunity to address climate action needs and for these projects to generate and secure the benefits available for future regional development through investment and jobs.</p> <p>  Equally, it is critical that connectivity to Rosslare Europort and all major cities and industrial hubs throughout Ireland is further supported by improving road developments.  As volumes through the port grow, it is essential that the Oilgate to Rosslare motorway and the new port access road are completed so that additional future traffic can be accommodated and Rosslare can be developed to its full potential to support the Irish economy.</p> <p>  We must not forget the traffic congestion problems that existed pre-Covid, and the over reliance on Dublin and the challenges this brought.  Rosslare Europort is keen to maximise the benefits of our strategic national asset, and we would welcome the support of the committee in the plans and proposals I have outlined.  I thank the Chairman and committee members.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Henry Kingston, port engineering manager.</p> <p>  The Port of Cork is the second largest in the State, handling all cargo types, lift on-lift off, lo-lo, containers, liquid and solid bulks, ro-ro freight, project cargo and cruises.  It operates facilities in Cork city, Tivoli, Ringaskiddy and Cobh.  The port includes Whitegate oil refinery and the Whiddy oil storage facility in Bantry.  The Marino Point site is currently being developed as a port facility and a new &euro;80 million container terminal is nearing completion in Ringaskiddy.  The Port of Cork is categorised as a tier 1 port of national significance in the national ports policy 2013 and a core port in the North Sea-Mediterranean corridor and on the Atlantic corridor of the EU TEN-T network.</p> <p>  The port is undertaking several significant infrastructural projects which have the potential to transform Cork Harbour.  The move of port activities into deeper water, closer to the shipping channels, will mean more efficient links to markets, a significantly lower carbon footprint and a reduced requirement for dredging the River Lee.  The urban regeneration potential left behind in the city and Tivoli docks is fully aligned with the national planning framework, NPF, objectives of compact living and sustainable transport.  These opportunities have been recognised and supported in the NDP, the NPF, the regional spatial and economic strategy for the region and local city and county plans.</p> <p>  However, relying solely on individual port companies to invest in national port infrastructure may not be sufficient to serve the needs of the national economy, especially while facing disrupters such as Brexit, climate change, offshore energy, hydrogen and transition fuels such as LNG.  A number of obstacles remain to the orderly and planned relocation of our city centre operations.  The first is the fact that the road connectivity to the key lower harbour facilities in Ringaskiddy and Marino Point is not up to the required EU standards for core port connectivity.  Full throughput from the terminals cannot be achieved with the current HGV access.  The second is the relocation of a number of private companies operating Seveso designation site in Cork city docks and Tivoli docks to more compatible port sites in the lower harbour.  The third is the investment needed to reconnect the freight rail link to Marino Point.  The fourth is the fact that the ability of commercial semi-State port companies to self-fund major capital projects is limited by the financial capabilities of our balance sheet.  Providing suitably upgraded freight connections from the national road network to Cork's new port facilities in Ringaskiddy and Marino Point will remove up to 600 truck moments daily from Cork city centre.  This will allow for city centre growth and compact living, and will support sustainable transport mode in the city, such as the positive impact the Dublin Port Tunnel had on Dublin city centre traffic.</p> <p>  In conclusion, despite the fact our port projects are supported in the NDP, they face the same risks, such as planning challenges and legal delays, as other projects, as well as funding uncertainty.  Efforts to streamline these processes have not been fully successful.  The current investment required to deliver the transformational change for Cork city and the southern region goes beyond the incremental capital investment which can be supported by the port.  The NDP has identified the opportunity for Cork city and the southern region in which the Port of Cork company must play a central role.  A broader perspective on how to clear the obstacles to realise this opportunity now needs to be applied and resourced by the various State agencies involved such as the Port of Cork, Cork city and county councils, TII, the NTA, Irish Rail and others.  I thank the Chairman and committee.</p></speech>

The Port of Waterford is the home port here.   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to join the committee today.  My statement is a summary of the submission we made to the Review to Renew consultation.  The Port of Waterford made its submission to the Review to Renew consultation on 28 January 2021.  This statement to the joint committee provides an overview of that submission.</p> <p>  The Port of Waterford operates from Belview Port point and handles more than 1.5 million tonnes of bulk products, mainly agri-related, together with another 100,000 or so tonnes of break bulk including bulk. timber, steel and project cargoes.</p><p>The port also operates in the container lo-lo sector, handling 50,000 20 ft. equivalent units, TEUs, annually, with spare capacity to significantly increase that throughput.</p><p> The Belview facility has excellent inland connectivity including direct access to the M9 and active rail connections into the port.  With our positioning, the Port of Waterford is a tier 2 port of national significance and provides infrastructure that is relevant both regionally and nationally.  The NDP provides enabling investment to implement the NPF, which sets the vision and strategy for the development of the State, balanced across all of our regions, towns and cities, out to the year 2040.</p><p> The importance of port connectivity in the context of Brexit and climate change is clearly signposted within the NPF with the inclusion of the following national strategic outcomes: outcome 2 is enhanced regional accessibility; outcome 4 is sustainable mobility; and outcome 6 is high-quality international connectivity.  The programme for Government states that the Government will work with the State's port companies to ensure they have the capacity, finance and policy supports to deliver in the years ahead.</p><p> I now turn to challenges and opportunities for port development.  The Port of Waterford masterplan sets out its strategic response to NPF policies and current challenges with respect to port development and the wider commercial environment.  It identifies development priorities to 2044 that could be implemented to meet the needs of the economy over the next 25 years.  Offshore wind investment as well as capacity constraints in Dublin, exacerbated by Brexit, will accelerate the requirement for new capacity and the need for the Port of Waterford's masterplan projects.</p><p> With regard to improving connectivity and sustainability, we are currently witnessing the relevance that Rosslare has assumed around the provision of services to ro-ro freight for direct to Europe connections.  Waterford has the potential and available capacity to have a similar impact in terms rail freight and lo-lo off services, with direct lo-lo services to Europe providing a viable option against using the UK land bridge or more expensive direct ro-ro routes.  Utilising best transport and logistics options also has the ability to make a significant contribution to transport decarbonisation.</p><p> We have requested an enhanced focus in the NDP around rail freight development, for overall support for network viability and for investment in rolling stock capacity.  In Waterford, the portside element and connections are in place with no additional investment required.</p><p> Offshore wind investment is a key component of the climate action plan and support for offshore installations represents a significant opportunity for the State over the next few years.  The port is actively involved in facilitating onshore wind installations and should be seen as a significant enabler.  Port investment will be required and strategy alignment between the south-east ports on this issue is highly desirable.  This opportunity will require the acceleration of some or all of the projects identified in the Port of Waterford masterplan.</p><p> The Port of Waterford submission requests that the revised NDP includes support for the Port of Waterford Master Plan 2020-2044 and the capital projects identified in this plan.  We also request that the NDP supports the delivery of a rail freight network and investment to facilitate offshore wind, and ensures that prescribed bodies have sufficient capacity and resources to engage with capital project development and delivery.</p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I kept my contribution as tight as I could but I look forward to answering any questions or providing more information on the port.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Colin Dunne, joint managing director of International Warehousing and Transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Founded in 1981, International Warehousing and Transport, IWT, is an indigenous privately-owned Irish company with offices in Dublin, Rotterdam, Hamburg and Ballina, County Mayo.  IWT is a leading provider of European and global shipping services.  Since 2009, we have chartered in excess of 3,000 freight trains serving Ballina and Dublin Port, and we currently offer customers 14 cross-country rail freight services weekly.  This is the only intermodal container rail service on the island of Ireland currently.<br/><br/>It is the ambition of IWT to expand and develop its services across the State.  Having invested heavily in our rail freight operations in Ballina we see an urgent need in the post-Brexit era for rail connectivity to the ports of Waterford, Foynes when reconnected, and others.  We are confident that many new business opportunities would arise if it were indicated that this infrastructure was to be made available.<br/><br/>The restoration of the rail freight connection from Mayo southwards to those southern ports, as proposed recently by the Minister for Transport, would allow for greater flexibility and alternative exit points for current business as well as the development of such new business opportunities.  To support this rail service, IWT has invested in excess of &euro;2 million in our depot in Ballina, with a capacity to operate the first and last mile on a 24-7 basis.  We have a modern fleet of trucks and heavy lift port-type reach stackers for lifting laden and empty containers.<br/><br/>In mainland Europe, Ballina would be referred to as an inland port and countries such as The Netherlands consider inland ports of strategic importance for competitive advantage to local industry.  Our existing rail freight service is a significant addition to our portfolio of international services.  We are the largest single freight customer of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  IWT charters the trains thereby taking all the commercial risk, and slots are available for the entire market to use.<br/><br/>We fully intend to grow current rail services where possible with a focus on reducing costs, on reducing transport&rsquo;s annual carbon footprint and on providing a statistically safer mode of transport.  In 2015, a study by the Western Development Commission estimated that the rail freight market share in the western region could be increased fourfold.  We are now interested in expanding our rail freight operations serving locations on the western rail corridor.  A number of other potential customers have been identified, including potential traffics from Cork to Ballina, Foynes to Ballina and Waterford to Tuam, Claremorris and Ballina.<br/><br/>In addition to facilitating direct access to southern ports such as Waterford and potentially Shannon-Foynes and Cork, the restoration of the rail link between Claremorris and Athenry would provide us with an alternative route to Dublin in the event of unforeseen interruptions or congestion on the radial line from Claremorris to Athlone.  There is already evidence of traffic congestion on the existing radial route from Dublin to the west.  As our operations continue to increase this becomes a more pressing issue.  There is a quick and available opportunity to commence a new service from Waterford to Ballina, and <i>vice versa</i>, immediately.  IWT is willing to commit to this.<br/><br/>I will turn to the environmental factors that we are aware of.  Rail freight emissions are 60% to 70% lower than road freight.  Rail is one of the most environmentally sustainable forms of transport.  The benefits of moving freight from road to rail to reduce carbon emissions are widely recognised in other EU countries and are championed by governments.  The promotion of increased rail freight by the Irish Government would send a strong signal to Europe that we are serious about meeting our carbon targets.  In line with our company&rsquo;s commitment to the environment our charter trains contribute directly to carbon savings by displacing approximately 13,000 truck movements or 3 million truck kilometres annually.  With a CO<sub>2</sub>saving, this amounts to an annual CO<sub>2</sub>reduction of 1,463 tonnes.  Our rail service currently displaces approximately 85 million truck kilometres from Irish roads annually.  Each train removes up to 36 HGVs from our roads.  IWT is actively seeking to increase the volume of suitable container traffic by rail.  Despite the fact that we are supposed to be incentivising carbon savings in the area of transport, Ireland currently has the second highest track access charges in Europe at approximately twice the average in the EU.  Remarkably, there are no subsidies towards rail freight unlike most countries.  By contrast, the Scottish Government recently allocated &pound;25 million to support the country&rsquo;s rail freight industry over the next five years.<br/><br/>We feel that more ambition is called for in these areas.  To address these issues, we believe it is necessary to invest in the integration and expansion of the rail network, including the revival of strategically important disused lines, which can also contribute significantly to Ireland meeting its emissions targets and obligations, and increasing gross domestic product in areas outside the greater Dublin area.  It is important to note that to date there has been no financial risk to Irish Rail; all the commercial risk lies with IWT, the charter party.  This demonstrates the success of a public private partnership that brings significant societal, economic, and environmental benefits with significant scope for further expansion.</p></speech>

I wish to raise with Mr. Meade the issues of access and affordability of rail services.  There are two projects I will cite, one of which is in my area with the extension of the Navan rail line from Dunboyne, and the other is in the west with the expansion of the western rail corridor.  Neither of these projects is included in the current NDP as existing projects.</p><p>Irish Rail has not mentioned them in its engagement on Review to Renew.  Can Mr. Meade please outline where he sees those projects?  I want him to give a commitment that Irish Rail will expand rail services across the State.  I fundamentally believe that both of the projects have the potential to serve a great purpose in modal terms so will shift people out of cars and on to public transport.  He will have heard about rail freight from the other witnesses.  Can I hear his response to both of the projects, please?</p></speech>

The National Transport Authority leads on the planning side as part of the greater Dublin area, GDA, review that is currently under way and the Navan rail link is part of that review.  We feed into the authority any issues, respond to any queries they have for us and give any guidance we can to them on costs, alignments and all of that.  We are fully committed to that.  All we await is clarity from the Department and the NTA.  It is a case of if and when they want to build it.  Obviously we are here to operate railways.  We very much welcome the expansion of rail across the network and we would welcome both projects.</p> <p>  On the case of the western rail corridor, at the request of, and subject to the terms of reference within the Department of Transport, we did commission a report that was undertaken by EY.  It is a financial and economical appraisal on proposals to extend the western rail corridor, as outlined before, ultimately to Claremorris in two phases from Athenry to Tuam and then Tuam to Claremorris.  The terms of reference specified in that appraisal were that we must ensure that any extension of the WRC meets all of the relevant appraisal procedures and value-for-money tests required under the public spending code.</p> <p>  The report was submitted to the Department in July 2020.  It was subject to an independent review, commissioned by the Department, with the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in the European Regions, JASPERS.  Neither report supported the extension of the WRC based on the terms of reference set out in it.  I would note that the Minister for Transport has informed the Government of a proposed all-Ireland strategic rail review of the inter-urban and inter-regional rail network taking cognisance of the need for balanced regional development and cross-Border connectivity.  While the Department is doing that we will be very involved with them and we will support them in any way they need.  If the decision is made to develop either or both of those lines then we will not be found wanting in supporting that decision and delivering.</p></speech>

I hope that the committee will have an opportunity in the time ahead and I am sure other contributors will comment on the western rail corridor.  There have been significant statements here on the foundation of the two reports, particularly in the context of the opportunity for rail freight.</p> <p>  For the remainder of my time I will focus on the Navan rail line and I have questions on the relationship between the national development plan review and the greater Dublin area transport strategy review.  I am confident that we will get the green light for the project as it has political support across the board.  I also believe that the economic and environment arguments for it is very strong and the social argument is without comparison.  If the project gets a green light in the review how quickly can it start?  What is the shortest timeline?  How does the greater Dublin area transport strategy relate to the national development plan?  How quickly can we get money allocated to the job to get it started?     </p></speech>

I am sure he is very familiar with County Clare.  The county has a couple of outstanding rail projects that I would like to see advanced, and they have been in the offing for some time.  We would see an extension of the western rail corridor as very beneficial to the Limerick, Ennis and onwards to Galway line that currently exists.  Anything that would improve passenger numbers through that area would be beneficial to County Clare, and particularly Shannon Airport.</p> <p>  A number of years ago there was a proposal to include a rail stop at Crusheen train station.  Please update us on that and consider increasing the number of stops, for example, at  places like Cratloe in south-east Clare and, possibly, Meelick.  That rail line is under-utilised when it heads into Limerick.  There could be much greater use made of stations that  facilitate the Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick.  I would be interested in hearing about proposals that Irish Rail might have in that regard.</p> <p>  Mr. Meade will be aware that the rail line as it travels from Ennis to Limerick frequently experiences difficulties at Ballycar because of flooding.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, and Irish Rail have conducted a number of studies on the issue and I ask for an update on that.</p> <p>  The spur into Shannon or a Shannon rail line is back on the agenda.  I am sure that Mr. Meade was familiar with the line over the years.  The late Se&aacute;n Hillery, former councillor, put a lot of stock in the project as a councillor who represented the Shannon region a number of years ago.  I have recently heard comment from the Minister, Deputy Ryan, that he is  relooking at the project.  I ask Mr. Meade to give the committee his perspective on the project.</p> <p>  In terms of the south-eastern part of County Clare, Killaloe and access to the Birdhill line, does Irish Rail propose to update the Ballybrophy line, increase services or make improvements?</p> <p>  Finally, disability access at Ennis train station is an ongoing issue.  Mr. Meade did mention the potential for some lifts and I ask him to talk to us about that.  I am more than happy with everything the other contributors said. </p></speech>

He asked a lot of questions and I hope I noted them all.  I will try to answer them in the order in which they were asked.</p> <p>  In terms of Crusheen, yes, before the financial crash there was a plan to consider building a station at Crusheen but that never came to fruition as part of the first stage of the western rail corridor.  We would state quite clearly that the responsibility for developing a transport strategy still remains with the local authority, as part of its county development plan and policy.  Subject to a positive outcome from any appraisal they may make we would, in principle, support the development of a station at Crusheen.  It will be necessary for the county council to arrange for the production of the required business case, as it is the authority with such responsibility.  We would support the development should that occur.</p> <p>  On stations into Limerick, I am happy to say that we have made a comprehensive submission to the Limerick-Shannon Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy, LSMATS, with the options that we see are viable for heavy rail as part of the overall transport offering for Limerick.  We see the option of several stations between Ennis and Limerick: from Sixmilebridge in; a park and ride facility at Cratloe, if we want; stations at Moyross; and then stations further in as part of that overall development.  We would welcome such developments.  We have put those options forward as part of the LSMATS.  I am sure that they will be taken into consideration by the NTA and will be subject to any final decision there. Whatever the outcome, we will be very happy to deliver those projects when they come our way.</p></speech>

It would be at the back of Limerick Institute of Technology and right beside the spiritual home of rugby, Thomond Park, and Moyross, which is a big residential area.  As it goes over the Shannon and swings around back into the city, it passes within ten minutes walk of University of Limerick, so it will serve all locations.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned Ballycar, which has been the subject of a long-running saga.  There is a big turlough at Ballycar that fills up slowly in the winter months.  If we get a lot of rain, it results in the line being closed for anything from eight weeks upwards.  Our worst closure in a very bad winter was for something like 15 or 16 weeks before it drained again.  A report on flood relief options at Ballycar has been completed.  We commissioned RPS Consulting Engineers and were involved in a round-table approach with other stakeholders such as Clare County Council, the Office of Public Works, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  The 2020 study builds on previous studies.  A preferred option for a technically viable drainage scheme that would prevent recurring floods has been worked up and submitted to the Department for consideration and, ultimately, funding.</p> <p>  On the rail link to Shannon, in 2007, a consultancy firm was involved and, as the Senator said, the late Sean Hillery was pushing on this issue.  The Department did a study to look at a link into Shannon.  As part of LSMATS, the current Minister has committed to revisiting that study and doing a further study on whether that link can or should be established.</p> <p>  On the Nenagh branch, we have proposed some activities on the Nenagh branch with a park-and-ride facility out near Birdhill, again as part of LSMATS.  Beyond that, there are not currently many proposals for the Nenagh branch.  With the Nenagh partnership, we have started looking more recently at how we could enhance services under the current restrictions relating to the branch.  It would require a substantial upgrade in order to put a high-frequency service on it but it is our intention, at an absolute minimum, to maintain it as is and, where we can, to improve services.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned accessibility at Ennis.  He will be happy to note we are well advanced with a project to put a new over-bridge and lifts into Ennis to make the station fully accessible.  That project is funded by the NTA and is under way, so that is happening.  I hope I dealt with all the questions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Meade for his comprehensive response and for the work he does.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has done remarkably well under his leadership in the past number of years to take the direction it has.

I want to ask Mr. Meade, in the context of his contribution in terms of the Cork line rehabilitation project, will he clarify the position on track laying, the facilitation of journey times and what that means for the customer?  In the context of high-speed electrification, what can we expect and how will we see Cork to Dublin traffic times improve?</p> <p>  The NTA was before the committee last week.  With regard to the Cork commuter rail project, what do Mr. Meade&rsquo;s comments mean in terms of advancing that ambitious plan?  Can he put a timeframe on it and what does he expect to see under the metropolitan transport strategy?</p> <p>  I commend the port of Cork for the work it has been doing in a post-Brexit world.  At this forum, I want to pay tribute to the outgoing chairperson, John Mullins, who is stepping down after eight years.  I thank him for his dedication to the Port of Cork and the vision he has, with the staff and the former chief executive, and now with Mr. McGettigan and Mr. Kingston, to drive the port forward and to have a very ambitious plan for Cork port.  In a time when we are rededicating to public service, John Mullins' commitment to Cork and to the Port of Cork is to be commended and praised.  I thank him for his service.</p> <p>  In the context of Mr. McGettigan's and Mr. Kingston's presentation, it was stated that the emphasis on streamlining the process has not been successful in terms of the attempt to expand in the context of the national development plan.  What does that mean?</p> <p>  I have been speaking with Deputy Paul Kehoe, who has been a very strong advocate for Rosslare.  Will Mr. Carr comment with regard to offshore wind energy, which is being discussed for the Rosslare Europort?</p></speech>

The rehabilitation of the Cork route is about maintaining our assets and maintaining the rail infrastructure - the track bed and the rails - to a high level.  What we are doing is improving and renewing with a view to maintaining the current line speeds of 100 mph.  As we progress and extend the amount of 100 mph running that we can do, that is with the ultimate goal of getting the Dublin to Cork services to about a two-hour journey time.  Our fastest train to Cork currently takes two hours and 20 minutes and, as we improve journey times by improving the track and increasing speeds, the target time would be to get key business trains to a two-hour journey time between the two major cities of Dublin and Cork.</p> <p>  On the passive provision for electrification, anything we are doing in no way hinders the long-term view of electrifying the network.  Anywhere we can make passive provision as we do this now, we keep a weather eye on the fact that, at some time in the future, we will electrify, and we may even raise line speeds further.  Therefore, where we can make passive provision at no extra cost as we go through this, we are doing so.</p></speech>

We engaged CDG Offshore and Marine to review the industry, what it was bringing and, more importantly, the infrastructure that would be required, particularly at port level.  We believe we have now put forward a very strong business case and a detailed plan and design for an offshore wind hub at Rosslare Europort.  We are the closest and best positioned port for these offshore wind developments, and we have the infrastructure development potential in terms of land available around the port.  It requires an investment of close to &euro;200 million and, while I know that may sound a lot in these times, we believe it is a very worthwhile business investment that will give the best return for the State.</p> <p>  With regard to regional development, it is critical, particularly at the construction and installation stage of offshore wind energy, that the infrastructure at a port is available in the State.  It is recognised that no port currently has the infrastructure for the requirements of the offshore developments.  As I said, we presented a plan outlining this, with a detailed roll-out of the project, including everything from detailed design and construction to operation.  We believe it is very achievable to be up and running in Rosslare Europort within the next three to five years to meet the needs relating to offshore wind development.</p></speech>

On increased frequency for CMATS, what we meant is that, between Mallow, Cobh and Midleton, it is about increasing the frequency of trains and improving the offering to the customer over several phases.  By 2023, we would see ourselves increasing capacity by cascading fleet into the area, and so generating more fleet.  Prior to Covid we would have had capacity issues, particularly on the morning Midleton service, with people trying get into Cork city.  In phase 1, we see ourselves investing in fleet to improve frequency and improve capacity on those lines.  As part of phase 2, we would move to a 20-minute service on those lines, whereas it is currently a half-hourly service.  Having increased the capacity, we would then increase the frequency.</p><p>In phase 3, out into 2027 and 2028, we could move to a 15-minute frequency with a through platform at Cork station and a Mallow-Cobh-Midleton commuter service that would be high-frequency, high-capacity and, over time, electrified.  That is what we meant by that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Henry Kingston" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#F00500"><p>The question concerned the efforts to streamline the processes related to plans which are supported in the national development plan and bringing them to fruition successfully.  In our case, we are currently building an &euro;80 million container terminal in Ringaskiddy and also looking to develop the Marino Point port facility, which was previously a fertiliser plant, and to regenerate it back into an active port which would be reconnected.  The current freight links, road and rail, to both these terminals are substandard.  There is the idea of an interagency approach to strategise on ports location and redevelopment for the activities many of our port colleagues have mentioned, including future wind development, offshore wind, etc., and their very laudable green benefits in the future.  This needs a more streamlined approach at a national and strategic level in order that when the ports are being built and delivered and facilities are being delivered, they are already connected and we do not have to wait subsequently for road connectivity to realise the full capacity of our port infrastructure, which has cost us not only a significant amount of cash but also significant effort to get through the planning processes.  That was what I was referring to.</p></speech>

I want to know what element of cross-Border planning has gone into Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's submission.  I am particularly interested to know what the plans are for the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service.  Some of the questions I have relate to cost and the need for greater frequency.  I want to know about the planning regarding cross-Border services and the possibility of having the speedier rail links we are talking about designing in the future.</p> <p>  We are now all into remote working and, therefore, even long-term commuters will be looking at the possibility of commuting two or three times per week.  I believe they should still be able to avail of commuter-based pricing, be it for one month or six months, taking into account that they might be travelling only two or three days per week.  Have the witnesses had any interaction on that possibility?</p></speech>

I am happy to report that there was a lot of close and detailed collaboration between us in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink, which operates the services north of the Border.  We have a group working between the two companies looking at enhancing the Enterprise service.  We are working on plans to move to an hourly service and we have been talking to the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB.  It has a funding pot and we have put to it a proposal as to how we would replace the Enterprise fleet and enhance the service.  It currently consists of four trains delivering nine services a day.  We are putting a plan to the SEUPB for a fleet of nine trains and proposing that the SEUPB fund it, which it is very interested in doing.  It is still at the planning stage, but we expect the SEUPB to assist us with that funding in order to move to an hourly service along with the Weavers Cross development on Great Victoria Street in Belfast where a new transport hub will be delivered in 2024 or 2025.  I am subject to correction on the date.  We hope to deliver a complete new fleet in conjunction with Translink, probably in 2026 or 2027, to go to a full hourly service with reduced journey times.  Our infrastructure south of the Border is in reasonably good shape.  It is reasonably well maintained.  The biggest issue for us is the level of congestion from Malahide into the city centre, with the ten-minute DART service as well, and finding slots to get services in.  It slows it up a little, but we are also advanced with planning on that and starting to look at how we will improve it.</p> <p>  The pricing structure is very much an issue for the NTA, but we are looking at the issue with the NTA.  We are already talking to it and discussions are ongoing about what the post-Covid travel patterns will be and what the pricing structure of tickets will be, moving away from the traditional monthly and annual tickets that were used heretofore.  It is a work in progress between us and the NTA.</p></speech>

If any of those details, particularly on the Enterprise service, could be passed on to the committee, I would really appreciate it.</p> <p>  The next issue falls between Mr. Dunne and Mr. Carr.  We are all dealing with Brexit and its outworkings.  We welcome the direct ferries to the Continent.  Does anything need to be done from the point of view of the State?  We have all dealt with Revenue, the Department of Transport, hauliers, etc., and there was a huge number of issues with systems and communications.  Have some of those been sorted?  I am talking about anything that would deal with services across the land bridge or directly.  Even though we have a reduced amount of transport across the land bridge, I assume both Mr. Dunne and Mr. Carr are still involved.  If I could get those questions answered, I would really appreciate it.</p></speech>

Our continental freight, as I said earlier, is up 446%; our UK freight is down 49%.  There are significant problems which are slowly being addressed, particularly in exports from the UK into Ireland.  However, a lot of those challenges will form the new world we are in now, and people are working to put systems in place to address that.  From our point of view, obviously, it is important we maintain those services with the UK because they will be an important part of our business going forward.  At the same time, however, it needs to be recognised that there has been a fundamental change in aspects of the supply chain in Ireland, particularly directly with Europe.  As a port, we have a lot of support regarding our border inspection facility.  We are lucky in Rosslare.  That has temporarily been built outside of the port, where all State agencies are on the one site together.  From the perspective of a customer using that facility, it is working very well for anybody coming from the UK into Ireland.  It means that customers go to one site and all the agencies are on that one site.  As part of our master plan, we are incorporating the longer term Border inspection facility inside the port and working closely with the State agencies and the Office of Public Works on that.  Very important for us is the road network and its continued improvement.  We have already seen the benefits of the Oilgate bypass.  Any road connectivity improvement makes Rosslare more attractive and helps relieve pressures in Dublin, which, we should not forget, were there before Covid.  We are delighted with the performance of the first month.  Despite all the additional traffic, we have managed to ensure that 98% of ships have left the port on time.  We have also started our master plan for the port, amounting to &euro;35 million.</p><p>That will bring other benefits for the roll-on-roll-off traffic in terms of space and availability.  I would say that things are working well at the moment from a port perspective.  That said, I am mindful that we are not seeing two very important aspects of our business to the full potential, one being passengers.  Normally, we would have approximately 800,000 passengers going through the port.  We obviously are not seeing that at the moment and probably will not see that for the remainder of this year given the restrictions.  The UK traffic is also down 49%.  The unknown at this point, and it will take another couple of months for this to work through, is how much of that traffic may migrate back to the land bridge or how many companies will revert to trading with some of their UK suppliers.  We should also bear in mind that the UK starts some of its introductions of customs from 1 April.  Its commitment is the full implementation of its systems from 1 July.  We can, therefore, expect to see additional problems, mainly, again, on the UK side.  My experience has been that UK industry has been poorly prepared for Brexit.  While there have been some teething problems with some of the systems on our side, I believe one would find the bulk of the problems are very much on the British side.</p></speech>

We operate a fleet of 160 trailers on the Ireland-UK routes.  The key to being competitive is to be able to deliver and reload and combine one's collections and deliveries.  This is proving challenging without the UK engaging.  It currently is in a kind of light-touch way.  Therefore, the only thing I can add is that the consequences to costs will definitely increase.</p></speech>

I wish to put a few points to Mr. Meade.  As I was in an earlier meeting, I missed a share of what he had to say although I have read his statement.  I apologise; as there are two other County Clare representatives present, I may ask repetitive questions.  Mr. Meade might bear with me.</p> <p>  I wish to make a few points.  First, I have a general comment relating to pricing.  I believe pricing of rail tickets continues to be one of the major barriers to people using the service.  If I was to take a return train today from Ennis to get to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann via Heuston Station, it would cost me &euro;74 return.  It costs me approximately &euro;19 one way on diesel to get there in the car.  It is obviously not all in Mr. Meade's gift but I believe the pricing in the future will continue to be an inhibitor to people using rail services and ditching the car to take the train.  Perhaps he might comment on that.</p> <p>  At county level, I wish to query and raise a few things with Mr. Meade as concerns, hopes and aspirations.  One is the idea of a Shannon rail spur.  I am my party's spokesperson on aviation.  We see a real bright future for Shannon, hopefully when Covid-19 passes, and it will.  It helps to have an expansionary view for Shannon Airport.  There has long been a corridor of protected land in south-east Clare, giving a rail spur from that Limerick to Ennis train line right into Shannon Airport.  Landowners along the line bemoan the fact that it has not progressed for years and yet the land is frozen.  I seek Mr. Meade's views on how he thinks that could progress.  Is it necessary?  Does Irish Rail see it as priority going forward in the national development plan?</p> <p>  On the issue of the western rail corridor, many of us were devastated to see the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report more or less rubbishing the idea of an extension of rail services along the west of Ireland.  I believe there is still some chance to breathe new life into that.  There are certainly communities in the west of Ireland but in particular, communities like Crusheen, County Clare, which have long awaited that upward connectivity along the west of Ireland giving them a decent service.  Mr. Meade might comment on Crusheen and plans for a station there.  It is something for which people there have long campaigned.</p> <p>  The other issue is the Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS, study looking at the transport needs and functions of Limerick city.  I made a submission some months ago suggesting that a park-and-ride facility could be developed in the Parteen-Moyross-Thomondgate area in proximity to Thomond Park because the new northern distributor road will be put in place there.  It is proximate to the city and third level campuses and a wonderful road network.  Irish Rail's railway line passes through there.  I believe it makes sense that there would be some kind of park-and-ride or rail-and-ride network there.  I would like to hear Mr. Meade's views on that.</p> <p>  I will make two final points to which Mr. Meade should come back with a contribution.  In terms of stations, I believe the Limerick to Ennis rail line has a number of densely populated communities.  I am from one such community, namely, Meelick.  Cratloe and Sixmilebridge are located above me and Parteen is on the approaches to Limerick city.  As recent censuses have identified, they are highly populated and there is potential there for new park-and-rail facilities as things go on and perhaps even new stations.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Meade believe greenways and the rush to develop them are somewhat in contradiction to the priorities of Irish Rail?  Finally, there is a well-publicised illegal encampment at the Irish Rail station in Sixmilebridge at present.  As the tenants and lessees of the car park, I ask Irish Rail to engage with the authorities in order that this functional car park and the essential facility it provides to that community can be restored in the quickest possible time.</p></speech>

The closer it comes to the time to walk up and go on a train, it costs more, the same as the airline industry pre-Covid.  However, prebooking online is very efficient for tickets.  The pricing structure is set by the NTA but we offer very competitive prices when a person books in advance and online for his or her tickets.  If a person arrives half an hour before the train departure time to buy a ticket, it is more expensive.  The structure on pricing is to encourage prebooking in order that we know our load demands well in advance.</p> <p>  Regarding the Shannon rail spur, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann did an exercise in 2007, to which we referred earlier.  It is part of the process under the LSMATS currently.  We have made a fairly detailed submission to the NTA on what we see as viable options under that consultation process, which is currently under way.</p> <p>  Certainly, the report that EY delivered, which I mentioned earlier as regards the WRC and which was discussed and reviewed by JASPERS, dealt with the terms of reference under which that report was delivered.  We also noted that the Minister has proposed an all-Ireland strategic rail review.  In that context, there may be a second review looking at the western rail corridor in the all-Ireland context to see if there is a viable option for it at that point.</p> <p>  Crusheen station is part of the responsibility of the transport strategy of Clare County Council as the local authority.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would, however, support the development of a station there once the business plan from the county requires it.  The funding is in place.  We would be happy to build it should that happen.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's comments around Thomondgate and Moyross, part of what we have proposed in our submission to the LSMATS is for stations there, perhaps at the parkway at Moyross or park-and -rides, as the Deputy outlined, on the new ring road or outside it, somewhere like Cratloe, where one could have a park-and-ride and increased frequency then on that line.  It would, therefore, create a commuter line around Limerick, which is part of the overall ambitions of the Minister and of Limerick as a whole.</p> <p>  Broadly, we support greenways.  Anywhere we have disused lines or where there are no short-term plans to have a live railway on it, we work with the relevant local authorities and we will give them licence to use our lands for a greenway.  It is built into every greenway agreement we make that if there is a requirement for transport or to put rail back on it, we can take back the right of way again.</p><p>We can put public transport back on that right of way but support them in the main.</p><p> On the issue of the car park at Sixmilebridge, I remind the Deputy that we do not own or lease that car park.  It is a county council car park so it has almost nothing to do with us.  I am aware the county council is dealing with it.  We have been in contact with it and with the local garda&iacute; from a safety perspective in terms of having people and young children so close to the line but it is an issue for the county council.  We neither have ownership of nor licence for the area.</p></speech>

I want to put a few questions to Mr. Meade.  He will recall the body of work the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, which I chaired, did regarding the flooding issue at Ballycar, on the Ennis to Limerick line.  A report has been finalised, which brought together all the stakeholders - Clare County Council, Irish Rail, the Office of Public Works, OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service - and including others also.  When was that report submitted to the Department of Transport?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in his understanding of it.  The report makes a recommendation on the best course of action and has costed it out.  I believe it is with the Department since late last year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#H00600"><p>Yes.  For those who do not know Ballycar, it is a big turlough.  It is a cast limestone area with one underground stream outlet from it.  It is no different from the bath at home.  If one fills it one third of the way and pulls the plug, the water is gone in a minute but if one fills it to the top it takes five minutes.  That is what happens with Ballycar.  When we have a particularly prolonged wet winter, and I do not mean a couple of storms, it fills slowly and eventually floods the railway line.  The railway line is probably 2 m above where it was historically so we have been raising the line to the maximum we could do over the years but Ballycar literally gets bigger and bigger as we see the effects of climate change.</p> <p>  On the preferred proposal, various options and solutions were looked at, including raising the line even further, but it was felt that if we do not do something to allow Ballycar drain naturally the water levels would eventually catch up with whatever we do so we are looking for a permanent solution.  Ultimately, it is about cutting out a channel from Ballycar, through the back of Newmarket-on-Fergus, out the back of Lough Gash and out onto the estuary.  That will be through some existing waterways but we are making them significantly bigger.  That would allow Ballycar to fill to a point.  It would take a lot of the rainwater but then when it comes to a particular point it overflows out into the estuary.  At a very basic level, that is the preferred option.  It would ensure that no matter how bad a winter we get we will not have the ten and 15 week closures we have seen in the past.</p></speech>

More than 1.4 million people used the Limerick to Ennis line in 2019.  Would it be safe to assume that it is a priority of Irish Rail to make a recommendation that it should be prioritised?</p></speech>

We do not want the line being closed for extended periods at what is almost a two or three year frequency now but the solution does not lie in Irish Rail's hands.  We do not have any authority to go beyond our own footprint.  That is the reason we involved Clare County Council, the OPW, etc.  While we led the project we got RPS Group to do the review.  We have managed the process and in agreement with all stakeholders we have come up with the most viable solution.  Once funding is put in place the delivery of that solution will not be in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's hands.</p></speech>

We have had contact with previous CEOs in the past when it was a live option.  The Deputy may know some of the history but at the time we were looking for funding, before the financial crash came a decade ago, to put in a station at Crusheen.  It is outside the remit of the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS.  It does not go that far north.  As I said earlier, essentially it would be a requirement for the county development plan and the council's transport policy across the county.  It is the authority for the policy so once it builds it in and we get the funding, we will build it.</p></speech>

In the original one that was done in 2007 it was to go all the way to the airport via the town centre and the industrial estate.  It was to run through the side of both of them.  If this project was to become a live project it would make perfect sense but the study has to be done.  The Department has said that as part of the LSMATS a study or review of that original study will be done.  The decision will be made on the findings of that but the Deputy's comment is a valid one.

I acknowledge Mr. Meade's contribution in which he thanked the staff of the railways for keeping the service going and providing vital travel services to people who needed to get to work through a pandemic.</p> <p>  I refer to regional rail.  Representatives of the National Transport Authority, NTA, were before the committee last week.  They said that they do not deal with regional rail or suburban rail in the regional cities.  Does Mr. Meade believe that an NTA heavy rail division would be beneficial in the development of good regional rail services in terms of interconnectivity between the regions but also the suburban service within regions such as Cork or Limerick?</p></speech>

In fairness to the NTA, we work closely with it.  There is a very close and strong working relationship with the NTA.  While it does not have the authority, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it does work with us on some of these projects and, where possible, it helps.  Some of that activity happens in more of an informal way for the funding but the Deputy's point is valid.  If the NTA had more authority and responsibility in that area we may get a more unified approach to inter region and commuter rail in the regional cities.</p></speech>

We know the contribution road traffic is making to emissions.  With respect to a &euro;200 million potential investment in Rosslare Europort, and this is a question for Mr. Dunne also, is there an opportunity for Rosslare Europort to operate rail freight with lift-on, lift-off operations?  Is that type of investment possible?  There is connectivity to Belfast on the Rosslare line and connectivity, via Rosslare Strand and Waterford, to the western rail line.  Alternatively, does the proximity of Belview Port make that impractical?</p></speech>

To maximise the potential for rail freight, a connection with key ports is required.  Rosslare Europort is a roll-on, roll-off port.  We see opportunities for offshore wind development.  That would address potential lift-on, lift-off opportunities at the port.  However, the challenge is with respect to the rail infrastructure that would be required to justify taking freight to and from Rosslare Europort as against developing an alternative in Waterford for the south east, which would provide an opportunity there.  The other port with connectivity is Dublin.  There are challenges there.  We should also note the Waterford to Rosslare line is not currently operational.  There is a single line from Rosslare Europort out towards Dublin.  In addition, it would bring freight traffic out on to one of the busiest, if not the busiest, commuter networks in the system.  A number of challenges would need to be examined with respect to rail freight being linked into the port as against, from a south east regional perspective, developing Rosslare Europort for further roll-on, roll-off operations that would alleviate some of the pressures in Dublin and as the offshore wind hub for the country, which would bring many national and regional benefits, and also developing the Port of Waterford to play a greater role in rail freight.</p></speech>

That would, therefore, be a quick win.  The Deputy will have heard the chief executive officer of the Port of Waterford, Mr. Frank Ronan, talk about the additional capacity that is available today to take more twenty-foot equivalent units, TEUs, which are lift-on, lift-off containers.  From the charter party&rsquo;s perspective, which we are, we would be ready to roll pretty much straight away, notwithstanding my comments with regard to track access fees.</p></speech>

The DART+ programme is an ambitious electrification proposal.  We are quite far behind most other European countries with regard to our ambitions to electrify.  Does Mr. Meade see opportunities for electrification in the regions, for example, in Limerick or Cork, or further expansion of the DART+ programme for electrification  Given the cost of electrification per kilometre, it would bring many benefits for the environment with respect to speeds, capacity and a reduction in emissions as against new road building.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#J01100"><p>Absolutely.  Electrification is very much a part of our future from a heavy rail perspective.  We can make significant inroads in the reduction of our current carbon footprint.  Heavy rail has done very well in reducing its carbon footprint historically.  We achieved the 2020 Kyoto targets, which were set in 2005, in 2016 with a growing network.  We had been improving services dramatically but on foot of many of the initiatives we took, we hit the targets in advance.  We are doing a lot of work on the carbon footprint and sustainability front across the business to achieve that.  Certainly, the Department of Transport study will consider electrification in the regional cities.  If a decision was made to put commuter rail into the regional cities, there is a case to be made for seriously considering electrifying them.  At a minimum, one would examine battery electric with some limited charging or electrification.  The line between battery electric or going for full electrification is defined by frequency.  As one gets to a higher level of frequency, full electrification outweighs the benefits of batteries and charging stations.  Electrification should be and, I think, will be part of our future.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their detailed opening statements, which were very interesting.  I will direct my questions to Mr. Meade, although the other witnesses may also respond as they cut across a number of the ports.  If there is anything the witnesses would like to add to their previous responses, I would appreciate them doing so.  With respect to plans to develop commuter potential on the Limerick to Ballybrophy line and developing the line through Castleconnell, Birdhill and Nenagh as part of the commuter belt for Limerick, does Mr. Meade have anything he would like to add in that respect?  He mentioned that this would require a substantial upgrade.  What does that mean in euro and cents or is there any other information he would like to add on that?</p> <p>  Has Irish Rail reviewed the business case for reopening services on the Rosslare-Waterford railway line, as submitted by South East on Track?  What is the company&rsquo;s intention regarding the Rosslare-Waterford railway line on developing freight traffic arising from the recent changes in freight flow patterns?  </p> <p>  Unfortunately, anti-social behaviour and crime occurs regularly on the Dublin commuter lines.  What impact is it having and what measures are in place to tackle it?  What communications are there with the Garda?  Has consideration been given to having a transport police service or any such provision?</p></speech>

We all know the history of the Ballybrophy line.  It did not get much investment during the lean years - for the past 20 years.  The line needs significant upgrading to bring it up to the standard of any of our main lines such as the Galway, Waterford or Westport-Galway lines.  Several level crossings need to be upgraded and several signalling issues need to be dealt with.  While it is safe to operate trains on the track infrastructure, speeds on it cannot be increased until there is significant investment in the line.  I would be slow to put numbers on the cost of upgrading it today but it would involve serious numbers, tens of millions of euro, to do the 53 miles of track on the line.  I do not have a costing with me but I would be happy to get a detailed costing for the Deputy and pass it on to him in due course.  That is the first step that would be required if we wanted to put high frequency on the line.</p> <p>  On the Rosslare issue and a line to the south east, as my colleague said earlier, we do not see a major opportunity for freight out of Rosslare because it is a roll-on, roll-off port.  As part of the study we are doing, we see the opportunity for having the Port of Cork at Marino Point, the Port of Waterford, as previously mentioned, and, in the long term, Shannon Foynes, as a tier one port, connected to rail with freight traffic moving to them.  This will become part of the overall study the Department is doing, taking account of what is the best value for money in investing in these various facilities.  The biggest one to invest in would be Shannon Foynes because it is relatively easy to reconnect at Marino Point, as we passed by it today, and it was formerly rail connected.  As we said, the Port of Waterford is currently rail connected.</p><p>It is about generating capacity to feed into those ports and attracting customers back to the network.  The biggest challenge for us will be generating more traffic through working with partners such as IWT and developing new partnerships across the board with a view to migrating to rail freight.  That will include the way in which the Government may want to incentivise companies to move to rail, as opposed to road.</p></speech>

Sadly, it is a reflection of society and what it has evolved into.  In the past year, under Covid, it has been more apparent because those concerned are not able to hide in the crowd, so to speak.  It is an ongoing issue for us.  We have very close ties with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We brought on board a chief security officer, an ex-Garda superintendent, about a year and a half ago to examine this.  The officer understands the business and what we need to do.  It is an ongoing battle; I am not going to say otherwise.  It is about people's perception of safety as much as a high risk to staff and customers on our services.  We spend a lot of money annually on security.  Expenditure has doubled in the past couple of years.  We will continue to spend on security and to invest where it is deemed necessary to deal with antisocial behaviour but there is no quick win or panacea.  It continues to be an ongoing issue for all public transport providers.</p></speech>

I congratulate the port of Rosslare, particularly on its excellent work on Brexit, and I also congratulate Irish Rail, including Mr. Meade, on its continuing activities.  I have some questions for both Mr. Frank Ronan and Mr. Meade.</p> <p>  Can Mr. Ronan identify the unique selling points that Waterford port has to offer?  How would a rail freight extension, that is, a rail corridor that allows for Waterford-Ballina connectivity, assist port development and enhance importation and exportation opportunities?  Might Mr. Ronan also highlight how Waterford port can facilitate offshore wind installation considering the port has been active regarding onshore wind energy installations already?</p> <p>  Could Mr. Meade comment on the tourism potential of the Waterford&ndash;Rosslare rail line, which is already connected but currently redundant?  Could he give a strong opinion on the development of rail freight services from Waterford to Ballina?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ronan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#K00700"><p>On the unique selling points in Waterford, it might be worth reminding ourselves for a second that the Port of Waterford has a throughput worth &euro;2 billion per year.  It supports between 900 and 1,000 jobs in the port zone.  There is &euro;100 million invested in the port's facilities and the adjoining partner facilities.  There is a very serious business handling a serious amount of bulk and freight cargo.  The lift-on and lift-off freight cargo we handle is particularly well aligned and associated with the rail, which is why we are making such a push about rail freight and why it is important to keep the conversation going.</p> <p>  With regard to our free capacity on the freight line, given our direct connections to Rotterdam we could actually take all the 50,000 freight units going to Rosslare, which Mr. Carr spoke about, and do so on a lift-on, lift-off basis.  We do not expect to see that happening in the next six months but we do expect to see some transfer, rebalancing or remodalisation of some of the flows.  On the unique selling points, we are actually available to do what I suggest now.  We are waiting to see a freight train coming in, whether it is from Mr. Dunne or some of his colleagues or competitors, in order to start the service and start taking carbon out of the system.  Rather than having a discussion about it, we believe it is something that can actually happen.  We would like to see it happen sooner rather than later.  Again, our profile in the south east is inclined to be a little low.  The port is there, however, and it is doing an important job.  It will become more important.  Dublin will recognise, as it fills up, that capacity in Belview is as important as is capacity in Rosslare.</p> <p>  On offshore wind developments, we would like to be supportive of the Rosslare picture.  As matters stand, the Waterford and Rosslare offerings are highly complementary.  There is no conflict in terms of the business we do.  We see the world in the same way in terms of rail freight and so on.  Maintaining the complementarity would be really useful, and we would like to support that.  We envisage Port of Waterford offering not the main drag services on the offshore side but assistance with the many necessary elements that go with the business, including cable laying, foundation laying and supporting the support ships.  There will be a lot of business as offshore and renewable energy developments come down the east coast and around the south coast.  Mr. Kingston and the others in Cork are waiting to welcome it with open arms as it comes down into the Celtic Sea and goes around the west coast.  This is not about one port; it is about the taxpayers' investment in ports and ports operating sensibly and strategically together to drive value and not kill it in any place.  I am trying to be a little holistic in my response.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that.  I hope I have left a little time for Mr. Meade in which to answer.</p></speech>

Having grown up in west Clare, I have seen the benefits of the Wild Atlantic Way in recent years.  Any facility that adds significantly to tourism will always be of benefit.  As to whether we would reopen the line for tourism, I am aware there is a proposal from the local authorities to put a greenway on it.  As I stated in an earlier contribution, we will support greenways where appropriate, with the caveat that if we need the infrastructure for public transport in the future, we can take it back.  The sugar beet industry was the anchor tenant of the line historically.  It went into care and maintenance shortly after the sugar beet industry left.  If there were an anchor tenant which needed the line reopened or something very viable, we would consider the matter.  If the greenway is the best way to go and it is deemed appropriate, we will support that under licence with the caveat that we can take it back for public transport use should it be needed.</p></speech>

I will be quick because many of the areas have been covered.</p> <p>  I am incredibly disappointed by Mr. Meade's presentation in respect of rail plans and services.  In the national context and the context of the west, there was a perfunctory mention of the Athenry-Galway double line, and that was all.  That is just not good enough considering that the region gives a lot in terms of freight and passenger numbers.  We surely deserve much more consideration than that.</p> <p>  What are Mr Meade's thoughts on the IWT proposal?  The ambition of IWT is what we need from Irish Rail, particularly in terms of connecting Ballina and Mayo to Waterford and Foynes.  I have been listening to the discussion on wind energy developments off Rosslare and Waterford.  I share the views of Mr. Ronan in this regard in that I am aware that Foynes has an equal ambition to be a centre for offshore energy.  Given that the west will be home to much of this, it would make sense to have a combination of ports, with Foynes being part of it.  How does Irish Rail propose to connect Foynes to the rail network?  Mr. Meade said he wants to do it.  What are his views on the IWT proposal?  IWT has shown what can be done from Ballina and what can be done by working with the good team Irish Rail has in Ballina.</p> <p>  My second question is on the EY report, which has been referred to a lot today.  Who commissioned it?  Was it Irish Rail or the Department of Transport?  What was the final cost of the report?</p><p>As he knows, it will be discussed again and there are many concerns about that particular report, about how it arrived at its conclusions and about the data used, but that is for another day.  I want to know who commissioned it and who paid for it, and what level of engagement there was between Irish Rail management and EY in the preparation of the report.</p><p> What is Irish Rail&rsquo;s policy on greenways?  Does it give up disused lines to them relatively easily or does it have a plan for lines that may not currently be used?  To use the phrase Mr. Meade has just used, if a heavy user or an anchor tenant was to come looking for them, would they be available?  What if someone comes looking for a greenway to be put on that line before the anchor tenant?  Has Irish Rail not just given up an asset without giving it much consideration?</p></speech>

On the International Warehousing and Transport plan, we work closely with IWT and have worked with it in the past, so I think we are part of that plan and we will continue to work with IWT.  We have ambitious proposals for freight.  In-house, within Irish Rail, we have recently commissioned a study around freight to understand how we can grow that freight service and get back into it.  Currently, freight services cannot be subvented by the State and they must wash their own face, and that is one of the considerations we are looking at.  We have ambitious proposals.  We are putting those proposals on the table and briefing the Department on them.  As part of the overall strategy, we are looking at reconnecting Foynes Port, and that is part of the overall freight strategy.  To be fair to the Department, this is also part of its long-term review.</p> <p>  As regards the western rail corridor, subject to the terms of reference detailed with the Department of Transport, we commissioned EY to undertake that study of the western rail corridor.  EY then went about its business and it referred back to us if it needed detail.  However, it was commissioned to do an independent report and it was allowed to do an independent report.  That report was subsequently reviewed by Jasper Consulting and, as we know, neither the review nor the report supported the extension of the western rail corridor based on the terms of reference that were set out at the time.</p></speech>

I can establish that accurately for the committee but it is of the order of &euro;250,000 to &euro;300,000.</p> <p>  We always support greenways, although there is a caveat on any greenway licence we currently have out there.  I remind the Deputy we do not set the requirements for public transport.  That is the remit of the Department.  We operate the existing rail service and while we support greenways and come up with some of the ideas, and we also have the expertise in the industry, it is ultimately a decision for the Government and Department if they want to extend, expand or put in new rail services.  The greenway is a win-win for both because it keeps the asset in State ownership and utilised, and if there is a decision at some point in the future that the asset needs to go back into a public transport mode, the licensing arrangement is such that it can do so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-02-16a.1316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Meade" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021021600002#L01200"><p>We currently do not see a business model there.  There is not a requirement today.  My colleague, Mr. Carr, referenced that the infrastructure cost of making Rosslare a rail freight port would be prohibitive, with Waterford not far away and Cork, which can also be rail connected, not much further away along the coast.  There is not a business case there today for Rosslare.</p> <p>  My point on the anchor tenant was that, when it was in operation, there was an anchor tenant in the sugar beet activity at Wellingtonbridge and there was three to four months of very intensive work there every year, bringing sugar beet to Wellingtonbridge while it was operational.</p></speech>

It is not new to us.  Of course, our ambition is to work with Irish Rail to open up this new route and get it going.  From our side, we are ready to go and it is just a matter of trying to put the various elements in place to get going.  Let us remember that 11 years ago, we started with two trains per week and we now have a daily train.  It is still a very substantial amount of freight that is taken off the road and a substantial amount of carbon dioxide savings today.  It is the only inland port in our country and it is of very significant importance to the west, I believe, and also to our international customers.  For a very significant amount of the cargo we move on the rail line, the decision-makers are not on this island but are scattered around the world.</p></speech>

First, I want to thank everyone for keeping services going during this pandemic, in particular all the staff involved.  I have a few areas I want to touch on with Mr. Meade.  First, Mr. Meade attended a public meeting on the Limerick Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS.  Irish Rail has made a submission to the NTA about developing the rail network around Limerick.  The NTA was before us last week and it is going to do a further process of public consultation, which will now include use of the existing rail network around the city.  How long does Mr. Meade believe it will take before that project commences?  What is the likely cost?  How long will it take to put in place?  What route will it take around the city?  Mr. Meade gave some information but perhaps he could be a bit more comprehensive.</p> <p>  Second, on the M20 route, once again, there was a public consultation on the M20 and we were looking at the upgrade of the link between Limerick Junction and Limerick city, where Irish Rail is putting double tracking at various locations.  When does Mr. Meade expect that project to go forward?  Where is it at in terms of planning and design?  What is the likely cost of such a project? </p> <p>  With regard to the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line, we have had quite a lot of correspondence from the North Tipperary Community Rail Partnership and I know Mr. Meade has had dealings with it.  The partnership has looked at the new Irish Rail strategy for 2020 to 2027, and it has concerns that, on the map on page 34, there is no development of service between Nenagh and Ballybrophy, servicing Cloughjordan and Roscrea, but only towards Limerick.  Mr. Meade has dealt with this.  What are Irish Rail's plans in respect of that line?</p> <p>  On another issue that is being brought to our attention, is there a sufficient number of train drivers in the employment of Irish Rail to ensure the company can expand services?  This issue is coming up with some groups.</p> <p>  I have a more straightforward question, and Mr. Meade&rsquo;s colleague, Barry Kenny, will be very familiar with this as I have raised it with him over many years.  I use the Limerick to Dublin rail line frequently.</p><p>I had severe problems with the broadband coverage but it has improved significantly.  The mobile coverage of late is good but it was dreadful.  Has Irish Rail put work into it?  I believe that if one puts the services in place with proper broadband and mobile coverage, people will use rail more frequently for business, normal day-to-day and leisure purposes.</p></speech>

The network line comprises the existing Ennis line which goes towards University of Limerick and swings out over the Shannon Bridge, via Moyross and Limerick Institute of Technology.  That line is in service.</p> <p>  On the other side of the city, we have a line that used to go to Foynes but it is not being used.  Off that, there is a line which goes down to Castlemungret, the old cement factory, that runs by a major shipping centre, some large residential areas and is within walking distance of the University Hospital Limerick.  This is strategically placed to be of great benefit to the local communities and local industries.</p></speech>

I have used the term before that describes it as a horseshoe around the city.  Then one has the line out to Limerick Junction.</p> <p>  The cost is being worked up.  There is a high-level cost to bringing all of this back into full passenger use.  Those costs can be spread over time.  Between the fleet, putting stations on these lines and reopening the final lines, the cost could be in the order of &euro;120 million.</p></speech>

As that is not a completely new redesign, we believe we would not need planning for it.  It is about reinstating the existing live line.  It is within our own footprint.

Our strategy, however, to 2027 was aligned with the original national development plan. It was how Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was going to deliver what was in it.  The national development plan is a subset of the national planning framework.  The first phase of it was Dublin-centric, meaning there was not much spend in the regions in the initial plan.  That is why our strategy to align with that plan does not have much.  However, matters have moved on.  We are revisiting the national development plan.  The current Administration is focused on the regional cities and asking us what we can do for them.  We believe that funding will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

Is Irish Rail including the rail spur to Shannon Airport in that costing?</p></speech>

I feel strongly about this but it is probably a housekeeping issue.   I am a passionate believer in rail travel.  I use it every single week.  For me, it is the nicest and best form of travel.  However, it is difficult to function if mobile coverage is poor.  It appears to be good at the moment but that is probably due to the fact that are fewer passengers on the train due to Covid.  Is Irish Rail looking into this?</p></speech>

If one goes through a patch where the cellular network is poor, whether one is in a car, train, bus or bike, one will still have poor coverage.  There is not much we can do about that.  We talk to providers and ask them to improve coverage along the rail network because of the levels of customers they would have travelling on the network.  It is an ongoing issue with us.  The improvement in Wi-Fi is a by-product of investment, in conjunction with the National Transport Authority, that we put in last year.  Our customer base is telling us that Wi-Fi coverage is quite good.</p> <p>  If I may come back to another issue, there is no issue with train drivers.  We have sufficient drivers and a constant training programme which we have maintained even through Covid.  We are constantly replenishing.  We are looking ahead at what the demand curve will be and training and providing drivers for that.</p></speech>
