    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Lucas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019102300002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me to make this presentation on behalf of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I shall first give the committee a little background to the policy framework on peatlands and then I will speak about the national peatlands strategy and peatlands restoration.</p> <p>  Peatlands cover approximately 20% of the State's land area and their use has implications across a wide spectrum of public policy.  Ireland's peatlands, occurring as raised bogs, blankets bogs or fens are unique on a national and global scale.  Ireland recognised the importance of these peatlands and took steps to protect these sites through designation as special areas of conservation, SACs, and natural heritage areas, NHAs.</p> <p>  The national peatlands strategy has run since 2015 and has as its vision statement "to provide a long-term framework within which all of the peatlands within the State can be managed responsibly in order to optimise their social, environmental and economic contribution to the well-being of this and future generations".</p> <p>  The strategy sets out a cross-governmental approach to managing issues that relate to peatlands, including compliance with national and EU environmental law, climate change, forestry, flood control, energy, nature conservation, planning and agriculture.  It is underlined by 25 key principles and commits to the undertaking of 32 actions across various sectors and themes, including research, tourism, agriculture, forestry, conservation, restoration, peat extraction, energy, water quality and climate change.</p> <p>  The strategy has a timeframe of ten years and will be subject to a mid-cycle review in 2020.  The publication of the first progress report on the implementation of the national peatlands strategy was approved by the Government and the report was published last year.  Work on the second progress report is ongoing with a view to publication by the end of this year or early in 2020</p> <p> As I have said, there are 32 actions in the strategy and I will give a flavour of progress on some of the actions.  Among the progress to be reported is action No. 3 where the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's European innovation partnerships, ElPs, programme has awarded a total of &euro;59 million to 24 projects.  Many of these are within Natura 2000 areas such as the hen harrier project and the pearl mussel project.</p> <p>  Action No. 5 is a key issues paper for public consultation on a review of the use of peat in the horticultural industry that has recently been published.  Submissions are invited on the key issues paper during the three month period closing on 20 January 2020.  A copy of the paper has been sent to the Chairman of this committee and that of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>  Action No. 8 is Bord na M&oacute;na's announcement that all Bord na M&oacute;na lands used for peat production will be rehabilitated in the long term in accordance with draft plans supplied to the Environmental Protection Agency.  It also recently announced an accelerated exit strategy for peat production and its intention for an enhanced rehabilitation programme.</p> <p>  With regard to action No. 13, currently two eddy covariance towers have been established in the midlands on peatland sites with a further tower to be installed next year as part of the accelerated bog restoration programme.  These flux towers are used as a tool for evaluating net CO2 or other gases exchange from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere.</p> <p>  With action No. 14 the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to jointly fund a two-year research project titled: "The vulnerability of peatland ecosystems to a changing climate and increases in the frequency and severity of droughts."  The project is scheduled to begin next year.</p> <p>  For action No. 27, in July 2019, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, approved grant funding of just under &euro;131,000 under the peatlands community engagement scheme, to 13 local community groups and organisations, with &euro;16,245 in pre-funding to be provided to seven of these groups as start-up funding.</p> <p>  I shall conclude by referring to the Irish and international experience of wetland restoration.  As recognised in the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019, restored peatlands are important carbon sinks, absorbing and storing large amounts of carbon as well as supporting improved biodiversity across Ireland.  In December 2017, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht published the National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022.  The management plan sets out how the raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  This restoration programme links with the peatland actions contained in the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 and actions contained in the national peatlands strategy.</p> <p>  In budget 2020, &euro;5 million has been allocated to embark on an accelerated programme of peatland restoration.  With the injection of this funding, it is intended to restore over 1,800 ha of protected raised bog in the next year.  Work on the restoration programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project - the living bog - which is funded under the EU LIFE 2014 - 2020 programme.  The Department, including the LIFE project team, has worked with international peatland experts to further hone its expertise in raised bog restoration  In tandem with the LIFE project, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department is undertaking restoration works on State-owned lands within the designated raised bog network.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting the Department to make this presentation and I am willing to answer any questions that members may have for the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019102300002#D00400"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators, ladies and gentlemen.  Peatlands are unique ecosystems in the context of the global carbon cycle.  This is because in addition to being home to rare biodiversity, peatlands are the largest and most concentrated global store of carbon of all terrestrial ecosystems, containing twice the carbon of the forest biomass.  The accumulation of vast quantities of carbon occurred over many thousands of years is thanks to the permanently waterlogged conditions that prevent the complete decomposition of organic matter.  In Ireland, peat soils are the largest carbon store containing an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon.  Total global carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from degraded peatlands currently amount to a third of the total emissions from the land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector and is equivalent to 5% of the total global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  In Ireland, peatland drainage for either domestic turf cutting, energy, horticulture, agriculture and forestry releases carbon that under normal conditions would have remained in storage within the peatlands.  Burning peat is a source of air pollution and drained cut bogs no longer function as a refuge for rare species nor as a repository for historical artefacts, for example.</p> <p>  Natural peatlands have acted, and continue to act, as carbon sinks but drained peatlands and related activities account for emissions of some 11 million tonnes of CO2 per year in Ireland.  This equates to total emissions from the energy sector in 2018.  The total emissions from the 11 million tonnes is composed of power station peat burning, domestic turf cutting, horticultural peat and, most important, from the drained peat bogs.</p><p>A key figure to bear in mind is that 1 ha of drained bog, whether cutover or cutaway, emits six tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>per year for each year that it remains dry.  Less than 50,000 ha of the original 310,000 ha of raised bog in Ireland remains uncut.  More critically, only 1% is in an active condition, meaning it is sequestering carbon by accumulating peat.  There are more green parks in Dublin city than there are active, peat forming raised bogs in the country.The same threats have also decimated the original 774,000 ha of blanket bog, with now less than 28% likely to be in conservation value, barely holding on to their carbon stores.  The proportion of active areas is still unknown in those blanket bogs but it is likely to be critically low and decreasing each year as a national management plan for the network of blanket bogs SACs has not yet been established.<br/><br/>The protection, restoration and rewetting of peatlands is in line with national and EU obligations.  Undrained and uncut bogs are amongst those that are accorded priority habitat status in recognition of the extent of historical destruction of such habitats across Europe.  It is a legal requirement to preserve all peatlands that are still mostly uncut and undrained and to aim to restore the high bog or uncut part.  The network of 53 SAC raised bogs is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the carbon store of peatlands.  While the proper restoration of this network will lock in 28 million tonnes of carbon, the high bog within the NHA network also requires action.  What about the blanket bogs?  Members should recall that the area of blanket bog is three times greater than the area of raised bog.  As such, Ireland could lock in ten times more carbon in the designated blanket bog network if only the management plan required by law under the habitats directive could be implemented for these rare ecosystems.<br/><br/>I turn to restoration and rewetting.  When rewetted, degraded peatlands stop emitting and instead lock in their carbon store.  Better still, when they are restored, peatlands can even return to acting as natural carbon capture systems.  To clarify, even if peat cutting were to cease and no efforts were made to block the drains, peat will continue to decompose and release carbon to the atmosphere until rewetted.  The minimum intervention is therefore to rewet.  Before I go further, I will clarify a few terms, namely, &quot;restoration&quot;, &quot;rewetting&quot; and &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, as there is confusion about them.  The following definitions come from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's wetlands supplement for 2014.  The supplement states that peatland restoration aims to permanently re-establish the ecosystem that existed before disturbance or land-use change.  The restoration of drained peats almost always requires rewetting.  The latter is the deliberate action of raising the water table on drained soils to re-establish water saturated conditions.  Rewetting can be accomplished by blocking drainage ditches or disabling pumping facilities and managing the water table so that it remains close to the surface.  Rewetting can have several objectives, such as wetland restoration, and may allow other management practices on saturated peat soils, such as paludiculture, or wet agriculture.  Rehabilitation<b></b>can involve a large variety of practices which may or may not include rewetting.<br/><br/>Restoration of our protected peatlands and rewetting of drained bogs are considered by the UN as low-hanging fruit and among the most cost-effective options for mitigating climate change.  In both restoration and rewetting, the water table must be managed.  Abandoning or re-flooding drained peat soils under the heading &quot;rehabilitation&quot; is not a climate-friendly action as both approaches release huge amounts of greenhouse gases.  The feasibility of peatland restoration has been demonstrated in a number of countries, including Ireland. We have found that cutover bogs can be fully restored to return their carbon sequestration and storage function, as well as their unique biodiversity.  In Canada, scientists and those in the peat industry have worked together to licence peat extraction but that has come hand in hand with a commitment to fully restore the site after the short period of extraction has ceased.  The Irish industry must be regulated and look to such international standard.  Industrial cutaways have been drained and have emitted CO<sub>2</sub>for as many as 70 years and cutover bogs have done the same for centuries.  Restoration should be supported where conditions are adequate but where that is not possible, the minimum required intervention should be rewetting<b>.</b><br/><br/>Peatlands and future climate change are important aspects of this topic.  Drained peatlands are extremely vulnerable to even modest climate change impacts and are projected to become even greater hotspots of greenhouse gases as the peat dries out, cracks or burns.  Rewetting of these degraded bogs has been shown to be a climate-proof, effective mitigation strategy, provided that extreme drying events like summer drought do not become a more frequent occurrence.  Importantly, the longer a rewetted bog is established, the more resilient it will be to climate change.<br/><br/>Our recommendations are as follows.  The restoration of active bog habitats within all raised and blanket bogs SACs must be implemented rapidly in order to be climate-resilient.  Rewetting is a low-hanging-fruit mitigation measure that must be applied to all publicly owned peatlands, wherever feasible.  It is not sufficient to stop peat extraction or ban unsustainable uses of peatlands.  Rewetting is a mitigation measure that should also be included in the range of governmental climate adaptation tool kits to help landowners to farm carbon.  This action is critical to safeguard the future of the massive amount of carbon locked in all peat soils and which will bring associated ecosystem services, including water quality and regulation and biodiversity.  Regulatory frameworks and legislation across governmental agencies must be put in place to ensure the sustainable management of peatlands and to support voluntary mechanisms, for example, funds, certification, payments for ecosystem services.  Local communities should be supported by adequate funding to help them participate in the rewetting and restoration of their local bogs which are part of our social fabric and cultural heritage.  The rewetting of industrial cutaway and large cutover bogs is a low-cost intervention approach that would support immediate and effective climate change mitigation measures.  Such mitigation measures should be integrated as requirements in association with other sustainable after-use options to avoid exacerbating global warming.  Given the policy vacuum in this area, I recommend that a task force be establish to oversee the after-use of cutaway peatlands in accordance with climate and sustainability objectives.<br/><br/>Our wet living bogs are crucial weapons in our efforts to avoid climate catastrophe.  I thank the committee for inviting me to make this presentation.</p></speech>

We started with a review of the raised bog natural heritage areas, NHAs, network because we realised that the very ecosystems that were supposed to be protected by the Wildlife Act had not been protected.  It was reviewed and it was found that the network was decimated.  We need to focus on that.  The Wildlife Act was supposed to protect those habitats but did not.  They are now dried up and will continue to emit six tonnes of CO2 per ha each year because those habitats will be dry.  The Government decided to continue on the same trajectory and let those habitats go because it was too expensive to restore them all.</p> <p>  The problem with blanket bogs is far greater because there are more areas involved and far less knowledge available.  We do not know how much land is concerned, active, cut or uncut.  We do not know how large an area is still there.  We discussed raised bog NHAs within the Peatlands Council and that was agreed but the decision about blanket bogs was pushing it.  It was shooting ourselves in the feet because we do not know what is going to happen.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

Dr. Renou-Wilson mentioned that rewetting is low-hanging fruit and a mitigation measure that must be applied to all publicly-owned peatlands wherever feasible but it is not sufficient to stop peat extraction or ban unsustainable use of peatlands.

Industry will cut away and that will be done mostly by large companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na or Klasmann-Deilmann whereas cutovers are done by small farmers.  One thing that must be done quickly, which is a low-cost intervention because we have done a cost-benefit analysis, is the rewetting of industry or cutaway bogs.  That action should be removed from Born na M&oacute;na, for example, and put into a task force using the expertise of people who have worked, or are working, for Bord na M&oacute;na and other people in this country who have expertise to see those cutaway peatlands being rendered at least carbon neutral.  I want to see the rewetting of cutaway bogs.</p></speech>

My role primarily relates to raised bogs and all issues around them.  As I said earlier, we have a national raised bogs SAC management plan, which is focused on the restoration and conservation of the raised bogs and addressing the needs of turf cutters.  For example, we have a turf compensation scheme that provides an annual payment for those who require it and I am responsible for the administration of that scheme.  We are also trying to relocate turf cutters to non-designated bogs, which also falls under my responsibility.  We are trying to restore the designated raised bogs, NHAs and SACs, and that also falls under my remit.</p> <p>  The focus of our Department and Minister is on the designated sites network.  We have 52 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog NHAs.  The Minister's focus is very much on the site that had been designated under national and EU law.  My section is focused on that.</p> <p>  There is also the national peatlands strategy to which I referred earlier.  An implementation group for that strategy brings together representatives from a number of departmental and State agencies and has an independent chair.  The Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Communications, Climate Action and Environment are represented on that group.</p></speech>

It is simple and does not matter if the surface of the peat is vegetated or not.  For flooding, the water goes at least 20 cm above the surface of the peatlands for long periods.  Rewetting is managed so that the water stays just below the surface of the peatlands 80% of the time.  There are flooding events during the winter and lands could be used as a flooding plain for the winter if needed, but the peat is not flooded permanently.  That is the difference.  Rewetting is not flooding.</p></speech>

Basically, a normal farmer would be paid to have a crop or harvest.  In this case, people would be paid to keep the carbon in their soil and manage whatever they want above.  That was what I was introducing here.  Paludiculture seems to have been ignored so far.  This is wet agriculture.  Farmers who are really keen on having a sustainable economic outcome could do that.

I could go through the species but perhaps the Deputy is more interested in knowing what we can do with them.  The crops that are currently used are ones that can be burned in a local biomass thermal power station.  The farmers feed this biomass into their heat power station.  It could be cattail or reeds - things that grow everywhere in wet bogs.  Farmers harvest these crops in a way that is sustainable.  The peat is never impacted.  Carbon is still accumulating in the roots of the plants.  It has never been ploughed or cut dry.  The farmer just cuts the biomass, which grows again each year, and uses that to achieve an economic outcome.  Obviously, one can just re-wet and let the bog return to nature, which also has significant benefits.  Farmers should be paid to bring about those benefits.</p></speech>

The plan to restore the 1,800 ha of protected raised bogs in 2020 was referred to in connection with an additional budget allocation of &euro;5 million.  How much carbon is envisaged being stored over that five-year period?  Does the Department use any other agencies to support its planting or the work it does on rehabilitation, restoration or whatever is required?  Do any other State agencies tender for that work and, if so, do they get it?  I am thinking in particular of Bord na M&oacute;na and the potential for it to maintain its workforce through retraining and accessing the tender.  Has this happened in the past or could it happen in the future?</p> <p>  I welcome the review of the use of peat in the horticulture industry because we are very keen on a just transition for everybody involved.  A number of companies are using their own boglands for horticulture.  I welcome that a public consultation has been opened with regard to that because we focused on bogs in State ownership rather than private bogs being used in an industrial fashion.  It is right that there should be a just transition for them as well.</p> <p>  My other question concerns Dr. Renou-Wilson's presentation.  It concerns the re-wetting of degraded peatlands.  How long will it take for these peatlands to stop emitting carbon and instead lock in their carbon when they are re-wetted?  Does Dr. Renou-Wilson believe the plan by Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na to plant trees on some suitable bogs is a good approach?  I note that she referred to alder in terms of paludiculture.  Could she give me a good example of paludiculture elsewhere in the world from which we could learn? </p></speech>

The idea behind the programme is to restore 32 bogs.  We hope to begin restoring nine bogs next year.  When the 32 bogs have been restored, it will result in the storage of around 28 megatonnes of carbon.  The nine bogs earmarked for restoration next year will help maintain a store of approximately six megatonnes of carbon, which will result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 5,000 tonnes.</p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked how the programme is managed at the moment.  There are two sides to it.  As I mentioned, we have EU LIFE programme funding.  We are getting funding from the European Commission and the Department is making a financial contribution.  This is managed by a LIFE project team that is under contract to the Department for five years.  It would go to tender for the restoration work being done in 12 special areas of conservation sites.  Dr. Renou-Wilson spoke about restoration and re-wetting.  In the raised bog sites - the designated sites - we are trying to maintain the active raised bog and restore degraded to active.  This would largely involve drain blocking with peat or plastic dams.  When the project team for the LIFE project goes out for that work, it tenders for that work.  It might tender for a block of bogs together, perhaps in a particular area.  Bogs are mainly found in the midlands and east Galway.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, separate from the LIFE project, the Department is moving ahead with the restoration of State-owned land in other raised bogs in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.  A lot of engineering and surveying skills are involved in that along with the physical restoration works.  We went to tender for that project a number of years ago.  Bord na M&oacute;na project manages that project for the Department.  </p> <p>  I also mentioned that we are trying relocate turf cutters to non-designated bogs.  There will be a certain amount of work in terms of land purchase and infrastructure works on the non-designated sites.  Again, Bord na M&oacute;na project managed that for the Department as a result of a tender process.  If it is useful to the committee, I can go into more detail about the restoration work that has already been undertaken but perhaps for now, it would be better to hand over to Dr. Renou-Wilson.</p></speech>

That equates to the high bog - the uncut bog - which covers 16,000 ha.</p> <p>  The next question concerned how long it takes to re-wet.  It is magical.  If one wets a basket of peat, it stops emitting immediately.  There is no trick involved and nothing else is necessary.  It could not be cheaper.  It simply involves preventing rainwater from draining away and leaving it in the bog.  If the peat is wet, it will stop emitting because that is what it has been doing for the past 10,000 years since the last Ice Age.  There is no trickery involved and no money is needed to do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked for a good example of paludiculture.  There are several examples.  It depends on location.  Even though we are a small island, location is important because it depends on how wet the climate is.  The west of Mayo is much wetter than the midlands.  It will also depend on how wet and cold winters are.  Countries like Canada, Germany and Finland have been trying everything that grows.</p><p>If it grows well in a given climate, it should be used.  In Ireland, reeds, including cattails and phragmites, grow well and could have good biomass to burn, as well as trees.<br/><br/>The other question related to the announcement about Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte planting bogs.  I was involved in such a project 20 years ago and, therefore, I know all about planting trees on bogs.  It is not easy and it causes many other environmental issues.  I was wary when I heard the announcement.  I hope both organisations will learn from what we have learned.  Some 250 ha of peat has been afforested in the midlands and one hopes they will return to that.  We need to be careful because if the peat is not rewetted and the trees do not grow satisfactorily, carbon will be emitted constantly from the dried peat.  Nevertheless, there are areas, especially in the midlands, that, perhaps due to their location in the topography, such as in a sloping area or a raised position, have been cut all around.  There is no way they could be rewet before everything else is rewet.  In such areas, a way will have to be found to sequester at least some carbon through afforestation, but we must assess every area for re-wetting potential before we do that rather than just deciding on what is easiest for everyone, which has been the <i>modus operandi</i>thus far.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the committee has the time to visit, given all the work we have to do, but it would be interesting to visit some of the bogs.  Mr. Lucas indicated he would like to go into a little more detail about the type of work the Department is doing to manage the bogs.  I would be delighted to hear from him.</p></speech>

Following a recent procurement process, works are contracted for the remaining sites, with works due to commence on the first site in late October.  The six done comprise Mongan bog SAC in County Offaly, Ardgullion bog SAC in County Longford, Garriskil bog in County Westmeath, Carrownagappul bog in County Galway, and Ferbane and Moyclare bogs in County Offaly.  Of those we have recently contracted out, we hope to start with Carrowbehy bog in County Roscommon, Clara bog and Sharavogue bog in County Offaly.</p> <p>  Under the project thus far, restoration measures have been undertaken on approximately 1,420 ha of raised bogs, installing approximately 7,500 peat dams.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned amenity development.  Through the project and engagement with local communities, we have plans for the development of amenity proposals at Ferbane in County Offaly and Mountbellew in County Galway, both of which will be subject to the granting of planning permission.</p> <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has undertaken restoration works on State-owned land.  Last year, we completed restoration works on two SAC sites, namely, Kilsallagh bog in County Galway and Drumalough bog in County Roscommon.  We have done work this year on Shankill West bog in County Galway and we hope to work on an NHA site before the end of the year.  The Department published a guidance document, which outlines best practice not just for the Department but for anyone involved in raised bog restoration in Ireland, in 2017 and it is available on our website.</p></speech>

There is a centre at Mountbellew that the community would like to develop in order that school or tour groups could visit it, hear a talk about the history of the bog, its flora and fauna and the tradition of turf-cutting there, and then arrange a visit to the bog.  There is an area in the bog that seems very suitable for a boardwalk.  As I saw when I visited, there is not peat underneath for some reason.  Somebody once lived there and had some vegetables growing there.  While it will have to be subject to planning permission, it appears that it will not interfere with the integrity of the site.  If there was a boardwalk, the view across the bog would be amazing.  The local community is highly involved in developing the project.</p> <p>  It is not just a boardwalk.  There would also be a tour and some demonstration of turf cutting, perhaps provided by the local community, during which there would be some discussion of the history of turf cutting.  I am less familiar with the project at Ferbane but I believe it is some kind of a bridge walkway, possibly building on a facility that is in place, but I am happy to convey details on the project to the committee.</p></speech>

Dr. Renou-Wilson stated abandoning or rewetting drained peat soils under the heading of rehabilitation is not a climate-friendly action because both approaches release large volumes of greenhouse gases.  My understanding was that once drained peat has been rewetted, it will stop releasing carbon, but Dr. Renou-Wilson seemed to contradict that.</p></speech>

The big difference is where the water table is.  Rewetting stops just below the surface of the soil.  In events of high precipitation, for example, it might allow a bit of temporary flooding, for a short period-----</p></speech>

Flooding is just letting the water go wherever it wants, as high as it wants, and then we end up with flooded areas we cannot manage.  A flooded area cannot take more water because it has been flooded.  A flooded area emits a large volume of methane and does not do anything else.</p></speech>

Obviously, the more bogs are drained, the more flooding there will be because water can be released more quickly and we know the damage that is doing.  To reverse that, many of those bogs have the capacity to hold water and to raise it to ground level or it can fluctuate up or down around that.  It would be very difficult to control.  I have never walked across the bog in the winter because one part of it would be flooded and another would not.  Is there potential for some flood control or flood alleviation in terms of maintaining those water tables?</p> <p>  Dr. Renou-Wilson also referred to cutaway and cutover bogs.  She mentioned that cutaway was typically what happened with State companies, the large companies.</p></speech>

She said cutover was typically for domestic turf cutting.  I have engaged in domestic turf cutting and I worked for a State company that was extracting peat.  The State company was cutting over; it was taking off 1 m to 2 m.  As regards cutaway, when turf cutting for ourselves, we went straight down to the gravel or the white sand at the bottom.  That is cutaway.  There is some confusion with those two terms.  I can take Dr. Renou-Wilson to a number of bogs where Bord na M&oacute;na has used cutover techniques and taken 1 m to 2 m from the top of the bog.  I know this has caused damage, but that is not the argument I am making.  I am simply referring to the terms as there is confusion on those two points.</p></speech>

That is why the definitions are in the peatland strategy.  People call it whatever they like, and that is fine, but when we must make a decision we should all call things the same name.  The definitions I gave are in the peatland strategy.  I will explain the biggest difference and perhaps the Deputy can then apply the definition afterwards.  A cutaway has no vegetation left.  It is a bare, brown field.  Big horticulture companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na and Klasmann-Deilmann would have removed all the vegetation in long fields, with drains every 15 m to drain the site.  It is just brown.  It is cutaway because they come back to it every year over the full plain of the bog.</p> <p>  What we call cutover is all the bogs that have just been cut on the edges right down to the level the Deputy mentioned.  One might or might not have reached the subsoil, but the vegetation in the middle is still there.  In most of the bogs the Deputy spoke about, one can see the middle of the bog.  It has vegetation on it.  That is what we call a cutover, and that is the definition in the strategy.  I understand that the Deputy might use-----</p></speech>

The degraded raised bog is in the middle.  Ecologists now know that cutting the edges of the bog is impacting its centre.  The bog is not raised anymore, incidentally.  It has lost its dome because it has been drained for so many years.  It is now just flat as a pancake.  It should be a raised bog.  We call the whole area a cutover.  Within a site, there would be a cutover area that may or may not still be cut and in the middle there is the degraded raised bog.  In some instances, it is still there and not cut.  It is degraded because it has been drained.</p></speech>

Given the importance of restoring the peatlands, has the Department set out a verifiable pathway for the rehabilitation recommended by the committee?  There is a division between Departments and I realise civil servants cannot do much about this.  However, there is a problem here.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are dealing with this.  Is that causing a problem and giving rise to an unco-ordinated approach?</p> <p>  I also have a couple of questions for Dr. Renou-Wilson regarding the uses for cutaway bog in terms of biomass on the cutaway section on the edges.  It is hard to grow anything on top of a raised bog.  I have not seen many people being successful with that.  The only things that grow on it are heather and sphagnum.  We have to get them growing again when the bogs are rewetted to regenerate them and keep them as growing bogs.  That is why they are raised in the first place.  As regards the cutaway areas where all the peat has been extracted on the edges, there is a large amount of that in Laois, Offaly and other midland counties.  In terms of growing biomass, what is most suitable there?  Willow has been tried and I understand it has not been successful.  She mentioned wet crops.  There are three power stations located in areas where there is large amount of bog.  They were located there for that reason.  Is there an opportunity to grow biomass there to fire those power stations?  In terms of trees on cutaway bogs, if willow did not work, what is the potential for small trees?  Silver birch is growing really well on the cutaway bogs.  It is growing naturally all over the place.  Is there potential to use silver birch or small fast-growing, broadleaf trees for biomass?</p> <p>  On the nationally designated NHAs and the SACs, will Mr. Lucas outline the difference between those?  Will he provide a synopsis of what is proposed for each of them and which ones are being given priority in terms of rehabilitation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Lucas" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019102300002#J01900"><p>The national restoration programme for raised bogs is for both the SACs and the NHAs.  As stated earlier, we have 53 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog NHAs.  There is a proposal to reconfigure the NHA network arising from a 2014 review.  The Bill to give effect to that, the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, is going through the Oireachtas at present.  The proposal is that we would keep 36 of the current raised bog NHAs, including parts of seven sites, and there is provision for the de-designation of 46 NHAs, including parts of seven sites.  These are ones which have little or no restoration potential.  It is also proposed to propose 25 new sites for designation as NHAs.  The restoration programme is for both the raised bog special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked what the difference is.  The main difference is that the special areas of conservation are designated under the habitats directive, which is transposed into national law under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, whereas the natural heritage areas are designated under national law, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.</p><p>However, both designations are part of the national conservation target area for raised bog that has been set.  The NHA has contributed to that target.  Even though they are designated under national law, they are part of Ireland's overall target to maintain or restore raised bogs.  As I said, the framing for this has been set out in the national raised bog special areas of conservation management plan, published in December 2017.  The name causes a bit of confusion but it covers the NHAs as well as the SACs.  Previously, until the budget announcement of &euro;5 million, the intention had been to restore all the designated raised bog sites within three cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.  Now that we have the extra funding in the budget, we will see if we can accelerate that programme's timeframe.  I have already gone through the programme and where the funding will go.  I will not go into the detail of this but, as I said, we are already providing funding.  We started with the living bog project, which is a &euro;5.4 million EU LIFE project, to which the Department is contributing &euro;1.352 million plus the restoration work on State-owned lands.  As far as the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service are concerned, bog restoration has been ongoing for a long time but we did a major study on Ireland's raised bog resource in 2013.  From that we have developed a new restoration programme.  We have restoration plans for all the raised bog special areas of conservation.  We are also developing those plans for the raised bog NHAs.</p><p> Deputy Stanley also asked about co-ordination between Departments.  When I listed the Departments and agencies on the peatlands strategy implementation group earlier, I missed one or two of them.  I was speaking from memory.  As well as those I mentioned, we have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Office of Public Works, the Environmental Protection Agency, Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  In the past year, since the publication of the Government's climate action plan in June, I have found there has been a focus in what the Department is doing on raised bog restoration.  This links into the peatlands action in the climate action plan.  There is a comprehensive structure in place in reporting that.  So far, in my experience, it has worked very well and it has helped co-ordination.  In the Department we report to the climate action delivery board, which, as far as I know, is chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of the Taoiseach, and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We report on our progress and the restoration programme to the climate action delivery board.  Our Secretary General is represented on the board and, as I said, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is on it as well.  That system is working very well.  The focus of our Department is on the designated sites.  As I said, we have 53 raised bog SACs and 75 raised bog NHAs, and the restoration of those, as well as addressing the needs of turf cutters, is a big programme of work for us.</p><p> I am not too sure if I missed anything.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, however, there are loads of areas that are not protected where the bog has been cut.  Such bogs can be rewetted to keep the carbon in them and some biomass can be planted.  The opportunity to do that is considerable.  In fact, we have a huge wealth of experience in that.  Unfortunately, this was all funded by Bord na M&oacute;na, which has all the reports.  I have been working with Bord na M&oacute;na for the past 20 years on how to grow anything on peat.  We have tried everything.  The Deputy mentioned silver birch.  Silver birch grows naturally on cutover bog because it is dry.  As the Deputy said, as soon as peat is wetted, the birch will look very sad, unfortunately.  One could plant other species such as alder, which grows much better in wet soil without releasing carbon from the peat.  What I am trying to say is that a comprehensive amount of work has already been done and considerable experience has been gained.  Bord na M&oacute;na thought at the time that this was not economically viable, but now there is the issue of climate change.  At the time, 20 years ago, nobody talked about the carbon, but now, with climate change in mind, we could see many potential options.  We should be supported at the beginning in order that we can at least get farmers revenue from these areas.  That way they could farm carbon and get a crop out of it.</p></speech>

Before undertaking the fieldwork, one would have to engage in a public consultation process and a consultation process with the landowners.

As it says in the national peatland strategy, there is a need to devise and implement a system of management for the SAC sites.  Any system of management for blanket bogs must be drawn up in consultation with local communities to ensure that important peatlands are managed in a suitable way for the benefit of the community and in compliance with EU law.  I do not think one could develop that management system until detailed fieldwork is carried out.  I do not think that system could be brought in on the basis of a desktop study alone.  Detailed fieldwork would have to be carried out on all those sites.  As I said, that would have to be done in consultation with local communities.</p></speech>

I find her evidence absolutely incredible, in both senses of the word, in terms of the scale of both the problem we face and the opportunity we have.  The problem and the truly frightening part is her closing section, where she noted the susceptibility of our depleted boglands to become a real problem in the event of climate change, where we will see them drying out and subject to fire and further degradation.  The inspiring parts are the sense of opportunity, as I understand it, and the scale of emissions abatement, or the stopping of emissions, we could achieve if Mr. Lucas and his colleagues were to get their skates on and take some action.  I note that Dr. Renou-Wilson is a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2006 guidelines on wetlands.  I am very much interested in hearing her answer to the following question.</p><p>The degradation of our boglands accounts for 11 million tonnes of carbon per year, which is equivalent to the entirety of emissions from our energy sector.  If we were to give Mr. Lucas 100 assistants and colleagues, make budget a non-issue and provide every resource possible to rewet, rewild and rehabilitate, how many of those 11 tonnes of emissions could be removed from the equation by the end of the next decade?</p></speech>

I do not know exactly how much, but a lot of that emissions total comes from the burning of peat and horticulture peat.  We could easily move that use to zero.  I am not talking just about domestic turf.  We do not know how much domestic turf cutting there is in Ireland and what are the associated emissions.  We have a vague estimate, but it could be reduced directly.  What Deputy Eamon Ryan is talking about really is the drained peat source and whether we can stop those peat soils emitting carbon.  If we put in a real effort, we can do so.  It is not rocket science.  We have the experience and expertise and can do it.  Not all of that will be visible because we are into issues relating to managing the water table.  It takes a great deal of engineering and work to manage the water table.  One cannot just walk away and switch off pumps.  That is not managing the water table.  Managing the water table takes a great deal of resources; perhaps more than we think.</p></speech>

I am speaking from memory when I say that extraction accounts for a little under half, or 5 million, of those 11 million tonnes.  The remainder is from the drained bogs.</p></speech>

I assume from that statement that her best scientific advice and her experience on the international panel is that we should immediately cease all extraction of peat.  That would be one way to immediately save 5 million tonnes per annum.</p></speech>

The FAO, UNFCCC and the IPCC all agree that we should say away from peat soils.  Peat soils should be wet and that is it.</p></speech>

If were able to save 5 million of the remaining 6 million tonnes, as a certain amount is very difficult, that would be a total of 10 million tonnes a year.  I assume that the price of carbon will be approximately &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  That is what we will have as a carbon price in Ireland.  Who knows what the international carbon markets will set it at, but it would not be an excessive figure.  Under LULUCF rules, could that 10 million tonne saving be accredited to us within our own international accounting provisions as to how we meet our Paris climate obligations?</p></speech>

The activity under the UNFCCC and the LULUCF is to account for all our drained and rewetted bogs.  To clarify, we can only account for rewetted bog when we have accounted for all our drained bog in the first place.  We must know where all our drained bogs are and how much is there so that we can start to account for the good guys.  Only when one has the bad guys can one have the good guys.</p></speech>

While the Government did not include that in its all-of-Government climate action plan, it advocated a mapping exercise.  Whether that is a land-use plan is a question of semantics.  What Dr. Renou-Wilson has said today makes the case again for a land-use plan to recognise, as she says, that certain areas might be suitable for particular things.  For example, a certain area might be suitable for alder or reeds while other areas should be left untouched or restored as raised bogs.  Does Dr. Renou-Wilson believe a national land-use plan would be useful in that context?  In her discussions with the peatlands council and so on, has such an approach been considered?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was not here for the opening statements as I had to speak in the D&aacute;il.  Some of my questions may have been covered already.  Our guests will forgive me if that is the case.  Can Dr. Renou-Wilson tell the committee more about the impact of the Government's proposed afforestation plan on peaty soils?  Can she explain how the current policies of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine work to protect or destroy peaty soils?  What can we change and what should any new policies look like?</p></speech>

It was a lot of work to take on and this is the first step.  It has to be done the right way.  Mr. Lucas was right to mention that it has to be done in consultation with people, which takes time.  They do not have the resources for that.  It will be critical because Ireland has the very last intact or natural raised bogs and blanket bog.  The last resources in Europe are in Ireland.  As such, we need that.  This is critical and it will have a huge impact because it concentrates on those SACs that are the jewel of the bogs.</p> <p>  I must say something about CAP.  Speaking as a soil scientist, out of all the bad guys out there - and cutover bogs were mentioned - peat used for agriculture is the worst emitter.  It is the top out of all land-use forms over the whole planet.  If one takes the list of all possible land uses, this is up there.  This is as bad as planting for palm oil in Indonesia.  Anything that involves supporting agriculture on dry peat soils is nonsense from a climate perspective as these are the really bad guys.  One needs to start there.  There is quite a bit in this country that we could address very quickly.  Because these soils have been fertilised, they emit not only carbon but nitrous oxides.  They are double enemies of the climate.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Lucas agree with this assessment?  What steps is the Department taking as part of the peatlands strategy to reverse carbon losses?  That is probably to outline the peatland plan already referred to.  Dr. Renou-Wilson stated that Ireland could lock in ten times more carbon if the habitats directive were properly implemented to protect blanket bogs.  Does Mr. Lucas agree and what would that mean in terms of work?</p></speech>

I stated what is set out in the national plan to restore raised bogs in three cycles of six years.  I mentioned the &euro;5.4 million Living Bog project, which has been in operation since 2016.  I also mentioned the work of the Department separately on State-owned lands within the raised bog SAC and NHA networks.  In addition, I stated that, with the extra budget allocation for 2020 of &euro;5 million, we hope to accelerate that programme.</p><p>I gave some figures and there is potential, as I mentioned, in that we hope to work next year on nine bogs under the restoration programme.  That would maintain a store of approximately six megatonnes of carbon and result in a reduction of CO2 emissions of approximately 5,000 tonnes per year.</p></speech>

That is right and it is the first thing we need.  We must remember the protected designated network is only 20% of the peatlands.  We are not even talking about the rest because it is owned by landowners.  It is why we must move on to farming carbon.  It is different from what the Government can do with its protected designated sites that must be done anyway under the habitats directive.  The work should have been done a long time ago, but we are now catching up.  That will lock in and, I hope, sequester more carbon.  I am pretty sure I will see that network safe before I leave the planet and I would be happy with that.  The rest is a problem and we need a policy to manage the peatlands not in this protected network.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Lucas and Dr. Renou-Wilson for their presentations.  Dr. Renou-Wilson spoke about 16,000 ha that make up the 53 special areas of conservation that together would store 28 million tonnes of carbon.  Mr. Lucas spoke about 1,800 ha being worked on in 2020 and 28,000 tonnes of carbon.  I agree it is crucial to move to the wider issue of our peatlands strategy.  If we properly resourced and scaled up our interventions, simply looking at only raised bog areas, we could potentially look at 28 million tonnes of storage versus 28,000 tonnes of storage.  It is quite a difference.</p> <p>  I apologise but I will focus on protected areas because I am concerned that they may not continue to be protected areas.  It was interesting to hear the specific numbers indicated by Mr. Lucas.  The intention is to dedesignate 46 of the currently recognised natural heritage areas.  Am I correct in saying that 46 of the raised bog natural heritage areas, which are currently recognised as areas of natural heritage, are a tiny fraction of the peatland in this country with national protected status?  Is it correct to say that 46 of 75, or more than half, are due for dedesignation under the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016?  I raise this because Mr. Lucas raised the issue of the legislation.  I suggested it may have been appropriate to wait to deal with that Bill until these hearings were completed, but this relates to policy.</p> <p>  Is it not the case that even a simple re-wetting of all the current natural heritage areas would have a benefit in terms of carbon sequestration nationally?  I am talking about the 46 affected by the proposal for dedesignation.  Would it be better to re-wet them and keep that network in play, regardless of whether we add new natural heritage areas?  I refer to the process around this.  Leaving aside any amendments - it is not what we will discuss today, although I agree with others in the Houses who saw them as troubling - we can look at the Government proposal, which is that the conservation value of a raised bog takes into account a comparison made between the area, range, habitat structure, function and ecological features of the bog and those of one or more other raised bogs.  My specific concern is the way the Department will decide which bogs are to be dedesignated and where protection will be removed.  It is through comparison with others, so what will they be compared with?  Will they be compared with the full network of natural heritage areas or special area of conservation bogs?  Will they be compared with the 12 bogs focused on this year?  Will they be used as a tool to justify the dedesignation of other natural heritage areas?</p></speech>

I responded to the question.  In 2014, the Department published a review of the raised bog natural heritage area network and it has been in the public domain since that time.  This is nothing new.  The most comprehensive analysis ever done was completed of Ireland's raised bog resource, considering the 52 raised bog special areas of conservation, the 75 natural heritage areas, and 100 non-designated sites.  This study was done on a scientific basis across the network, including special areas of conservation and non-designated sites.  It was not a bog-by-bog comparison, and I cannot emphasise that strongly enough.  It took in the entirety of Ireland's raised bog resource.</p><p>That was looked at to see whether it would be possible to get a better network in terms of restoration potential, a better network that could be restored and a better network in terms of meeting Ireland's national conservation target for raised bog.  In terms of the review and the proposal for designation, I emphasise that what has come out of that review is only for the raised bog NHAs; it is not for SACs.  I reiterate that it was not a bog-by-bog comparison-----</p></speech>

The result of the first phase of the review were published in 2014.  The review must be completed.  Hopefully, it will be completed when the Bill is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The review concluded, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, that there should be a refigured network that would involve the cessation of turf cutting in 36 NHAs, which would remain designated.  Those who have had to cease domestic turf cutting on those sites have been provided with compensation by the Department since that time.  As stated, seven sites were to be divided with one part to be conserved and another part to be designated.  The de-designation of the 46 sites includes the parts of the seven sites to be preserved.  They are sites that have been judged on the basis that their conservation potential is expected to be marginal or restoration is considered to be prohibitively expensive relative to the conservation benefits it would achieve.  There is still a loss even though the conservation potential these sites is marginal.  It is proposed to designate 25 new raised bog sites in public ownership or where there is reduced turf cutting pressure.  We will end up with a better network in terms of the area of active and degraded bog and with less cost in terms of paying compensation to turf cutters.</p></speech>

The mechanism now for determining which will be included in the list of 46 is a bog-by-bog comparison.  Mr. Lucas mentioned restoration potential but rewetting potential and the benefits of potential rewetting were not considered.  In response to my colleague, who asked about the SACs, Mr. Lucas was very clear because this Bill also allows for a similar bog versus bog comparator regarding the de-designation of blanket bogs.  Mr. Lucas outlined a very lengthy process in respect of raised bogs.  There has been no equivalent process for blanket bogs.  Mr. Lucas said that the Department would not want to look for any system of management.  In fact, it does not even want to move ahead with the management of SACs blanket bogs, which is mandatorily required by the habitats directive, without consultation and directives.  However, it is proposing a mechanism that can allow for the de-designation of blanket bogs in advance of having had such a consultation so it seems that it is ready to run ahead on the legislation in terms of natural heritage area blanket bogs even though it has not delivered on its requirements in terms of special area of conservation blanket bogs.  I note that it is not in the gift of the Department to de-designate SACs so it probably cannot be claimed as a virtue.</p></speech>

Can we afford steps backwards with regard to bogs?  How do we ensure that we are consistently moving forward?  Should we be looking to an expansion of our natural heritage network and perhaps the connectivity with that?  Dr. Renou-Wilson mentioned farming.  I have heard beekeeping discussed as a potential ecological restoration mechanism regarding boglands.  Does Dr. Renou-Wilson wish to comment on that?  Could she comment on the environmental impact of conversion of peatland to golf green.</p></speech>

The SACs were the best things as a whole.  If we look at raised bogs in Ireland as a resource, the SACs were the best.  NHAs were turned into SACs when the habitats directive came into play in the right places.  Meanwhile, it was a case of "out of sight, out of mind" with regard to the NHAs that did not change and kept being degraded.  Why was this?  It was because they were being cut.  When it came to looking at them again, they were so badly damaged, I would not even consider wasting any water on them.  In some cases, they are bad.  This is a fact.  There was a scientific review to assess those.  In some cases, they were not reviewed with the objective of re-wetting them.  That was never done.  They were reviewed with the objective of saying that their status as bogs was not of conservation value and that if turf cutting was going to continue on them, it would not impact any other good potential protected sites.  That is how it happened.  Meanwhile we found that other sites that had never been designated had potential so we have a protected areas network as a resource.  We must hold on to that.  We can manage to restore this area of roughly 3,000 ha, which is 1% of the raised bogs we originally had.  We could get back to it by including those new national heritage areas and new SACs.  We will have new SACs.  There is no stepping back.  We cannot go back.  It is damaged.  Those NHAs are wrecked.</p></speech>

The Bill was amended in the D&aacute;il to provide that a Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht could at some point in the future undertake a review or reviews of blanket bog NHAs.  This in no way means that the Minister would de-designate NHAs.  It could even mean that the Minister might decide to designate new NHAs.  I do not want people running out the door thinking that the Minister would do that tomorrow.  In my view, based on what is in the Bill and on what was done for the 2014 review, the first thing that would need to happen would be a comprehensive scientific review of the whole blanket bog network encompassing the blanket bog SACs, the blanket bog NHAs and undesignated blanket bog sites.  This would take quite an amount of time on its own so I do no think any Minister could de-designate NHAs next week or when the Bill is passed in the new year.  The first thing that would have to be done is a comprehensive scientific review of the blanket bog network.  I do not think it would be possible to carry out a proper review without undertaking those steps.  There are criteria and checks and balances in the Bill as well but the first thing that would have to be done would be a very comprehensive and wide-ranging scientific review.  One could not undertake a review of the blanket bog NHAs without doing that, as was done for the raised bog NHAs.</p><p>If the Department and the Minister were to undertake a similar review, they would have to follow a similar approach.</p></speech>

It is the same way that somebody has a soil that is better at growing grass and another that is not.  There are some bad soils.  I am a farmer as well and I have bad soils.  I will not be able to grow a good crop of barley on a bad soil where there is <i>Juncus</i>because it is wet.  Those wet soils are good for the climate.  If one drains them, the soils become bad for the climate.</p></speech>

Farmers with that type of ground got grants from the Government to drain said land.  This was to help them to derive a living from the land they were given or they bought.  That is all what they had to put food on the table.  They got grants and were advised by bodies such as ACOT and Teagasc to drain their land to keep more stock.  Now, people are saying they cannot keep their cattle and must drown these lands because they are a big problem and to go to hell after that.  That is not fair.</p> <p>  I note the deliberate action of raising the water table.  People worked hard to lower the water table to dry their lands.  To be told all of a sudden that they must change their tactics, block drains, flood the land, have ducks and wild birds and not to keep their animals is absolutely ridiculous.</p> <p>  The witnesses are, by and large, referring to the midlands.  We know what happened in the budget.  I do not regret the people in the midlands getting money to compensate them for being unable to work in Bord na M&oacute;na.  However, the fact is that the people in rural Ireland who must have a car, tractor and a lorry will pay the carbon tax to foot the Government&rsquo;s decision to close these bogs that are creating energy.  The policy is all electric.  However, in the finish, if we close down all the power stations, where are we going to get the electricity?  I do not think anybody has answered that question.</p> <p>  I live in and represent Kerry.  People from the midlands have been on to me, however, about Bord na M&oacute;na blocking drains and stopping pumping water from the bogs.  They are concerned such action will flood adjacent lands and that they will not be able to cut turf or farm their lands.  If the water from these State-owned lands cannot reach the main drainage course, it will create difficulties for people around those places.</p> <p>  There is a big question as to the legality of what is proposed.  The witnesses need to get ready to answer those people.  They have used these watercourses for generations.  Blocking watercourses willy-nilly like this cannot be done without consulting and coming to an agreement with neighbouring landowners.  Some of those affected will never again be able to cut turf.</p></speech>

Every time there is a re-wetting or restoration plan, the Department consults all the landowners and everybody is consulted before any of those plans proceed.  What I have proposed is to support farmers who have peat soils that need to be re-wetted.  They must be paid instead to farm carbon.  I know in the past they had to drain these lands.  Now we realise, that was a bad idea for the climate.  They will need to do something else and pay those farmers.  I know it sounds funny.</p></speech>

They have to be developed further in partnership with stakeholders, including landowners and local communities.  The idea behind this plan is to ensure the impact of the restoration work to surrounding agricultural land - blocking the drains on the bog with peat dams and sometimes with plastic dams - is kept to a minimum.  By raising the water level, it is not intended to flood the land but rather to ensure it remains wet enough to encourage the growth of sphagnum moss within a protected site.  In some cases, it might be decided to block some drains while leaving others open.</p> <p>  To allay concerns about the potential impacts of restoration on areas of land adjacent to the designated bogs, we are in the process of developing drainage management plans for the raised bog SACs network as part of the restoration programme.  The live sites will be dealt with separately.  We have been engaging with landowners and turf cutters on the development of those drainage management plans.  It is a legitimate concern and one we have to address.</p></speech>

Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson talked about blanket bogs.  She has to get one thing clear in her head.  It is private property.  Has she a right to go on to somebody&rsquo;s private property?</p> <p>  In fairness to Mr. Brian Lucas and the NPWS. they have drawn up a management plan on re-wetting.  When people heard about re-wetting, they thought the water would be run down.  It is not.  They have consulted in various areas.  I had many a row with them but they consulted people in affected areas.  If there are any problems, they have addressed them.</p> <p>  What are the 53 raised bog SACs?  They were brought in under the habitats directive.  They were brought in to save an amount of bog because the rest of Europe had cut theirs.  It was not brought in for the climate or saving tonnes of anything.  There is no part of climate written into it.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

That is not what the habitats directive was about.</p> <p>  It is not helpful when the likes of the NPWS are trying to resolve issues on the 53 raised bog SACs.</p><p>The National Parks and Wildlife Services, NPWS, has called them the best bogs in the country.  When one has a bog that is functioning and has been rewetted, and the active raised bog is beginning to work back again, what is the carbon sequestration per acre on that bog?  What is the tonnage per year, per acre?  I have been at a conference, but I would like to know the position on a raised bog.  I know that blanket bog is totally different.  Blanket bog regenerates itself much more quickly than the raised bog.</p><p> The other point made by Dr. Renou-Wilson was that she said that if one cuts on the outside of the bog, that the middle of it is destroyed.  I have been with Ray Flynn from Queen's University Belfast, who I am sure Dr. Renou-Wilson knows well, and with RPS and have been on complexes of 3,000 acres.  They can prove that maybe for 200 m or 250 m, such a cutting would have an effect, but the bog will remain intact inside of that.  One has to be able to show, under the habitats directive, that one does not have an adverse effect, which is the wording of the directive.  Dr. Renou-Wilson's statement earlier that the middle of the bog would get degraded is not correct.</p><p> As to the ongoing de-designating bogs debacle, there are category 1 and 2 bogs, degraded bogs, and ones that were not worthwhile regenerating.  When the scientists such as RPS went out and studied this - people do not want to look into this - it was completely useless to try to put these bogs back.  Consequently, it decided to go around the country to look for other bogs that would help it in its overall plan of reaching the required targets.  It reached these numbers, in order to make the new plan, which was a sensible thing to do, rather than at Raheenmore Bog - our witnesses may be familiar with this bog - which was taken over and given to the National Parks and Wildlife Service in 1979 by Bord na M&oacute;na.  Liners were put into it that blew out of the way.  Efforts were being made to restore the bog.  To this day, this is a bog that it is virtually impossible to regenerate or to have re-function.  This can be compared with bogs where I am from in the west of Ireland and where people cut domestic turf in which the base of the bog is still there and will always be there; it is like biting at the toes of an elephant.  Those bogs are able to regenerate, can be rewetted and one can work with them so much better.  </p><p> I listened earlier where the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, was getting stick in respect of this 28 million tonnes, or 11 billion or whatever was the figure.  In fairness, I cannot say that I am going to go into anyone's house and say that I am taking it over, no more than I can say that I am going to go into a person's private property in a bog.  The NPWS cannot do that.  On top of that, it has rewetted some bogs and will have difficulty for the simple reason that there are private landowners with whom it would not be familiar because there are turbary and fee simple rights.  In fact, there are eight different types of rights involved with bogs.  Those people will shove their heads above the parapet shortly and they can ask for their drains to be reopened where rewetting was done because the NPWS went in on private property.  Either we are going to be communists in this country and are going to take over the world or we are we going to sit down, talk, and work with people in a proper fashion.  </p><p> I seek an answer to those questions about the sequestration in respect of what the NPWS call those charm bogs in the 53 raised bogs SACs, that is, the tonnage of sequestration.  Mr. Lucas has had people dealing with an issue in the past few years with the regeneration of bogs whereby a machine has to be brought in on it with low ground pressure.  Is the estimate of &euro;5 million equal to about 17 diggers for 240 days, which is 17 people for the same period?  Is that a fair assessment what Mr. Lucas's Department has done has done so far around the country?  We have seen the Bord na M&oacute;na side of this, which would be a more intensive approach to regenerate a bog because the bogs the NPWS are working in have vegetation and very little drainage on them in comparison, because the drainage done would have been done at the time of the council work.  Domestic turf cutters do not need drainage on a bog to cut it, which we need to be clear about.  I am aware that the Department is going to some bogs at the moment, Carrowbehy Bog, for example.  That is the work that &euro;5 million does on bogs that are fairly intact.  If one looks at the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs, as was pointed out earlier, there are drains every 12 m, this work would be much more intense for the machines.  Would Mr. Lucas consider that there will be less work will get done because of that?</p></speech>

For the &euro;5 million earmarked in budget 2020, that overall programme involves 36 bogs, which are the designated raised bog sites.  That is what I will focus on.  This will begin with nine bogs next year.  Over the whole programme, it is hoped to be able to store  is 28 megatons of carbon.  In the bogs next year, it would be hoped to store 6 megatonnes of carbon, which would result in reduction in CO2 emissions of approximately 5,000 tonnes per year.  I have looked at the figures and I have been on bogs and have seen the drains that have been successfully blocked.  That has been done, as Deputy Fitzmaurice has said, with a digger where one inserts the peat or plastic dams.  I can send on the figures we have.  We have done some estimates on how many machines one would need over a bog but off the top of my head, I cannot remember the figures.</p></speech>

Peatlands have two functions when it comes to carbon.  It stores the carbon that is already in there, which is the biggest issue at the moment.  This is the carbon that has taken thousands of years to accumulate in the peat.  Peat is roughly 50 kg of carbon per cu. m.  To rewet it is just to keep that carbon in and to stop the emissions, which is critical for the future and for Ireland, otherwise it will have to pay for this carbon.  When the bog is restored in this programme, only restored sites will be able to sequester more carbon.  The figures are in the strategy, which I cannot find right now.</p></speech>

Peat is an annual constant carbon sink, which is what is important about it.  Unlike forestry, it has a huge amount of carbon already there, which once drained is released into the atmosphere.  That is why the rewetting is important.</p> <p>  The second question was on blanket bogs.  I appreciate the point about private properties.  My recommendation is to start first with publicly-owned blanket bogs.  Believe me, there are publicly owned blanket bogs.  Coillte owns many blanket bogs.  We have to start with those, I agree, and show how it is done and then we will move on to help the farmers who want to rewet their land in a way that is feasible to support them to farm carbon.  This is the way that it is done in Wales and in Scotland, where farmers are now being paid to rewet a vast area of blanket bog.  Farmers are very happy to do that.</p></speech>

Again, if one is still cutting turf then that will not help, only if it is protected.  In a site that is not protected, a typical blanket bog could still have ongoing turf cutting in areas without damaging the main part of the blanket bog, but it must be clear where and to know where to stop and not go on further into the blanket bog.  It should be wet then, because one cannot have re-wetting and cutting.</p></speech>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service is trying to resolve an issue in conjunction with ecologists and scientists and they are trying to find alternatives for people to make sure that those 53 bogs are as far as possible preserved and that we can get re-wetting done.  We must also ensure that minerals from land do not come in.  We must ensure the drain between the bog and the land is kept clear because minerals from land are not good for the bog.  Objections are coming in.  If environmentalists keep objecting, because it is private property people will keep doing what they were doing until an alternative is put in front of them.</p></speech>

We have seen it on television.  The smog in Indonesia is old peat burning.  Once a fire starts it burns for a long time.  Bord na M&oacute;na knows that very well, as it has to stabilise the peat stacks so they do not catch fire.  We are dealing with a fuel.  It is like a fossil fuel; it is very dangerous.

We cannot get away from that fact.  At the end of the petition, the petitioner states "This is from a millennial worried about my prospects in the housing market in the future other than renting".  It is worth noting that for the first time in the history of the State, we have fallen behind the EU average rate of homeownership of 69%.  We are behind Germany, which is supposed to have the model that pursues renting as the option, in home ownership rates.  Less than 20 years ago, the average age at which a person could buy his or her own home was in his or her 20s.  I was approximately 25 when I bought the home I live in now.  It is now in a person's mid-30s when he or she can buy.</p> <p>  The petitioner has touched on a major issue in respect of properties.  It is a matter the Committee of Public Accounts touched on when the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, was before us to discuss large developments being bought up by investment funds while squeezing potential first-time buyers out of the market.  In that context, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) (First-Time Buyers) Bill 2019 in the D&aacute;il yesterday through Deputy Darragh O'Brien to allow local authorities to designate up to 30% of zoned land for first-time buyers.  Initiatives like that to tackle this issue in the context of what the petitioner has said are worthy of consideration.  I would not pursue the method the petitioner proposes, but investment companies buying up these properties is fundamentally wrong.  It is a slight against the country.  Those of all political hues can agree when investment companies are squeezing first-time buyers.  Looking at the statistics, home ownership figures are falling behind those in countries with a supposed rental model.  That is worrying for this country.  It was good to have the petition before the committee.  As D&aacute;il and Seanad Members, I hope that we tackle it.</p></speech>

We should look at the response to the petitioner, which shows that less than 1% of transactions account for what the petitioner outlines.  Undoubtedly, we have an issue with housing, but we must not get into fake news either.</p></speech>

We are not getting into fake news.  The policy has not worked.  There is a crisis, which is not acceptable.  Things like the Bill proposed yesterday to empower local authorities to stave off this onslaught are worthy of debate here.</p></speech>

While I do not want to get into a debate here, the Austrian model builds 2,700 units per year outside Vienna.  Austria has a standard rate of rent of approximately &euro;600 per month and they supply their schools, doctors and everything else.  While the petitioner is flagging up a point about nervousness and planning for the future, we must acknowledge, whatever Government is in power, that not enough is being done to build affordable units.  Not everybody wants to own a house.  We have some kind of psychological block in Ireland that one has to own a house.  It is all about having security and a home.  Under the Austrian model, however, people can live in massive communal villages where no one is under pressure.  It does not matter how much a person earns a month, there is a standard rate.  If a person agrees to terms and a contract, he or she has harmony.  When there is harmony in an area, it increases the mental health and wellness of individuals and communities.  It is a model we should look at.  It should be noted in relation to the issue the petitioner is trying to raise that no matter who is in government, we should plan for the future and look at alternative models that are affordable.</p></speech>

I accept that Deputy Buckley has a philosophy and ideology but I disagree with it.</p><p>Home ownership in this country has fallen to 67%.  We should offer people that option.

I agree that security of tenure is important but the submission was specific on allowing first-time buyers into the market.</p></speech>

I suggest that we consider inviting in Repak and other organisations, as the Chairman and secretariat deem appropriate.  The thrust of what we want to do is to reduce packaging and have more informed labelling.  Repak has a recycling strategy for the period 2018 to 2030 and in that context it might be worth inviting it in.</p></speech>

My understanding is that options are coming down the line.  We should take a positive lead globally.  We have the opportunity to do so.  I agree with the Chairman and Senator Buttimer.  We should hear from Repak and major producers of recyclable and non-recyclable goods about their plans for the future.</p></speech>

To be fair, the response from the Department is comprehensive in answering the issues raised by the petitioner.  We are going off on a tangent to the extent that it is not possible to adhere to what is being specifically sought in the petition.  However, members understand the importance of packaging, which is one of the biggest issues in the area of climate action.  It would be useful for the committee to gain an understanding of the position of Repak and industry representatives on this agenda.  Is it agreed that we keep the petition open, communicate with Repak and see where we go from there?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00035/19 seeks to have more funding allocated to create additional and larger autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and special classes in mainstream schools.

However, it is an issue that is becoming more prevalent and a growing number of students are presenting.  The Department has produced a report on the role of special education needs organisers, SENOs.  I do not wish to be political in terms of scoring points against my own Government or creating a political divide, but there is an initiative we need to address.  One might argue that this falls within the remit of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and I will accept the decision if that is the case.

Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they may interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  They can also adversely affect television coverage and web-streaming.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and her officials.</p><p>At present guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements for children who are subject of public law childcare proceedings are provided for under section 26 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The primary purpose of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019 is to give legislative effect to replacing section 26 with a new part of the 1991 Act to regulate the current <i>ad hoc</i>system of guardian <i>ad litem</i>appointments for the benefit of children and young people.</p><p>The intention is for the select committee to conclude its consideration of the Committee Stage of the Bill during this morning's meeting.  The meeting room is available until 2 o'clock.  I hope we will not need it for that long.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I refer members to a grouping of amendments for the purpose of debate.  Unfortunately a number of amendments submitted by Deputies Funchion, Rabbitte and Sherlock have been ruled out of order and the Bills Office has advised them accordingly.

I was disappointed, and nearly angry, to see these amendments ruled out of order.  The Bill is about the rights and interests of a child, which is why the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, system was put in place in the first instance.  This is particularly the case at the moment, where social workers change regularly and many children do not have social workers for long periods.  In many cases, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is basically the child's right-hand person.  If we are saying that we will not allow for guardians <i>ad litem</i>in all circumstances, the Bill is hypocritical.</p><p>I have a major issue with the fact that it was 6.30 p.m. yesterday when we were told that the amendments had been ruled out of order.  That is very short notice to allow us to prepare for today.  The ruling undermines the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to provide for a discussion on the matter so that we might find a way of getting around it.  Amendment No. 2 in particular is important, but it has been ruled out of order.  I would like to see us doing something about the matter it addresses and amending the Bill on Report Stage.  Otherwise, we in my party will be reserving the right to vote against the Bill on Report Stage.  It is contradictory and hypocritical and does not protect the best interests of children.</p></speech>

It is unusual for three Opposition Deputies to work together and submit amendments.  We obviously felt strongly on this issue, given that we submitted three joint amendments.  We did so because we believed we would be facilitating, supporting and strengthening the Bill.  Ruling them out of order will leave the Bill weak, and the people who will be most affected are the children in the childcare system.  I ask that the Minister consider what we have submitted.  Deputy Funchion cited one amendment in particular, but what we speak about in our amendments goes to the core of the issue, namely, ensuring that every child has access to a GAL regardless of postcode lotteries or the level of the court system he or she is in.  The child might not need a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, but he or she would have had the opportunity to decline one.  Another amendment would have protected the guardian <i>ad litem</i>by providing him or her access to legal advice.</p><p>That is where we were coming from with our amendments.  We believed we were assisting and facilitating the process in a mature fashion, but we were told at 6.30 p.m. yesterday without being given any good reason that they were not being accepted.  I look forward to the response.</p></speech>

The other issue I have is the constitutionality of the legislation under Article 42A.4.1<sup>o</sup>, which reads:</p><blockquote>(i) brought by the State, as guardian of the common good, for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, or<br /><br />(ii) concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child,the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.</blockquote> <p>I know that the Minister is acting in good faith in respect of this provision, but our fear is that the postcode lottery will be an issue.  For instance, it is not always the case that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>may be appointed.  It depends on the judge and where he or she sits.  It is at the judge's discretion.  This is an issue that has been-----</p></speech>

It is routine for such matters to be determined by the Bills Office in conjunction with the Chairman of any committee at this Stage of a D&aacute;il Bill and for the decision to be made the night before.  The Deputy is a Chairman and has been a Member of the House for longer than I have, so he knows that.  The amendments and the rationale will be outlined to the Deputy when we get to them.  That is the normal procedure.  The Deputy was advised by email last night, through the secretariat.  That is the normal procedure.  We will get to it.  The Minister has indicated her position.  Deputy Funchion raised a very important matter, which I am sure the Minister will discuss with us.  I should point out that we are trying to work together on this.  I do not have a negative position on the amendment.  I said as much in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I am sympathetic to it, as is the Minister.  We can have a proper debate about it and hopefully come up with a resolution.  That is my position.  I must now follow the procedure for Committee Stage.  We can get to the individual amendments when they arise.  We can discuss them and I am sure the Minister will set out her points.  That is the way this works.  The Minister is not making an opening statement.</p></speech>

As I am sure the members are aware, it would require the District Court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in all childcare proceedings and would enable the court to discharge that order where the child makes a request to that effect.  Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in every case before the District Court would entail a significant increase in the cost to the State.  Amendment No. 3 is consequential to amendment No. 1.  The amendments must therefore be ruled out of order as they would create a charge on the revenue, in accordance with Standing Order 179(3).  That is the advice that has been given.  We would not normally have a debate on such matters, but if it is all right with the Minister I might ask for her opinion on it.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair for sharing that advice.</p><p>I cannot accept the amendment because I do not agree that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem </i>should mandatory in every case.  That opinion is shared by many stakeholders who have engaged with us, including Dr. Carol Coulter, who as the Deputy knows is the director of the Child Care Law Reporting Project.  I have also discussed this with my officials at length.  To tease out why that would be the case I will propose some hypothetical situations in which it might not always be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  </i>One example would be a non-contentious case where a child is already in care, either with relatives or in general foster care, and where this is being formalised by a care order.  Another example might be the case of a vulnerable parent, in which voluntary care may not be appropriate.  The proceedings may be about formalising care by relatives.  That is an example in which it might not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Another example might concern an older child, who might not want yet another professional to be assigned to him or her.  An older child may request to speak to the judge directly, perhaps accompanied by his or her social worker.  Those are examples where in my opinion it may not be necessary to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem.  </i>Therefore the Bill should not stipulate that it is mandatory to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Of course guardians <i>ad litem </i>do very valuable work, but in many cases it is important to provide flexibility.  We must recognise that they are not the only way for a child to have his or her views and best interests represented in every set of circumstances.  I expect the Deputies would agree with that.</p><p>The provisions relating to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem </i>must be read in conjunction with the additional obligations the Bill places on the court through the greatly expanded section 24, with which I know Deputies are familiar.  That new section removes the reference to parents' rights and responsibilities and clearly states, &quot;the court shall regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration in the resolution of any such proceedings&quot;.  It includes a long list of factors that the court must consider when determining what is in the best interests of the child.  It also inserts a new section 24A, which provides:</p><blockquote>... the court, in so far as practicable shall&mdash;(a) determine the means by which to facilitate the expression by the child of his or her views in the proceedings, and<br /><br />(b) give such views as the child wishes to express due weight, having regard to the age and maturity of the child.</blockquote> <p>Taken together, these provisions place a heavy duty on the court to hear the views of children who are the subject of care proceedings, to give those views due weight and to fully consider a long list of factors during its consideration of what is in the child's best interests.</p><p>The judge in childcare proceedings has an overarching responsibility to vindicate the rights of the child, including his or her fair procedure rights.  The authors of Child Care Proceedings: A Thematic Review of Irish and International Practice, research commissioned by my Department, outlined other mechanisms used in other jurisdictions to hear the views of the child.  Those include a meeting between the child and the judge, the child providing the court with a personal letter, video or drawing, the child responding to a questionnaire and the child communicating his or her views through his or her social worker.</p><p>I do not want to constrain the courts if they have a better way of doing something for a particular child.  I am also mindful of the planned reform of the family courts and hope that in the future there may be other approaches to hearing a child's view more directly and representing his or her best interests.  Amendments including the one proposed by Deputy Rabbitte acknowledge that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not always needed.  The amendment suggests that when a child does not want one to be appointed to him or her, the child's views should be respected.  My provision provides that when considering whether to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem, </i>the court should consider the views of the child on whether or not he or she should have one.  Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to every single child, even children who have already expressed the view that they do not want one, forces a child to reject a guardian <i>ad litem</i>once one is appointed.</p><p>That would be disrespectful to an articulate young person who has already made his or her views known to the court.  I feel it would make more sense not to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>if a child does not want one in the first instance.  That is in the Bill as it stands.  I also believe that adding an extra layer to proceedings by requiring a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be appointed and then dismissed, because he or she is not needed, would undo a lot of the good work we are trying to do.  We want a new guardian <i>ad litem</i>system to reduce complications and delays and not add to them.  The Bill is an effort to bring about a recalibration of our statutory landscape in which the child is placed front and centre.  I know members agree with that principle, even if they have different views on this particular issue.</p></speech>

Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in every childcare case before the District Court would create a substantial increase in the cost to the State.  The amendment must, in accordance with Standing Order 179 (3), be ruled out of order as it would give rise to a charge on the Revenue.</p></speech>

I cannot make a decision on advice I was not given until 6 p.m.  I would like to facilitate a debate but I will not do so on amendments that have been ruled out of order.  If Deputies want to have another bite of the cherry, and I invite them to do that, they can do so in a general discussion on section 6 after we have dealt with the amendments to that section.  All members will be free to make a lengthy contribution at that point.  We do not have to leave this room until 2 p.m., though I do not want us to go until that time.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, as is the case with local authorities, when items are ruled out of order, leeway is given.  I have provided that leeway.  The Minister made a contribution on an item that had been ruled out of order.  We cannot have a debate on items that are out of order but the members can make general contributions on each section and I encourage them to do so.  The member who proposes a motion that is in order can make two contributions, an initial contribution and one following the Minister's reply, while other members may make one contribution to an amendment.  There are 27 amendments and only five have been ruled out of order.  The members have the right to make a contribution to any amendment that is in order and I am here to ensure their rights are respected.  They have to understand, though, that I also have a job to do.  I do not want to have a row with anybody nor to curtail debate.</p></speech>

Appointing a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in every childcare case before the District Court would create a substantial increase in the costs to the State.  The amendment must, therefore, be ruled out of order as it would create a charge on the Revenue.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 is also out of order.  It would require the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to provide or arrange for the provision of legal advice to guardians <i>ad litem</i>in every case before the District Court for which they are appointed.  The provision of legal advice in every case before the District Court would create a significant increase in costs for the State so the amendment must be ruled out of order as it would create a charge on the Revenue.  The amendment is also somewhat consequential to previous amendments.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 has also been ruled out of order as it would require the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to provide or arrange for the provision of legal advice to guardians <i>ad litem</i>in every case before the District Court for which they are appointed.

That is the primary reason I can see in terms of the change.</p><p>Current practice is that a report would be prepared for every court sitting.  There is no intention to change the current practice, where the guardian<i>ad litem</i>may produce a number of reports over the course of one case.  In addition, section 35E.(2)(c) places an obligation on the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to provide an update to the court on any additional matters relevant to the best interests of the child that come to his or her attention during the course of the performance of his or her functions.  Effectively the provision is already in the Bill, as it is acknowledging that other reports can come forward.  The meaning of report in the singular can be read as plural, effectively. </p><p>Therefore I think the amendment is unnecessary.</p></speech>

We believe that people have the right to read the report.

Having heard Deputy Funchion outline the intention of these amendments, which is to ensure that a party has sufficient time to read a report, in reality the wording provided could be interpreted as removing the right of an unrepresented party to receive a copy of a report furnished to the court.</p><p>Under the proposed wording &quot;such a party would have the right to read the report only&quot;.  Clearly it would not be appropriate that a party with legal representatives would receive a copy of a report but a party with no legal representatives would not.  I suggest that the amendments could be interpreted in that way, effectively as removing the right of an unrepresented party to receive the report.  I also understand there can be issues around the timely delivery of the reports to parties and to guardians <i>ad litem</i>in childcare proceedings.  That could be addressed better by the rules of the court rather than in legislation.  I do not know whether the Deputy's concerns could be addressed in procedural issues relating to the Child Care Act and those are being examined as part of the overall review of the Act.  These matters are also being addressed in the family courts Bill, which will be brought forward by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan soon.  That is my reason for rejecting the amendment.</p></speech>

The point we are trying to make is that unfortunately at present copies of reports end up in very inappropriate forums and then one has the fallout from that.  What we were trying to say is that people should be able to access the report and have assistance to do so, if they need it, for example if they have learning difficulties but that they would not be able to take the report away physically.  This is fairly commonplace.  There may be fallout and it could have repercussions for that person because the information is still out there in an inappropriate forum.</p></speech>

The rationale still stands that it could be interpreted to remove the right of an unrepresented party.  Also effectively in doing that in breach of the <i>in camera</i>rule, the judge of the court has a right to penalise in that regard as well.</p></speech>

We believe that the guardian <i>ad litem </i>is being demoted to witness status, which means that he or she is not necessarily a party to all proceedings and that he or she can be called as a witness if required, which means they may not be involved in all of the proceedings and that they may be called as a witness for part of it, but not all of it and that they are operating in the dark in that regard.  I strongly feel that this demotes the status of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019102300002#F01900"><p>I respect the Deputy's view but, again, I certainly do not think that is the case.  Obviously we read the Bill as a whole, although I am not suggesting that the Deputy is not doing that, lines 34 and 35 on page 8 outline that: </p><blockquote>The court or any party to the proceedings may call a guardian <i>ad litem </i>appointed for a child as a witness.  </blockquote> <p>This does not limit the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to the role of witness only.  There is no intention that this be the guardian <i>ad litem</i>'s only role, to demote the role, to use Senator Funchion's language.  The provision does not exist in isolation and with any legislation must be read in conjunction with the whole of Part VA that is to be inserted into the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p>That includes the provision that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is appointed for a child, and the right under section 35F(1) of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to apply to the court for a report to be procured regarding the welfare of the child.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>is also given the very important function of informing the child of the recommendations contained in the report, the outcome of the proceedings, and such other matters relevant to the proceedings as the guardian <i>ad litem</i>considers appropriate.  I believe all of these functions will require the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be present throughout the proceedings.<br/><br/>Guardians <i>ad litem</i>may also continue to make section 47 applications.  This section, which is already in the Child Care Act, allows them to make an application on any question affecting the welfare of a child in the care of Tusla.  I do not think it demotes or restricts it.  Many other functions are identified in the Bill.  It is important to read the Bill as a whole.</p></speech>

Looking at the section 35 provisions from an Opposition point of view, there can be gaps geographically in the system at District Court level.  In some parts of the country there is quite a robust service.  Again, to quote the Minister, in the absence of a family court system where we are relying on the District Court, we need to try to buttress the wording such that there is certainty.  Where there are gaps in the service, we need to buttress that service to ensure that, for instance, in this amendment, people will have reasonable opportunity to read the report.  That is the spirit in which we are proposing the amendments.</p></speech>

I believe it is open to interpretation.  The Minister is saying they might not be considered a witness on party to all proceedings.  However, once the word "witness" is mentioned there, they might be seen as only a witness.  This comes from the stakeholders and from people who deal with child welfare cases in the courts system.  They are fairly adamant about this.  By removing the word "witness", we are protecting the current status.  It does not have a cost to the Exchequer.  On some of the other things, we have accepted the Minister's explanation.  I will not be backing down on this one.</p></speech>

When we discussed it in the Chamber the last time, I spoke strongly about the role of the witness, the definition of the witness, that the guardian would only be called once, and that he or she would then be asked to leave the proceedings.  We all know that cases in family courts or any courts can take a long time.  It is not over in just one sitting and could go on for nearly a year.  That is why I do not like the idea of the word "witness", and the one report or one viewing and then having to leave.</p></speech>

It is important to emphasise that, as matters stand, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, is not a party, and has never been a party.  It is at the court&rsquo;s discretion that they are sometimes allowed to exercise party-type rights.  That is an important distinction but it emphasises that discretion resides with the court to allow the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to work for the child&rsquo;s best interests.  It is important to acknowledge the overarching responsibility of the judge in the case is to vindicate the rights of the child and to behave proportionately in the interests of the child, and that there is no fundamental impediment to vindication of the fair procedure rights of the child in an arrangement where the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not a party to the proceedings.</p><p>This provision does not remove this discretion but we want to make it clear that, effectively, there is no automatic right for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>to act as a party.  This Bill sets out a guardian <i>ad litem</i>role that is based on the Children&rsquo;s Acts Advisory Board 2009 guidance.  Its core functions are to ascertain the views of the child and to make recommendations to the court on what is in the best interests of the child.  Party status does not sit well with this role as an independent resource appointed to ascertain the views of the child and make recommendations to the court.  I would like to emphasise that the child can be made a party under the Child Care Act, as it stands, and, under this Bill, a child who is a party can also have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is the child, not the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, who has a personal interest in the case, so I believe this is the most appropriate route for those children who want to, and for whom it is in their best interest to, be joined as a party.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019102300002#H00800"><p>I have had regard to public interventions.  In one case, a solicitor of long standing who is operating in Cork, Mr. Colm Roberts, is on the public record as part of process of interrogating and examining the role of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  He stated in a recent presentation:</p><blockquote>In 2009 I raised my concern in another child care case before the District Court in Cork as I believed that as a legal advisor for parents, I was at a disadvantage in cases where the extent and role of the Gal was unclear, and particularly the extent and role of his/her legal representation was even more unsettling as it seemed to move the Gal into a more adversarial role.<br /><br />This particularly became more acute in circumstances where the Gal was supporting the application for Care Orders by the Child &amp;amp; Family Agency (previously HSE).  This is very problematic for the Court to balance the right of the Gal to fully participate in proceedings that he/she has been appointed in and at the same time ensure that natural justice and fairness to all parties is protected and vindicated.  This issue was dealt with in detail [in] a judgment by District judge Mitchell.</blockquote> <p>In putting forward the amendment to delete, we want to strike a balance between the presumption in favour of the appointment of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and the discretion of the District Court in the absence of a fully fledged family courts infrastructure, while seeking to give a voice to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, which is the voice of the child before the court.  I do not see what is so injurious about our intention to delete these lines.  I am not a lawyer and I have never been a witness before a court, in particular proceedings before the family courts, so I am a layman in this respect.  We are seeking to ensure that voice is absolutely robust in the absence of there being a fully fledged family courts infrastructure.  Again, this goes back to the geographical disparities that exist between certain parties where, without being disrespectful to District Court judges, not every District Court judge has the training in respect of these types of cases that come before them.  Is there a formula of words that would copperfasten the importance of the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>without necessarily calling for them not to be a party?  The Minister would say that is in other sections and is already inherent within the legislation.</p><p>We are effectively trying a belt and braces approach but I have an open mind about how the Minister might respond to that.</p></speech>

We need a form of words that copper-fastens the position for a child with disabilities who may be non-verbal.  We also need to into consideration that such a child needs to be party to proceedings and I have not heard that come through.  We are talking in the round here about people who are able to articulate but we must also talk about the voice of a child with disabilities.  That is a role I seek for the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and I do not see it shining through in the way the legislation is being presented at the moment.  Deputy Sherlock is right that the form of words used should nearly remove the discretion allowed to judges in appointing guardians <i>ad litem</i>in order that we protect children.  That is what I am looking for.</p></speech>

I agree with that.</p><p>We are using this form of words to indicate that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>being a party to proceedings is not the default position.  That is the primary issue.</p><p>On the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte, as I understand it, a child can be made a party under this Bill, which is not current situation.  Perhaps I am incorrect about that.  A child, including a disabled child, can be made a party with a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.</p></speech>

I mention Mr. Roberts in particular because he is on the public record having made submissions to this process and Bill but he could be any solicitor around the country.  This is an adversarial system.  I have sympathy for the Minister when she states that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not automatically a party to proceedings.  However, we are trying to strike a balance and recognise the fact that the system operates differently in different parts of the country.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned a child with intellectual disabilities or a child with no voice and there are any number of types of case to which we can refer but in certain parts of this country, there is no automatic entitlement, right or prospect of a child having a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Does the Minister acknowledge that is the case?</p></speech>

The primary objective and whole point of what we are doing is to change the situation, as described by the Deputy.  The legislation will clearly define the role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>and place the guardian <i>ad litem</i>on a statutory basis.  It will establish an office to oversee that and a panel.  This will put a whole new system in place so the situation to which Deputy Sherlock refers will no longer be the case.  It will take some time to roll that out but we are trying to create law to change that situation.  I do not know if I can accept the rationale that we need to have certain things provided for in law to help us deal with where we are now, as distinct from where we are going.  I believe that answers the question the Deputy has raised.</p><p>The line, &quot;A guardian <i>ad litem </i>appointed for a child is not a party to the proceedings&quot;, is used because it is our argument that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has no personal interest in the case and it is important for him or her to be an independent resource for the child, whatever his or her background identity.</p></speech>

In addition, it is important for all parties to the proceedings to be aware of what reports are being requested and potentially undertaken.  We are trying to ensure that communication is ongoing.  It is also important to note that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>is under no obligation to come to an agreement with other parties.  This subsection seeks to ensure that only appropriate communications take place in the interests of justice and for the good of the child.  The limitations on the right of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to request reports that already exist and are still in date are in place for good reason.  Duplication of reports can be wasteful of time and resources and can slow down court proceedings unnecessarily.  Subjecting a child to numerous interviews with experts without good reason is not in the best interests of the child.</p></speech>

It goes back to a core value about the age of the child and the consent of the child who does not wish to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  In those circumstances, a report would be produced and submitted to the courts acknowledging that the child, for reasons of age or whatever else, had chosen not to have representation.  We have sought to have included in the Bill a provision whereby a report would be produced to reflect the fact that some children may choose not to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That report would issue in the course of proceedings to reflect that the child was offered a guardian <i>ad litem</i>but had chosen not to avail of one.  As such, this document would be on the record and would address any concern that, down the line, possibly in an appeal, a child would claim that a guardian <i>ad litem</i>was not offered to him or her.  That offer would be recorded in a document.</p></speech>

We have borne witness to the infrastructure that exists in this country, the shortage of social workers, the constraints and so on.  Where there were court proceedings, the guardian <i>ad litem</i>would fulfil a specific role.  I do not think the Minister would necessarily disagree with what I am saying.  We are all largely on the same page about seeking to ensure that the rights of the child are adhered to as per the constitutional amendment.  Again we find ourselves slightly constrained with regard to what we proposed.</p></speech>

I know that depending on who is sitting on a particular day or if someone is on annual leave, the interpretation differs.  We are trying to remove that to ensure there is fairness given to the voice of the child.</p></speech>

I am fully in agreement with the intention here, but the Bill as worded already addresses the issue.  The intention of this section is to ensure that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>has recourse to the court if he or she believes that the Child and Family Agency is not giving him or her information he or she requires to undertake his or her functions.</p></speech>

In the Bill as drafted, an order ceases to have effect, <i>inter alia, </i>on the expiry or refusal by a court to make a care or supervision order where a child turns 18 years of age.  The effect of the amendment is to potentially continue the guardian<i>ad litem</i>order in place indefinitely, thereby incurring costs on the State in paying the guardian's costs and expenses.  In accordance with Standing Order 179(3), the amendment is ruled out of order as it would create a charge on revenue.</p></speech>

The oversight role would represent a significant departure from the current functions of the ombudsman and would require significant additional resources to discharge, which the State would have to fund.

There is a lamentable absence of comprehensive, quantifiable data about childcare proceedings in Ireland.  The childcare law reporting project's valuable work has provided a window into those proceedings but we are still lacking reliable quantifiable data on childcare cases.  It is my intention that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>office will endeavour to provide information on its activities, while respecting the important privacy protections provided by the <i>in camera</i>rule and GDPR.  I am happy to consider bringing forth an amendment to provide for the publication of an annual report.  I will consult the Attorney General's office on the appropriate wording.  </p><p>I take this opportunity to advise Deputies that I also intend to bring forward two amendments on Report Stage to the <i>in camera</i>rule under section 29 of the Child Care Act.  As I have mentioned, the childcare law reporting project provides a valuable window into these proceedings, but there is currently no expressed basis for Department officials to attend proceedings.  This creates difficulties for the Department in terms of monitoring the implementation of the 1991 Act and the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>executive office into the future.  While I recognise the importance of the <i>in camera</i>rule for the protection of the privacy of children and their families, I am also conscious of the seriousness of State intervention in family life under the 1991 Act and the obligation for legislation and policy to be informed by evidence from our courts.  I have secured Government approval for an amendment to section 29 of the 1991 Act to authorise the attendance of two specific groups of officials, including those who will have official responsibility for managing guardians <i>ad litem</i>and those who will have a specific role in monitoring the implementation of the 1991 in order to revise and improve it.  </p><p>The second proposed amendment will enable the childcare law reporting project and other similar bodies to exercise their functions properly by ensuring that they have access to all relevant reports.  I emphasise that these proposed amendments will not impact on the court's ability to restrict access to the court on a case-by-case basis but nor will they impact on the court's ability to restrict access to court documents, if desired, in the specific circumstances of a particular case.  Furthermore, no person will be permitted to make public information likely to lead members of the public to identify either a party to the proceedings or a child to whom proceedings relate.  Additionally, I am considering the possibility of introducing a provision which would allow for a review of the reformed guardian <i>ad litem</i>arrangements under this Bill.  I have instructed my officials to explore this issue with parliamentary counsel.  The intention is that such a review would commence not later than three years following the coming into operation of this legislation.</p></speech>

I may have inadvertently and incorrectly stated on Second Stage that responsibility for this entity will be given to Tusla.  That was an error on my part.  We are now creating an entity that will come under the remit of the Minister of the day.  Obviously, the Minister will have control of its budget.  While the Minister will not become a party to court proceedings, he or she will be able to go into courts.  Could that put the Minister into conflict with the child law reporting project, for instance?  We have only just received this information.  I am speaking for myself as an Opposition spokesperson when I say that all stakeholders continue to have a lot of respect for the independence of the Child Care Law Reporting Project.  Any recommendations made arising from the work of the project have the confidence of everybody who is involved in the whole area of childcare law.</p></speech>

First of all, I am just providing information on what I intend to do.  We can discuss it then.  The Deputy has said he has &quot;only just received this information&quot;.  I am offering information that can be reflected on later.  I hope that is a good thing.  On the particular issue raised by the Deputy, I must point out that underneath the amendment is an intention that officials will be there to be observe and will not have any party status.  They will support the new guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  This provision will rarely be used and will be used by leave of the court only.  Those are a couple of the things I could say right now on this matter.  I suppose it will be particularly appropriate to discuss and debate it when we have the Report Stage amendment.</p></speech>

It would have been useful to have known this on Second Stage because it would have given us a better chance to discuss these matters at this stage of the proceedings, when amendments are being introduced on Committee Stage.  The Minister has yet to address the reason she intends to bring forward the Report Stage amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.560" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2019102300002#N02800"><p>I wish to make a few concluding remarks on this matter.  I was genuinely disappointed that amendment No. 2, which went to the heart of the Bill, was ruled out of order.  It spoke to the reason the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system exists in the first instance.  I understand and accept the point the Minister has made about a child who might not want to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>or about straightforward cases in which there is no need for a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  We allowed for that in amendment No. 2, which stated: &quot;The District Court may discharge an order directing the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, on the application of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, if the child so requests.&quot;  We understand that the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is not necessary in certain cases.  In other cases, the child does not want a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to be appointed.  We think it would be better to say from the start to every child in care that he or she has a right and an entitlement to a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  If we are genuinely interested in representing children, being the voice of children and ensuring the interests and rights of children are heard, listened to and respected, this is the crux of the matter.  I find it very difficult to support this legislation without this amendment being factored into it.  That is why I asked earlier if there is any way of looking at this issue in advance of Report Stage.  I would appreciate it if such a way could be found.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  If we cannot find a compromise or a solution in this respect, I will vote against the Bill on Report Stage and I will advise my party colleagues to do likewise.  It is hypocritical to state that we want this system to be in place to ensure children in care are protected, while at the same time saying that not every child in care will get a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  It is definite that children will fall through the cracks.  In years to come, cases will be taken against the State by people who feel they should have been given a guardian <i>ad litem</i>but no such opportunity was provided to them.  While I understand what has been said about the cost to the Exchequer, the issue goes beyond that.  I found it difficult to go through the rest of the Bill after this amendment was ruled out of order.  This aspect of it is the heart of the matter for me.  I will wait to see whether it is rectified in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

As stated earlier when she was not present, there is a great deal of good in the Bill.  We have focused on one section of the Bill in our amendments.  It is important to acknowledge that there is a lot of good stuff in the Bill.  Most of the amendments that have been proposed relate to section 6.  I have met officials from her Department.  I would welcome another meeting if that could be facilitated.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock, who said that this is about the language.  I firmly believe there is a wording that could be used.  Like the Minister, I am a purist.  There are certain things we believe.  I am a purist when it comes to my belief that every child should have the opportunity to avail of the services of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>if those services are needed or if he or she chooses to avail of those services.  We have discussed children who do not want to have the opportunity to avail of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Every child who finds himself or herself in these circumstances should have the opportunity to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  Maybe we can meet somewhere to discuss that further.  I do not want the Report Stage debate to happen without everything having been teased out in its entirety.  I would like to see the Bill passed.  I would like to think that common ground can be found.  When I arrive at a committee meeting, I do not like to feel, as I did today, that another move is taking place without the committee having had enough time to address it.  While I thank the Minister for flagging what she has just presented to us, I emphasise that a great deal of discussion needs to take place before we get to Report Stage.  We need to find a solution.  The current system is working in certain parts of the country, but it is not working everywhere.  Geography has a significant part to play in this.  Although there is a lot of good in this legislation, when I walk out of this committee room I will continue to be disappointed with section 6.</p></speech>

I am really disappointed the Minister has ruled particularly amendment No. 2 out of order.  She gave her reasons for ruling amendment No. 1 out of order and then listed the reasons given for ruling amendment No. 2 out of order.  She said that sometimes young children, particularly teenagers, may not want a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  We have covered that in that amendment, so she gave her reasons for ruling amendment No. 1 out of order, which we have covered in amendment No. 2.  All children should be given the opportunity to have a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  I think we are losing sight of what this Bill is about.  It is about children's interests.  We all sit here and say a social worker can do this.  A social worker cannot, and I speak from experience regarding the service of guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  Sometimes children are sick to their back teeth of talking to officials, and they see social workers as officials.  They see their carers and their parents and they are caught in the middle, but the guardians <i>ad litem</i>are their voice.  I know this from experience because I have heard children ask, when they would not discuss something with a social worker, for such and such to be called because that person was the child's voice.  The Minister is taking away these children's opportunity to have that voice.</p></speech>

To be perfectly clear, some of the primary concerns and disagreements we have had in the room this morning concern decisions that were made by the Bills Office rather than my Department or myself.  Neither I nor officials had any hand in making those decisions, as members will be aware.</p><p>We are all engaged in making law from our own perspectives to ensure that the best interests and the voice of the child are heard in the context of people's experiences.  Things need to improve in order for this to happen and, as referred to a number of times in the course of this morning's meeting, in order to ensure consistency in that regard throughout the country.  In light of that, we have all engaged in deep reflection and done much reading on this.  I have also consulted a number of stakeholders.  I know that vested interests have also participated in the conversations.  It is important that, as a result of that kind of deeper reflection, we try to make the best law we possibly can.</p><p>I look forward to discussing the amendment Deputy Sherlock tabled, which, as he said, he will consider resubmitting on Report Stage.  We just have to check the wording with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Again, that is standard practice.  Furthermore, Deputy Sherlock may wish to offer his rationale for tabling the amendment, but I was not in a position to accept it because it suggests that the ombudsman is effectively made responsible for monitoring the court's conduct during <i>in camera</i>proceedings, and the Bill has been framed with regard to the separation of powers.  I could expand on that, but that is the heart of reflection on the matter and-----</p></speech>

I am here in my capacity as a research officer at the ESRI.  I am an economist by training and I am a PhD in the area of in the area of health economics.  I am the lead author of the ESRI working paper, An Examination of Activity in Public and Private Hospitals in Ireland 2015, which was published last October and which the Joint Committee on Health has invited me to discuss.  The analysis was undertaken as part of the ESRI-Department of Health research programme in healthcare reform, which has the broader objective of projecting demand for and expenditure on healthcare services in Ireland.  The working paper was prepared in light of the independent review group's work examining the implications of the Sl&aacute;intecare proposal to remove private practice from public hospitals.</p> <p>  While the ESRI did not provide any direct input to the deliberations of the review group, the working paper was subsequently cited as part of the review group's final published report in August 2019.  The ESRI working paper examines the extent of private activity in public hospitals and provides an overview of service delivery across public and private hospitals in Ireland in 2015.  The analysis expands on research undertaken and findings presented as part of the ESRI research series report, Projections of Demand for Health Care in Ireland 2015-2030, the first report from the Hippocrates Model published in October 2017.  The report contained new analysis of private hospital activity, which had not been previously published for the Irish healthcare system.  The working paper expands on that analysis by examining the extent to which care in public hospitals was delivered on a public or private basis.</p> <p>  In 2015, nearly 1.5 million day patients, those admitted and discharged on the same day for elective, that is, scheduled treatment, and nearly 4.2 million inpatient bed days relating to either elective or emergency care were recorded across the public and private hospital system in Ireland.  The public hospital system delivered the majority of this care.</p> <p>  In 2015, approximately seven out of ten day patient cases, and more than eight out of 10 inpatient bed days were estimated to have taken place in public hospitals.  Some 16% of cases in public hospitals were treated privately.</p> <p>  Looking at private care across the hospital system, more than 75% of all private day patient activity was recorded in private hospitals.  In contrast, we estimate that less than half of all private inpatient bed days were recorded in private hospitals.  These findings suggest that the private hospital system is primarily specialised in the delivery of elective care, with all day patient care being elective by definition.</p> <p>  In considering the removal of private care from public hospitals, it is important to note that most private inpatient activity in public hospitals are emergency inpatients arriving through hospital emergency departments.  Elective private inpatient activity accounts for less than 4% of total inpatient bed days in public hospitals in 2015.</p> <p>  It is unclear, therefore, whether the types of private emergency inpatients currently treated in public hospitals could access the care they require in private hospitals.  Traditionally private hospitals have not provided many of the more urgent and complex treatments associated with emergency care that are available in public hospitals.  Data on public and private activity in public hospitals were available from the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, scheme managed by the healthcare pricing office.  HIPE collects detailed clinical and administrative data on discharges from and deaths in acute public hospitals nationally.  However, we did not have access to comparable routinely collected administrative data on private hospital activity.</p> <p>  To try to fill this gap, private hospital activity profiles were estimated using aggregate information on health insurance claims provided by the health insurance market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority.  We would have liked to extend this analysis further, for example, to compare public and private activity at the level of diagnoses and procedures or to compare the roles of the two types of hospitals with respect to elect and emergency inpatient care.  Data limitations meant this depth of analysis was not possible.  The absence of good quality data creates difficulty for both researchers and policy makers to inform important policy proposals, such as the one being discussed this morning, with evidence.</p> <p>  The full working paper has been circulated to the committee and is available on the ESRI website.</p></speech>

I ask Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#D00500"><p>Thank you, Chairman.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report by the all-party Oireachtas committee recommended the phased elimination of private care from public hospitals.  There is cross-party political support for this for a very good reason: quite simply, access to public acute hospital services is unfair and that needs to change.</p> <p>  Ireland is unusual in that those with private health insurance or who can pay out of pocket are able to access services in public hospitals quicker than those who do not have health insurance or cannot afford to pay.  This is not fair.  It is difficult to think of any other public service where people are treated more favourably simply because they can pay more for a service.  Our recommendations are designed to eliminate this unfairness.  Our proposal would also help to move us towards the accepted norm in almost all advanced countries.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s system of private practice in public hospitals is very unusual.  We asked the OECD to report for us on the Irish system, and it found Ireland to be a striking outlier.  We have a very large private health insurance market.  The overwhelming number of hospital consultants have rights to private work and almost 30% of our total hospital activity is funded privately, a situation comparable only to the US.</p> <p>  I would like to refer briefly to the widespread misunderstanding about the cost of removing private care.  The recommendations we make are costed, and costs are phased in a way that makes the change affordable, and I will come back to this point.</p> <p>  We recommend legislation to ensure that public hospitals are used exclusively for the treatment of public patients from the conclusion of the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare implementation period.  Our other recommendations ensure a reduction in private activity over time, but over the lifetime of Sl&aacute;intecare, private activity must eventually cease entirely and the legislation should provide this.</p> <p>  The key recommendations in the report concern the consultant contract and there are five recommendations.  First, all new consultant appointments should be to a Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.  This would allow consultants to conduct only public activity in public hospitals.  It is important that this recommendation is implemented soon.  There is no point in continuing to issue contracts with private practice rights when these will have to be bought out in the future.  This recommendation is the key to removing private activity from public hospitals in a progressive, orderly and incremental way.</p><p> Second, we recognise that there are significant consultant recruitment problems in our public hospitals, with approximately 370 vacancies at the moment and a further 380 posts occupied by non-permanent staff.  While working conditions, hospital rosters and matters such as training opportunities for non-consultant doctors play an important role, pay is also a factor.  In October 2012, the starting pay of consultant doctors was cut significantly.  We recommend that the payscales for all new entrant consultants to the Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract and for existing consultants appointed since 2012 on public-only contracts are restored to the scale that existed pre-October 2013.  In current terms, the starting salary of a type B consultant appointed today is &euro;131,000.  The starting salary of a new consultant should our recommendation be accepted would be &euro;182,000, a very considerable differential of &euro;51,000.  This new salary would compare very favourably with salaries in other countries and would put Irish consultants among the highest paid consultants anywhere.</p><p> Third, while our recommendation about new consultants being appointed to a public-only contract will ultimately lead to the removal of private activity from our hospitals, this will take some time.  In order to speed up the process and encourage existing consultants to change to the new contract arrangements, we have recommended that existing consultants should be offered a contract change payment to move to the new Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract.</p><p> Fourth, we are concerned that there are some consultant posts, and I stress the numbers are likely to be very small, where it may prove almost impossible to recruit a suitable candidate.  A scheme exists in the third level sector that allows a special derogation from pay service caps to address recruitment to highly specialised posts in a very limited number of cases, and we have suggested that this also needs to be considered in the public health service.</p><p> No doubt members are aware of some concerns that have been aired over the amount of private activity in public hospitals conducted by a small number of consultants that is above the amount allowed in their contracts.  It is our view that the HSE needs to ensure that this does not happen, so the agreed monitoring and reporting system to robustly monitor and enforce the existing consultant contract must be implemented.  We made two further recommendations, namely, the Department of Health should ensure that HIQA&rsquo;s quality and safety regulatory functions are extended to all healthcare settings, including those in the private sector, and that a better data collection system would be put in place relating to the nature and scale of activity in the private hospital system.</p><p> Obviously, the implementation of these recommendations gives rise to increases in public expenditure.  The additional costs arise mainly from the loss of private income of public hospitals but also in relation to consultant pay - for those taking up the public-only contract - and the increased cost of treating greater numbers of public patients, and we have set out the final costs at the end of ten years and it comes to approximately &euro;650 million per annum.  The main element of this is the private income of hospitals - now just over &euro;500 million - paid mainly by insurers.  This income is declining in any event due to the campaign by insurers to inform patients that they gain no advantage from using their insurance when admitted via the emergency department of a public hospital.  While the loss of this income will result in a cost to the Exchequer, people are already paying for this in the form of higher insurance premia, and the loss of this income will result in higher taxes but lower insurance premia.  Even if there is no change in the existing system, this source of income will decline, and it would be very risky to rely on this income continuing into the future.</p><p> It is important to note that &euro;650 million is the annual cost which arises after all private activity is removed.  In the initial years of implementation, the costs will actually be quite modest, primarily arising in relation to additional expenditure on consultant pay.  This would amount to around &euro;12 million if recruitment targets are met.  An additional public activity which would be caused by the recruitment of these public-only consultants would cost a maximum of &euro;40 million per annum.</p><p> One matter which is important to highlight is the effect these recommendations would have on the capacity of our public acute hospitals.  We believe that the vast majority of patients being treated privately in public hospitals will become public patients under our future arrangements.  This is because they are in a public hospital as emergency patients or they require complex care or multidisciplinary services, or maternity services where there is no equivalent services provided within easy reach in the private sector.</p><p> In our report, we also advised the Department of Health should examine the clinical indemnity scheme to ensure that there is a level playing field in relation to the clinical indemnity between private work carried out in public and private hospitals.  This would address the situation where consultants conducting private work in public hospitals currently do not have to make any contribution towards their indemnity insurance for their private work.  We have been careful to develop our recommendations in a way that ensures there is no shock to the system.  While the policy change can be commenced quickly, the effects will happen incremental over time.  While it will take ten years to fully remove private activity, significant progress can be made relatively quickly.  Also, implementing these recommendations over the lifetime of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme makes it more affordable and ensures that they happen in parallel with improved care models, better availability of diagnostics, and improvements in primary and community care that will be necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the proposal.</p><p> There will be little immediate effect for those who rely on private health insurance.  People will still be able to use their insurance should they wish to, but over time, our public hospital system will be better able to provide services for all public patients, and people will have less need to take out health insurance.  People will still be able to access services in private hospitals with their private health insurance should they wish.  Our recommendations represent a significant part of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme of reform and map out a small number of policy actions which can be taken which would see the change implemented progressively in parallel with the wider health service improvements already under way in Sl&aacute;intecare.  The costs are phased in a way that makes the change affordable.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Who needs a formal title on it?  We all know it as the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  </p> <p>  Can I ask Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir about one of the things that is not recommended, maybe because it is so glaringly obvious it should not have needed recommendation?  If we are going to move to a world where we do not have private practice in public hospitals, which is something I and Fianna F&aacute;il support, we should not build new private facilities into new public hospitals.  Maybe it is just assumed that we would not do that if we are all signed up to removing private care.  However, as it happens, the Government is building dedicated private facilities into the new national children's hospital, and it is building very substantial private facilities - physically separate facilities - into the new National Maternity Hospital, which are both public hospitals and both built with public money.  </p> <p>  There is a line in the report which says the Government should send a clear signal that at some future date private activity will no longer be permitted in public hospitals.  It is not one of the key recommendations, but maybe because it is the kind of thing that one should not really have to recommend.  Does Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir believe there is any issue with dedicated, private facilities being built into the new children's hospital and the new maternity hospital in a world where we are trying to take private care out of public hospitals?</p></speech>

The terms of reference were pretty tight.  We had enough complicated issues to address not to mention taking on ones that we were not asked to look at.  As a committee, we do not have a particular view on that.  It would strike me that if one has no private practice in public hospitals, within ten years, it would be recommended that these facilities would have to be used for something else at the end of ten years.</p></speech>

It strikes me as an extraordinary up yours to Sl&aacute;intecare - not by Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir, obviously- by the Government to build physical private facilities in at a time when it says it is taking them out.  Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir referenced in his report and in his opening statement the idea that the vast majority of private care in public hospitals is coming from patients who have come through the emergency department, and one could argue, therefore, that removing those insurance payments is like saying there is no such thing as a private patient in a public hospital anymore.  One is coming in as a public patient.  If we are running a hospital, in essence all that would happen is that virtually the same number of patients would come in.  We would have to provide the same level of care to the same number of patients more or less, but we would have substantially less money to do it.  Obviously, we have to square that circle because we want to take the private care out of the public hospitals.  Is that a reasonable reflection of the current situation?</p></speech>

Nobody knows the answer to that; it is a judgment call.  We took a view that that might be a very optimistic assumption, and that it was likely if I ended up in an emergency department that I would probably stay there, in that I would not be transferred.  There might be some transfer.  If people accepted this proposal on the basis that it would free up a lot of capacity in public hospitals for public patients, that assumption might not be realised, and we were anxious to point out that when we embark on this policy proposal, it is not based on an assumption that would be unachievable and that would lead to disappointment.  It was a judgment call.  Some people will transfer, but my opinion and that of my colleagues is that there will not be a wholesale transfer.</p></speech>

One is going to have the same number of patients in the hospital, but one has less money to treat them.  One could argue that it is going to reduce capacity.</p></speech>

At the moment, insurance companies pay out I think &euro;2.5 billion.  If they do not give &euro;500 million to public hospitals, they only pay out &euro;2 billion.  Insurance premia should fall.  The tax relief on the insurance premia will fall.  From an Exchequer point of view, there is an effect, but from the point of view of the people out there, they are just paying for it in a different way.</p></speech>

One of the things I think this comes down to, from a financial perspective, is that we have bought into the principle, but we have to pay for the principle.  Does Dr. Keegan have a sense as to whether public hospitals, when they charge insurance companies for private work, fully recoup the costs with a bit of a margin?  Do they recoup less than the costs?  In other words, if one is running a hospital, and let us say 10% of one's patients are private patients, from the money one gets from them, is one covering the costs and does one have a little bit extra to spend on the public system, or is one losing a bit and having to subsidise private work with the public budget?</p></speech>

If we are talking about funding the removal of private care, it is pretty important whether or not we know if that private care is covering its costs right now.  What we could be doing, if the public system is getting the costs plus a margin, is stripping more money out of the public system, which the Exchequer's going to have to cough up for.  Neither Dr. Keegan nor Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir know.</p> <p>  Much of Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir's report focuses on changing the consultant contract, and we have an unusual consultant contract in Ireland which allows for this.  Just on a point of clarification, the new Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contract essentially would disallow private work in the public hospitals, but would it allow consultants do private work in private hospitals?  Could they do four days a week in a HSE hospital and then do Friday, Saturday or Sunday in a private hospital?</p></speech>

As long as they fulfil their public commitments, what they do in their spare time, whether they play golf or do something - teachers do grinds - was not something we were concerned about.  What we are concerned about, and what is going to be critical in this, is the negotiation of a new contract with flexible rostering - a proper consultant contract that would apply to most public servants, that they fulfil the requirements of the job on a full-time basis.  That is really where we are.</p></speech>

It is now much more representative of society and more people require more flexible working arrangements and the heath system has to accommodate that like everybody else.</p></speech>

However, there is a wide variance in how much money one can make in private practice versus public work, depending on specialty.  My understanding is that in emergency medicine, psychiatry, and other areas, there are very few private opportunities, but that in orthopaedics, plastics and other areas, one can make quite a lot of money.  Has Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir given any consideration to how one would treat specialties differently, depending on the opportunity cost, or would he do a blanket contract across the consultant body?</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly is right that if one gets a distribution of private earnings, it is quite skewed.  Some people have relatively little.  What we were keen to get was a critical mass of consultants onto this new contract, so that if one gets the bottom half of the distribution of private earnings to switch, one gets a significant number in the new contract.  Some people would find it very unattractive and might never want to give up their rights, which is why the ten-year legislation piece is quite important.  One is giving people ten years' notice.</p></speech>

On the basis that most of the private patients are still going to come into the public hospital, that assumption is probably untrue.</p></speech>

I ask Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir to bear with me for a second.  The first reason for doing it is that it will free up capacity in the public hospitals.  The data would suggest that that is probably not true.  The second reason for doing it is that it might free up financial resources, but if we do not know if private is subsidising or being subsidised by the public budgets, we do not know whether or not that is true.  There is an ideological reason.  None of us would stand over a situation where private patients jump the queue and get special treatment in public hospitals.  The ideological or principled statement still holds very strongly but the mechanics, the rationale and the improvements in the system do not.  Those arguments do not appear to hold, according to the report.</p><p>There is one other possibility, which concerns what this does to work within the hospitals.  For example, if any group of people end up making much more money by seeing private patients, then some people might have accused some consultants of being encouraged to make sure there were lots of private patients to see and that perhaps, within a given hospital, the same consultant treating patients in a public hospital might spend much more time taking care of their private patients than their public patients.  Other than the principle of removing private care, if it is not down to cost then it is not down to capacity, which does not seem to be the case, are there any other actual tangible advantages to doing it?  We want to improve the system for public patients.  Is anything Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir can see on a day-to-day basis that, in real healthcare terms, would improve?</p></speech>

It is that to me, it seems completely unacceptable that in a public institution, people are treated differently based on their income.  For example, my daughter is in primary school.  Would anyone think it was sensible if I could pay the teacher extra money to give her special attention in the class compared to other children?</p></speech>

At the moment, one of the reasons - insurance companies told us this - people buy insurance is that they perceive that they can get special treatment or jump the queue.</p></speech>

On Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir's reference to "ideological" being a pejorative term, it is not in my house.  It never was and I pride myself on consistency in that.</p> <p>  On the notion of private facilities within the confines of public facilities, I have a serious concern that although we are saying we want to remove private health care from the public system, which is good and laudable and there is cross-party support for Sl&aacute;intecare on the one hand, we can see two big facilities being built into which private care will be stacked on the other.  My fear is that if those consulting rooms and facilities were not available to private patients, they would be available for public patients and therefore would have an impact on the waiting lists.  </p> <p>  Perhaps this question is for Mr. Keegan because he outlined that while he did not have access to comparable routinely collected administrative data in private hospitals, he could collect some of it.  My difficulty is that does not give us the total cost.  We have asked the HSE repeatedly the cost to the public system of effectively subsidising private healthcare.  It is very difficult to put a money amount on it.  We previously have had people in here from the HSE who described to us what they called stretch income targets that are set for them, whereby they must collect a certain amount of money back from private health insurance.  This creates a perverse incentive.  I have never been able to see a definitive cost put on private healthcare.  We know the impacts on the waiting lists because clearly it will be public patients who will benefit from the availability of additional capacity.  On the actual cost, I refer to when a private patient is treated and where he or she skips the queue.  If two people with the same level of acuity happen to be in the accident and emergency unit - one with private health insurance and the other without - in my estimation, in all likelihood the person with private health insurance would be admitted in that instance.  If that person has already been in the accident and emergency unit, one cannot quantify the actual cost to the public system and the subsidy that is provided to the private system or am I wrong in that assumption?  Can it be quantified if so, how much is it?</p></speech>

There is activity-based funding now whereby there is a unit cost of care and for each discharge, there will be a complexity-associated score for that discharge.  One will also have information as to whether that discharge is public or private.  That captures the cost to the hospital.  For public patients, it will capture things like salary and consultant costs, nursing costs, non-pay costs and so forth.  For the private discharges, it will just capture the cost to the hospital and there would be no consultant costs included, which are paid separately by the insurer.</p> <p>  One could get an idea there of the expenditure but returning to Deputy Donnelly's point, the question is whether the income coming from the insurers actually covers that.  That is an issue that unfortunately we currently cannot get at.</p></speech>

This pokes a hole in the argument that we will fall off the edge of a cliff if that income is taken away.  The full extent of that income is not known because the level of subsidy cannot be identified.  This is a problem.</p> <p>  As for this State being an outlier, are there other examples from well-developed countries of people doing what we do in respect of the mix of private and public patients?  Internationally speaking, is the model we operate with its mix of public and private patients an outlier?</p></speech>

I note and thank Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir for moving very quickly to draw a line under the argument that we cannot afford this.

We need to pay people properly to do proper public service.  That is going to have to be done anyway, because the emergency salary cuts are going to be restored and we should get some value for that.</p> <p>  Moreover, the &euro;524 million that insurance companies pay hospitals is very unstable income.  There is a lot of talk about ephemeral corporation tax revenue but this is another element here.  If we do nothing and maintain the existing system, that money will drift away in any event.  People are waking up to the fact that when they are given this form in the emergency department, their treatment does not really change.  They may get slightly more attention from the private consultant but effectively, they are paying for something they get for nothing anyway.  This is putting up the cost of their insurance premia and the insurance companies are waging a very effective campaign to draw this to people's attention and this money collected is falling.</p><p>The question is how far will it fall.  I would not bet on this money continuing to be available.  People say our proposal would cost &euro;650 million, but if we maintain the existing system, we will have a lot of these costs.  It could be phased.  I pride myself on being somebody who is very concerned.  I have spent 40 years looking at the public finances.  I started in Revenue and we would not want to do anything stupid that would actually wreck the system.  I am satisfied that if we were to do this in an orderly and progressive way, it could be afforded.  It is a question of whether we want to do it.  How important is it and how important is the principle that people should be treated equally in the public system?</p></speech>

Without an increase in capacity and staff, waiting lists will not improve, but the changes would lead to an improvement for public patients to an extent because the system would not include people who were being fast-tracked on the same road beside them.  Ultimately, as Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir said, it comes down to whether there is the political will to do it.  I thank Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir for the report because it goes a long way towards us being able to encourage our colleagues to come along with us.</p></speech>

I am fully supportive of the report which is an excellent piece of work.  Like the previous speaker, I sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare for 11 months.  It is welcome that the report endorses the journey we were on.</p> <p>  This is totally doable.  It is really about ideology.  It is a "will we", not a "can we", question.  It is welcome that the Minister for Health has said he wants to do it and I hope his colleagues agree with him.  Tying it into the Sl&aacute;intecare timeline is completely achievable.</p> <p>  I have some questions about how we will do it, rather than if we do it.  Where I come from we are 100% in favour of doing it.  It is a core belief of my party.  In his opening statement Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir said, "significant progress can be made relatively quickly."  What are the three or four steps a Government should take?  The cost of this measure would be cumulative over a number of years.  While they do not all have to be financial, some of them will have to be and obviously there may be an immediate impact.  What are the three or four immediate steps Dr de Buitl&eacute;ir believes the Government should take to implement it?</p></speech>

The most important thing is that new consultant appointments should be made under the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.  That would mean restoring pay and having new contracts for new consultants.  It is critical that this be done early.  The longer we continue to issue the existing contract we are pushing up costs because we would have to buy them out.  If consultants are given contracts and we then want them to change to something else, they will have to be bought out.  It is a normal rule of life that if one is in a hole, one stops digging and making the problem bigger.  With the legislation and getting the newer consultants onto the Sl&aacute;intecare contract, the third piece would be getting into negotiations on the contract change payment.  We did not put a number on it because it would be a matter for negotiation or judgment.  The negotiations would try to get a reasonable number of the 3,000 consultants working under the existing arrangements onto the new ones.  They are the three things I would do early.</p></speech>

In my next question I am asking for his personal opinion.  I am aware that the terms of reference have been defined.  I am a huge supporter of the national maternity strategy, but it is way behind.  We are all aware of the issues surrounding the national children's hospital.  There will also be other developments.  Given that the Government supports it and while not all politicians will support it, most will, should we not just block having private facilities in public hospitals or public healthcare facilities under construction?  I am probably asking this questin based on what is contained in the report.</p></speech>

In fairness to the witnesses, the report is excellent, but this was not part of Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir's terms of reference.  The Government has committed to implementing this report, the Minister said he supported it, but now its author, in a personal capacity, has articulated the question: what is the point in having these facilities if we are going to implement this report?  They will be redundant.  Is there not a significant issue, which many of us have been raising here for a considerable time, with the implementation of the national children's hospital and the national maternity strategy?  We can probably pull the latter back because the Government does not have the capital funding to carry out much of it at present, as people in my area know.  However, do we need to write to the Minister and the Department of Health about this, based on what we have heard today?  Perhaps we should talk about the matter at another point.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir for his responses and his honesty.</p></speech>

Dealing with the pay issue will help considerably.  There is significant support for dealing with that issue, recruitment and retention and so on.

According at the Revenue income distribution tables, the recommended salaries that would be paid to consultants would put them in the top 0.7% of income earners in Ireland.  I think that was the figure when I worked it out.  Adding to that the public service pension, these are attractive posts, so it should be possible to recruit people of the requisite standard to do the work in public hospitals.  If that turns out not to be the case, we may have to consider adjusting the salary in future to ensure that people can be attracted.</p></speech>

I will ask a couple of questions.  First, I know that this may not have been specifically mentioned in Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir's brief, but to what extent have private patients in the public hospital system tried to jump the queue?  Is it happening and, if so, to what extent?</p></speech>

It is a big selling point for insurance.  We asked the question to what extent.  We cannot get the data, but the people who have experience of the system experience it in their day-to-day lives.  They have a perception that if they do not have private health insurance, they will be disadvantaged in some way.</p></speech>

We all get replies to parliamentary questions in which we are told that nobody can speed up the process.  We do not want the process speeded up; we want it dealt with such that people are not forever moved from the back of the queue to the middle or the front of the queue but moved along the system.  I have no ideological hang-ups, good, bad or indifferent.  As far as I am concerned, the patient who requires treatment should have access to effective, second-to-none treatment as quickly as possible - and throughout the European Union, for that matter.</p><p>I emphasise that we need to get some evidence of that, otherwise large numbers of people will waste their money by providing for something they can get through the private system in any event.  It is not clear why those patients are paying through the private system and going through the public system to ensure they can get through the public system quickly.  It is an expensive way to go about it and it is a duplication that will cause snarl-ups in the system.  Based on the examination of everything that happens in the system, has anything been discovered that we cannot see from our vantage point?</p></speech>

The additional capacity is 3,000 beds by 2030 as far as I recall, which may be something the committee teases out in its later session about all the other improvements.  This is just one part of a programme to improve the health service for the people.  It is an important part of that but it is not the only part.  A lot of other things happen.  For example, one of the key problems is the availability of diagnostics.  Apparently, it is quite slow to get access to diagnostics in the public system but access to diagnostics can be had much more quickly in the private system Dublin.  That means a patient can have the evidence of diagnosis more quickly and that puts him or her up the queue because he or she knows what his or her health condition is compared to someone who does not know because they have to wait.  That is an important part of the programme to improve the health service.</p></speech>

The vast majority of private care in public hospitals is emergency care.  If one is hit by a car for example, it does not matter if one is a private or public patient.  One will not jump a queue and will be seen in the same time by the same consultants.  The value of holding private health insurance in that context has to be questioned.  The benefit of skipping the queue is only seen only for a small proportion of private activity.</p></speech>

We were told all along that we had too many hospital beds and we did not need them.  We were admonished at a high level for spending money on bricks and mortar because it was seen as unnecessary, and different ways were to be found to deal with patients in the future.  That did not happen.  It now appears we were misinformed by people who should have known better.  We have now moved to another scenario.  I realise that in the position we find ourselves, conditions in the workplace, insofar as our hospitals are concerned, are not ideal.  That is presumably down to overcrowding and the pressure on consultants, staff, doctors, GPs and everybody else.  Our system is not large enough to cater for the population, which  I understand.</p> <p>  However, how do we compete?  We have been told by the HSE that in appointing consultants, we have to compete with New York, Boston, Sydney and London, and if we do not, we will not get the staff.  The independent review group held exchanges with the various stakeholders and reference was made to consultants' pay, which was the subject of a considerable increase that will put them among the best paid in the world.  There are a couple of other issues we cannot deal with.  We cannot offer the 24 hours a day of sunshine they have to offer in Australia.  That is a decided disadvantage in attracting high-calibre people to high-calibre positions in this country.  Similarly, we cannot compete with Canada and we cannot compete with the weather conditions in many areas, including in the Middle East.  Are there issues other than consultants' pay that the independent review group considers might make that sufficient impact?  We have asked this question on a number of occasions and we have not been given an answer.  What is the total cost of that?  Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir made a stab at that in terms of the millions of euro required on an annual basis, which is hugely important.  It would probably result in a cost of approximately &euro;6 billion over a ten-year period.  We tried to get that information from some of our guests in recent weeks.  They were reluctant to tell us exactly the cost but they should be able to tell us because if there is dissatisfaction with the system as it is, it must be possible for those directly involved to identify what the problem is and to identify that it needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Working conditions, rostering and the lack of proper facilities are all pertinent issues.  Money is a factor in respect of hygiene in the workplace.  It is one aspect but it is not the whole story and the problem will not be solved by just throwing money at it, even though we are going to do that anyway because there is a commitment to unwind the &euro;131,000 annual pay threshold at some stage, although there is debate about the timing.</p></speech>

The additional costs arise mainly from the loss of private income of public hospitals but also in relation to consultant pay - for those taking up the public-only contract - and the increased cost of treating greater numbers of public patients, and we have set out the final costs at the end of ten years and it comes to approximately &euro;650 million per annum.</blockquote></speech>

It will be &euro;650 million at the end of the period.  By the way, if things stay as they are, nothing will change and some of these costs will be there anyway because consultants' pay will have to be restored.  The money coming from insurance companies is unstable as well.  It is similar to corporation tax receipts.  It would be foolish to bank on that continuing as permanent income.  To say all that is lumped into the cost of this proposal is an exaggeration.  A lot of that money will have to be paid out anyway.  While there is a cost, the people are already paying for this.  This would change the method by which they pay.  When I get my annual bill from my health insurance company, which is due next month, I do not regard it is as voluntary.  It would be a big risk for me to decide not to have health insurance anymore because one never knows what might happen.  If, for example, that was transferred and my premium reduced, I would be content if my taxes went up a little to pay for it.  There is an Exchequer cost to this but the Exchequer is not the whole story.</p></speech>

What is the extent to which he feels that impacts on the efficient delivery of health services?  What intervention is required apart from making the staff permanent?  I fail to see why that cannot be done.</p></speech>

Sometimes locum or agency nurses are in a workplace for one day and they are not there the next day so there is no continuity.  The Chairman will be able to better inform us on that than I would but it seems to be fairly obvious.</p></speech>

The review group's report shows that since 2009 the total number of doctors, including junior doctors, has increased from slightly over 7,000 to more than 9,400, an increase of 33% increase.  In the same period, the number of consultants increased by more than 1,000.  The number of consultants has, therefore, increased by approximately one third.  I agree with what Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir said about the excellent Hanly report.  Many of Hanly's recommendations need to be implemented much faster.</p> <p>  This morning we discussed the idea of private practice being take out of the public hospital system.  I have no problem with that idea.  The number of outpatient appointments in public hospitals stands at approximately 3.5 million per annum.  As such, around 63,000 people attend outpatient appointments each week.  The review group's report states that 1,333 consultants have access to private rooms on site only and 600 consultants have access to rooms off-site in private hospitals and clinics.  This means nearly 2,000 of more than 3,000 consultants do some form of private practice.  Let us take a consultant employed in the public system who also sees 20 patients a week privately.  If we average that figure over 2,000 consultants, it equals 40,000 appointments per week.  Taken over 52 weeks, we have 2 million appointments per annum.  Could the public system with its current structure absorb an extra 2 million outpatient appointments?</p></speech>

I ask Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir to look at the figures for off-site consultations by consultants who have public contracts but also do private work outside of the hospital.  If he adds up the figures, he will find that consultants see 2 million outpatients privately.  What could happen is that private practice that is totally disconnected from the HSE could develop further.</p> <p>  I understand the new contract allows doctors to do private work but not outside the hospital.  In other words, consultants cannot go off-site at any stage.  The current contract is for 39 hours per week.  If a consultant wants to do extra hours but is not allowed to do these in the hospital, it reduces the amount of work that he or she can do.  Does Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir agree?</p></speech>

They may be on call every second or third weekend.  It is not just about the 39-hour element of the contract.  It is also about the on-call element of the contract.

I will mention as an example the case of someone who wants to do research, is unable to do it within the HSE structure, but is able to do it in connection with a third party.  Under his or her contract, he or she might be restricted from doing the research.  One of the big complaints we hear from many consultants is that they are not given an opportunity to do research to help to develop further the care they can provide.  That is a simple example of what I am talking about.  In this case, the off-site work that they are not allowed to do is research and development work.</p></speech>

Twelve consultants have left CUH to work privately.  One of the reasons they chose to walk away from the salaries they were getting, and to go working privately, is that they believed they were unable to do things they were good at.  They felt that working privately would give them the freedom to do such things.  Twelve very good consultants have left the system in Cork.</p></speech>

One of the challenges in the present system is that consultants who want to do a lot of work in addition to what is provided for in the contract are unable to do that under the HSE structure.  I am not sure whether we can develop the system sufficiently quickly to recruit people while retaining the people we have.</p></speech>

I would like to make some comments.  Most members of the joint committee sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, which produced the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The fundamental principle we were trying to introduce as part of the efforts to move private practice out of public hospitals was that preferential treatment would not be given to patients with private health insurance.  It was suggested as a strategy that there should be a common waiting list for private or public patients with no preferential treatment.  The idea was that people should be treated on the basis of need and not on the basis of whether they are insured.</p> <p>  When we looked at other countries, we learned that Ireland is an outlier in this regard.  In other countries where there is private health insurance, supplementary insurance gives people additional access to services but not additional access to public services.  In France, for example, one can have top-up insurance if one wishes.  It allows one to access private facilities, but it does not give one any preferential treatment in the public system.  Everybody in Ireland is essentially entitled to free public care in a public hospital, regardless of insurance status, with the caveat of paying &euro;800 a year, or &euro;80 a day for ten days.  If someone with private health insurance ends up in a public hospital, that is bonanza money for the hospital.  It is almost an accident that the person who has ended up in the public hospital has health insurance.  The perverse incentive that arises in these circumstances has been outlined.  The hospital wants to maximise the insurance income and the insurance company wants to minimise the amount of money it pays out.  In fact, it is accidental money that comes in the door of the hospital, most likely through accident and emergency admissions.</p> <p>  It must be impossible to police the 20% private work that is allowed in a type B contract.  If there are not many private hospitals in an area, as is the case in the mid-west, the percentage of people with private health insurance who are treated in the hospital can increase to 40%.  We cannot refuse people treatment because they have private health insurance.  We have to look after them.</p> <p>  If there is to be a public-only contract, medical indemnity insurance will cover public-only contract work.  My understanding is that if one has a type B contract, a proportion of one's medical indemnity insurance is not covered through the public purse.  I presume that consultants with public contracts who choose to do private work outside their 39-hour contracts will have to take out additional medical indemnity insurance to cover their private work.  At the moment, they are probably getting an advantage because their public-paid medical indemnity insurance is covering much of their private practice.</p> <p>  We have discussed the cost of inpatient cover.  A substantial amount of private practice takes place in our public hospitals.  Private facilities are used for diagnostics.  A consultant who carries out a private clinic in a public hospital has access to all the public facilities to carry out his diagnostic tests and his follow-up work, at no cost to the insurance company and at no cost to himself as a practitioner.  I ask Dr. Keegan and Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir to comment on that.</p> <p>  We discussed the provision of elective-only hospitals in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  As a result of capacity constraints, most people who are admitted to hospital come through accident and emergency departments.  This involves urgent work.  Elective work is being pushed out of public hospitals because they do not have the capacity to cope.  Most of the work that is being carried out in public hospitals now is emergency care, urgent cancer care or perhaps some elective day-care procedures.  More and more, the work in our public hospitals is urgent work.  Unless we provide elective-only hospitals, we will never clear our waiting lists for elective work.  I ask the witnesses to comment on these issues.</p></speech>

I had another meeting which went on.  </p> <p>  I sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  Although this issue was part of it, I felt it was ideological in terms of the proposals for how it should be done.  I get what Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir is saying in that staff numbers are the same, as is the number of sick people who require care.  His response to Senator Colm Burke was that it was just about moving people to receive treatment in the public system.  </p> <p>  On the 39-hour contract, the lack of autonomy is an issue for consultants.  I am not sure if the research and development element is an issue in the context of the 39-hour week.  Obviously, their contracts would have to have on-call and other activities sewn into them.  On restricting someone at the top of his or her game professionally to a 40-hour week, is it anyone's business if they want to work 15 hours somewhere else?  I am not saying they should or should not, but I wonder if this is the way to bring the profession with us.</p> <p>  We have heard in the last couple of sittings of the committee that there is a very significant draw from the public into the private sector.  Senator Colm Burke referenced the situation in Cork where 12 or 14 consultants have left Cork University Hospital to move to the Bon Secours Hospital.  A number of dermatologists have left Beaumont Hospital, while an emergency department consultant recently left Tallaght Hospital to move to the Beacon Hospital.  With this in front of us, how do we pull them back?  Is the stick rather than the carrot approach the way to do it?  No amount of discussion here will make a consultant return from a private hospital to the public system.  With all the ideology in the world, we still need consultants to deliver care.  I am not sure how what is in front of me shows that is possible.</p> <p>  I refer to the figure of &euro;650 million a year and Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir saying it is going up to that amount.  I sat on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and get that it is building up to that amount.  Every year there is an increase in the health budget and the money seems to be absorbed into a bottomless pit.  My concern is that the &euro;650 million will be layered constantly into the overall budget with no improvements in service in return.  It might be &euro;250 million one year and then &euro;650 million, but I cannot see how we can show that money will improve services to the extent that it will encourage people to stop paying for private health insurance because they are happy with the public system.  Am I wrong in saying that?</p></speech>

I had four very helpful colleagues who made a significant contribution to this work and our considered view is that it can be done.  As such, it is now a matter for the political system.  It is a question of values and whether one believes it is proper that people in a public institution should be treated equally, regardless of their ability to pay.  That is a question for the political system.  I remember when equal pay was introduced in 1974, some said we could not afford it, but it is a question of values.  There are some issues where one either believes something or one does not.  If one believes it and wants to make the change, my committee was able to establish that it could be done, albeit there would be a price.  It is up to the political system to decide, in the face of competing priorities, whether achieving the goal of equal treatment in a public institution is worth it.  That is a deeply political question.</p></speech>

We can have political ideology and all of that, but beliefs and thoughts do not produce consultants and deliver better services.</p></speech>

A salary of &euro;131,000 is not sufficient.  If one goes to &euro;182,000 and we find in the light of experience that it is not enough, a future public service pay commission will have to look at it.  We have to pay people the salaries that attract them.  For example, it was found recently in respect of two critical posts, namely, chief executive of the HSE and Garda Commissioner, that the initial salary offered was insufficient.  It was, therefore, adjusted.  That is what we have to do.  I am not pretending that we have all of the answers, but if we want to have a decent health service, we will have to pay people properly to deliver it.  By the way, there are very few of these people.  There are 3,000 consultants in a population of 4.5 million and half their pay comes back in tax.  The incremental cost of paying people properly to deliver a public service is a rounding error.</p></speech>

We are well aware of the power of lobbying and large corporations in the private sector.  That will always occur.  Can we win the battle?  Are those of us who want to deliver a uniform service to which everyone will have equal access based on need rather than ability to pay fighting a battle we cannot win?  Major investors who have invested huge money to siphon off the bread and butter operations and elective surgeries - the handy stuff - have shareholders who want to achieve a return on their investment.  We are on the other side seeking to deliver healthcare services.  How do we avoid losing out to them?  Does Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir envisage that the larger private hospitals, the names of which we all know, will only be offering cosmetic surgery and bits and bobs in ten years' time?  What does he see as the future for them?  How will standards in the public service increase while the corporations move away?</p></speech>

We are a complete outlier where 50% of people think they have to have private health insurance, some of which is for non-advanced plans that only apply in a public hospital.  That market would decline.  An international benchmark of about 15% would be typical.  We can get a high-performing public system with the Sl&aacute;intecare programme and the private system can go off and supplement that or compete with it.</p></speech>

On the fallout from private hospitals, maybe this is a question for Dr. Keegan but there is anecdotal evidence that it has emerged that some treatments are being done in private hospitals, especially in the field of elective cosmetic surgery, and then the sick person is ending up in the public system.  If the damage is done in a private hospital and then the patient arrives into the public hospital, is there any recourse for the public system in cleaning up the mess it has had nothing to do with publicly?  The patient is obviously a public patient at this point but how does the public system manage the fallout from possibly unnecessary operations when it has plenty of people who require necessary and urgent operations?  I have seen an emergence of people being admitted from elective cosmetic surgeries recently.  How do we deal with that situation where the likes of St. James's Hospital ends up with a person who has undergone a botched procedure?  Do we bill them?</p></speech>

Without that, we cannot really understand if something is happening in the private hospital system that is then becoming a burden or a cost in the public system.  It is only anecdotal at the moment.  To flesh that out and really get an understanding of the relationships between the private system and the public system, we need better data collection from the system as a whole.  That is an important point.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the fact that the new national children's hospital and the new national maternity hospital will have dedicated and separate private facilities.

I want to clarify something because statements were made here earlier that are grossly unfair to our healthcare professionals.  It was suggested, not by our witnesses, that private patients going into accident and emergency departments in Ireland would receive more favourable treatment than non-private patients.  To the best of my knowledge that is absolutely untrue and would be a grossly unfair and scurrilous thing to say about our emergency medicine healthcare professionals and all the other healthcare professionals in our hospitals.  I believe that was implied pretty directly earlier on in the committee and from my perspective, that is fundamentally untrue.  If one walks into one of our accident and emergency departments, he or she can sign the form to indicate he or she has private insurance or not, but our healthcare professionals will treat them regardless.  I just wanted to state that.  What was said earlier on-----</p></speech>

I want to disassociate myself from any suggestion there is preferential emergency care in this country.  Not for a moment am I suggesting the witnesses implied there was.</p> <p>  Maternity care is a good example of where a lot of women, if they can access and afford private care, will go for it.  The main reason one hears for that decision is the woman wants the same consultant.  She feels that if she goes in and is dealing with one obstetrician the whole way through, that is really valuable.  Has the independent review group looked at how those real concerns can be dealt with if we remove the option for women to avail of private maternity care, thereby removing the option to avail of having the same obstetrician through the care and delivery?</p></speech>

I would like to bring it back to the patients.  Let us put the consultants aside for a minute and ask how things would be affected for patients.  The ESRI report is good in the numbers it gives on what is going on in our public hospitals.  Those numbers will come as a surprise to many people.  For example, three quarters of the beds in public hospitals have people in them who have come through the accident and emergency departments.  Most people probably intuitively think the number is much smaller but three of every four beds in our public hospitals are filled with patients who have come in from the accident and emergency departments.  Whether we take private practice out of public hospitals or not, three of the four beds will still be filled with those people.  We will still have to care for them but we will have a lot less money because we will no longer be taking money from the insurance companies.  Three out of four beds will still be full with the same people but we will be behind because we will not be getting paid for any of that, whereas we were getting paid for about one in five of those patients.  That leaves one of every four beds.  The vast majority of those bed days are for public patients.  The ESRI report shows that less than 4% of the bed days in public hospitals are for elective private care.  That is the only bit that would change because the people will still come through the accident and emergency departments.  Less than one on 30 of the beds would have people in them who may not have been in them if we took elective private care out.  On the basis that some of those patients are in the public hospitals because the public hospitals might be able to deal with more complex matters, of those one in 30 beds, a load of them will still be filled.  Those patients will have to go through the public system because they will be availing of public facilities.  Let us assume that if we remove private practice from public hospitals, in reality it will free up about one bed in 50 in our public system.  That is broadly what it will do and that is the actual change we will see.  At the same time, we will also remove the money that pays for that one bed in 50.  We would not suddenly have one bed in 50 free and have doctors and nurses ready to treat the public patient who would go into that bed.  We are not funding that and we have a lot less money available because we are not taking any money in from the patients from the accident and emergency department.</p><p>If we just said that in principle it is no longer allowed to have private care in public hospitals, one bed in 50 might be freed up but we would not have the money to pay for that bed or for the doctors or nurses, and we would have significantly less money available to treat the patients in the other 49 beds.</p><p> I fundamentally and wholeheartedly agree with the principle of equal care in public hospitals, and I think it is enough that it is a principle.  The narrative to date has been that doing this will somehow reduce waiting lists and improve access for public patients.  Based on the analysis we have been given, it will do the opposite.  It will reduce capacity for public patients, thereby increasing waiting lists.  Is this a reasonable analysis of the numbers we have just seen?</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly asked a question about continuity of maternity care.  A fundamental reason women and their partners go for private maternity care is the continuity of care with a consultant.  I understand that people are not always guaranteed the same consultant but, in my experience, a consultant will introduce the patient to his or her colleague as the consultant who will look after the patient when the original consultant is on holidays and that he or she is aware of the situation.  Women want this.  They do not want to be examined by somebody different every time, particularly with complex pregnancies.  They want the assurance that they do not have to tell the whole story every time they go in for a check-up.  It is regrettable this was not examined because it is a key reason for private health insurance.  My only access was at that time.  It is a critical point in people's lives and there is definitely a desire for continuity of care.</p> <p>  With regard to the children's hospital, the committee has heard there will be four or six suites for private paediatric care.  While I understand why this is, if this is where we are going, it sends the wrong message to have private rooms in the new hospital.  I understand why the contract is as it is and why doctors want it but it seems wholly unfair that if my child has an eye problem that is not an emergency and Deputy Donnelly's child has a similar eye problem but he does not have private insurance, one of the children will get preferential care in the new hospital.</p></speech>

They may not necessarily get the same personal contact with the same doctor.  With regard to maternity care, the public system is excellent and superb.  Irish maternity care provides one of the top services in the world with regard to maternal and infant mortality.</p> <p>  We will have to finish this session, unfortunately, at 11.30 a.m.</p></speech>

I was a member of the Sl&aacute;intecare committee chaired by my able colleague, Deputy Shortall.

I welcome Ms Laura Magahy, executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office, Dr. Colm &Oacute; Conaill of the Department of Health, Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategic and planning officer with the HSE, Ms Ciara Mellett, Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office and Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Healy, chairwoman of the Sl&aacute;intecare citizen and staff engagement and empowerment steering group.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have made to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Magahy to make her opening statement, which I believe is in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.</p></speech>

I will provide an update by way of the opening statement and then we will take questions.  We are one year into implementation.  I first met the committee a year ago when the office was being set up.  I wish to update the committee on what we are doing in terms of the action plan and where that is at.  Then I will step back a little, say what we have done and analyse the implementation to date in terms of what are the foundational steps we have taken, what key enablers we have been able to put in place, what the next steps will be and what the dependencies are on that.</p> <p>  The slide shows where we were last year.  We very much value the ongoing opportunity to update the committee on a quarterly basis and to get its input.  The effort we are making in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office is based on an all-party Oireachtas approach and we cannot do it without the continuing support of the committee, which we welcome.</p> <p>  The implementation advisory council has also met four times so far during the year.  That is under the chairmanship of Dr. Tom Keane.  We have very good input and advice from the council.  We very much appreciate its work.  The implementation office was set up in quarter 1 of this year, in January.  We published our action plan, which has taken a very programmatic approach to translating the vision of the all-party Oireachtas committee into the first year of its implementation.  We are embarking now on the action plan for 2020 to 2022.</p> <p>  In terms of governance we also have the high-level delivery board, comprising the Secretaries Generals of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Public Expenditure and Reform and Health, plus the chief executive of the HSE and me.  The board discusses issues of cross-departmental importance to Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  I am delighted that Mr. Dean Sullivan is present.  Since the advent of the new HSE board, we have put in place oversight taking a joint implementation approach for two key programmes that need to be rolled out in the coming years.  We have established a joint implementation approach to that, which feeds through into direct oversight by the Minister.  That is the system of governance.  It is now well-established and is working well.  It gives grounding to a programmatic and systematic implementation.</p> <p>  Our action plan update, as of September, is going to the Government next week.  I am pleased to share that we have taken our workstreams approach through the action plan and that we have reported on all of the different elements through the action plan.  The summary is that 114 deliverables were due by September and we are 93% on track.  As for the eight that are off track; they will be back on track by the end of this year.  That is the reason we put them into the orange category.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work that has been done by colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to bring these deliverables to bear.  Our office is there to make sure that things happen; we are not doing a lot of the work.  Where things go off track, we have an input and we are there to make sure things stay on track.  We acknowledge the work that has happened.  We are 93% on track and will be there by the end of the year.</p> <p>  I will analyse where we are with the implementation process.  I have categorised the process into foundational decisions without which we could not have moved forward.  These have all taken place and were deliverables in the action plan.  They have all taken place since we came into office.  In the past year the decision was made on the six new regional health areas.  On the previous occasion I was before the committee I asked if we could please stay with the plan and do it because we knew there was not unanimous agreement on regional health areas but everyone stayed with it.  I acknowledge that and thank the committee members and the system for staying with that because it is a foundational piece.  That allows us to plan for six integrated regional plans.  I will come to that later.</p> <p>  The second foundational decision was to get the new HSE board and CEO in place.  That is already putting a discipline around what is happening.  We have a very good working relationship with the HSE through the new CEO and with the deputy director general, Mr. Dean Sullivan, who is present.  A third foundational piece was the GP contract, again, without which we could not move forward.  It was a key enabler especially in the context of chronic disease management and that will be rolled out from next year.  Another key enabler is the enhanced nurse contract, which will make sure services can move seamlessly between the hospital and community.</p> <p>  A fifth piece we have been very pleased to see being put in place is through the office of Dr. Colm Henry.  He has had a national clinical programmes review and made recommendations on what happens next in regard to them.  They are important because if we say we are going to have six regional plans, we need them to be done in a national context.  Not every region can go off and design its own way of doing things.  It must be done in such a way that we have one national cancer programme, one neurorehabilitation strategy and there are many other strategies that are national and that can be interpreted in a regional way.  Putting that foundational piece in place has been extremely good.</p> <p>  We considered the multi-annual commitment to recruiting staff in the community as another important piece that was put in through the budget because it allows us to plan in a multi-annual way.  As members are aware, that is unusual because most service plans are done on an annual basis so we are very pleased that we will have visibility into the future for those.  We want and need more of that.</p> <p>  In terms of foundational decisions, the dialogue forum has been a critical initiative to strengthen the relationship with voluntary providers.  As members are aware, section 38 and 39 organisations are a significant part of the system.  Putting the dialogue forum in place following the Catherine Day report is another very important foundational decision.  Those are not everything but they are the ones I have picked out for today.  There will be more in the action plan that will be released next week.</p> <p>  Next I wish to focus on some of the key enablers that have been put in place.  The forum that has been put in place to look at the oversight implementation of the role of public health doctors, in particular in the context of regional planning, is important.  If we are to have population-based planning we need an enhanced public health doctor role.  The conversations that are happening at the moment through the office of the chief medical officer in the Department and our HSE colleagues with the public health doctors will be concluded by the end of this year.  They are a key enabler.</p><p>The postgraduate medical education strategy forum, which is being chaired by Mary Doyle, is another really important initiative.  This forum is looking at long-term postgraduate medical education and how it will be planned into the future.  </p><p> We cannot have a shared care record or an electronic health record unless we have an individual health identifier office, which was put in place this year and is being staffed.  The individual health identifier numbers have come across from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Again, if this had not happened, we would not be able to roll out our shared records so this was a very important key enabler.  </p><p> I consider e-pharmacy to be extremely important and one of the first and most important pieces of a shared care record.  We have put the governance in place through the HSE to roll that out as urgently as possible.  Regarding the joint initiative between the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health on housing options for our ageing population, an implementation group chaired by Leo Kearns has been set up.  If we are to keep people well and keep them in their own homes for as long as possible, looking at alternatives to nursing homes is critical.  This group produced a very good strategy which an implementation group is examining to make sure it is rolled out.  </p><p> Mr. Sullivan and I put an elective hospital oversight group in place.  We know that the Government made the decision to have elective hospitals in Galway, Cork and Dublin but we need to address this issue in a national context in order that everybody in the country is covered for elective care.  Those groups are working with us.  The timeframe for the group's deliberations is 12 weeks and it is progressing very well.  A clinical lead for trauma has been appointed.  Mr. Sullivan is leading on this project, which involves naming and rolling out trauma centres in Dublin.  A decision will be made on that in the next two months.  </p><p> I have not addressed every issue but I have highlighted areas that are very important and without which we would not be able to move forward.  There is a commitment to have a single assessment tool.  The preferred bidder is being selected and that will be rolled out from February.  Selecting and rolling out the single assessment tool is a key enabler.  </p><p> I will now discuss the budget allocation for Sl&aacute;intecare in 2020.  The budget contained many initiatives that are what I would call Sl&aacute;intecare-friendly but these initiatives specifically come into our section.  We are very pleased that we have the enhanced community fund, a multi-annual fund to hire up to up to 1,000 therapists, nurses and other front-line staff to care for people in the community, including advisers for people with dementia.  This will allow us to treat people in the community closer to their own homes, thereby reducing community waiting lists.  I am happy to discuss how this will be rolled out when we come to questions but it is very important.  We cannot move people out of hospital unless we have the capacity in the community to do so.  The all-party Oireachtas committee's report was very clear on that.  The allocation for the fund will rise to &euro;60 million in 2021.</p><p> I will describe a few projects covered by the integration fund of &euro;20 million.  There has been a huge response from the system in terms of ideas for doing things better and in a different way and scaling good ideas.  The &euro;12 million care redesign fund is about providing care at the least form of complexity, in accordance with the clinical care programmes, to people in the right location.  Again, this is very good work that we need to scale.  It is all about moving people out of hospital to the place of least complexity, as appropriate.   </p><p> I am happy for Ms Healy to take more questions on citizen and staff engagement but I will touch on a few matters.  We have a very good response from the system, particularly from staff.  Everybody is now talking about Sl&aacute;intecare and how they are doing things in the Sl&aacute;intecare way.  They talk about Sl&aacute;intecare in action and how they can do things in a more integrated and joined up way.  It has become very much a language as well as action across the system.  We have been very careful to engage with all the different healthcare professionals, such as nurses and doctors, including at conferences, to hear their suggestions about doing things in a different and more joined up way.  We have received a very good response and that this is embedded across the system.  More work needs to be done but there has been a very good start.</p><p> In respect of wider citizen engagement, we have been carrying out joint initiatives with Healthy Ireland.  A very interesting Health Reform Alliance event was held last week and other consultation events with citizens have been held.  We have also worked with staff around values in action, conferences and briefings.  We welcome our engagement with this committee and elected representatives through the quarterly action plan report, committee attendance and other briefings, as needed.  We are always open to discussing any aspect of the process with members or their colleagues.</p><p> I mentioned the integration fund because it was a highlight during the year when so many interesting projects applied for funding.  A total of 477 applications were received, of which 122 projects were successful.  They are found all around the country.  The little dots in the slide represent the locations around the country.  The goal was to promote the engagement and empowerment of citizens in the care of their own health, to scale and share examples of best practice and processes for chronic disease management and care of older people in particular, and to encourage innovations in the shift of care to the community or provide hospital avoidance measures.  We received very interesting ideas, some of which involved scaling existing things while others proposed new initiatives.</p><p> I will discuss some sample projects.  Jigsaw Online is an e-mental health platform.  Jigsaw is very engaged and involved in youth mental health and the e-mental health platform the organisation is setting up for young people is a very interesting project.  Other examples of projects include one by Epilepsy Ireland and Alone's BConnect project.  Alone's project is very innovative.  It is talking about linking healthcare, social care and community care using technology and services.  Other projects include Beating Breathlessness by the Asthma Society; Cro&iacute;, West of Ireland Cardiac Foundation's MySl&aacute;inte community lifestyle programme; and Diabetes care in the mid-west.  The latter project was a very interesting one that involved a podiatry-led pathway for timely provision of footwear and orthotics in the community.  Basically, it was about preventing amputations through early intervention.  It is a critical project.  Another project involves rolling out FIT teams in Mullingar, Wexford and west Wicklow.  We know the FIT teams have been proven to work in Limerick and other places.  These teams go into hospitals, identify people in the emergency department and try to get early interventions so they stop older people in particular from having to be admitted to hospital and wrap the services around them.  It is a very good project.  There are around 300 staff within the integration fund projects.  As we know, the staff are the core of services and health and social care is all about services.  </p><p> We have work to do on eligibility and entitlement.  We are submitting a memorandum to Government on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, developing a roadmap for universal access and establishing an interdepartmental group on eligibility and entitlement.  We would love to discuss with the committee whether there should be a citizens assembly on the issue of eligibility and entitlement.  </p><p> Regarding access and capacity, I mentioned that two key programmes are being rolled out using a joint integration approach.  The left hand side of the slide details the regional integrated care areas, RICA, programme while the right hand side details the capacity-access programme.  We know we need to create more capacity in the system.  We know we need 2,600 more beds and more staff and that we must shift care from hospitals to the community and focus on prevention.  This framework provides an interesting way of approaching how we will do that and names projects to achieve this.  Some of the key ones to pull out are healthy living to scale patient empowerment integration fund programmes.  An awful lot of programmes in there involve patient empowerment, social inclusion and social prescribing.  We need to implement housing options for our ageing population.  They are just two initiatives.  With regard to enhanced community care, we need to recruit 1,000 new front-line community staff, implement alternative paths for unscheduled care and diagnostics and procure the shared care record.</p><p> On hospital productivity, we need to optimise usage of existing hospital beds and decide locations of elective hospitals and procure design teams for them.  These are the projects for next year and the year after in the context of the capacity plan.  It is very important that they are put in the right sequence and that decisions are made in the right order.</p><p> I shall now turn to regional integrated care areas.  We had a very good meeting with the chief executive officers of the hospital groups and the community organisations two weeks ago and we asked them if they would be willing, able and up for doing joint planning from the bottom up for each of the six regions.  They have come back and have nominated people they would like to be involved.  We also want to get patient representatives and representation from the section 38 and section 39 organisations, and from the public health doctors, in order that we can begin in earnest the regional planning for each of those six areas.  The approach we are taking is to: look at the population mapping and then to look at population needs; decide capacity planning requirements for each region; look at the enablers that need to be rolled out for the regions; and - critically - looking at the pathways of care per region.  In the next two weeks, we will have an interesting opportunity when Carolyn Gullery from Canterbury, which is often quoted as a very successful region, will come over to share her experience with and meet each of the six groups we have set up in order to look at these six integrated regional plans.  It will be very interesting and I am excited about that.  It is a great opportunity to get our regional planning right.</p><p> Deputy Shortall is interested in population profiling and how it is done.  Through the health intelligence section of the HSE we have done the population profiling for each of the six regions.  The profile is based on age and so on.  We can then plan what the services are that each of the regions has.  We have done that for each of the regions as a first step.</p><p> All of this work we are doing involves a number of dependencies.  We are quite clear about the steps we want to take and how we can roll it out, but we need to maintain the momentum that has been put down during this year, to continue the stakeholder buy-in and to ensure that we have the members' support.  If we do not have that support, if there is anything we can do better, we would be very open to that.  We also need the Government to continue to take key strategic decisions - because there are a number that need to be taken in the next short while - and to resource those decisions.  Depending on all of that, we are up for it, we are able and we have all of the structures and governance in place.  I thank the committee for its continued support.</p></speech>

One has to be able to get care when one needs it, it has to be high-quality in nature and it has to be at a price that does not cause a person undue financial hardship.  Unfortunately, we are moving rapidly in the opposite direction.  Access within the public health system is collapsing.  We have the worst level of access ever in the history of the State and we have by far the worst access to healthcare anywhere in the developed world.  It was getting better quite quickly but over the past five or six years, it has been growing rapidly worse.  Over the past three or four years, the decline has accelerated.  I fear that we have passed a tipping point whereby some of the negative feedback loops are reinforcing the damage already done.  Word has got out within the clinical community globally that Ireland may not be a great place to come and work as a doctor, nurse or midwife for reasons relating to working conditions, etc.  These things reinforce themselves.</p> <p>  Ms Magahy has a very good, attractive-looking slide in her presentation that illustrates the different parts of the system.  I made a few notes as I went through it.  In my area of Wicklow, mental health services pretty much do not exist.  I have no doubt that it is the same in many other areas.  They are now telling people that they are not even going to bother putting them on a waiting list because the service just does not exist any more.  Self-care in the advanced medical sense of having diagnostics and working with GP-led teams to manage one's own care also does not really exists.  Dentistry services exist but they are too expensive for most people to access in any meaningful way.  For the first time ever, in many instances it now takes several weeks to see a GP.  A group of pensioners in Wicklow town recently told me that if they call their GP regarding, for example, respiratory issues that need to be seen to immediately or the person could end up in the accident and emergency department, it can be three weeks before they are seen.  GP care has never been as hard to access.  That is if one can access it.  A new patient cannot actually get a GP pretty much anywhere in Wicklow any longer.  Occupational therapy appointments may take four years if one is a really severe case.  For a child to get access to speech and language appointments, it can be three, four or five years before he or she is seen.  In fact, they are beginning to send out letters now saying that it will be at least two years and that a time cannot be given because there is no money, resources or therapists.  This is the reality faced by children, mums and dads.</p> <p>  If one gets to a hospital, to St. Vincent's, for example, there could be a wait of a few days on a trolley.  A person would be lucky to get a bed.  People are terrified of having to go into accident and emergency departments.  Diagnostics have reached the point where people are just trying to borrow money to pay for private appointments because they are being told it could be six months, a year or two years before they can get the scans their doctors think they need.  If a person gets a scan and is referred for specialist care, it might be another year or two before he or she gets to see that doctor.  If that doctor says that an operation is required it could be another year or two years before that is done.  This is the reality.  Social workers in Wicklow have so few resources they are working out of their cars.</p></speech>

Bear with me.  We need to call this out.  I am not blaming Ms Magahy or her team for any of this, but there is a lot of talk about plans, governance, oversight, budgets and pilot projects.  The reality, however, is sick children, sick adults and sick pensioners who can no longer access healthcare in the State.  The only thing that really matters is when are they going to see a difference?  When will it be possible for a child with special needs to get help?  When will it be possible for an elderly person to be able to access his or her doctor when he or she needs to do so?  When are things going to actually improve for men, women and children who need healthcare?</p></speech>

I will come back to access in hospitals shortly.  This is why it was so important that the thousand therapists are being funded.  Prioritising the allocation of them to address community waiting lists, staffing of primary care centres and keeping people out of hospital is critical.  This is what we will be working through with Dean over the next couple of weeks.  The Deputy is absolutely right that Sl&aacute;intecare is all about moving care to the place of least complexity, trying to prevent things happening in the first place and resourcing of the community.  Our one mantra in the programme and implementation office was always "Let us resource the community properly and do it in an organised way".  Patients will see the benefits of that next year.  Will everybody see the benefits immediately?  Probably not.  Will there be a start?  Yes, there will.  That is the priority from our perspective.</p> <p>  The integration fund also has a large number of projects that address issues the Deputy has raised around mental health and older people.  Many of these are not simply pilots, many of them are scaling initiatives that have already been working properly but which needed resourcing and scaling.</p><p>Our goal is to get immediate, short-term improvements.  That is what will be put in place through next year.</p></speech>

Having done all this work, analysis and stakeholder engagement, has Ms Magahy come up with any reasons things have got so bad when funding has gone up by so much?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#W00700"><p>I will say two things in response.  First is our rising elderly demographic.  We are getting older and living longer, which is putting additional pressures on the system.  The older people are, the greater their demand on the health services.  That is a fact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.855" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#W00800"><p>That is a steady-state issue, though.  What we are seeing is access collapsing over a relatively short period, whereas the demographics have been tipping along for some time.  What has happened for access to collapse at the same time?  The extra &euro;5 billion that has gone into the system in the past four years comfortably covers demographics, so the funding is more than in place to deal with the demographics.  Does Ms Magahy have a sense of what else is happening that we are seeing such a collapse?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.856" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#W00900"><p>I do not think we are getting the turnaround time within our hospital system.  That is another thing we have identified.  We know that a large number of beds in hospitals - probably 1,600 beds at present - are suboptimised.  That is a large amount of capacity in the system that needs to be looked at.  As I said, Mr. Sullivan and I are jointly looking at capacity and immediate access to see what we can do about this.  Half of this is due to hospitals not being used optimally and approximately half is due to people who should be in different locations.  Deputy Donnelly mentioned respiratory illness.  We are outliers in terms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, occupancy in hospitals.  We need to put services around those people in the community.  That is part of what the integration fund is about, and the enhanced nurse contract will also help us to do that.  In alluding to all these key enablers in our presentation, we were trying to say those things will make a difference.  The GP contract and chronic disease management will make a difference, but going back to Deputy Donnelly's main point, we are not using optimally what we have.  That is my view, having looked at the figures.  We need to do more jointly with the HSE.  Does Mr. Sullivan wish to come in on that?</p></speech>

I am not sure I would describe access as having collapsed.  The lists were unacceptable a year ago, and they are still unacceptable now.  It is a key priority for the HSE, the Department and the Minister to tackle those waiting times, not just for themselves but because of what they mean for individuals waiting for care and the concern and waste the issue causes in the system in terms of patients cycling through it, going back to their GPs, tipping up to emergency departments and so on.  Tackling this is an absolute priority of the organisation I am in and Ms Magahy.  We need to recognise, though, that the work to which Ms Magahy alluded, the PA Consulting capacity planning work commissioned by the Department just over a year ago, has flagged up material capacity shortfalls in the system.  Efforts are being made to address those.  That is the reality.  That work also recognises, as Ms Magahy said, that there are opportunities to use more effectively the capacity we have.</p> <p>  I will make a final point, which is again consistent with the Government's commitment around all this.  Ms Magahy referred to the &euro;12 million care redesign fund.  That will be targeted at, among other things, the access issue and delivery of care in a different way and in different settings of lower complexity.  There is also an uplift in funding for the NTPF this year within the letter of determination from &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million.  That funding will be very helpful in trying to tackle precisely the problem Deputy Donnelly talked about.  I am confident we will begin to see a change during 2020.  I think there are opportunities, especially on the scheduled care side of the house, where a lot of the waits to which the Deputy alluded are, to begin to make progress on that and to start to build confidence in all our stakeholders.  I think the unscheduled care will be more challenging.  The reality is that there is a demographic pressure there.  Admissions to hospital will continue to rise every year.  Capacity is tight.  We will make progress there but I do not think we will be as quick as with the progress on the scheduled care side of the house.  I hope, if we are back here in six to nine months, that we will begin to see that tanker starting to turn, but we can revisit the issue then.</p></speech>

We have analysis and detail on that so we need to stop doing that.  To do so, we need to be able to provide those services somewhere else, so it is not as simple as saying, "Stop doing that", because we need to provide alternatives.  We are in the process of doing so.  Some of this is accounted for by delayed discharges, and again the-----</p></speech>

Nobody wants to be in hospital if they do not need to be there, and we need to start providing alternative pathways.  We need to look at other professions and what they can do.  We need to look at what pharmacists could do.  We need to provide alternative treatment paths and not have everybody coming into the emergency departments.  That is part of it.  Then, as we said, there are very good initiatives happening but we need to scale them.  People are coming into emergency departments and being met by FIT teams, brought to other locations and treated in a better and much more humane way.  Things are happening in pockets around the system but we must scale them, standardise them and roll them out.</p></speech>

There are 11,000 hospital beds, as Ms Magahy's slides showed.  One of the key planks of the capacity and access process is to improve the efficiency with which we use beds, but we will never get to the end of that journey.  The opportunities Ms Magahy has flagged up are there and we need to tackle them.  There are other opportunities, however, from discharge once a patient is declared medically fit all the way through to, as Ms Magahy said, patients being admitted on the day of surgery, ideally, or on the day before.  Good progress is being made on that, but again there is further work to be done.</p></speech>

Ms Magahy said we might begin to see an appreciable difference next year, but the Sl&aacute;intecare report is already two or three years old and there has not been any difference.  In fact, the trolley wait figure for today is 551, and that figure hardly ever goes below 500.  What I am trying to tease out is where we will see an appreciable difference.</p></speech>

The unscheduled care is a more complex problem with hard capacity issues in there in terms of patients who, no matter how many community alternatives we have, will require admission to hospital.  That is flagged up in the PA review, which states that even today we are 1,000 beds light of what we would need to tackle the occupancy issue the Deputy was talking about.  That is why we have to continue to apply pressure on the unscheduled care side of things and control.  I think it will be a slower improvement but on the scheduled care side-----</p></speech>

We discussed it this morning.  I refer specifically to the fact that the national children's hospital will have a private facility, and that the new maternity hospital has planned on having a private facility.  Is there a little bit of a contradiction there in terms of Government policy?</p></speech>

I absolutely have a view on de Buitl&eacute;ir in that it is part of what the original Oireachtas committee agreed to do.  The report is very logical and while it looks at doing things over a longer timeframe than was originally envisaged, it does so in a cautious way and suggests doing it in an iterative way.  A memo is being prepared for the consideration of Government on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.</p></speech>

Ms Magahy is the head of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office and I would have thought she would have a view on that.</p></speech>

Government will be given a memo on de Buitl&eacute;ir and if Government decides to implement it, we will make sure it is implemented.  It is a foundational piece of Sl&aacute;intecare and was very much part of what the original objectives were about - the separation of private from public is part of what was originally mooted but it is a Government decision to make.  It is critical that it is made because if we are going to be building elective hospitals, we need a decision.  That is all I would say.</p></speech>

If Ms Magahy's view is to implement Government policy that is fine but I think there is an inherent contradiction in what the Government is saying.  There is no purpose in us going down that road any further.  Ms Magahy referred to a multi-annual commitment to recruiting staff into the community.  I know it is the 1,000 therapy posts.  Kids in my constituency wait 33 months to see a therapist.  That list is only getting longer and the parents are only getting more desperate.  We know that.  In terms of physical bodies, what does that mean?  It seems to me that we have heard the 1,000 posts announced and reannounced in a number of different formats.  Where are they going to be?  When are they going to be recruited?  Are they in college now?  What grades are they?  When are they going to start?</p></speech>

That is &euro;10 million next year rising to &euro;60 million.  They will be in place by the end of next year.  We are committed to doing it in a way that links it with services.  We could say we will put however many physiotherapists in however many locations and hope for the best but that is not what we are doing.  We want it to be linked to services for children, for people either on community waiting lists or to move people from hospital into the community.  It will be done linked with services.  Mr. Sullivan will be working through the service plan and will be identifying those positions.</p></speech>

That is compared to December 2014.  While there has been a 24% increase in administration and management staff, there has been only a 3.7% increase in the number of public health nurses.  Can we be given a figure as to the increase in public health nurses that is going to happen over the next 12 months?  Although my colleague has given the impression that the whole health service has collapsed, the number of outpatient appointments has not decreased.  The number of day care procedures has not decreased.  The number of operations happening per week, per month and per annum have not decreased.  The witnesses would probably agree with that.  If anything, the numbers in all areas have increased.  In case people get the concept that there are 118,000 people in the HSE sitting around doing nothing all day, that is not the position.  They are all working very hard.  However, I want to raise the issue of access to diagnostics by GPs.  As regards people having to be referred in to accident and emergency departments to get access to diagnostics, what proactive work has been done?  We want to keep care in the community and away from the hospital.  What has been done to make diagnostic services available to GPs in a faster timescale than currently is available?</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of dieticians consistently over the last three or four years and nothing has been done on it.  We have a system whereby if a nursing home patient requires advice or consultation with a dietician, he or she has to be taken in to the hospital.  What are we doing to have dieticians call to nursing homes once every month or two to reduce the overall cost of this?  If a patient has to be taken into a hospital to see a dietician, the likelihood is that two staff from the community hospital or whatever have to travel with them.  There is a significant cost and time factor.  It is a very simple issue where work can be done in the community rather than in a hospital.  I would like to hear answers on the three issues I have raised.</p></speech>

It is a really important piece.</p><p>A group that was set up under the national clinical programme for radiology is actively examining that.  It is looking at working across traditional boundaries and promoting advanced practice radiographers.  By 2022, we will have 70% more radiographers.  They are in training at present.  It is very important that they are in the pipeline, as it were, and will be ready to do it.  A new workforce model is being developed to meet GP and patient needs, as well as new models of education and training.  I am happy to supply details of that.  It is the work of the HSE's national clinical programme for radiology.  It has mapped all the different radiology infrastructure throughout the country.  Again, that work was one of the deliverables in the action plan and it has been done.  The issue is to get it up and running.</p></speech>

The most important thing, to refer back to Deputy Donnelly's point, is that people have timely access to diagnostics.  That is more important than whether it is through a GP or whether the diagnostics are delivered close to the patient's home.  The first thing we must do is ensure that the capacity in the system in Ireland is sufficient to respond in a timely way to the needs of the population.  We must get that in some type of order, and that is some way ahead at present.  However, through the same process we were talking about previously we will start to see progress on it during 2020 and beyond.  Then we can move to make it ever more accessible for GPs and so forth and, in due course, get to a position where, if it is entirely reasonable for somebody to be referred by the person's GP for a scan of some description, it does not go around the houses and we end up with that service being delivered in a local setting.</p> <p>  On the dietetics issue, we could pick a number of pathways.  Some of the eye care pathways are a little like that as well, with people going around the houses to an extent.  A number of pathway processes are being reviewed by the clinical programmes with a view to streamlining them and identifying whether there is any added value in the patient going through two or three hoops when care could be delivered more straightforwardly and locally without the various hoops on the way.  There are issues to be resolved and assurances given to various clinical staff to understand what that would look like.  They are motivated by, among other things, ensuring that patients do not fall between the cracks.  That is how these pathways in some cases have developed.  However, in the 21st century there is certainly scope, and dietetics is one area, to make the pathway much more straightforward for the patient so he or she does not have to go via a hospital to get physiotherapy, dietetics, diagnostics or whatever else.  It should be entirely possible for patients to access those at local level without going anywhere near a hospital or a hospital practitioner.</p></speech>

There are approximately 24,000 people in nursing homes.  If any one of them wishes to get access, the individual must physically go to a hospital.  This is a very simple matter.  There is a huge cost reduction in having a simple system put in place to accommodate the needs of the dietician who can provide the care where the person is being cared for.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.921" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1222" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#Y01300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  It is clear that a great deal of work has been done on the detailed planning for the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and the outworking of many aspects of the recommendations.  That is commendable.</p> <p>  The missing piece is the funding required to make these recommendations happen in the short term as opposed to stretching out over future years, so we get beyond the point of pilot projects and individual funds for interesting things.  They are not on a sufficient scale to achieve the type of step change that is required and was envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It is regrettable.  The opportunity arose in the budget for the Government and those who support it to allocate the necessary funds at a level that would achieve that step change and ensure that citizens would see an appreciable improvement in services.  That can only happen if funding is provided on the scale to achieve those major changes and the shifts in where we provide services.  It is only when that happens that people will starting seeing a difference and will be able to achieve access.</p> <p>  The main problem for many of our citizens is that access is so poor.  An example of that are the issues of eligibility and entitlement, on which the committee was very strong.  We need to move beyond the current arrangement where people are eligible to receive services if the services are available but there is no legal entitlement.  That is the big difference between healthcare and, for example, social welfare.  I can appreciate that the witnesses are in an awkward position and that they must talk about the issue of entitlement potentially being kicked to a citizens' assembly, but the Sl&aacute;intecare report referred to extending legal entitlement from the start of the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  There are other big ticket items that must be dealt with and where there has not been much progress.  One of those is the consultant contract.  Earlier Dr. de Buitl&eacute;ir spoke to the committee about its importance if we are to achieve the ending of private care in public hospitals, which is a key enabler and potentially a game changer in how we provide healthcare services.  Will Mr. Sullivan give us any hope that work is being done on a new consultant contract?  It was not referred to in the presentation.  This is in light of the recommendations in the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, the issues that were raised during the summer regarding the Medical Council, a high level of bullying and unacceptable practices in the hospital doctors arena, the question of specialisation, and the fact that we seem to be concentrating too much on specialisation among hospital doctors at the expense of generalists and getting people out and working more quickly.  There are indications that there is much interest in public-only contracts.  We must move quickly towards those if we are to achieve significant changes in hospital services.  Perhaps Mr. Sullivan will tell us the position with the new consultant contract and when we might see some product from that.</p> <p>  Equally, there is the GP contract.  We know there is a major shortage of GPs and we know that many new graduates would willingly stay here if they could afford to do so and if they were not expected to set up their own practice or work as an assistant.  There is a programme for Government commitment with regard to the introduction of salaried GPs.  Is anything happening on that?  There is a new GP contract, but as far as I can see there has been no progress on salaried GPs.</p> <p>  There are other areas on which I have questions.</p><p>One of the key recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report that was not covered in the report before us relates to legislation.  If memory serves me, we recommended that legislation be introduced in seven areas.  One of the most important is the question of accountability, throughout the system, starting with ministerial accountability for the provision of adequate services.  It was recommended to us on the committee that introducing such accountability would be a game changer in respect of the politics of the issue.  What is the status of that proposal and of the recommendation on legislating for accountability at clinical and administrative level?  The chair of the board, Dr. Tom Keane, was very strong on the need to legislate for clinical accountability.  As far as I recall, he stated it was one of the most important steps we could take.  Given that our guests have not mentioned legislation, they might comment on that.</p><p> On the question of entitlement, is putting it to a citizens' assembly the only recommendation?  We expected progress to be made in the area.  I get the distinct impression the matter is being kicked into a long process.  When is there likely to be some progress in the area? </p><p> On the additional 1,000 community staff who were flagged in the budget, I very much welcome the decision in principle but I am anxious to hear the planned timescale.  If those who have control of budgetary matters had provided the funding in a more upfront manner, the staff would be recruited upfront, rather than in what has been described as the medium or longer term.  To what extent has Ms Magahy's office control over the allocation of those staff posts?  What is the basis on which it will allocate those posts?  We in the committee were strong about having objective resource allocation systems in place and removing the politics from the allocation of resources.  Will Ms Magahy update us in that regard?</p></speech>

It means a great deal, given that she was the Chairman of the committee that produced the original Oireachtas report.</p> <p>  On eligibility and entitlement, there will be a concerted effort immediately.  I highlighted a couple of aspects in the presentation, including the memo to Government on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which is important.  A unit is being established within the Department of Health specifically to examine eligibility and entitlement, and will be resourced to do so.  There has not yet been a concerted effort but there was acknowledgement through the Secretary General that it would happen and we are very pleased about that.</p> <p>  The issue of eligibility and entitlement touches on several Departments.  As the committee will be aware, if one is eligible to a medical card, one will also be entitled to other benefits.  We have agreed at the high-level delivery board that an interdepartmental group will be set up to examine eligibility and entitlement.  They are tangible steps that will give emphasis and momentum to that question, which is important.  The Minister recently attended the universal healthcare forum in New York and is very committed to universal healthcare.  It is important to get the homework done in respect of what universal healthcare means and produce a pathway to what it will cost.  The issue of cost explains why we proposed a citizens' assembly.  I might ask Dr. Healy to say a few words on the matter and I can return to the other questions thereafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.924" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#Z00300"><p>I am sure we are all aware of how effective a tool a citizens' assembly as a structure has been at allowing us to bring citizens into the room, to present them with solid, evidence-based research and to put questions to them.  By and large, not just in the case of the assemblies on marriage equality and the eighth amendment, the experience has been that they come up with the correct answers.</p> <p>  The commitment to universal healthcare is strong and has not slipped.  Nevertheless, engaging the citizens in a conversation about the path to it would be useful.  It is not about not providing it but rather about seeking the informed views on how we would go about providing it, which we would determine by gathering the citizens' opinions.  I am a fan of the citizens' assembly as an important, structured way of gathering views.  While we are mindful of the House's own work over a period, carried out by many Members of the Oireachtas, the committee and the experts who appeared before it, we have discovered in our engagement that the public has little knowledge or understanding of the matter.  The citizens' assembly structure is a way of focusing the desired media attention on such conversations and discussions and of genuinely involving the public.</p> <p>  That is a short summary of why we propose a citizens' assembly.  There is a head of steam behind it and we would love for it to be done.  It is not a way of kicking the can down the road.  In fact, it is the opposite.  It is a matter of engaging the citizens on what remains one of the main commitments of the Sl&aacute;intecare project.</p></speech>

I imagine that the issue will play out over the next several months and we will return to the Government for a decision.</p> <p>  The Deputy indicated that it is not just money that keeps people in a job, although it is an important factor.  I acknowledge her point.  It is also about the atmosphere - not just physical but also cultural - in which they work.  If people cannot get access to theatres to perform operations or see people in the correct circumstances, it becomes hard for all healthcare staff to work in such conditions.  The elective hospitals initiative we have done, which was intended to streamline unscheduled and scheduled care, will help in that regard.  It will help people to have their theatre time and will keep professionals interested and engaged in their work.  That is as, if not more, important as money to the professionals to whom we have spoken.  Highly skilled people being unable to get into theatres on time is not conducive to retention. </p> <p>  On resource allocation and the additional 1,000 front-line staff, I am mindful a resource allocation model has been applied throughout the system.  The ESRI has pointed out there is an unequal distribution of community healthcare workers per head of population throughout the country.  While I am mindful of that as a base, we must also examine the services that such community healthcare professionals will put in place, in response to community waiting lists or staffing the primary care centres, as well as the initiatives or services that will move and keep people out of hospital-----</p></speech>

They are to be congratulated.  It is very easy to sit by and criticise the system and say that somebody should do something.  Oscar Wilde said that duty is what we expect of others but not necessarily of ourselves.  Our guests have embraced the mission with decisiveness, clarity and a sense of purpose.</p> <p>  Are our guests satisfied with the progress of the action plan in meeting their targets so far?  Has the progress been in line with their expectations?  Is the progress that has been made on track to achieve the expectations next year and in subsequent years?</p> <p>  What has been the impact on the delivery and co-ordination of activity in the system since the appointment of the new board of the HSE?  One of my colleagues will deal with the governance of e-pharmacies and I will leave that.</p> <p>  The enablers that have been put in place seem to be embracing and comprehensive.  Other issues will arise as Sl&aacute;intecare evolves but have any arisen so far?</p> <p>  The postgraduate medical education strategy is an issue that has come up on a number of occasions as requiring urgent attention.  Are our guests satisfied that the required attention is being given to the issue as a means of addressing a whole series of issues that may arise down the line?</p> <p>  How is the single assessment mechanism progressing?  Is it in line with expectations?  Are there any snags?  Can it be improved?  If not, why not?</p> <p>  I am also concerned about access to hospitals.  Senator Colm Burke referred to nursing homes and dietary issues.  Dietary issues seem to be important for older people who are long-stay patients in hospitals.  The extent to which an appropriate diet is available to such persons seems to be much more important than we, or at least I, first anticipated.  This committee will meet some people on that issue in the not so distant future and that will hopefully be of benefit in improving quality of service and quality of life and health for people who are either in care at home or in nursing homes.  Sufficient emphasis has not been placed on dietary issues in the past.  From what we now see, hear and read, that is an area in which we can contribute greatly, at little cost, to an area that could relieve the burden on many aspects of services in many ways.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.937" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#AA00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments which I will relay to the team and they will be pleased.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked several questions and I will try to answer them in sequence.  We are on track so far but we have an awful lot to do.  We are only in year one.  It is only 13 months since I sat before the committee without a team and with no staff.  We started pulling it together from scratch and working with colleagues in the HSE and the Department.  We have put structures in place now so we have a fair wind behind us and I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in the Department and the HSE as a part of that.  We are on track so far but we cannot rest on our laurels.</p> <p>  One of the first things that the director general, Paul Reid, asked about when he started was how the HSE was doing and how the board of the HSE, with its new remit and governance structures, was going to interface with the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office.  There was a genuine acknowledgement on his part and on mine that we need to work seamlessly together.  One cannot have one piece of work in the Department and another in the HSE, trying to do things that are not joined at the hip.  I am delighted to have agreed with Mr. Sullivan that we are going to have a joint implementation approach to capacity planning, in particular, and the roll-out of the regional integrated health plan.  That took a while to work through but is now in place.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the single assessment tool which is critical because it is the basis of the statutory home care scheme.  All older people and, eventually, people with a disability will be assessed through the single assessment tool.  Their requirements will be looked at and it will form the basis of the statutory home care scheme.  I should have alluded to that as another important eligibility entitlement initiative when I was answering questions from Deputy Shortall.</p> <p>  The tool is being piloted at the moment in a few different areas and they are working through how it is happening in practice and talking with the various people on the ground about glitches and improvements that need to be made if there are any.  It will be fully rolled out from February onwards.  It is a very good thing that is happening.</p> <p>  I agree that the postgraduate medical education strategy is very important.  It is joined up.  It is being chaired by Mary Doyle, the former Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, who is a capable and knowledgeable person.  I have a meeting with that team this afternoon to see how that is going.  It is a very important piece of the jigsaw.</p> <p>  The Deputy may not know that HIQA is organising that a survey for patients will go into nursing homes and that will feed in nicely to seeing what the response is to food and we look forward to seeing the results of that.  The Deputy is right that diet is a key part of our health and well-being.</p> <p>  Did I miss any of the questions that the Deputy asked?</p></speech>

I hope this all works out because it is two and a half years since the report of the Select Committee on the Future of Healthcare, chaired by Deputy Shortall and upon which Deputy Durkan and I sat, was published.  We are now 25% of the way into a ten-year plan.  It is not Ms Magahy's fault because she had nothing to work with initially apart from our report.  That committee report was born out of a frustration with the system and situation as it was.  We all worked together to try and leave our bias behind and work to the future.</p> <p>  Following on from that, part of the issue I see now is the constant leeching of top-end consultants that this committee spoke about in the previous session and last week.  Those consultants are leaving our public sector to join our private sector and we have not yet managed to stop that bleed.</p><p>As long as that continues, I fear we cannot deliver this, despite whatever else we do, unless we have the hospital consultants to lead this healthcare provision.  We need to focus on the consultants.  Some 50% of NCHDs are not in training posts.  We have the leaching of the top people but in terms of succession planning, we do not have the bodies coming along in the future that are wedded to the system and part of a structured career path.  If all of this worked out, and everybody was up for it, how are we going to guarantee that we have the consultants to lead the delivery of healthcare?</p><p> The GP contract and salaried GPs was a critical point of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There has been an emergence in the larger urban areas of GPs who have general medical services, GMS contracts doing many elective and cosmetic surgeries in their clinics and many travel vaccines.  I do not class all GPs in this group.  These procedures are not jobs that GPs should be doing in a strained health service.  I would much prefer to see my child's burst eardrum being seen over somebody getting elective Botox in a surgery.  I am quite concerned about the use of GPs' time.  This is not a criticism as they have to pay rents, rates and salaries and there is probably more money in elective cosmetic surgeries than in weeping children's ears.  I am concerned that if we do not go down the salaried GP route, we will always be competing where the skill sets of the GPs are siphoned off into sectors that are more profitable and have no public health value.</p><p> On pharmacists, we spoke about patients earlier and often speak of them as if they are all same type of patient.  Any of us who works in the health service, however, knows that there are major complexities in patients.  I am reminded of a pharmacist in Galway who took it upon himself to monitor ten complex patients across gender and age groups.  This pharmacist together with the local public hospital and GPs, they held the hands of ten people as they went through their complex lives with their complex medical conditions.  It was a loose study, but the ten individuals were admitted to hospital 30 times in the year prior to this intervention, an average of three admissions.  Following this intervention, there were only four admissions in the next year.  My concern is that we look on patients as if they are all the same and we never hold the hand the most vulnerable.  We just keep firing money and expensive injections and treatments at them but we do not follow up whether the injection goes into their body or whether they turn up for their appointment.  The group of people in Galway proved that when resources are directed at the most vulnerable and complex cases, this can have a significant impact on hospital admissions.  Various figures are bandied around, but there is a claim that up to 60% of hospital admissions are due to medication errors.  If, as Deputy Donnelly mentioned earlier, three quarters of beds in public hospitals are occupied by people who come in through emergency departments, investment in the more complex patients with great need seems to be the key to try to reduce the bed occupancy rate and waiting lists.  How is Sl&aacute;intecare progressing with the pharmacists?  The fundamental basis of Sl&aacute;intecare was need and not ability to pay, and a move towards the community.  It must be ten years since pharmacists started doing the flu vaccine.  It started off - with no offence intended towards the Chairman - with the question as to how pharmacists might manage and what if some person died or had an anaphylactic reaction?  Some ten years later, is ten years correct?</p></speech>

It was said that pharmacists would not want to give injections to people but we all got over it.  How will the role of the pharmacist in the community be expanded to prevent this 60% of admissions that are based on medication errors?</p> <p>  I know I am boring everybody to tears, but some of the things that happen are so common.  Someone seeing a consultant in a private hospital, for example, and does not think that he or she needs to tell his or her GP in Clare what is going on with the cardiologist in Dublin.  They then go somewhere else to get something else done.  They then get a prescription in one pharmacy, and get the other one in the pharmacy beside the private hospital.  They go home and are taking three times the medication they should be on. This is common.  I get worried when we talk about citizens' assemblies and such matters when we have not focused on why people are turning up in emergency departments.  Accidents and emergencies happen.  However, if we invested in the prevention of man-made errors, we could free up capacity in our system.</p></speech>

As recently as last week, I had a productive conversation with Mr. Daragh Connolly from the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, about what it could do.  There are good examples relating to minor ailments in Scotland and, therefore, we are working up a scheme to see what we can do.  Pharmacists are on nearly every street in the country.  They open later than most other healthcare providers and there is a significant opportunity in this regard.  I will be very happy to come back to the committee when that is worked out.</p></speech>

The individual health identifiers, IHIs, are now in place, which give the basis for the shared care record.   The e-pharmacy project will be the quickest win in value for the patient from a shared record point of view.  If we had that and we are looking at a patient portal, the patient would go to the private hospital or to the places the Deputy has mentioned, and their medications would be on their portal, which would be able to show what have had.  That is critical to the move between the hospital and the community, and for the patient to move between different care settings.  That is an absolute priority.  This is firmly on Mr. Sullivan's radar as well.  I will be happy to come back to the committee regarding progress on this issue.</p></speech>

The HSE did a great deal of work on cutting back on elemental feeds and so on.  To follow on from Deputy Durkan's commentary, wound management and protein content of food is vital for older people and people with an injury, old or young. I agree with the Deputy Durkan that while hospital meals have improved in recent years, a fundamental part of growing and repairing a patient's body seems to have been neglected.  It is unacceptable that older people or people with swallow issues can be handed a carton of Ensure.</p><p>Regardless of their age or the complexity of their needs, people receiving care have a very basic right to have a balanced diet made available to them if they are not able to get their own food, which will obviously be the case if they are in a nursing home.  Diet has to mesh with medication, doctors and nursing.  This issue cannot be left on its own.  There is no point in a patient getting wonderful wound care from wound specialists using really expensive pressure sore bandages if he or she is getting no protein.  That wound will never heal.  This has been ignored or left to the wayside for the years, probably due to the power of the companies making the elemental feeds.  </p></speech>

When representatives of the IMO appeared here last week, they identified the shared care record as one of the critical enablers of reform of the health service because it crosses all clinical disciplines and drives efficiency.  A practitioner could log into a shared care record and see what diagnostics have already been carried out and do not have to be duplicated, as well as finding information on a patient's current medication.  This is absolutely critical, more so than clinical input and numbers of consultants, nurses and allied professions.  It drives efficiency.  One of the critical points in the Sl&aacute;intecare report was the need for a shared care record and a single health identifier in order that people could be tracked through the system.  It drives efficiency so well.  It would substantially reduce waiting lists because there are many people on several waiting lists seeking service from several different hospitals and disciplines.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report set aside a figure of &euro;850 million or &euro;875 million for the shared care record.  In the current climate it is unlikely that this kind of money will be available in the short or medium term.  How is the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office approaching the introduction of a shared care record?  I see that e-health has been included under "Workstream 1" in the submission.  What progress has been made on this?  A shared care record also drives integration, another cornerstone of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It offers efficiency, integration and a better quality of care.  What stage has that reached? </p></speech>

This issue is absolutely critical.  The e-health office is currently involved in a dialogue to see how quickly a shared care record can be put in place.  The results of this dialogue, which is currently ongoing with ten companies, will be produced by the end of this year.  This will offer a direction and enable us to use what we have.  We have had this conversation before.  There is already an awful lot of data, including data from the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, GP data which will hopefully come on stream, patient administration system, PAS, data from the hospital system and data on radiology from the national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS.  There is an awful lot of system data.  We now need a platform that can get these data sets to talk to each other.  That is different to the electronic health record, which has already been rolled out in some of the maternity hospitals and St. James's Hospital.  The shared care record is more urgent and more applicable from the patient's perspective.  Good progress is being made but a real focus will be needed next year.  The capital plan includes a budget for that.  I know that every effort is being made through Mr. Sullivan's good offices to make that happen.</p></speech>

Reference has been made to citizen and staff engagement.  That excludes people who may not technically be citizens but are working in the health service.  Perhaps the language could be altered slightly.  I acknowledge exclusion was not intended.

We have gone back to using the word "citizen" because of the feedback we received.  The feedback we received indicated this wording was seen as more inclusive.  We did a bit of research on that.  Our sense is that we are not there yet.  However, we engaged 100 advocacy groups at a seminar last week.  These groups included all different kinds of voluntary organisations representing people right across the community.  When we examine the regions over the next year, we hope to really drill down in co-operation with those organisations, so that we get right down into the communities to inform the co-design of the system.  Whether someone is a citizen or not, we will be very mindful of that-----</p></speech>

It has to be incorporated into every single part of all of the services available across the system.  Clinical governance will be part of the design of the regions and the allocation of roles between the Department, the HSE and the regions.

The figure of 2,600 beds comes from the capacity review.</p><p>The review describes this figure as an extreme requirement, not the likely requirement.  It is the minimum conceivable number.  If everything in the world worked exactly right, at the right time and infinite resources were available to do everything else, 2,600 beds would be needed.  The review states, however, that up to 7,200 beds would be needed.  Experts have informed me that the number is probably somewhere in between those two figures, in other words, between 4,500 and 5,000 extra beds will be needed.  Given that, is the independent review group worried that we are planning to fail?  If we add 2,600 beds when we probably need twice that number, are we knitting in failure of the system for the next two years?</p><p> On costs, has the independent review group been able to discover the cost per bed day or procedure, or both, for the different hospitals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.988" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Magahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#DD00200"><p>I agree the target of 2,600 beds is almost like a best case scenario.  After all the improvements required are taken into consideration, only 2,600 beds are needed, which is still a very large number.  However, the timeframe is until 2031 so we have a bit of road to travel, although we know it takes a long time to plan and build infrastructure.  We were talking earlier about the suboptimal use of some current beds.  The first and most immediate target is to try to get the beds in place.  The second target is to try to get the elective hospitals streamlining the scheduled and unscheduled care.  Mr. Sullivan and I are working assiduously on naming and getting that capacity in place.  The next target is the needs of the regions.  That is how we are going about allocating those beds.  A hospital improvement programme is also needed in order to maximise the stock we already have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.989" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019102300002#DD00300"><p>I get all of that.  I am referring specifically to the number of beds needed.  The figure of 2,600 applies in a scenario where everything is done correctly, which is not possible, even with the best will in the world.  No country in the world can do everything right.  Are we not essentially planning to have too few beds?  If the minimum conceivable extra number of beds is 2,600 and the experts are saying it is probably several thousand more than that, are we in danger of planning to fail and of almost guaranteeing failure?</p></speech>

It was a set of reasonable assumptions around the impact of public health interventions, the impact of additional staff and resources in the community and the potential to improve how we use the existing bed stock, an issue to which Ms Magahy alluded.  After all of that, the figure left was the 2,600 number to which the Deputy referred.  Those were the assumptions as opposed to five things all having to break perfectly, in which case only 2,600 beds would be needed.  I am happy to proceed on the basis of getting 2,600 beds in place, and implementing the other interventions that are necessary so that only 2,600 beds are needed.  We will then see where we are.  There are an awful lot of moving parts in health and social care that the Deputy is well aware of.  Population needs may change over the next ten years and so on.  We will work towards that in good faith.  We are constantly looking at it in any event.  We have processes in place and we have the model whereby we re-run and test things and so on.  I am not aware of anything in the review that is so far out there as to be virtually unachievable.  The figure is about right, plus or minus, and we will keep refocusing and reviewing as we go forward.</p></speech>

The piece that is harder to predict is that if we put money into prevention, at what point does it kick in to save a bed?  That is harder to predict because sometimes it might have a ten-year impact if a measure is started now.  It is also harder to argue for resources for such a measure but that is where we should be trying to make changes.  The Deputy mentioned the importance of diet, prevention, exercise and all the usual things and asked if we were doing enough on prevention and dealing with the obesity crisis.  There are probably some brave decisions to be made next year on prevention and the budget for health and well-being.  These cut across Departments and probably need to be stepped up.  That is a harder piece to prove with regard to beds, if I am being honest.</p></speech>

On critical enablers, I mentioned the shared care record.  Another issue is access to diagnostics, which is a serious matter in respect of the optimal use of beds.  During the week, 60 patients were waiting for an MRI scan in University Hospital Limerick where there is one scanner for a population of 400,000 people.  It is essential not only that there is access to diagnostics from general practice but that there is access to diagnostics within the hospital system.  Many patients are waiting for a diagnosis that will allow them to go home, stay in hospital or influence their treatment.  If we are talking about the suboptimal use of beds, access to scanning and ultrasound diagnostics in particular is a critical enabler in driving efficiency.  I could also mention many other diagnostic tests that are required.</p></speech>

I thank the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre for taking up the late opportunity to come before the committee.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  I will call on them to make their opening statements in the order in which I have introduced them.  If I get the name of the person leading off on the opening statement wrong, I ask the witnesses to correct me and put me on the right path.<br/><br/>I must ask not only all the witnesses but everybody here to put their mobile phones on silent.<br/><br/>I must draw the witnesses' attention to the usual position on privilege.  I ask them to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members of the committee should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>For the information of our guests, we have, unfortunately, received a small number of apologies this morning, which impacts the attendance.  I very much regret that.<br/><br/>I thank all of them for their respective written submissions, which I expect will be the basis or bones of their opening addresses.<br/><br/>I call Mr. Herrick to kick off.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, the broader questions associated with online expression and the regulation thereof and the challenges involved in this very complex area have been a key priority area for the council for over many years.  We have made a number of previous submissions to this committee and other committees on matters related to this question.</p> <p>  The regulation of online speech, including communications through social media, engages complex human rights issues.  In approaching these questions, the ICCL seeks in the first instance to understand the context and the effect of harmful online communications and behaviours before then moving to the challenging question of how to develop appropriate laws and policies in response, in particular laws and policies that are precise, effective and proportionate in dealing with the problems that arise.  In the short time available to us, we aim to highlight the nature and extent of one specific form of online harassment, namely image-based sexual abuse.  In doing so, we will refer to a specific case that illustrates the types of issues we feel the Oireachtas and public bodies should urgently address in this area.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Farries, who will speak to the submission the committee has received.</p></speech>

We present these submissions in memory of Dara Quigley and in consultation with her mother, Aileen Malone, who is present in the Gallery.</p><p> Dara Quigley was an Irish activist and journalist.  In 2017, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na forcibly detained Ms Quigley under Ireland's Mental Health Act for walking naked in a Dublin street.  State CCTV cameras captured Ms Quigley's images.  Media reports tell us that a garda was suspected of recording the images.  The images were shared on a WhatsApp message group and, subsequently, posted on Facebook.  The images were reported to have been shared 125,000 times before being taken down.  Several days later, Dara Quigley committed suicide.  Two and a half years later, no organisation or individual has been held responsible for their role in the abuse of Ms Quigley.  Dara's mother has supported our discussing this case today to lend a personal perspective regarding, as she says, "how devastating online sexual harassment and public humiliation can be".</p><p> Today, the committee is considering responses to what it terms "revenge porn".  ICCL objects to "revenge porn" as a term.  It is not pornography; it is sexual abuse.  Revenge is only one of myriad motivations that, principally, are to violate a person's dignity and his or her autonomy.</p><p> "Image-based sexual abuse" is a term coined by UK academics to better describe the non-consensual nature of this problem either by creating or distributing private sexual images.  Image-based sexual abuse is a gendered problem with established harms.  Our research shows that while anyone can be a victim, the majority are women and the majority of perpetrators are men.   This is not to say that intersectional factors also influence the likelihood of experiencing online harassment.  Generally, the LGBT+ community is at increased risk.  One's race, religion, ethnicity, mental health and ability are all risk factors.  The harms have been well described by others, numerous academics and in our submissions.  I ask the members to please let me know if they want me to elaborate during questions.</p><p> The image-based sexual abuse of Ms Quigley illustrates weaknesses in the Irish regime for responding.  We have proposed several solutions in our submissions and we will focus on three solutions here.  </p><p> A first step for tackling this problem is updated and robust laws.  This has been outlined well by the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  ICCL specifically calls for the criminalisation of image-based sexual abuse.  This is might be an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to outlaw the creation and-or sharing of private sexual images.  ICCL also supports the creation of a civil wrong together with legal aid access to ensure restitution and compensation.  However, as ICCL has previously stated in its submissions on harmful content moderation, and in our review of the recent Harmful Communications and Digital Safety Bill 2017, "harmful content" must be clearly defined.  As has been said well here to the committee, a lack of specificity will not meet legality standards and could lead to infringement of other rights, including expression. </p><p> Second, strong laws also require strong enforcement practices and we cannot have enforcement without a cultural understanding of this problem at garda&iacute; level.  The committee has heard stories here of people not receiving adequate assistance from garda&iacute; on online harassment issues.  Dara's treatment was far more egregious.  In our submissions we, therefore, present a number of suggestions for the Garda in line with our other ICCL publications to ground Garda practices in the principals of human rights.  Specifically, the integration of training and assessment regarding the gendered and otherwise intersexual nature of online harassment, including image-based sexual abuse intersectional.  It is enough to focus on cyberbullying, a terms that erases the context of power and marginalisation in which injustice against people such as Dara has occurred. </p><p> Third, the ICCL is opposed, in principal, to the Department Justice and Equality's community-based CCTV programme.  We recommend that the State does not further contribute to online harassment by building up the web of tech surveillance to which we are all, increasingly, subject.  Installing CCTV to maintain public safety is based on flawed logic.  Blanket surveillance does not help us; it harms us, which Dara's experience has certainly demonstrated and it harms some of us more than others.  There is significant research that suggests CCTV does not effectively deter crime to sufficiently mitigate the impact on our privacy.  Policing tech can also be very discriminatory.  In Dara Quigley's case, CCTV has become a mechanism for gendered online harassment and her experience of image-based sexual abuse.  We need to rethink this wrong-headed approach to expanding surveillance simply because the technical means exist together with over-policing segments of the population in Ireland.</p><p> In conclusion, Dara Quigley's experience is an appalling one and it is ongoing for her family.  We are conscious that investigations have been initiated into Dara's death and egregious treatment of her by, as yet not formally identified, perpetrators.</p><p>However, two and half years later, these investigations have not provided any justice to Dara or her family.  The aim of our submission today is to highlight the tragic consequences of violations of rights in this area and solutions in order to prevent such cases occurring in future.  At the same time, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties will continue to support Dara's family in the struggle for justice.</p></speech>

We provide free, reliable, non-judgmental information services to more than 150,000 young people in Ireland each month.  At the core of what we do is a mission to reach our peers where they are, which is online.  Consequently, we have developed a real and practical understanding of the realities of youth engagement on the Internet.  It is important in any debate that touches these issues to consider both the challenges of better digital citizenship and the great capacity for good that exists in an open and accessible Internet.  Too often we find ourselves talking about &quot;online safety&quot;, by which we mainly mean restricting the capacity of bad actors to do harm but that kind of framing does not always recognise the ways in which online services can also enhance the safety and well-being of young people or the rights of children, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to association, education, participation, expression and information.  That is whether it comes through online mental health services access to a supportive community for the otherwise isolated or the kind of information on sexuality, health, employment or education that so many thousands of young people access every day online.<br/><br/>Our focus needs to be on preserving the possibility and promise of an open Internet while being clear about those areas where there can be no substitute for smart and effective regulation.  SpunOut has a long history of engagement with the service providers that dominate young people's experiences online.  We have worked for a number of years with Twitter&rsquo;s global trust and safety council and as part of Facebook&rsquo;s suicide and self-injury advisory committee.  Where we can work with and influence the big platforms in the technology space we have done so and we have seen results.  Our partnership with Facebook and our colleagues here from the DCU anti-bullying centre, for example, has helped train and resource young people and teachers in the area of better digital citizenship.<br/><br/>We can tell the committee, from experience, that possibilities exist in platforms and civil society groups like SpunOut, working together, to voluntarily improve the online space.  That experience has also taught us what are the limits.  It has taught us that, for all the platforms can do to try to improve their impact on the world, there are areas in which there is simply no substitute for intervention and regulation by the State.  We come across the limits of not intervening, particularly with a platform like Snapchat.  It is incredibly popular with young people, offering a service based on the promise that all messages being sent are private and temporary.  However, Snapchat is domiciled outside of the European Union and routinely makes no effort to engage with non-governmental organisations on issues of privacy, transparency and safety of young people on the platform.  Like any private company, the main goal is to maximise shareholder value and, like any non-profit, organisations such as ours can only involve ourselves as far as our limited budgets will stretch.<br/><br/>Government has a role that is inescapable in this as the only democratically mandated force within our society with the authority, ability and resources to intervene and tilt the balance from multinational global corporations back towards the individuals and communities that use our shared online space.  We need to start reshaping how we view the relationship between us as service users and the companies that shape our online experiences.  The nature of these companies' business models is simply not properly understood within our current laws.  There is an assumption, for example, that when I set up a profile with Snapchat or another online platform, it is fundamentally and legally a relationship of equals and that the pages of terms and conditions I probably sign without reading, much less understanding, somehow mean I am fully informed of every way in which my data might then be used.  This is a legal illusion we need to break.  The reality is when we deal with an entity of that size, influence and power, it is a relationship not between an ordinary customer and a regular provider of services; it is a relationship in which we are at a profound information disadvantage.<br/><br/>The answer to how we manage those relationships better is by accepting first and foremost that when we access a service, such as a doctor or solicitor, where their level of knowledge so outstrips the client, and where the client relies on the provider not just to provide a service but also to do so in a client's own best interest.  Those services must have a legal responsibility to a client above and beyond their obligation to turn a profit.</p><p>The answer is accountability.  We do not necessarily need a Hippocratic oath for Snapchat or TikTok but we need the Government to recognise and enforce the accountability these services owe us for the disproportionate influence they have over our lives.</p><p> What does that level of accountability look like in practice?  As a country, we have surely learned that regulations can only be as effective as the regulator.  That is why we need a powerful and independent digital safety commissioner as we have outlined in our submission to this committee.  That commissioner needs to be empowered by legislative change, specifically new laws that clearly define online harassment and hate speech and that make it an offence to share intimate images without consent, regardless of the platform used.  Our current laws in this regard are largely from a predigital age and are long overdue an update.</p><p> So too is our conception of privacy.  The idea that we have an exclusive right to our personal data is under relentless challenge by companies for whom mass data profiling is the model for doing business.  Whereas the general data protection regulation has gone some way towards validating our individual rights in this area, it is still simply untrue to assume a multinational organisation with a legal department and an individual consumer are somehow operating on an equal playing field.  Our right to privacy, like so much else, is only meaningful when we can be confident it is underwritten by a State system that is willing to wade in and defend it actively rather than just telling us our rights and expecting that we enforce them ourselves.  It is no use just guaranteeing rights in theory.  The digital safety commissioner will need a framework that lets it receive and respond to reports as quickly and effectively as possible.</p><p> If we are waiting for young people to call into the Garda to report that they are being bullied or harassed, we may be waiting a very long time.  A single, clearly advertised central point of contact by text or online is far more likely to encourage young people who have been wronged online to come forward and report what has happened.  They will also need to know that their complaints will not just gather dust.  The Garda must be funded to deal with these reports in a timely way.  We have had very positive experiences with cases brought to the child exploitation unit recently and I hope that ethos can be applied just as well to young people aged 18 and over too.</p><p> The question of funding really gets to the heart of this.  From what I can see there is widespread support in the Oireachtas for the Government taking a bigger role in this area.  Without meaningful resourcing and hard money behind the project, no new regulator, legal change or Garda unit will be able to make much headway.  That is why we are calling for a minimum budget of &euro;10 million on day one of the online safety commissioner taking office, if necessary funded by an industrial revenue-based levy on many highly profitable online multinationals that have chosen to make this country their base of operations.  Accountability needs to be a watchword for all of us in this, including the Government, non-governmental organisations and service providers.  Until we have a firm commitment to the resources we will need in creating a safer Internet, we will not be holding ourselves accountable to the millions of people, young and old, who deserve a better, more secure, more responsible online space.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Mair&eacute;ad Foody and Dr. Tijana Milosevic, researchers with international experience working at the anti-bullying centre, ABC, in DCU.  The national anti-bullying research and resource centre is a university-designated research centre that brings together not just researchers from across DCU but across colleges in Ireland and abroad.  The centre receives public and private funding, which allows us to undertake research and develop resources into issues relating to bullying and online safety.  There are currently 20 researchers based at the centre and researchers at the centre were the first in Ireland to undertake research on school bullying, cyberbullying, workplace bullying, homophobic bullying, sibling bullying and "sexting" relating to mental health and well-being with young people.  The centre currently delivers a whole school, community anti-bullying and online safety programme to post-primary schools in Ireland and it is available for free to those schools.  The programme, called FUSE, focuses on bridging the gap that often exists between parents, teachers and students in tackling bullying and promoting online safety.</p> <p>  Members of the committee have already received our full submission so I will highlight in summary three areas we hope will be helpful to the committee in determining what laws and regulations are appropriate for dealing with online harassment and related matters.  With legislation, we support the move to increase oversight of social media and related platforms and the level of this oversight is ultimately a decision for the Government to determine.  We recommend that consideration be given to the experiences in other countries where hastily introduced regulations have been ultimately found not to work as originally intended.  Legislation should be informed by sound research, including the voices of young people.</p><p>We welcome the recent announcement by the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, NACOS, that it is commissioning national research that will provide insights to those seeking to develop legislation and guidelines on online harassment.</p><p> We encourage the committee to take into account a range of platforms on which cyberbullying may occur and not just a handful of large social media companies.  Our research shows that children and young people are equally likely to be bullied or have negative experiences on gaming platforms, for example, as well as content-sharing apps, friending apps, and artificial intelligence platforms and chatbots.  The established social media companies tend to have more developed resources to address various online harms that may not always be available to the various start-ups, which spring up quickly and accumulate significant numbers of young users.  We are by no means suggesting that the big companies should evade scrutiny, merely that a range of platforms should be taken into consideration when designing legislation while being mindful of the need to protect innovation and freedom of expression.  Incentivising safety by design might be one approach to addressing this issue.</p><p> Regarding support, cyberbullying is not merely an online safety issue but is also a behavioural problem.  Therefore, removing content alone may not solve the conflict, which can continue on other platforms or offline.  Any legislation that only or predominantly focuses on content removal might miss the opportunity to address the problem at a level beyond merely addressing its symptoms.  Legislation should also focus on providing funding for support to those who have been victimised online.  Often the removal of content is only the first step in a process of overcoming trauma related to online harassment, and further counselling and support may be required.  This could include funding for psychological counselling services available to children involved in cyberbullying both as bullies and as victims.  This could also entail the provision of funding for helpline services which offer counselling and educational support to prevent future incidents reoccurring.</p><p> Regarding prevention, cyberbullying by children and teenagers often relates to a lack of understanding and appreciation of the effects their actions and words might have on other children or teenagers whom they target.  We have found in research that the provision of education related to online safety, tolerance, kindness, diversity and inclusion can go a long way to reducing the level of bullying and cyberbullying.  Securing funding for educational measures aimed at prevention could also be considered.  Specifically, there is a need to create a national standardised cyberbullying or online safety prevention and intervention curriculum, which could include online safety instruction and which would be deployed not just in schools but also in sports clubs, youth clubs, online training for young people who use the Internet, advertisements, marketing and engagement with parents and so on throughout the country.  This could also constitute a way forward in promoting online safety among young people.</p></speech>

We are very grateful to the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to speak on the topic of online harassment, harmful communications and related offences.  I am here with my colleague, Ms Shirley Scott.  We have already made a submission to the committee answering the various questions it raised.</p> <p>  Our interest in this topic arises from the range of services we offer.  We take more than 270 calls each week on the national 24-hour helpline we run.  We provide face-to-face therapy to nearly 600 people and training to approximately 2,000 people per year, including those working on the front line with victims and survivors of sexual violence and those working with children and young people.  Our personnel accompany victims and survivors to the sexual assault treatment unit at the Rotunda Hospital, to Garda stations and to court.</p> <p>  In our work we see the often lifelong consequences of the trauma and harm caused by sexual violence of all kinds, which is often compounded for victims and survivors as a result of technology and harmful communications that are used to harass and humiliate.  In our BodyRight programme, developed to raise awareness of sexual violence among young people and to assist in its prevention, we have recently had to introduce additional modules to address what their teachers and guidance counsellors found as the serious issues of sexting and sextortion, and we are developing a module on pornography.  As everybody has said, while the sharing of images might appear harmless to some people, particularly young people, sexting and other forms of image sharing can have serious social and legal consequences, and the importance of young people knowing about those consequences cannot be overestimated.</p><p>We hear all the time from callers and clients of how a single image uploaded to the Internet without consent can often have devastating consequences for the person whose image is uploaded.</p><p> We also prefer the term preferred by the committee of "non-consensual sharing of sexual images".  This type of abuse, the sharing of images online without consent, is often done by partners and ex-partners and is one of the deepest betrayals of trust by a partner or ex-partner, who is using technology and the Internet to cause harm.  We need legislation to better protect everyone together with a greater understanding of the harmful and insidious nature of such abuse.</p><p> Such forms of non-consensual sharing of intimate images are recognised as specific offences in other jurisdictions.  We have expanded on this in our written submission.  In brief, many jurisdictions have laws in place to protect people from online sexual violence.  The offences introduced in Australia, New Zealand, England and Wales targeting online harassment and harmful communications focus on both the behaviour and the impact of the behaviour, which is an approach we recommend.</p><p> We also recommend that harmful content be defined as any content that seriously interferes with the peace and privacy of the other person or which causes alarm, distress or harm to him or her.  Freedom of expression, while an important right, is not an absolute one and must be balanced against the impact of the online harmful communication and privacy rights.  Our criminal legislation on the issue is at present entirely inadequate to address issues of harassment, stalking, voyeurism or other harmful online behaviour and does not protect the rights of those who are victims of such behaviour.  If the definition of harmful content were broadened, there would be a more balanced approach that would not impose undue restrictions on the right of freedom of expression, which only requires the removal of content where the content is injurious to the victim.  We do not have legislation creating any statutory responsibility for Internet service providers to monitor effectively content being posted on their websites.</p><p> In our written submission to the committee we have recommended a flexible approach whereby the legislation would be supported by the capacity of a digital safety commissioner to regulate content within the main mandate of the legislation.  The commissioner would have mandatory powers to implement legislation and capacity to build codes of practice and to issue notices or other takedown sanctions if the need arose.  Based on the data and research of that office, rules could be adjusted to ensure that the legislation remains effective and current.  We also believe there would be a substantial increase in safety, a reduction in crime and much more responsibility online if every account had a verified author.  This is not the current model for online companies anywhere but it would be a substantial safeguard against criminal behaviour and activity, such as that which happens on online dating sites, defamation, which happens with trolls and fake accounts across social media, and irresponsible posting.  Companies would be responsible for verifying.  Posters and authors would be responsible for their defamation or their criminal activity and harmful communications.  This should be universal but could at least be Ireland and Europe-wide.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the presence of Dara Quigley's mother and thank her for coming in.  I offer my sympathies on the death of Dara.</p> <p>  The function of this committee is such that we will produce a report.  Since we are lawmakers, the primary function of the report will be to explore how we think the law should be changed.  I say this just so the witnesses are aware of the process.  We are looking at a very broad sweep of issues.</p><p>I will start by looking at some issues that we all recognise as wrong and in respect of which the law needs to be changed.  I would like the witnesses to answer by explaining how they think the law should be changed in these areas.  I will mention as an example the case of a woman in a relationship who consents to the taking of intimate photographs, before the relationship ends and her ex-partner subsequently publishes the photographs on the Internet.  How do the witnesses believe the civil law should be changed in the first place?  The woman's right to privacy has been breached and her confidence has been eroded.  Is Ms Farries suggesting we should have a new statutory provision that recognises the statutory right to privacy of such a woman and provides her with a remedy in statute?</p></speech>

The use of the phrase "image-based sexual abuse" is better because it immediately and accurately conveys the significant harms entailed.  The term "non-consensual sharing of sexual images" does not capture the lack of consent involved when the images are created in the first instance.  It deals with the sharing aspect only.  Many cases, including that of Dara Quigley, have been identified in which images were created without a person's consent.  We need to be very clear about our terminology to ensure we draft effective solutions.  Drafting effective solutions at the legislative level must involve setting out a specific civil wrong to address image-based sexual abuse and providing for accompanying sanctions.  Legal aid options must also be made available to facilitate those who seek redress.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about privacy more generally.  This committee has considered legislating for privacy as well.  I want to make it clear that there is an established constitutional right to privacy and that privacy is a human right.  That is codified.  If it would be helpful to Ireland to put the right to privacy into State law to make it more clear to the Government how serious it is, I would not be opposed to it in principle.  Consideration would need to be given to how it would be drafted.</p></speech>

We are not just looking at the inaction of social media companies here; we are also looking at the inaction of the Garda and at the restrictions on judges.  If no laws adequately guide the Garda and our Judiciary, how can we point the finger at social media companies?  How can we say they need to take down certain content when it is not even illegal?  We need to make it illegal before we start looking at what social media companies should and should not be doing and at how they should be held accountable.</p></speech>

If representatives of the social media companies were sitting here, they would say that under the e-commerce directive, they take down any such images brought to their attention.  Many people are dissatisfied with that because when they contact social media companies, it takes a period of time for this to happen.  They find it difficult to invoke a statutory provision.  Do any of the witnesses think there would be a benefit to putting a more strict statutory provision on social media companies and holding them liable for any loss or emotional damage sustained by a person as a result of the publication of images of this nature?</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly take the point made by Ms Farries that young people need access to supports such as legal aid to engage in the redress process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the liability of companies.  We live in the real world.</p><p>From our perspective, there is a pragmatic response in these circumstances.  At present, under the e-commerce directive, the responsibility of platforms begins when they are notified of a piece of content.  We would broaden that to provide that they also have a responsibility to be proactive.  To pick up on the point made by Professor O'Higgins Norman, we are not greatly concerned about some of the larger platforms; we are concerned about platforms such as Snapchat and TikTok that have not engaged and are continuing to refuse to engage.  From our perspective, such services are overwhelmingly used by young people.  There needs to be an onus on such platforms to engage in proactive measures, such as hashing of images that have been shared, to prevent their resharing.  When we think about closed and encrypted spaces, we appreciate that encryption is set to proliferate further across all platforms.  The first point we would make from our perspective is that this approach can only work in circumstances in which platforms become responsible when they are notified.  We have seen a number of cases in which a significant takedown response has not been initiated by the platforms even though they have been notified.  Such cases have been escalated to us.  I know we are talking about the harmful communications Bill, but it cannot be divorced from the proposal to establish an office of digital safety commissioner.  There must be a place within the State where citizens can go to seek the takedown of a piece of content that has not been responded to by a platform.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Power think that would be of benefit to complainants in cases like that I have mentioned as an example?</p></speech>

Immediacy is of great importance to victims in cases like that described by the Deputy.  My organisation believes that young people should have immediate legal recourse and should be able to access legal counsel to enable the enforcement of the takedown of such content.  In less egregious cases, when the citizen involved has exhausted the avenues within the individual platform, he or she should have recourse to a regulator like a digital safety commissioner to enforce the removal of the content in question.</p></speech>

If we read this without having established an office of digital safety commissioner, it will not work.  In order to involve the social media companies or the online companies, we believe there is a real need for such companies to take a tiered approach at the civil level.  The job of the digital safety commissioner should be to raise awareness and - as part of a two-tiered approach - to take down content effectively, with sanctions where this does not happen.  That is where they would come in at the civil level.  The companies use the e-commerce directive the whole time.  If we look at how that is being developed by the European Court of Justice, we will see that there is increasing recognition of the need for effective takedown procedures.</p></speech>

First, there is a duty of care that the platform social media companies have towards their users and others, which the Deputy has mentioned.  Second, if people are not finding a quick enough remedy with a complain, they should be able to go to a statutory body or statutory officer who can act on their part very quickly.</p> <p>  The third is legislation if people want to pursue that.  There is a danger, if we go straight to defining something as a crime, that the victim has to retraumatise himself or herself to get a remedy.  We would be kind of thinking, especially when it comes to children, that there should be processes in place where it can be swiftly dealt with and addressed pretty quickly.  In addition, in the context of children, those who engage in cyberbullying behaviour need work done with them as well.  There are reasons for that and there needs to be some kind of intervention there as well.</p></speech>

This would mean that if somebody published defamatory or criminal material, he or she could be found and that would raise responsibility for everybody who wants to say something.

Harmful content has a broad sweep of meaning and ranges from the example that I gave at the outset to something like hurling abuse at a politician.  Do the witnesses think that people should be allowed to abuse other people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.1078" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Farries" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019102300002#P02900"><p>We are hearing very concerning propositions are being raised to the committee right now in the names of rights and we are concerned because they are, frankly, quite alarming.  The term "cyberbullying" is as concerning and challenging to legislate for as the term "online harm".  Vaguely defined terms such as this may include illegal content but it might also capture users' behaviours that are deemed harmful but not illegal and not sufficient to take down.  This, therefore, would have the effect of censoring speech and certain associated rights attached to that.</p> <p>  The UK Online Harms White Paper has introduced duty of care but that has been robustly criticised by qualified rights advocates.  Duty of care imposed on social media platforms, combined with heavy fines, creates incentives for platform companies to block online content, even if its illlegality is doubtful and even if it serves to further conversations about online abuse.</p><p>We have seen content moderation by social media companies.  Please forgive me, they are actively engaged.  They are not unengaged in this scenario.  We have seen them get it wrong repeatedly.  Women of colour complaining online about their experience of racist harassment will be censored.  That should not be censored.  We need to make sure that we do not incentivise the removal of speech to protect certain interest groups.</p><p> I refer to this dangerous proposition about user verification.  We do not support such proposals.  The ICCL is part of an international network of civil liberties organisations.  My colleagues in the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights have talked about an activist who was imprisoned, egregiously, for simply calling on people to gather and speak against their experiences of harm.  In 2013, Ave Abdul Fatah was violently arrested for talking about issues on Facebook and Twitter and he was only released last March.  The idea that people would be unable to speak out anonymously about their experiences of harm in areas where autocratic regimes erode civil rights is a problem.  That is something we absolutely need to protect not just gender considerations but intersectional considerations.</p></speech>

There are plenty of member states where activists, trade unionists and journalists are targeted and, indeed, have even been assassinated.  There is a superficial appeal to this idea of verification but it is deeply problematic in practice.  The Deputy compared expression online to driving a car on a road.  His analogy is problematic because one can also use the analogy of online expression in terms of expression more generally.  We do not require licences for people to be politically active, express themselves, protest or write letters to newspapers and so on.  This goes to the heart of the question about harmful content and, again, the analogy that was helpfully introduced by the Deputy, about expression that might cause distress to a politician.  We have a carefully crafted balance of freedom of expression within the Council of Europe area under the European Convention on Human Rights and, indeed, under the Constitution.  Once one starts getting into the concept of what might cause distress to others, in terms of being harmful, that is not amenable to a proportionate legal definition.  That is the problem we are likely to encounter if we go down this road.  It is not at all to understate the challenge of finding the right ways to deal with things that undoubtedly cause injury to people.  Of course, that is the challenge the committee has taken on but we need to be careful not to introduce vague concepts that will compound the problem.</p></speech>

We are definitely always on the side of the victim and concerned that supports exist for people who have been victimised.  For an LGBT young person in Turkey, for example, who has no physical supports in their community, the online environment is the only place that they can feel comfortable.  We do have to be careful that when we think about regulation that we do not prohibit free speech but we also do not take away supports for young people that exist today.  The supports never existed in the past so it is positive that they exist today.</p></speech>

On the point made by Ms Blackwell, the difficulty in finding the perpetrators of these types of crimes or proposed offences is not to be understated.  Ultimately, the way to come at that is a resourced law enforcement that is able to conduct these investigations in the way that is able to find the people who are responsible.  That is made more difficult by encryption and other such things that are, in our mind, proportionate.  The proportion of harms versus the normal day-to-day activities of citizens is small.  Should everything be de-encrypted just to allow law enforcement investigate those kinds of harms that are perpetrated or should law enforcement be enhanced, trained and provided with the resources to investigate these crimes in an effective and efficient manner?  At the moment the Garda is not resourced to be able to do that work.</p></speech>

Therefore, they are different from politicians receiving abuse.  Those of us working in the sexual violence sector and our colleagues working in the domestic violence sector would say that it is about impact of those images.  The abusive behaviour - the stalking and the capacity to know the points at which one can damage somebody - means that the impact on the person must be taken into account, be that a young person or an intimate or ex-intimate partner.</p></speech>

We came up with the topic of harmful content, which is a very subjective term.  There are some examples of behaviour such as those we discussed earlier that we all agree are clearly reprehensible and should be criminalised, but once we start going further down the line, it gets far more difficult and ambiguous.  I do believe people have the entitlement to abuse others, not just in the political sphere.  People can be abusive and we must be very careful about criminalising behaviour that is not clearly reprehensible behaviour such as the examples about which we spoke.  I thank the witnesses.  We must come up with solutions at the end of this process.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Callaghan said, we aim to sort out or come to some sense of where we can make recommendations regarding the reform of laws around all of this.  It goes into another area, which has been evident from the conversation.  Laws may not always be the appropriate way to deal with it and there may be other things that can be done.  I would like to tease that out.  One of the things I am interested in is the platforms and their liability in this area.  While there may be difficulty in finding the person because of anonymity, even when he or she is found, all one can do at the moment is ask the platforms to take it down.  The platforms can take down the offensive images or comments but often they do not.  There can be a fight to make sure that happens and the individual feels he or she is very much David against Goliath.  Should Goliath be more responsible for the situation?  Should there be some way of ensuring that the platform is liable and should there be a sanction against it if it does not act within an appropriate timeframe?  We know the Internet is instant, which is what makes it great to use.  How do the witnesses think ensuring platforms take down offensive content within an appropriate timeframe could be legislated for or do they think there is a means of legislating for it?</p></speech>

That was the focus of my research so it involved the tools these companies already have.  I am not a legal scholar so I do not feel competent to speak on the issue of liability.  I understand both sides in terms of freedom of expression and innovation on the one hand and the need to protect on the other.  It is extremely important for victims to have a streamlined way of communicating what has happened and an effective way to take down content that has harmed them in some way.  It can be difficult for companies to do that for various reasons.  Very often, even if the poster is anonymous, the problem is not just with him or her.  Content spreads easily and is very easily shared so the problem becomes a cultural problem.</p> <p>  I will give a perfect example of this.  I have studied the cases of children who have died by suicide in different countries.  This happened because their intimate images were shared online without their consent, for example, through predators.  What really got to them and in a way brought about that tragic outcome was the bullying from their peers that took place afterwards, so it was not about the poster and taking down that one piece of content or even punishing the poster.  It was about the wider culture of bullying.  It is important to take the content down and point out that this form of abuse is not okay, particularly when someone is a young person, but it is not enough.  Of course, companies should be responsible but regulating their liability is a very difficult question.</p><p> In respect of the proposal for a digital services Act in the European Commission and the e-commerce directive, it is a very difficult question that legal scholars must address.  This committee should bear in mind that taking down this content is really not enough.  It is very important to know that even if we incentivise the companies by proposing fines, which is one aspect of what the Australian eSafety Commissioner is doing, it is not enough of a solution.</p><p> It is also very important that we need to evaluate continually what the companies are already doing.  If they say they have an effective reporting mechanism, there needs to be a way to determine through independent research how effective that is from the perspective of victims, particularly if the victims are young people.  </p></speech>

From our perspective, we disagree with the title of online safety commissioner.  Any school curriculum that is developed should not just focus on how to protect one's password.  It talks about not sharing a toothbrush.  Those analogies are very helpful and useful for working with children, but ultimately it is about not being a bad actor oneself and reframing it in that way.</p> <p>  We feel there should be monetary sanctions on the platforms after they have been notified and if it has been escalated to the regulator.  For example, in Australia and New Zealand, there are fines of up to $300,000 for every instance of non-compliance with the takedown request from the regulator.  The established platforms will comply with that and build systems to ensure that those requirements are complied with.  For us, it is very helpful in tackling some of those entities that are perhaps not domiciled here or within the EU as a way to engage them with the regulatory structures here as we might establish them.</p></speech>

The answer is "Yes", which is why we proposed solutions for two Goliaths here - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the need for it to human rights-proof its practices, and the State and its desire to expand CCTV unnecessarily, thereby capturing all of us in an increasing web of technological surveillance.  We have framed this by reminding the committee of the experience of Dara Quigley.  It is not just about the social media companies, although that is certainly a significant question.  As Dr. McIntyre has told this committee, that is very much an EU project.  Meanwhile, here in Ireland, we have much more of what he described as easy wins, such as access to discrete pieces of legislation, for example, on image-based sexual abuse, and looking at the practices of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure they are human rights-proofed and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources and education to do that effectively.</p></speech>

Those of us who followed that case saw how an agency of the State behaved in that manner and failed repeatedly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has appeared before this committee many times and we are always assured that everything is done properly and followed through, yet this case and others arise.  It is a very appropriate warning that things are not right and that we need to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I was going to follow up on my question about the Goliaths.  If all those agencies were held to account, one of their arguments is that when they get this stuff up and it goes out there, they lose a certain amount of control.  It is my view, and I wonder if it is shared, that if greater sanctions were in place, the companies could build it in to ensure they would have more control.</p><p>I certainly see that reflected in online content, which is often very intimidatory and bullying.  When two groups in society identify online as opposites, they start arguing online and some of the dialogue becomes terribly intimidating and aggressive.  This attracts an audience.  I sometimes think that this is the social media companies' game.  It is what they want.  That also needs to be examined.  Bullying is a very closely related issue.  As others have said, this goes beyond what happens online.  It concerns society at large.  Mention has been made of a cultural problem.  People behave much worse online than they would if they were in a room with each other.  When they get used to behaving a certain way online, they start behaving the same way on the street or in a room with others.  That is where it can lead. </p><p> It is almost a closed or fascistic mindset.  It is about domination and refusing to have any civil discourse on anything.  It is a case of them being right and all others being wrong.  People form identity groups, which they can do very easily online.  It is a way of enhancing their status.  People come to think that nobody is as good as their group.  Their view of themselves is so wonderful that anyone who says anything else is to be wiped out.  This culture has developed considerably online and I now see it developing in society.  Everyone can recognise this as very harmful.  Should there be an obligation on the social media companies, which provide the space for this to happen, to warn against it?  There should be legislation obliging them to give space on their sites to warning messages, just like we have legislation requiring labels on cigarettes to warn that they are dangerous.  There should be a warning on social media-----</p></speech>

It is not in the interests of social media companies to put up the kind of warnings that might have been issued by dating agencies in the good old days.  There is something to that.  The codes of conduct established in other countries like Australia have led to better practices.  Governments find it easier to create obligations for companies.  That requires a digital safety commissioner, although we do not have to use that title if <i>SpunOut.ie</i>does not like it and has a better word.  Those codes of conduct are needed because sharing is the essence of what online companies do.  They will have to be told they cannot do it before they will stop.</p></speech>

It goes to the heart of human nature and the way human beings behave when they are not educated to appreciate kindness, inclusivity, diversity and equality.  One analogy is the time in history when schools were first established.  Bullying happened in classrooms and teachers did not see it as a problem.  They saw it as boys being boys.  They thought it was just how kids behaved, and as long as it did not get too far out of hand, teachers did not see a need to step in.  Educators later realised the damage this caused to individuals and we realised that education has a very important role in helping human beings to overcome the inclination to dominate or be aggressive towards others.</p><p>Perhaps something similar needs to happen in the new parallel society online and some kind of duty of care should emerge.  If I own a coffee shop and two people are having an argument in it, am I responsible for that argument?  Probably not, but I have a duty of care if the argument gets out of hand and I might need to step in and ask them to take their argument somewhere else.  I would be obliged to uphold a standard of behaviour in the coffee shop.  Something should be done to make that duty of care very clear to social media companies and other platforms.  It must be clear that certain standards of behaviour are not acceptable in this space.  I do not know how that can be realised technologically.  In the past, people joined clubs that had rules.  When people joined the club they signed up to behave in a certain way, knowing that if they did not do so they would be shown the door.  This is not a new problem but we need to deal with it in a new place, that is, online. </p></speech>

In regard to individual behaviour, it is very important not to focus on warning people about what may happen if they engage with social media.  That implies that it is individuals' responsibility not to be abused.  We think it is better to focus on creating firm codes of conduct that apply to everyone who is active online, on a social media platform or elsewhere.  It should be our responsibility not to abuse others on the platform.  How that works must be very clearly laid out.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to the points made about social media companies' behaviour.  Reference has been made to the point at which a piece of content is shared too much and taking it down is effectively beyond the power of these companies.  It is important to outline how modern social media companies operate.  Much has been said about the challenges of getting a piece of content taken down.  While the companies may not have control over whether an individual uploads something, a piece of content, abusive or otherwise, does not get hundreds of thousands of views and shares because individual users choose to amplify it.  A modern social media platform generally has algorithms that work behind the scenes to boost content.  The technical details can be murky but as we will all be aware, content is generally boosted because it is controversial.  It is content people want to click on because it might outrage them or elicit a reaction.  Everyone who is on Twitter will be aware that users no longer have to actively amplify a piece of content to get it on to other people's timelines.  Content is shared because it is popular.  It is a chicken and egg phenomenon.  However, that does not happen in a vacuum.  It certainly does not happen because we all decide to boost a certain piece of content.  It happens because of processes social media companies put in place to boost content.  It is absolutely the case that the bigger a piece of content is, the more the companies are responsible.  We should never assume that content simply gets out of a platform's control.  The reason something gets out of control is the processes those platforms have actively put in place and propagated. </p></speech>

The term "parallel society" is an accurate description of this.  The difficulty is that this parallel society is a real society.  It is real for the people who are in it, and it has a real impact.</p><p>A failing since the Internet gained widespread popularity is that society and governments have considered that the problem is happening at some remove and should be left alone.

I thank them for their presentations, which I have read.  My mind is going in several directions regarding the questions I should ask.  It is a very helpful process for us because there is no simple solution.  I acknowledge the points made by the witnesses, especially those from the ICCL, regarding the balancing of rights and the importance of the Garda, the State and the Oireachtas in addition to the platforms.  I am aware that only some of the bigger platforms have appeared before the committee.  The witnesses have pointed out that there are other platforms about which we should be equally worried.  The bigger companies reassured the committee of their interest in this area, as they do, in order to make profit, as they are entitled to do.  However, they referred to the e-commerce directive but did not freely acknowledge it is not up to scratch or fit for purpose.  We know it is not and that there is a process under way to update it.</p> <p>  The committee asked the companies about their self-regulation.  They were quite confident that their self-regulation was robust.  What jumps out at me are the comments of the representatives of the ICCL and the NABRRC regarding more accountability.  The NABRRC submission it states: "Commissioning research into the evaluation of effectiveness of company self-regulatory measures should precede and inform any further steps about regulation."  Similarly, the ICCL is asking for companies to be more open in supplying information.  It seems to me that we are looking at a problem that we are all anecdotally aware is very serious, but we do not have the information to inform us on the proper steps to take.  There is a danger that we will go down the wrong route.  I will revert to Ms Blackwell.  My heart agrees with verification but I do not think it is the solution because it does not strike a balance with open and free expression.  Is Professor O'Higgins Norman aware whether that research been done?  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>

I have looked into how much children are using the tools being provided by the companies and whether they are aware of them.  The companies have told the committee about their safety and help centres which provide educational advice to children in cases of bullying, for example.  The question is whether those tools are useful if children, parents and teachers are not aware of or using them.  I asked children who were using them whether they found them helpful in bullying situations.  If the companies are acknowledging that we need regulation but are pointing to these tools as examples of the good things they are doing, and the committee wishes to hold them accountable in that regard, then we need to be able to see how effective these things are.</p></speech>

A survey with a nationally representative sample found that more children were aware of the companies' reporting and blocking tools, but fewer were aware of the safety and help centres.  One should assess how effective those tools are for children.  They are not the only tools being used by the companies, which are starting to rely more and more on artificial intelligence.  They are open about that in their transparency reports.</p></speech>

It is a very important issue that requires more time and attention than it has received.  It is a good start to focus on social media companies as it goes to the heart of the matter.  The UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, David Kaye, has called for radical transparency from social media companies.  He stated that there needs to be a radical disclosure of all information in a manner that is meaningful.  Our perspective is that is not a radical request; it should be absolutely normative that social media companies be transparent in that way.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what the ICCL has done on this issue.  We issued two sets of submissions, both of which are available online and one of which regards content moderation generally and also the submissions to this committee specifically.  I very much appreciated the Deputy's questioning of Karen White of Twitter regarding what that transparency means.  The Deputy asked whether Twitter is disclosing what is going on in the background and being forthright in its quarterly publications.  The ICCL agrees with Amnesty International that those publications do not go far enough.  They present data, but those data are not meaningful.  Amnesty International provides very specific suggestions on how to make the data meaningful.  For example, the company may state that it took down content in a particular number of egregious situations and claim that is amazing.  We would like to know the number of reports of abuse it receives per year which fail to receive a response from the company.  We would like the reports to be disaggregated by category of abuse reported.  Social media companies often highlight that they took down particular posts or pages.  We would like to know the average time for such harmful material to be taken down.  That question has been asked of the social media companies by the committee.  We need to see that information transparently provided in their published reports, but that is not being done.</p></speech>

Of course, it is only as good as its operation on the ground.  We have a letter from members stating that, in the past nine months, Twitter's engagement really has not been as good.  In fact, the members of the council seem to be begging for a phone call with the chief executive officer.  Perhaps "begging" is the wrong word but they are appealing for a phone call.

We would engage on a more constructive basis with the platforms and take an approach where we would escalate any issues that we have to them directly.

Self-regulation is not enough.  These initiatives that the companies have established, from our perspective, are hugely welcome.

There is a percentage of real people who are in situations where content that has affected them has not been removed.</p></speech>

Our helpline is starting to capture the use of technology as a growing trend.  We started looking at it back in 2016 and, at that stage, less than 1% of the callers were speaking about online harassment and communications in addition to the sexual violence they had suffered.  That had increased to 1.3% in 2017 and, in 2018, the figure was still less than 2% but it is rising.</p></speech>

The fact that there is not a sufficient criminal framework means that even reporting complaints to the Garda is difficult.  That is true for the once-off sharing of an image by an intimate partner, or former intimate partner, of a person.  That image may have been taken consensually but is shared non-consensually or was taken non-consensually.  There are also cases where the harassment is so-called upskirting or the covert taking of images.  Those issues cannot even be reported to the Garda, let alone brought to a stage where somebody is in a position to bring a civil suit on privacy grounds.</p><p>Legal aid and the lack of law is in some ways the most significant problem we see, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

We need to move away from using the term "revenge porn" rather than "abuse", which Ms Blackwell has mentioned.  It is abuse to transmit the sexual image.  One thing is language and another is where we go on legislation.  Third is the larger issue of accountability and openness and how we do that.  We need that information.  We need information to analyse the problem and its extent.  Currently, it appears to be gender based once again, which has to be said.</p></speech>

It is a centrepoint of our submission that there is common agreement on the need for a discreet and specific amendment to that legislation to deal with this issue.  It is also agreed that legal aid is a central issue, which we identify in our submission.  As the committee will be aware, there are wider challenges within the legal aid system and there are other areas but this is clearly one which is about practical implementation.  I echo the comments of Dr. T.J. McIntyre who attended the committee last week and said there was a great deal which could be done to implement the existing law effectively.  That should include providing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with financial resources, human resources and technical expertise.  There is a great deal that can be done to enhance current implementation.</p></speech>

Things happen but something must be done about them.  However, nothing was done about that.  I am not going into the personal details but it would be remiss of me not to mention the case.

This is an area which has been of huge interest to Deputies, Senators and society as a whole.  I will be brief, as I do not want to labour any point.  We are here because of what was done to Dara Quigley.  I did not know her but a terrible wrong was done to that young woman.  We look at social media as a wondrous thing but it has an underbelly of depravity, which sometimes brings out the worst in people.</p><p>Justice has not been served with regard to those involved in Dara Quigley's untimely death, but I hope it will be.</p><p> These platforms make a great deal of money from young people and there is a form of social baiting that takes place on them.  They give a platform to people who would not normally act out in some ways.  They are given ways to act out online.  There is a great responsibility on technology companies to act responsibly not only in respect of themselves but in relation to the people who use their platforms.  Everybody has a smartphone.  In some ways, we love them because they are so useful and permit human beings across the world to communicate.  However, they have also become dangerous weapons that can destroy someone in the blink of an eye.  There have been other incidents in which people have shared images, videos and all sorts of material which were deeply personal and have wronged not only the victim but the victim's family also.  It is extremely difficult to police it.  The genie is out of the bottle.  How do we monitor the wild web?  It comes down sometimes to our own behaviour but largely to the companies that provide this technology.  They say it is freedom of expression and freedom of speech but one does not provide freedom of hate and freedom of depravity which hurts other people.</p><p> The question is how to police these platforms.  The law needs to change.  It must be updated from where it was in the mid-1990s.  The Internet did not exist as it does now 20 to 25 years ago.  If individuals did elsewhere what they sometimes do online, they would generally end up in court.  In Dara Quigley's case, for example, if someone put such images up in the form of posters all over the city centre and was identified, he or she would end up in a court of law.  There is no doubt about that.  However, the fig leaf provided by online platforms has given some people the green light to do things they should not.  It is just an observation.  The law must be updated.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act dates from the 1990s and contains no reference to cyberbullying or digital or online harassment.  I understand the law will be updated by the end of the current parliamentary term.  I hope that happens to protect everyone who uses the Internet.  The Internet is here to stay but while there are positives to it, there is also an underbelly that has extremely detrimental effects on our physical and mental health.</p></speech>

I became aware of the topic quite late and, as such, it was a bit of a last-minute dash.  I thank the committee for allowing me to contribute.</p> <p>  I am motivated to come here by two particular cases, namely, that of Dara Quigley and that of Jacqueline Griffin.</p><p>I have specific questions which are directed at all the witnesses.  One of the questions has in some way been answered in terms of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act.  What do the witnesses think of Deputy Howlin's proposed legislation?  Alternatively, to they believe we should look to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act?  I also refer to the amendment suggested by Dara's mam, Aileen Malone, on not including a requirement concerning intent to cause distress.  There is a huge onus on the individual or family to prove the intent of somebody else to cause distress.  In terms of the question concerning the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act or Deputy Howlin's legislation, how do the witnesses feel about moving away from revenge porn and creating another form of offence that does not specify that requirement on an individual?  I am not sure how many members are aware of Jacqueline Griffin's case concerning the sharing of her decapitated remains following her death on the M50.  She was a family friend of mine and her brother is one of my closest pals.  Because I know the distress and harm that caused to the Griffin family, I asked for their consent before I raised Jacqui's case because I watched the absolute horror that family faced.  I sat with him while he begged me to tell him the truth on whether I have seen that image, where it is and if it is still online.  It was absolutely horrific.  How do we begin to move, in the legislation and in the development of policy, to also include and have a conversation about giving consent when somebody is no longer alive to give it?  Paul asked me to contribute on his behalf this morning.  He sent me a few lines to read which I will paraphrase.  He says it better than I can.</p><blockquote>Jacqui wasn't alive to consent to the sharing of her decapitated remains all over social media.  Just because her accident happened in a public place should not mean that she does not have a right to privacy and dignity.  The damage that this caused our family has destroyed our faith in humanity.  It goes beyond the initial trauma of just seeing the image, but has completely destroyed our emotional well-being.  Everyday life is impossible.  Everything from travel, work and even our own ability to have an online presence.</blockquote><p>How can we begin to legislate for that?  We are very aware of who shared that image and I wonder what should be the criminal sanction on somebody that records somebody's death and something so horrific.  The online platforms acted as quickly as they could when we tried to intervene at the time.  How can we create legislation to deal with the recording by an individual of someone's death and is that an area that has been examined in the context of causing of harm?  Obviously the person in question is no longer there to take the case.  Can the case be taken on behalf of the family and due to the impact on the family?  What is the legal position in terms of that family being able to pursue something?  I wonder if that could be part of the conversation.</p></speech>

I also thank Paul for the statement, which captures very well the types of harms that are experienced when these images are shared without consent online.  It illustrates perfectly how incredibly damaging and challenging it can be.  I would like to respond to the two specific questions asked by Senator Ruane about criminalisation and the types of legislation that we might look at.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties supports the findings of the Law Reform Commission.  There might be an amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act in order to criminalise those sorts of behaviour.  We specifically talked about image-based sexual abuse.  We support the criminalisation of that through an amendment of that specific Act.  We also support the creation of a civil wrong.  That is the response to the first question.</p> <p>  I will now respond to the second question on the intent to cause distress.  Senator Ruane referenced Dara's mother's statements about that to the media.  There is Scottish legislation dealing with image-based sexual abuse that focuses on the circulation of these images with the intent to cause distress.</p><p>That does not go far enough because, as we have said in the submissions, intention to cause distress is not the only motivation.  There are a variety of intentions.  To be clear; criminal law requires intent.  There needs to be an action and an intention.  We just want to be careful that we do not inadvertently narrow that intention so that other reasons are lost.  Perhaps someone circulates an image because he or she thinks it will be lucrative and he or she wants to make a lot of money.  Perhaps it is being done for salacious reasons.  Perhaps the principal motivation is to violate someone's autonomy and dignity.  That does not necessarily capture distress alone so, as always, we need to be very careful about how we draft this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.1209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Power" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019102300002#CC00200"><p>I thank Senator Ruane for raising this case.  I also thank Paul for allowing us to hear Jacqueline's story today.  From our perspective, as Ms Farries has described, any legal framework has to consider intent but it should also include impact.  One of the things that we have seen in the devastating consequence of harms that are caused to people through the sharing of content online is that often the impact is minimised and often is not well understood.  While we might have heard of Jacqueline's case at the time, it is really important to hear Paul's story today articulating that it does not just end there, that the impact is much further-reaching and there is a longevity to it that people do not realise.  From our perspective, in terms of somebody who shared those images, and in the case of Dara Quigley as well, while obviously we are not in those people's frame of mind, we have seen that the public are just not aware of the consequences of their actions.  Whether there is intent there or not, people need to understand that publishing images as distressing as the ones mentioned denies a person the right to privacy and dignity.</p> <p>  One of the first cases we had to comment on in that regard concerned a music festival and a young girl whose images were posted online.  We would have thought we had come some way since that point towards understanding the consequences of sharing content that we do not have the right to share.  It is not within our gift to decide whether content should be shared.  There is obviously context to the issue as well.  We must think about the platforms as well, in that when the Arab Spring was happening or even when the violence was perpetrated against people fighting for independence in Catalonia, there is a context to some of this content.  We should be able to see some of the harms that are caused to people but, again, it should be proportionate and there should be mature consideration about where that applies and where it does not apply.  For us, ultimately, it has to focus on impact on the individual.  Again, the reason we need a digital safety commissioner is to be able to escalate hard cases like this where time is of the essence to be able to restrict the further sharing of such content.  To be fair, the platforms do respond in certain circumstances such as those outlined.  I do not think they have to be of such a gravity as the cases of Jacqueline and Dara to require a quick response.  Every case where there is content about a person or that causes a person distress should be responded to just as quickly as in those circumstances.  We need to create the framework to allow that to happen.</p></speech>

Most of the work we do is with young people but we just should not engage in adult-to-adult sharing.  We have rights but there are responsibilities on us to act appropriately.</p><p>Young people are a little better at this because they have lived more in the online world and are fluid between both.  For some reason, the adult generation seems to see it as being separate offline and online worlds.  We do not seem to see that we have to be responsible online in the same way.</p><p> With regard the impact of bullying, the definition of bullying that we use in our work and research is that there has to be repetition, intent to cause harm, a negative impact and a power hierarchy.  That holds for cyberbullying when it is peer-to-peer, but some of those things will be different.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned that it might not be persistent.  A person might take one photo, so it might be hard to penalise that person or say that he or she is perpetrating bullying because he or she has only done it once or shared it once.  However, the impact on the victim is repetitive and those images have been shared all over the place.  It is persistent in that sense and it is harder to see if there was intent to cause harm.  Once those images are available, there will be an impact no matter what, because one does not know where they are and cannot imagine where they will go next.  The ideas relating to intent needs to be changed.  We need to think more about consent being sought and make sure that we have appropriate language, understanding that we should be asking for consent from the beginning before we take any image and share it.  Rather than focusing on sexual or horrific content, it should be in our day-to-day language and we should flip the way society talks about it from being a separate, online issue.  We should be asking for consent offline before taking a photo or sharing it.  Young people are a bit better at doing that than adults.</p></speech>

There is also the matter of decency.  We should have a core value system that means that a person will not do something just because he or she is not allowed to but because he or she should not do it.  If we lose that in society, then an educational response is needed across society.  We keep talking about schools but it also applies outside schools, in the community, in clubs and wherever people gather.  We need to re-educate society about what it means to be a decent individual.</p></speech>

They may not be in our law at present.  The law should be much clearer that they are communications and also that they are communications that result in harmful content being shared.  Many other jurisdictions, such as Australia, have come up with ways of framing that.  New Zealand talks about serious emotional distress, as experienced by the Griffin family.  As Mr. Power said, there does not have to be a death to cause serious emotional distress but it can be a factor.  The fact that we do not have sufficiently clear legislation to cover this as a communication and then to recognise that it is a harmful sharing or communication needs to be addressed quickly.  Our figures show that it is becoming an increasing problem.  We need to make sure that those things are clear because, to answer the Senator's question, the current law is not strong enough to deal with it, and it needs to be.</p></speech>

It is in Article 40.3 of our Constitution, Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  We have a wholesale right to privacy.  It is well established and well codified.  What we lack are specific laws about specific crimes, which we can address through the Law Reform Commission and our submissions.  There needs to be a culture within the Garda to be able to tackle that and to have human rights-based principles and sufficient resources to take it on.</p></speech>

I have listened to what has been said and I am very conscious of Senator Ruane's contribution.  The contributions indicate the multifaceted nature of what we are dealing with.  I am not a legal expert, nor am I an expert on social media, as much as I would like to think I am.  It is absolutely apparent that young people are using platforms that are not even familiar to most of us.  We had a presentation on this theme at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly yesterday, where I asked the question that I am going to ask the witnesses.  Please do not interpret it as me being glib since I mean it sincerely.  Since it represents the bulk of what we are dealing with and what we understand to be the main form of online harassment and harmful communication, I would like to get some understanding from the witnesses about how we go about legislating for toxic, harmful or warped masculinity.  For me, there seems to be a common thread throughout most, though not all, harmful, abusive communications online.  The need for education and a cultural change was discussed at the meeting I was at yesterday and that is absolutely the case.</p> <p>  We have referred to the main social media providers such as Twitter and Facebook and things being posted on their services.  We could implement laws and define the legal instruments required to deal with some of this.  However, if we do not legislate for the root cause, then even with the greatest will in the world, if something is posted and dealt with in a matter of minutes, taken down, and sin &eacute;, it has still found its way in that time onto WhatsApp and such, where it is shared on perhaps 47 different group chats with an average of 20 people each.  There is an issue of culpability, and I would like a clearer understanding of who is responsible.  Is it the producer of the image, the sharer or the holder?  People have God knows how many WhatsApp messages a day and sometimes they do not even know what they have been sent.</p> <p>  I would appreciate the witnesses' views on those themes.  That is not to let the providers off the hook.  Legal and legislative instruments need to be agreed and provided for, but we need to address it fundamentally as opposed to just saying that we need to change the culture or to have a societal conversation.  We have seen that problem of toxic, harmful and warped understandings of masculinity on public platforms and how harmful some of that can be.  It happened in my own home city, with the notorious trial that took place last year.</p></speech>

I do not have an answer to that but I certainly know that education works.  When we teach young people about diversity and inclusion, and give them other opportunities to think about what it means to be a man or a woman, research shows that it makes a difference.</p><p>My PhD was in the area of homophobic bullying and we tested educational initiatives to reduce homophobic bullying among males.  When they were implemented, they worked.  From an educational point of view, there are many examples of how to proceed on this.  Legally, how to enforce that or criminalise people for being a bad type of guy, and so on, is a question for someone else.</p></speech>

We have not yet seen what the professor is talking about in terms of the education that is required, although it is happening to a degree.  Do we need to wait a few years before we start to see that at a broad, informed, societal level?</p></speech>

For example, the introduction of the Equal Status Acts and related legislation around that sends a message out to society that we should not discriminate against people on certain grounds, but it also has a ripple effect and it has an effect in terms of thinking about their behaviour.  That kind of legislation, set alongside education, can have a very positive effect.  However, there is still not enough going on in our education system.  I do not know if the generation coming out of school today will be any better around these topics.</p> <p>  There is currently a revision of the RSE programme in schools that is being undertaken by the NCCA and I hope that revised RSE programme will seek to tackle these issues of toxic masculinity and restricted forms of femininity and so on, in a more direct way than we have in the past.  That requires resourcing and education and training for teachers.  Research tells us they are slow to deal with some of these topics in the classroom because they are not comfortable talking to kids about some of the issues that might come up in a classroom when dealing with these topics.  Education certainly helps.</p></speech>

From our perspective, it underscored the amount of work we have to do to effect that cultural change, and education is the silver bullet in that regard.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is from infancy upwards, which is a long game.  However, in terms of what we can do in the short and medium term, for perpetrators, who are predominantly male, at present there is no accountability so there is no deterrent to refrain from engaging in either offensive behaviour or harmful behaviour.  The purpose of all of us being here today is that we have seen that the lack of specific offences on the Statute Book has prevented garda&iacute; in local Garda stations around the country from being able to take reports and complaints from citizens about, say, image-based sexual abuse, harassment, cyberbullying or otherwise, and bring those cases through to resolution after deciding whether it is a civil or criminal matter.</p> <p>  From our perspective, we need to see the garda&iacute; being able to very clearly see what is an offence on the Statute Book and being able to take that and enforce it, so there is a deterrent that stops people from engaging in this type of behaviour.  At present, there simply is not.  We see so many cases where images are shared in private messaging groups and, ultimately, there is no sanction for that.  Therefore, we cannot be surprised that it continues to happen.</p> <p>  We do not solicit these cases and we are not a one-to-one service, but somehow they still come to us because there is nowhere else for people to go.  We have had a number of cases where younger guys, perhaps in their late teens, have shared images with somebody else, where the other person had a false identity and was then extorting them with the threat of sharing the images publicly.  That has a huge impact on those young people.</p><p>We have been able to escalate them to the child exploitation unit within the Garda.  However, at local level the resources and capacity to respond are just not available.  We need the legal framework to be able to do it.  We need legal aid for young people to gain access to remedies quickly.  Ultimately, we need the regulation to regulate any other harmful content.</p><p> To address the Senator's opening point, just because something is posted and taken down quickly, there is still the event and it should still be prosecuted, particularly where adults are concerned.  It is not enough to have the content removed.  It still needs to be pursued.  It is not the case that once the content is removed, that is the end of the matter.  It should be pursued relentlessly in order that a deterrent is clear and clearly established in order that we can start to clamp down on this behaviour.  I hope education will do us right in time, but it is a long game.  We need to have the legal framework now in order to be able to deal with things in the short and medium term.</p></speech>

I recognise that it is not just a general air of toxic masculinity or toxic anything else, but very often it is a malicious intention to do harm through digital communications which currently cannot really be prosecuted.  The current harassment laws are insufficient, as are current stalking laws.  We need a better definition of communication and to have it recognised that, where harmful behaviour happens, it is harmful by reference to impact.  It will take into account particularly those who are targeted, not just the general fall-out of the harmful behaviour.  Sometimes, people are targeted and that should be a particular element of the prosecution in the case, which is very important.  It is the carrot and stick approach.  The carrot is education, with which we all agree.  As for the stick, to go back to Deputy O'Callaghan's analogy about driving a car, we stopped drink-driving partly by awareness raising but also because people's driving licences were being taken off them.  We need personal prosecution, as well as awareness raising.</p></speech>

It is part of the problem that needs to be addressed and it is very important.  Dara Quigley was certainly exposed to it.  It is not absent from law enforcement institutions.  Long ago academics used to think that what they called information and communications technology spaces would create safe zones for people who were experiencing things like toxic masculinity to group, talk and collaborate.  What we are seeing instead is the opposite in that the inequalities we experience offline are amplified online.  Toxic masculinity is certainly an example.</p> <p>  As for solutions, in our submissions to the committee, in addition to law and our rejection of the roll-out of State CCTV surveillance systems, we advocate changing these cultural issues at Garda level.  We advocate education, training, assessment and integrated modules across units to ensure the harm attached to the intersectional nature of online harassment, including toxic masculinity, are addressed.  We have to be very careful that we do not erase the context of power and marginalisation in which the inequalities occur by simply saying something like "bullying" or "cyberbullying".  West Coast LEAF is a rights group in Canada and I am a lawyer who used to practice in Canada.  It likes the term cybermisogyny because it captures better the harm associated with things like toxic masculinity.</p></speech>

For example, we might bring to bear a legislative requirement for advertisements or perhaps users to have to go through a firewall to access some of these things.  Is there a role for providers to talk to people, regardless of age - it can be designed and framed in a certain way - about the issues of consent and people's own personal responsibility?  I have worked previously in education and think there is a role for education providers to play, but it needs to be even broader.</p><p>We need to empower and enable parents and guardians in speaking to their kids about these matters in an informed and appropriate way.  We must also empower youth clubs and youth service providers.  This may be happening already, but I am not aware if it is.  How crucial is it that we reach a position where we can compel some of the providers in raising and honing in on some of these matters?</p></speech>

To be clear, some social media companies are doing absolutely nothing in this area, including dating sites, etc.  They are big social media platforms, but they are not doing any work in this area, at least to my knowledge.</p></speech>

They provide that education voluntarily.  In our submission we propose that it should not just be up to the company's corporate social responsibility or self-regulatory practices but that there should be a requirement for them to assist with funding, with the Government, for education.  We speak about young people, but I cannot speak for other parts of society.  In addition to funding education measures, there should be psychological assistance for victims when bullying happens, for example.  We would have to leave how it would be executed to the committee.  Broadly, it should not just be done on a voluntary basis.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to her family for continuing to fight her corner for her because of the injustices she suffered, as well as to the ICCL for the campaign it will launch seeking justice for her.  Is it because of the law that no one is being held responsible for the abuse she suffered before her death?  It was responsible for her death.  I am convinced by the various presentations made, by which I have been informed and educated, that legal changes are needed.  Is it the case that there is no law applying under which somebody could be held responsible?  I refer to the garda who shared the video, etc. and whether they could currently be held responsible.  Is it simply a legislative problem or are there other problems which mean that people are not being held accountable?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-10-23a.1247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Farries" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019102300002#HH01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  The laws need to be updated, but it is not simply about the law.  There are issues at Garda level that we have outlined and identified.  There must be cultural changes at that level and we have provided suggestions on how to do it.  There was a third suggestion that I have repeated over and over again today, but it has completely escaped me.  I feel it has not been part of the conversation, which is why it has left my mind.  </p> <p>  What about the expanding web of surveillance technology in the State to which we are all exposed?  It is increasing every day and it is not just coming from private companies.  It comes from the State.  We must fundamentally rethink it for the sake of privacy which, as I have outlined, is heavily codified.  There are also data protection principles at EU level.  The use of closed-circuit television systems is wholly unnecessary, given the level of invasion of our privacy.  The egregious treatment of Dara Quigley really illustrates the point.  The risks to our privacy and willingness to associate with people important to us, travel to areas of a city important to us and speak out are too great.  A host of rights are implicated.  The data which suggest CCTV systems warrant that invasion of our fundamental rights are not available.</p><p>It is not worth it and the horrible experience of Ms Dara Quigley illustrates that.  This is a call to the committee to keep that under consideration when it examines the problem of online harassment.  There are individual perpetrators and social media companies but we cannot forget the role of the State.</p></speech>

If Deputy Murphy is finished, it remains for me to say it has been a very informative session.  On behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I thank Mr. Herrick, who had to leave early and had indicated that to me previously.  I also thank Ms Farries from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  Well done to Mr. Ian Power and Mr. Jack Eustace from SpunOut.ie on their work and I thank them for their contribution.  Professor O'Higgins Norman, Dr. Foody and Dr. Milosevic have been very helpful in today's process and I thank them very much.  They are based in DCU and we wish them continued success in the work of the national anti-bullying research and resource centre.  Ms Blackwell and Ms Scott had little opportunity to prepare but seized the moment when the gap appeared.  Well done as always.</p> <p>  I certainly will not conclude the meeting without making reference to the fact that we have for all the sad but right reasons reflected very particularly on the very tragic passing of Ms Dara Quigley.  As has been mentioned, we are honoured to have her mother, Ms Aileen Malone, with us in the Public Gallery.  I know it cannot have been easy for her to attend this morning but we thank her and those who accompanied her here this morning to our final session on online harassment and harmful communication.  In her absence, I thank Senator Lynn Ruane for introducing the brief but very pertinent statement of the brother of the late Ms Jacqueline Griffin.  These and many other cases have been addressed or highlighted over the past four weeks of hearings and they are the driver behind us choosing to try to grapple with this.  Each of the sessions, including today's, which is no different, demonstrates that this is a very complex area and it is not a simple matter.  It will not be simply remedied.</p> <p>  As colleagues have said, we now have the responsibility to prepare a report and deliberate on the recommendations we will put forward.  I hope, if we are still a sitting Parliament, we will have the opportunity to publish that report and recommendations in late November or December.  We do not know if we will still be here but we hope we will.  We do not want to lose the value and potential of this exercise.  I invite all members present, including Deputies Paul Murphy and Gino Kenny, who are not members of the committee, to join us for a group photograph with our guests outside in order to complete our snapshots of these sessions.</p></speech>
