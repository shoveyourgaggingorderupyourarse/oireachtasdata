I welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his officials.</p> <p>  At the request of broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors in the Public Gallery are requested that, for the duration of the meeting, mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device.  It is not sufficient to put phones on silent mode, as it maintains a level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Before we proceed to consideration of the Bill, I call Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>

Very tragically and suddenly, he passed away yesterday.  Because he was a regular attendee at the committee, I thought it would be appropriate for the committee to write to his family and express our condolences on his passing.  I can pass on the contact details to the Clerk.</p></speech>

We have gone through the standstill period and that standstill period has been successful, so there is nothing standing in the way of our passing this legislation as quickly as possible.  We have made a couple of minor technical amendments based on that interaction with the EU.  Everything is still in line in terms of the intended direction for this legislation.</p><p>The first amendment is on the size and range of the plastic microbead to be restricted and it is to more closely align the Bill with the proposed forthcoming EU REACH regulations, which will restrict the intentional addition of microplastics to products.  Members may remember that, on Second Stage, I said that, with our microbeads Bill, we were going further than the EU.  This is to make sure that, when the EU catches up with us, we will all be in the same place.  The amendment is a slight tweaking of the position.</p></speech>

It is to make sure that we allow for a very small allowance for microbeads that might unintentionally make their way into a product, so we have put in a limit of 0.01%.  To give an example, it is possible that food in a plastic container might have a tiny trace of microbeads, which might be unavoidable.  The legislation intends to capture people who intentionally put microbeads in products.  While it may happen accidentally, if it does, it is only allowed to 0.01% of the weight of the product.  That is the change being made here.</p></speech>

(1) A person guilty of an offence under this Act (other than an offence under <i>subsection (5)</i>of <i>section 5)</i>shall be liable&mdash;&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>The amendments follows advice from the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is around the different fines and offences under the Bill.  There is a difference between a summary conviction and a conviction on indictment and we want to bring the legislation in line with most other legislation in terms of the severity being escalated for conviction on indictment and reduced for a summary conviction.  The amendments bring us into line in that way.</p></speech>
