It is not sufficient to just put phones on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference with the broadcasting system.</p><p>On the agenda today is the role and remuneration of local authority members.  I welcome to today's meeting the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p><p>I draw the attention of the officials to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>It has been agreed by the committee that we will take the Minister of State's statement as read and we will go straight to questioning.  The first member who indicated, Senator Boyhan, will be followed Deputy Cassells.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019112700002#B00300"><p>First, I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to this committee.  I also welcome the representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government AILG, the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA and anyone else who is tuning in.</p> <p>  I read the Minister of State's statement last night and there was nothing new in it.  I have a few questions.</p> <p>  The Moorhead report was commissioned in June 2018.  We are now heading into Christmas 2019.  It has been a long time and people are frustrated.  The Minister of State will be aware of this because I have seen the correspondence that has gone to him.  I passed correspondence on to the Minister of State from people of all parties and none in the matter.</p> <p>  To set the context straight here in this public meeting, councillors are on &euro;17,359; it is a pittance for the work they do.  The Minister of State himself started in the General Council of County Councils with me in 1999.  I know he is committed to local government.  This is not a dispute with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, whose hands are perhaps a little more tied than he wants to say.  The reality is the Government made a commitment in advance of the local elections, in which in excess of 900 councillors were elected, that we would address it.  I suppose I am asking the Minister of State what is the delay.  Has he seen additional drafts of this report in the past two or three months?  Can the Minister of State tell this committee whether he has seen any drafts of this recommendation?  Is there a reticence or reluctance on the part of Government to acknowledge the important work that county councillors do?</p> <p>  As I say, it is frustrating.  Members of all parties, including the Minister of State's own, are frustrated by the lack of progress.  I am trying to get confirmation.  What is the Minister of State's plan?</p> <p>  I have stated previously I believe city and county councillors should earn approximately &euro;30,000 - 50% of what Senators earn.  I believe their earnings should be linked to Senators and have said so previously.  I do not support decoupling county councillors from other politicians.  We are all politicians.  We are all elected.  We are all serving our communities and our constituents.</p> <p>  I will not dwell on it.  As I say, I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but it is time that we had clarification.  At this stage, where is this report?  When will it be published?  What is the process for publishing it?  I would also like the Minister of State to give a commitment that he will continue to engage with this committee, as he is doing today, on how we will progress it and to say what is happening.</p> <p>  Finally, I did not have an opportunity, because I left early to come here, to hear what was said on "Morning Ireland".  The Minister of State might enlighten us as to what he is talking about in relation to "Morning Ireland" and his commitment for additional or interim funding.  I simply do not know.  I came down the stairs today to be told that there was an announcement on "Morning Ireland".  The Minister of State might share that with the committee.</p></speech>

Given that we were due to have this report at the end of the summer recess, if we could have clarity this morning that this process will be put to bed it would be welcome.</p> <p>  I welcome the clarification on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  As with all major announcements of significance in this country, such as the budget, the national development and all internal Committee of Public Accounts documents, it went on that programme first.  I welcome the "Morning Ireland" clarification.  If, perhaps, as Senator Boyhan said, we could get official clarification for the record of the Houses as to the standing, I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the increase would cost &euro;7.5 million per annum?  Has the Minister discussed the cumulative amount with the Minister for Finance and has he committed to the process?  Has the Minister of State discussed it with the Taoiseach and has he committed to the process?</p> <p>  I refer to the discussions and the position of the AILG, representatives of which are in the Public Gallery and whom I welcome.  Has the Minister of State discussed it in terms of the indicative figure with the County and City Managers Association and local authority directors of finance in the context of future budgets?</p><p>Is it going to be a situation where this will be funded in the interim by the Exchequer or by internal financing?  Can the Minister confirm, in respect of his statement on committing to the back pay, that the increment that would be put forward would be backdated to the point of the election in 2019?  If the Minister's position is still the same, can he enlighten us on where that funding will come from on the basis that county council budgets for the current year, 2019, would have been put together in November 2018?  Councils which currently pay local representatives would not have adjudicated for such expenditure in the 2019 period.  Is it the case that such moneys due to councillors in 2019 would be met from central Exchequer funds?  How is that going to be accommodated going forward into 2020?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019112700002#C01700"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman.  This committee has a really good working relationship and we work in a very collegiate way.  I think we should continue that in all of our discussions, notwithstanding people's different points of view.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  Particularly for anybody watching this, it is important we put this discussion into some context.  We have been having conversations over the last year or so, both in this committee and with the Minister, in respect of some forthcoming legislation, about strengthening the powers of local government and increasing the responsibility of our local elected representatives, not just in terms of the directly elected mayors but in terms of some of the other structural reforms the Minister has been proposing.  At the same time, we all acknowledge that it is becoming increasingly difficult to attract as broad a spectrum of people into local politics as all of us would like.  One of the reasons, although it is not the only one, is the very limited financial remuneration for city and county councillors.  People from low-income families, mothers with children and people from a variety of backgrounds find it very difficult to take on the ever-growing responsibilities.  We have to acknowledge that and it is important the public knows that.</p><p>It is also important that we state again that city and county councillors do not get a full-time wage.  There are lots of people out there who think city and county councillors get a wage commensurate to some who work in the Houses, but that is not the case.  In fact, there are many local authority representatives who either make very little money or who lose money because of the cost they incur in doing the work.  That is particularly the case for county councillors from larger rural communities, and I say that as a Dublin Deputy and a former full-time councillor.  Our conversation here is about trying to look at ways of improving the throughput of talented and capable people into local government, particularly at a time when their responsibilities are growing, and we are looking to give them more power and responsibility.</p><p>The Minister of State is probably not going to be able to answer a lot of the questions because he is going to tell us that the report is being finalised and we will have to await the outcome of that.  In respect of the report by the journalist from the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, is it the case that the Minister of State is considering rolling this issue into broader public sector pay negotiations?  If that is the case, or if that is one of the options, can he talk us through what that would mean, what that could look like, who would be responsible for negotiating that and what the kind of timelines would be, because it is the first time I have heard that publicly and that is certainly a very significant bit of information?</p><p>Can the Minister of State give us a commitment in terms of the timeline of the publication of the report his Department has commissioned and a timeline for the period within which he is going to come back with formal recommendations?  One of the difficulties this committee has is that when the Government commissions a report, it takes a very long time to produce it.  It then sits with the Minister - I am sure the Minister and the officials work very hard on it - and there is a long period of time before any action is outlined.  I am looking for some timelines in respect of that.  As the Minister knows from my submission to the Moorehead review, we strongly favour a shift to full-time, paid city and county councillors.  We have made an interim proposal where there should be a kind of a two-grade payment for part-time and full-time councillors.</p><p>We are strongly of the view that all unvouched expenses should be abolished and replaced with a basic rate of pay for full-time and part-time councillors and a fully vouched system of expenses for additional cost of work, and we argued for that in the Oireachtas also.  I am hopeful the Minister of State will move somewhere in that direction.</p></speech>

This whole debate on councillors' remuneration has been going on for quite a long time, and I respect the fact an independent body has been set up which has already given an interim report, but not a final one.  As colleagues said, what we need here are clear timelines.  Obviously, the Minister of State is privy to an awful lot more information in terms of what may be contained in the final report than we are, but the whole narrative before the 2019 local elections was that there was an expectation in respect of councillors that this whole issue would be addressed, because the system that pertained between 2014 and 2019 was quite unsatisfactory.</p> <p>  There were electoral areas but particularly in rural Ireland that had ballooned.  The workload of councillors had, in some cases, quadrupled because town councils had been eliminated and the redrawing of boundaries had moved some electoral areas from being four-seaters or five-seaters to eight-seaters or nine-seaters.  There has been a recalibration there in recent times, and those areas have been reduced, but the workload has not been reduced.</p> <p>  The idea of a fair day's wages for a fair day's work is something we all want to see.  There is cross-party support for dealing with this issue.  While it is not popular in the media to increase the pay of politicians, whoever they are, most fair-minded people would accept that county councillors who are at the coalface dealing with issues on a daily basis are not earning a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.</p> <p>  In my nine years in this House, I have never been told by anyone from any side to pipe down.  It happened under the Vice Chairman's stewardship.  Usually when people say things off-the-cuff that they do not mean, they withdraw the remark.  It comes as a very great disappointment to me that that remark was not withdrawn.</p></speech>

I will move to non-committee members.  I am very conscious of the time as I want the Minister of State to come in.  I ask non-members to keep their contributions to a minute so the Minister of State can come in and questions can be answered.  I call Senator Daly.</p></speech>

I welcome those from the AILG and members from the representative organisations.  Those from LAMA were here yesterday.</p> <p>  Many questions have been asked already.  In a speech, it was indicated that there would be back pay.  My colleague, Deputy Cassells, asked where that back pay would come from.  Back pay has been promised.  Will there be back pay going back to the local elections in 2019?  The 2020 budget was a missed opportunity in regard to this issue.</p><p>The other clarification we seek relates to what was announced on "Morning Ireland".  Is that going to be implemented and when?  We need details about where that funding will come from.  Is the ultimate aim to link this to public sector pay and to include that as part of it?  We cannot continue to have an argument on this singular issue every few years with nothing being resolved.  Can we have clarification on whether it will be linked to a Senator's pay or to some other grade in the public service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1382" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019112700002#D00200"><p>The main issue here is timelines and when we can expect action on this issue.  The Moorhead report has been in process for almost two years.  The Minister of State wrote to me on 6 November and said that he had not received the report and hoped to receive it shortly.  Following receipt of the report, he said he would liaise with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before submitting the report to the Government for consideration and that it was his objective to publish it thereafter.  That could take a substantial amount of time.  What is the timeline involved?  Can the Minister of State give an indication about the pay, including what was mentioned in "Morning Ireland" this morning?  I believe councillors deserve a salary that is at least 50% of a Senator's salary, as was mentioned earlier.  The work they do is comparable to the work of a D&aacute;il Deputy albeit they might have smaller constituencies than Deputies.  However, their work on the ground is key to our democracy and they should be rewarded for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1372" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019112700002#D00300"><p>I have a question about pension entitlements.  Councillors have access to a State pension since 2016, but until then they were paying the class K scale.  No retrospective action was taken.  Will the review investigate this?</p> <p>  My second question is about councillors' maternity leave.  Section 37 of the Local Government Act 2001 states that the councillors shall be deemed to have resigned from membership of a local authority if they miss meetings for a period of six months.  In addition, they must attend 80% of the meetings to receive payment and expenses.  The obstacles to women are obvious and have affected all political parties and others.  I am aware that the Minister of State is interested in this, but can he give a commitment to having a discussion and tabling an amendment to the Local Government Act 2001?  Will he consult with the main parties, the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, LAMA, the National Women's Council and so forth?  I am sure we can reach agreement on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019112700002#D00400"><p>I will be brief and try to answer all the questions.  I might be repetitious but I will reply anyway.  I thank the members for their ongoing interest in this matter.  It has dragged on a little longer than anticipated over the past two years.  I would have expected to have the full report at this stage.  Senator Boyhan asked when it will be delivered.  I am told that it is being finalised and that I will have it in the next ten days or so.  It is now my intention to publish it when I receive it.  When I receive it I will have to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but at this stage the least I should do for the councillors is ensure that it is published once it is received.  I acknowledge what Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, which is that the process outlined a month ago could be very long.  I believe it should be published when I get it.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan asked if I had seen a draft.  I saw one draft and I sent it back two months ago.  As to the parameters of the delay, I cannot outline the reasons but I expect to have it in the immediate future.  I am a little reticent about giving timeframes in light of the fact that I previously gave a timeframe that I expected to meet.  These things are outside my control.  Senator Boyhan also said that he does not support decoupling from Senators.  I do.  I believe all public servants, including councillors, should be treated the same and that, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, we should not be returning to councillors as a stand-alone item at any stage in the future.  They should be treated like every other public servant.  I have no problem giving a commitment that I will continue to engage.</p> <p>  I did not hear the radio programme this morning, but I received a report on it.  What was contained therein was a fair synopsis of all the speculation I have heard in the last few weeks.  However, as the final report has not been published I am not in a position to talk about final figures.  Deputy Cassells asked about a specific figure of &euro;7.5 million per annum.  Again, this was in the context of this morning's radio programme.  That may well be the figure from this morning's programme, but having not received the final report I cannot confirm or deny that figure.</p> <p>  I have discussed this with the Taoiseach.  In fact, it was the Taoiseach and I who decided that we need to do something in this area and that is why Ms Moorhead was appointed.  I have also discussed it with the Minister for Finance.  Both of them are committed and share my view that councillors should not be the worst paid people in the room among local authority staff, which is the current position.  Essentially, councillors work for the minimum wage and even slightly less in some cases.  That is why this group was established.  The proof of the pudding in respect of my colleagues and the Minister for Finance will come in the next stage of this process, but he has been very committed up to this point to ensuring that councillors are paid better than they are at present.</p> <p>  On the initial payment, having discussed it with the County and City Management Association my view is that the Government will have to provide the initial funding, particularly in light of the fact that many budgets are already finalised, but it will have to be built into local government funding thereafter.  Several members of the committee asked about that, including Deputy Cassells.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is right that we have given extra powers not just to directly elected mayors, which is starting in Limerick, but also in respect of the rates alleviation measures.  I am not sure whether councils acted on them in the most recent budgets, but that power for them to reduce rates is now in place.  It is a new role that councillors did not have previously in terms of a targeted scheme built around their local area plans or county or city development plans.</p> <p>  One of the reasons it is difficult to attract people is certainly low pay.  I am aware of the Sinn F&eacute;in submission with regard to full-time and part-time councillors.  I do not agree with it.  I do not believe there should be two types of councillor.  We had that previously with regard to town councillors and county councillors and the issue of some areas having two ballot papers and others having one.  There is value in having a mix of people who are members of local authorities - people who are not just other public servants or people who are retired or who are students but also people who are in full-time employment and who wish to serve their local community.  They should be accommodated without being a second class.  I realise that is not the intention, but it might be the result of having a differentiation between full-time and part-time.</p> <p>  As regards publication, I will do it immediately upon receipt of the report, which should be in the next couple of weeks and well in advance of the new year.  Then there will be discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  After that the people in the Department will decide on where the money comes from, what the rate will be and what the path will be.  There is a strong possibility that it will be part of the public sector pay talks which are due to commence next year.  However, that decision has not yet been made so I cannot comment further on it.  It will be part of the discussions I will have with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  On Senator Conway's contribution, I commented on the timelines.  He is correct that the matter was discussed a great deal before the last local elections.  I gave commitments that it would be addressed and I am still determined that it will be.  I acknowledge that councillors are underpaid at present for the work they do and the amount of time that goes into the job.  I am committed to ensuring that whatever is in the report is implemented, but that will be a process of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I know that I have the support of members here, and other members, in terms of those discussions that will take place in the near future.  Reference was made to a reduction in the size of the local electoral areas, which has helped councillors to be able to better serve their local communities.  I have always believed that local councillors should be local and that we would not have the monster electoral areas that were created in 2014.  It is correct to say that the issue is not popular but I too share the view that it should be a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  It is my position, as I have stated previously and I will restate it here, that the expenses councillors generate in the pursuit of their work in terms of mileage, which are on the same rates as Oireachtas Members and other public and civil servants, should be retained.  That element of the job is not going to change.  Equally, there is an inherent value in the education and training budgets councillors get because they allow for an exchange of information and an opportunity for councillors to network and to learn from one another, and those funds facilitate that.</p><p> I assure Senator Mark Daly that I have not diverted from my view that this should be dated from the last local election.  It is a bit like boundaries when it comes to elections; there should be natural boundaries and elections are natural boundaries politically.  I have not moved from that.  Again, as I said at the outset, central government will have to pick up any increases or a substantial amount of them, but after that it will have to be built into the budgets of local authorities.  From my point of view, as I stated it from the start, the aim is very clearly to link it to public sector pay so that this never happens again and that there will not be politicians in the future deciding the pay of other politicians.  That should not happen.  It is the last vestige of that.  It should have been done when Oireachtas Members were linked to the public service.  A similar arrangement should have been introduced at that time rather than to Senators.</p><p> In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question, I addressed the timeline.  He said that pay should be 50% of the pay of Senators.  I do not agree with that, but it should be substantially more than it is at present.  I have not received the report.  I expect to receive it very shortly and I will publish it immediately.</p><p> The change Senator Warfield referred to in relation to pensions is the reckonability of councillors' PRSI contributions towards their State pension.  As I understand it, and this is the position I will enter into in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the pension gratuity system that existed up until the most recent election should remain.</p></speech>

From the date of the last election and when the new regime kicks in there should be a knock-on pension of a type that will link to the public sector grade to which Senators will be linked.</p> <p>  My final point relates to maternity and paternity leave.  The issue at the moment comes down to the fact that expenses cannot be claimed when they are not earned because people are unable to do their job because they are out on maternity leave and paternity leave.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and I will do work shortly on the issue of equality because it affects all politicians, including Oireachtas Members.  We are the only public servants, whether councillors or Oireachtas Members, who have no entitlement.  I know the Minister of State is anxious to do something on it and I wil ljoin him to add the perspective of councillors.</p></speech>

Councillors need to be properly paid and they are not.  I welcome the suggestions that have been made.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is not showing us his entire hand of cards at the moment.  Councillors cannot just be sitting there quietly.  They must have real powers to challenge officials and they also need access to other specialist knowledge.  If there is a policy difference between a council and the executive the elected members should be able to get legal and other advice separately.</p></speech>

I could not agree more.  I echo what Deputy O'Dowd said.  I do not know what will be said in the report on the matter but I think councillors should have access to outside advices, and not just have to rely on the legal advice of the council.</p></speech>

We have gone through the standstill period and that standstill period has been successful, so there is nothing standing in the way of our passing this legislation as quickly as possible.  We have made a couple of minor technical amendments based on that interaction with the EU.  Everything is still in line in terms of the intended direction for this legislation.</p><p>The first amendment is on the size and range of the plastic microbead to be restricted and it is to more closely align the Bill with the proposed forthcoming EU REACH regulations, which will restrict the intentional addition of microplastics to products.  Members may remember that, on Second Stage, I said that, with our microbeads Bill, we were going further than the EU.  This is to make sure that, when the EU catches up with us, we will all be in the same place.  The amendment is a slight tweaking of the position.</p></speech>

To give an example, it is possible that food in a plastic container might have a tiny trace of microbeads, which might be unavoidable.  The legislation intends to capture people who intentionally put microbeads in products.  While it may happen accidentally, if it does, it is only allowed to 0.01% of the weight of the product.

We requested that the committee further consider legal aid as a stand-alone issue at its hearings on the reform of the family law system and are delighted that it will so do.  It is a fitting decision, given that FLAC has been campaigning for comprehensive legal aid and access to justice for 50 years.  My remarks will summarise the more detailed submission which has been furnished to the committee.<br/><br/>Access to justice is a process, a goal and a gateway to the exercise of other procedural and substantive rights.  Although it has no single precise definition, its core elements include effective access to legal information, early advice, representation, legal aid and the courts, as well as to a fair system of redress, effective remedies and just outcomes.  Access to justice is important for several reasons.  Most obviously, it enables individuals to know whether they have a claim and how to enforce it.  It has a far broader social value and is vital to social inclusion.  It has been FLAC&rsquo;s experience that people who are socially disadvantaged often experience legal problems accessing social welfare or housing or addressing unemployment or debt issues.  These issues often occur at the same time.  The greater the vulnerability, the greater the number of justiciable issues and the greater the extent of social exclusion.  Solving even one of these legal issues has a beneficial impact and may have a knock-on effect on other areas or may improve social inclusion.  In that regard, it does not make sense that the Legal Aid Board can represent a person in his or her family law case but cannot do so in a social welfare appeal or eviction case which may be going on at the same time in another court.  Research has identified that access to legal advice and assistance can improve people's health and well-being, while reducing pressure on healthcare services.  In the United Kingdom, access to justice is treated as a basic right and a vital element in social inclusion policies and id given a similar priority to health and education.  We would like that approach to be taken here.<br/><br/>It is also essential to democracy.  Laws made by the Oireachtas, such as the important new socially protective provisions contained in the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Act 2019, are only effective if they can be enforced.  It diminishes the democratic process if people do not know about the new laws and are not in a position to avail of the new rights provided.<br/><br/>Access to justice is essential to the rule of law.  By that, I mean ensuring that the Executive branch of government carries out its functions in accordance with the law.  In the course of its recent consideration of the issue of access to justice, the UK Supreme Court stated:</p> <blockquote> 	In order for the courts to perform that role, people must in principle have unimpeded access to them.  Without such access, laws are liable to become a dead letter, the work done by Parliament may be rendered nugatory, and the democratic election of ... Parliament may become a meaningless charade.  That is why the courts do not merely provide a public service like any other. </blockquote> <p>The most pervasive and intractable weakness of our civil justice system is that it only provides reasonable access to justice to individuals and bodies with very significant resources, the small minority of people who are able to get legal aid and the lucky people who are able to access &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; arrangements with their lawyers.  This failing was exacerbated by the financial crisis which resulted in serious budget cuts to the Courts Service and an increase in the number of cases.  There is increasing awareness of the problem, however, and a growing consensus that major reform is required.  The Chief Justice has recently set out on a number of occasions the moral and economic arguments for broader and deeper legal aid.<br/><br/>The committee is asked to note certain matters for context.  First, there has been no national economic and social analysis of the impact of the failure to provide civil legal aid in certain areas or the potential cost savings that would be realised through introducing comprehensive access to justice.  Understanding the scale and nature of unmet legal need is vital for designing appropriate Government policy and targeting investment.  Second, the programme for Government contains a commitment to commission an annual study on court efficiency and sitting times, to be benchmarked against international standards and provide accurate measurements for improving access to justice.  An annual study providing accurate measurements would be an extremely important addition to our understanding of the problem.  Third, the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Kelly, is undertaking a review of the administration of civil justice, which includes in its terms of reference the issue of access to justice.  It is expected to be completed shortly and should be of significant interest to the committee.<br/><br/>Ireland operates a common law adversarial system, which places a much greater burden of ascertaining facts and researching law on parties to litigation than is the case in a civil law system where the judge plays a far more inquisitorial role.  This increased burden on the parties in Ireland is relevant to looking at access to legal aid, access to the courts, provision for lay litigants and costs. <br/><br/>The recent EU justice scoreboard figures for expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU show that Ireland is among the lowest in terms of spend on the law courts system.  There is significantly lower expenditure on the courts system here than in civil law countries.  Ireland also came second last in terms of the number of judges per 100,000 inhabitants.  That may at least partly explains why expenditure by parties is considerably more in Ireland than would be the case under a civil law system.  Given that our system weighs so heavily on the parties, the Chief Justice has argued that a far higher percentage of GDP should be spent on the courts and legal aid.  There is a need to recognise and treat the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board as being essential to the administration of justice and the rule of law and to resource them accordingly.<br/><br/>On the right to legal aid, it is 40 years since Josie Airey took on the might of the church and the State.  She held the State to account for its failure to provide her with legal aid in her High Court family law proceedings.  There is a right to legal aid under both the European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution where it is necessary to ensure effective access to justice.  It is not an absolute right in all cases but the European Court of Human Rights has indicated that factors such as the importance of the issue, the complexity of the case, the capacity of the individual to represent himself or herself and his or her emotional involvement are of importance in deciding whether to grant legal aid.<br/><br/>The European Charter of Fundamental Rights also provides a directly applicable right to legal aid where it is necessary to achieve access to justice if a claim involves European law.  Huge swathes of socially protective law involve European law.  For example, almost all of our employment and anti-discrimination law has a European element.  European law is also present in some aspects of social welfare and in regard to homelessness, environmental law and privacy law.  This requisite assessment of need as set down by the European Court of Human Rights and the breadth of laws covered are not reflected in our legal aid system with its wholly inadequate funding, rigid and out-of-date means test, which requires one to have a disposable income of &euro;18,000 or less, its completely unrealistic accommodation and childcare allowances, its strictly-applied merits test and the exclusion of many areas of law that impact on vulnerable groups and individuals.  We have concerns that the method of delivery of legal aid through law centres does not allow for the targeting of services at particularly vulnerable groups or individuals such as those living in institutions or prisoners.  As the Legal Aid Board is, effectively, the largest family law practice in the State, it should be actively involved in education and research.<br/><br/>The current system of civil legal aid in Ireland was introduced in response to the Airey judgment 40 years ago but at the time, fell far short of what had been recommended in the Pringle report on civil legal aid and advice.  Although there have since been minor incremental changes, it has proven extraordinarily difficult to bring about substantive change to this restricted system or to convince the Government that it needs to invest significant increased resources in the legal aid system and the courts.  We hope that will change on foot of these meetings.  A root and branch review of the provision of civil legal aid is needed, to include an examination of the funding of the Legal Aid Board, the means test, allowances, fees, merits test and the exemptions of certain areas of law.</p><p>The review also needs to examine the method of delivery of legal services to ensure they are targeted at particularly vulnerable groups and individuals, along with the provision of strategic services for particular communities, as well as the capacity of the Legal Aid Board to engage in education and research.<br/><br/>Access to justice involves more than just access to legal aid and includes access to the courts.  We recommend court fees should be poverty and equality-proofed.  There should be provision for waivers for people on no or low income or in receipt of social welfare.  Our current court forms and procedures are archaic, dating back to the 1880s.  While there have been some amendments to them, they need to be reformed to be practical and accessible, including for lay litigants and people with disabilities.  I have provided in my written submission some examples of the complex and obscure procedures still in place.  Either the Law Reform Commission, LRC, or a broadly drawn group comprising relevant stakeholders such as the Courts Service, the human rights committees of the Law Society and the Bar, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the National Disability Authority, the Citizens Information board, the National Adult Literacy Agency, as well as relevant NGOS such as FLAC and disability NGOS, should be formed to consider the updating of the forms and procedures to ensure accessibility and clarity.<br/><br/>The courts system is predicated on the basis that people with be represented.  We all know a significant number of people try to represent themselves.  Our FLAC information line is contacted every day by people trying to navigate what they see as a complex system.  We recommend a widely drawn working group should be established to examine access to justice for litigants in person, which would draw up a report and action plan.  This has been done in the UK.  Any reforms of the administration of civil justice should factor in that many litigants will not be represented by lawyers.  The Courts Service should provide guides to administrative aspect of the courts, such as the listing system, call overs, hearing dates, how to address the court, as well as more accessible formats than just print.  The more detailed submission repeats the numerous recommendations contained in FLAC&rsquo;s submission to the review of the administration of civil justice regarding access to justice, particularly for people with disabilities.<br/><br/>Given the number of people who are comfortable with modern technology, the development of an online court service in appropriate cases with appropriate safeguards should be given consideration.  It has to be recognised, however, that it will need considerable investment.<br/><br/>The more detailed submission sets out the importance of public interest litigation and contains several recommendations.  Legislation should be introduced to permit the use of third party litigation funding and abolish the rules of champerty and maintenance.  The Supreme Court has said it is a matter for the Legislature to make provisions for third party funding.  Section 169 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 should be amended to expressly include cases taken in the public interest.  Protective costs orders should be put on a legislative basis.  Legislation needs to be enacted to properly provide for multiparty actions or class actions.  The rules on standing should be liberalised and placed on a legislative basis if necessary.  The doctrine of mootness, which effectively means a court will not look at an issue if the case has been decided, should be relaxed, particularly in cases of public interest.  The State should not use strict confidentiality clauses that require parties to keep confidential the terms and the fact of the settlement.<br/><br/>The more detailed submission sets out the importance of and the development of <i>pro bono</i>legal practice.  It recommends the introduction of a public procurement model for public legal services requiring all legal services to sign up to a target of <i>pro bono</i>hours per year.  The review of education and training, which is being carried out by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, should have regard to the development of <i>pro bono</i>legal services, particularly in the training and educational needs of those involved in the provision of such services.  The development and encouragement of <i>pro bono</i>legal service could be examined by the authority.  While such work is valuable and needs to be encouraged, it is not the answer to a properly funded and resourced legal aid system.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Ken Murphy, director general, and Mr. Stuart Gilhooly, former president and council member.  We come to this discussion with a strong understanding of how the courts are currently operating and how that impacts on solicitors' clients, many of them families and businesses seeking to resolve disputes and move on with their lives.</p> <p>  The committee is to be commended for focusing on the issue of access to justice.  Access to justice does not merely apply to access to the courts but also to legal advice and assistance in dealing with many other aspects of citizens' lives.  For example, it can involve how they interact with Departments and State agencies, as well as non-contentious work.  In that regard, solicitors play an essential role ensuring the rights of citizens are protected and defended when compared against the might of the State, as well as facilitating their contribution to the economic and social welfare of the State.</p> <p>  The committee has raised queries about competition in the legal sector and transparency in legal costs.  Approximately 11,500 practising certificates were issued by the Law Society this year, representing an all-time high.  This represents a substantial increase of approximately 64% on the 7,000 issued in 2005.  On the education front, we are inching towards 500 trainees at any one time.  Throughout the State, there are approximately 2,300 firms, 90% having ten or fewer solicitors, based in every county, city and town.  Trends that have, in recent years, shaped the competitive environment include changing consumer behaviour.  Consumers increasingly shop around and are happy to have several solicitors looking after various items.  The model of the family solicitor &ndash; the one-stop-shop &ndash; is being increasingly challenged.  As a consequence, we compete on what and how we offer, as well as price.  Close to 20% of the profession now works in-house, providing legal services only to their employer and not to the public.  While many work in the public sector, as well as large institutions and corporations, it is also the case that businesses have employed solicitors to handle legal work internally.  The implication of this is that firms are tendering more competitively for corporate work.  In turn, this is impacting positively on price and delivery for clients.</p> <p>  With the new LSRA in place, the option of limited liability partnerships is available to firms who are in partnerships.  We anticipate that this will lead to greater competition and innovation between firms, as it supports a greater appetite for growth and expansion of practices.  As of November 2019, no fewer than 4,000 new admissions from our three neighbouring jurisdictions &ndash; England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland - have occurred since 1 January 2016.</p><p>The Brexit bounce brings the total number currently on the roll of solicitors to 20,500.  Dublin boasts an increasingly international legal sector and a number of UK and international law firms have established here in recent years.  The legal market in Ireland has always welcomed competition.  Competition is good for the consumer and for the solicitor firms in finding new and innovative ways to deliver for their clients.<br/><br/>I will address the issue of transparency.  New and transformative provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 commenced on 7 October 2019.  Along with new disciplinary and complaints mechanisms for consumers to avail of, the newly commenced provisions significantly strengthen consumer safeguards and transparency in respect of legal costs.  As a brief overview with regard to transparency, section 150 of the Act provides for: an indication of costs from the outset of a case, including the basis of those charges; an obligation to update clients on costs throughout the lifetime of a case or matter; a cooling-off period; and mediation on disputes about costs.  Failure to furnish this information to clients can result in the solicitors' costs being unrecoverable and it becoming a disciplinary matter.  The Act provides for the establishment of an office of legal costs adjudicators.  The data that will be assembled by the office of legal costs adjudicators through the public register of determinations, under section 140, as well as the criteria that will apply, will provide a valuable tool in ensuring the proportionality of fees, insights into the factors that inform fee levels and consumer guidance on legal fees.  The level of granularity of data in respect of cost headings and stages of proceedings derived from the revised bill of costs, the basis of the forthcoming register, will provide a benchmark to legal professions and to the public that will be much more predictable and transparent.<br/><br/>I will address future developments under two headings.  The first is multi-party and class actions.  The LRC in 2005 subjected this matter to considerable scrutiny and analysis.  At present, there are many examples of large numbers of virtually identical claims being issued in the District, Circuit and High Courts in consumer and competition litigation and product liability litigation contexts where the availability of a class action procedure would reduce costs for all parties and lead to more efficient use of court resources.  The LRC recommendations included that a formal procedural structure be set out and rules of court be introduced to deal with instances of multi-party litigation - it provided draft rules in the report - and that reform of current procedures to deal with multi-party litigation should be based on the three principles of procedural fairness for the plaintiff and defendant, procedural efficiency and access to justice.  In 2017, Sinn F&eacute;in prepared a multi-party actions Bill and this might provide some assistance in progressing the matter.<br/><br/>The second heading is a statutory form of third party litigation funding.  The Law Society's view is that the Oireachtas must consider a legislative framework to provide for third party funding.  Persona<b><i></i></b>and SPV Osus<b><i></i></b>are two recent Supreme Court decisions, which both called for a legislative response, as well as underlining the role that third party funding can play in access to justice.  Such reforms have been introduced in many similar common law jurisdictions and have proven effective in ensuring enhanced access to justice without the perceived downsides associated with US contingency fee models.<br/><br/>A discussion on fees is incomplete without discussing the determinants of fees.  Some of those are internal to the solicitor firm, such as rising staffing and operational costs as with any business, and some are external.  Key external determinants of legal fees are the delays and other inefficiencies in the courts system.  In the context of litigation, increased resourcing of the Courts Service would be a fundamental factor in ensuring that costs are avoided and minimised through leaner processes, adequate professional and support staffing and investment in technology.  With 0.2% of our GDP spent on Ireland's courts, as opposed to 0.4% in Germany and the UK, the society believes that investment by the State in the courts system must increase to reverse the cuts and impacts of the recession and to achieve long-term and enduring changes.  The society has a warm and constructive relationship with the Courts Service, which should be commended on how it delivers its service to the public considering its limited funding parameters.  The service is also going through a number of change programmes and is investing in technology.  Substantially increased use of technology is the key to the future and its introduction must be greatly accelerated.<br/><br/>Additional issues arise in the context of capacity.  Ireland continues to have one of the lowest numbers of judges <i>per capita</i>in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  According to the European Commission, Ireland has one of the lowest proportions of second instance judges.  With 6%, Ireland is considerably below the international average of 22%.  While recent appointments are welcome, the courts remain significantly under-resourced, particularly the higher courts.<br/><br/>The availability of high-quality research assistance is a major factor in the efficient use of judicial time.  Increased capacity for legal research, case preparation and management and the drafting of memoranda, orders and judgments would deliver improved organisational capacity for the Courts Service and, ultimately, improve Ireland&rsquo;s standing as a forum for litigation.  The review of the administration of civil justice, chaired by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, and of which Mr. Stuart Gilhooly is a member, is examining these capacity and efficiency issues and is close to final publication.</p><p>The society urges that the report's recommended measures that will improve efficiency and effectiveness should be progressed without delay.  <br/><br/>On the issue of capacity building, the society, along with the Bar, is excited about the Government-endorsed Brexit initiative for the legal sector.  The newly-appointed chairman, former Taoiseach, John Bruton, will lead a valuable infrastructure project that will benefit Ireland's citizens and businesses, as well as attracting additional dispute resolution work and other international legal work to Ireland.  With the right approach and investment, the return on this initiative may endure long beyond Brexit.<br/><br/>Our colleagues on the Legal Aid Board have provided an update on expenditure and activity levels in recent years.  We commend the excellent work the Legal Aid Board does, despite its underfunding by the State.  Our Constitution provides, implicitly, for access to legal aid for qualifying applicants on the basis that parties before the courts should be entitled to legal representation.  Accordingly, legal aid is mandated by the Constitution and primary legislation but it must be meaningful and effective, in terms of scope and access.  It must be fit for purpose.  The narrative on legal aid might lead some to conclude that the system is disproportionately costly.  When one considers EU data comparing expenditure on legal aid per head in member states, Ireland's expenditure is disappointingly lower than that of other EU member states, &euro;17.63 <i>per capita</i>, as opposed to for example, &euro;24.30 in Denmark and &euro;30.69 in England and Wales.  The willingness of lawyers to carry out legal aid work is necessary for legal aid delivery.  The terms on which legal aid is offered can lead to reluctance to take legal aid work, against the backdrop of increasing complexity of cases, rising overhead costs and the administrative burden of the system.  The rates payable, particularly for criminal law, are inadequate and borderline uneconomic.  The Legal Aid Board has an unenviable task, within the resources available to it, in delivering on its remit.  The society continues to advocate for more resources, improved streamlined systems and process and providing feedback on how the civil and criminal schemes are working.<br/><br/>It is the professional obligation of solicitors to seek the best outcomes for their clients under the law.  In pursuing that, the reasonable solicitor generally shows flexibility in terms of fees.  Many solicitors provide access to justice, support their clients on a &quot;no foal, no fee&quot; basis, on a <i>pro bono</i>basis, or with a <i>pro bono</i>element.  Most of us live in the communities we serve.  We build our practices based on the quality and integrity of our service.  It is therefore in the interests of the reasonable solicitor to charge proportionate and reasonable fees, and to provide transparency on those.  The level of legal fees is the product of negotiation and agreement between individual solicitors' firms and their clients in a highly competitive market of 2,300 firms.  Solicitors compete on specialised expertise, on specialised skills and on quality of service, as well as on the level of fees charged.  I hope these observations have been of interest to the committee and the delegation looks forward to engaging with it on them.</p></speech>

For any legal system to operate at its optimum level access to justice must be available to all.  Justice is a fundamental value that is important and essential to the lives of every citizen in a functioning democracy.  Members of the Law Library play what we consider to be a vital role in promoting and safeguarding the right to access to justice.  The principles that barristers are independent, owe an overriding duty to the administration of justice and that the interests of their clients must be and are defended fearlessly are at the heart of the independent referral bar and the regulatory framework that governs members of the Law Library.  All of those principles and rules are contained in our code of conduct and that code binds each member of the Law Library.  The code also contains what is known as the cab rank rule, which precludes members from refusing to take on a case based on their distaste for its nature, or that of the client, the client's conduct or opinions.  This rule plays a very important part and role in ensuring that all members of society have the ability to access the courts and justice with the benefit of expert legal advice and representation.  It means that the consumer, the client or the litigant has access to expert and experienced legal representation.<br/><br/>Members of the Bar provide their services through a variety of structures, on the basis of legal aid, on the basis of fees charged, <i>pro bono </i>and fourth, on a &quot;no foal, no fee&quot; basis.  I have made a detailed written submission which I know the committee will consider very carefully.  In this opening statement I will outline the headlines.  We have had the benefit of hearing from Ms Barry on behalf of FLAC and will hear from the Legal Aid Board in due course.  It is fair to say that we echo much of what Ms Barry had to say about the necessity for reform and improvement in the legal aid system. <br/><br/>I will address legal aid first.  Legal aid has long been recognised as vital to ensuring that a person's constitutional rights have access to the courts and to a fair hearing.  The availability of legal aid to those who cannot afford legal representation from their own means is an essential element of the administration of justice in a democratic society.  Many recipients of legal aid are among the most vulnerable members of our society and their access to the legal system must be supported and protected.  Through the participation of barristers in the provision of civil and criminal legal aid schemes, legally aided clients have the benefit of representation by barristers with experience and expertise.  Unfortunately, however, the civil legal aid system in Ireland is chronically under-resourced and significant additional resources are urgently required if a scheme is to provide meaningful access to justice to those most vulnerable members of our society on a long-term and sustainable basis.  <br/><br/>Ms Barry has referred to the need for improvements in the eligibility thresholds and the areas of law covered by the civil legal aid scheme and we share and endorse those views because they are necessary to ensure that the constitutional right of access is promoted and supported and secured through the civil legal aid scheme.  There is also evidence from the World Bank that there are considerable economic gains to be garnered from increased investment in legal aid.</p><p>We have dealt with how those economic benefits accrue through investment in the legal aid scheme in our detailed submission.  <br/><br/>We are anxious to emphasise that investment in the civil legal aid scheme should not be seen in isolation.  There is little point in investing in a civil legal aid scheme that ensures more individuals have access to a legal system if there are blockages further down the line within that system.  The civil legal aid scheme needs to be amended and improved but there also has to be investment in the court system.  Constricting budgets are making it harder for the courts to do their work.  A series of studies by the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, CEPEJ, illustrate how since 2010 Ireland's expenditure on its judicial system relative to GDP is consistently lower than that of neighbouring jurisdictions.<br/><br/>According to the Doing Business survey, conducted by the World Bank group for 2020, Ireland ranks 91st out of 190 countries in the category on ease of resolving a contractual dispute.  That is dealt with in detail in our submission but it appears to be the case that Ireland's low rank is largely attributable to its low scores for case management, court automation, and time.  Court automation is a function of the lack of investment in IT structures for the court system.  Case management and time are directly in respect of the ongoing shortage of judges.  <br/><br/>The shortage of judges means delays in the courts system and such delays are themselves an impairment on access to justice.  It is undoubtedly the case that a wide series of reforms is required so that timely and efficient access to justice can be secured by every citizen and litigant in the State.  We deal with those various reforms in our detailed submission.  We also welcome the upcoming publication of the administration of civil justice review, which was chaired Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, the President of the High Court, and in which the Bar Council participated.  That review and the recommendations in that report can only be given effect and generate benefits, which I know that this committee wishes to secure in the area of access to justice, if those recommendations are properly supported by funding from the Executive.<br/><br/>The second way in which the Bar provides its services is, of course, on a fees basis.  The council recognises that unduly high legal costs can constitute a barrier to access to justice.  Contrary to popular narrative, Ireland is not found to be a high-cost jurisdiction for legal costs.  According to the World Bank survey mentioned earlier, of the eight common law jurisdictions compared by the survey, Ireland has the fourth lowest lawyers' fees at 18.8% of the value of the claim, which is almost identical to the figure in Australia of 18.5%.  That survey also shows that the total cost of resolving a contractual dispute, to include lawyers' fees, court fees, and enforcement costs, is similar to that of Singapore, which is ranked first in the world for the total cost of resolving such a dispute.  The overall percentage costs in Ireland are 26.9% while it is 25.8% in Singapore.  It is also the case that the market for barrister services is more competitive than it has ever been.  This has led to considerable reductions in fees paid to most barristers.  One factor that has contributed to this reduction is the long-standing requirement introduced by the Bar unilaterally that on receiving instructions from a solicitor, a barrister must provide a written fee estimate to the solicitor.  That requirement is set out in our code of conduct and this obligation was reinforced by having been put on a statutory basis by section 150 of the Legal Service Regulation Act 2015.<br/><br/>That increased transparency and information provided to the consumer through solicitors will have, and has had, the inevitable effect of generating more competition among practitioners.  It allows consumers to be aware of the proposed fees and to negotiate accordingly.  That, in itself, inevitably has a downward pressure on legal fees.  <br/><br/>Those rules generally do not apply where legal services are provided to the State because in those circumstances, work is generally provided according to a fixed schedule or scale of fees unilaterally set by the State.  State bodies are the largest consumer of legal services in Ireland and in circumstances where work and services are provided to such bodies, there is little or no negotiation on fees on the part of counsel because fees are set by the State.  The high standard and low-cost representation secured by State bodies has been recognised by the Government in its 2018 spending review report on criminal legal aid.  <br/><br/>It should also be emphasised that similar to public and civil servants and other State contractors, severe cuts were applied to barristers' fees during the economic downturn.  Since 2008, cuts to professional fees have ranged in the order of 28.5% to 69%.  There has been no restoration of those fees in the intervening years.  These cuts impact directly on the question of access to justice that the committee is concerning itself with.  These fees make it unviable for many legal practitioners to continue to participate in State-funded schemes such as the civil and criminal legal aid schemes.  <br/><br/>On the criminal front, there is an emerging shortage of experienced junior barristers who can survive the early years of poor income from a criminal practice.  This should not be just of concern to the Bar Council and to barristers but should be of a wider societal concern.  If this is not addressed, it will mean that there will be fewer barristers to provide services to litigants, particularly in the criminal sphere, which will have a direct impact on their ability to access justice by way of mounting a proper defence.  This will have an adverse impact on the administrative of justice and on the public good.<br/><br/>Irrespective of the level of costs, there will always be individuals who simply cannot afford legal services from their own means.  In the absence of a proper and adequate system of legal aid that ensures their right of access to the courts, members of the Law Library, along with organisations such as FLAC and community law centres such as Community Law and Mediation, strive to fill that gap by providing their services either on a <i>pro bono</i>basis or, in some instances on a no foal, no fee basis.<br/><br/>Some 82% of the members of the Law Library undertake <i>pro bono</i>legal work.  The voluntary assistance scheme is the formal<i>pro bono</i>scheme of the Bar of Ireland, which makes the full range of barrister services available directly to charities, NGOs, and civic society groups on an entirely <i>pro bono</i>basis.  The details of that scheme are contained in our submission.  Members of the Law Library also provide voluntary legal assistance to a number of community outreach projects that operate outside of the Bar, such as the Community Law and Mediation centres.<br/><br/>In appropriate cases that are not covered by the civil or criminal legal aid schemes, a barrister may be willing to take on an individual client case on a no foal, no fee basis.  This means that a barrister will not be paid unless his or her client is successful in the proceedings.  This is, in effect, a free legal aid scheme operated by barristers at their own risk.  It provides many people with access to the courts where they would not otherwise have such access.  The importance of the no foal, no fee structure and system has been highlighted by FLAC and independent law centres such as Community Law and Mediation in circumstances where there is no comprehensive civil legal aid system in the State.  The no foal, no fee structure is frequently applied in constitutional and public interest litigation and the availability of such services has unquestionably benefited the recognition, protection, and vindication of constitutional rights of individuals, including the right of access to the courts.  Many of the landmark cases in the constitutional sphere have been brought on a no foal, no fee basis. <i>Pro bono</i>and no foal, no fee work play an essential role in ensuring access to justice but I emphasise that they should not replace an adequate legal aid system.<br/><br/>We are grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on these important topics.</p><p>We are obviously available to answer any questions members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McDaid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019112700002#J00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  The Irish civil legal aid system has been in place for almost 40 years.  It was put on a statutory footing with the enactment of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  The Act obliges the Legal Aid Board to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to persons who satisfy the requirements of the legislation.  It also requires the board to provide a family mediation service.  The board furthermore administers a number of criminal legal aid related schemes in anticipation of legislation to transfer responsibility to the board for the administration of the main criminal legal aid scheme.</p> <p>  In order to provide civil legal services, we use a mixed model of service.  We have 30 law centres and two specialist offices, all staffed with solicitors, while we refer out certain cases to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  Last year, we provided or facilitated legal services to approximately 18,400 new clients.  Most of those will have received or be receiving an ongoing service.  The majority will have involved legal representation in court, and many of those matters will be time consuming and often demanding cases.  In 2018, approximately 71% of those who sought legal services from the board did so in relation to a family matter, just over 10% in relation to international protection, just under 10% on foot of the Abhaile scheme and 9% in relation to general civil matters.  I have set out the level of demand in recent years for legal services from the board in the first appendix in my statement.</p> <p>  The civil legal aid system in Ireland is relatively speaking compared with other jurisdictions quite broad scope-wise.  All civil matters are within the scope of the system unless specifically excluded, unlike in some other jurisdictions, notably England and Wales, which take the approach that all matters are excluded unless they are specifically included.  The main case types that are excluded are defamation, small claims, disputes concerning rights and interests in or over land, licensing and conveyancing.  Representative actions and group litigation are effectively excluded also.  There are some exceptions to the exclusions.</p> <p>  One aspect of our legal aid system is that legal aid, that is, representation, can only be provided for cases before the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, the Coroner&rsquo;s Court and any court or tribunal that is prescribed on foot of the legislation.  It is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality to prescribe any tribunal or court, and he or she must have the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to do so.  To date, the only tribunal that has been so prescribed is the International Protection Appeals Tribunal and its predecessor, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Legal aid is thus not available for cases before the likes of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p> <p>  In terms of comparison with other common law jurisdictions, the scope of civil legal aid in Ireland is very similar to Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the legislation operates on the same principles and with many of the same exclusions.  England and Wales have effectively excluded most private family law disputes since the passing of legislation in 2012.  According to the latest available Family Court Statistics Quarterly, published by the UK Ministry for Justice, the number of private family law cases where neither party is represented increased from 12% in January 2012 to 39% as of June 2019.  Most Australian and Canadian jurisdictions do not fund, or only fund to a very limited extent, money damages cases, for example, tort and contract cases, while in Ireland these cases come within scope.  In many European Union member states, other than the United Kingdom, Malta and Cyprus, the legal environment and rules are very different, and in some jurisdictions and courts, legal representation is compulsory.  This makes comparing the provision of legal aid in such jurisdictions with our own very difficult.</p> <p>  Our financial eligibility criteria for legal aid are laid down in some detail in the legal aid regulations that have been passed between 1996 and 2017.  Broadly, the regulations provide that a person&rsquo;s disposable income must be below &euro;18,000 per annum.  Disposable income is assessed by taking gross income and deducting certain allowances.  A person&rsquo;s disposable capital assets must be below &euro;100,000.  The person&rsquo;s home, if he or she is a homeowner, is not assessed as a capital asset for the purpose of the regulations.  I have set out in the table in the second appendix the income and capital thresholds for a number of other common law jurisdictions.  Allowances differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and so the thresholds may not be directly comparable.  Research work that we did back in 2009 indicated that approximately 50% of the population was eligible for legal aid.  We updated the research a couple of years ago using 2015 data and the finding was that eligibility was in the region of 46%.  </p> <p>  It is common case that the rules of civil procedure in Ireland need updating, and I doubt that I can add anything to what the review group, chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, is likely to recommend.  However, as I have alluded to, most of the work we do is in the area of family law, which is an area that Mr. Justice Kelly&rsquo;s review group will not address.  I strongly believe there is scope for reform of the family justice system.  I wholly endorse the recent report of this committee in relation to that system, and our chairperson has publicly expressed endorsement on behalf of our organisation.  We have worked with senior officials in the Department of Justice and Equality to progress the heads of a family courts Bill, which I am aware is just one reform aspect but it is a really important one.  Our commitment to reform in this area is about pursuing better experiences and outcomes for persons going through a relationship breakdown, but it is also about having a more efficient system and thus being able to use our resources more efficiently.  I echo the comments that have already been made by other contributors on that particular issue.</p> <p>  We have waiting times at our law centres, and it is always a concern of both the statutory board and my own to try to manage those as best we can.  It is worth noting that approximately 57% of those who seek legal services from us will get an immediate or near-immediate service.  We will always prioritise certain case types, including domestic violence cases and cases involving Tusla, where we are representing parents whose children are the subject of applications to be taken into care or under supervision.  Most of those looking for legal services for a remedy in the District Family Court will be granted legal aid swiftly.  Legal services on foot of the Abhaile scheme are effectively immediate.  I am noting this not in any way to diminish concerns about waiting times.</p> <p>  In terms of impediments to improving the promptness of services to those who are waiting, one particular challenge at the moment is solicitor recruitment.  We are limited to offering new recruits the first point on the pay scale.  A number of other public bodies have been able to obtain flexibility within their scales in terms of what they can offer, but to date we have not been able to get that flexibility.  A solicitor recently left us to go to another public sector body, anecdotally on the basis that he was going to be paid &euro;15,000 per annum more.  It is an ongoing issue to persuade the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and we are being supported by our own Department in this regard.</p> <p>  We refer work to private solicitors on a fee-per-case basis.  The fees require the approval of our own Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  As an organisation that works on a closed budget basis, we have to strike a balance between maximising the number of cases that we can refer to private solicitors while at the same time ensuring that the fees payable attract enough solicitors to do the work.  I doubt that many would argue that the Irish legal system is lay litigant friendly, though one qualification I would put on this is that it is notably friendlier in the District Family Court in Dublin.  Situations like repossession lists are clearly difficult places for persons who do not have legal representation.  On foot of the Abhaile scheme, we now have a duty solicitor service in county registrar&rsquo;s possession courts, which the  board facilitates and organises, and which may allow what would be lay litigants to get some level of legal assistance on the day of the court.</p> <p>  On the subject of class actions, I would urge that considerable attention is paid to any legal aid aspect that might be contemplated for such actions, as this could require a significant rethink in terms of the legal aid system.  While it may be somewhat tangential, there are proceedings in being on behalf of a company limited by guarantee against the board where the company is seeking legal aid for the purpose of other litigation relating to the environment.  I do not propose to comment on the other issues raised in the appendix to the committee&rsquo;s invitation, though we would welcome members' questions on those issues or on any other matter on which we can usefully contribute.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Access to justice and legal costs is one of the most important topics.  I am relatively new to this committee.  I thank the Chair and the members for choosing this topic.  I did have some input into the work and agenda.</p><p>Forty years have elapsed since the Airey case and it is extraordinary that we are still talking about very basic factors concerning access to justice.  In three and half years my respect for the legal profession, particularly the Judiciary, has increased and my colleague seated beside me might laugh at that.  However, I certainly need and see the importance of having a very independent and strong legal profession and Judiciary, which are often the last call for the citizen.  Within that there is huge inequality.</p><p>I will quote the Chief Justice because we do not often have chief justices leading us.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	There is little point in having a good court system, likely to produce fair results in accordance with law, if a great many people find it difficult or even impossible to access that system for practical reasons.  But it has increasingly become the case that many types of litigation are moving beyond the resources of all but a few.  </blockquote> <p>I ask that the witnesses in the course of answering might deal with the question of access and the comments made by the Chief Justice.</p><p>I shall start with the solicitors and the fact that a reference was made to the setting up of an office of legal costs adjudicators in the opening statement.  Has the office been set up under the Act?</p></speech>

To further answer the question on the legal costs adjudication situation, it is not really a question of setting up that office.

What I can tell the Deputy is that the president has been working very hard on the report and a huge amount of work has been done.  I am only one member of the committee.  I think what has occurred is that there was probably a little bit more work in it than was anticipated.  It is going to be a longer report than was anticipated.

That paper refers to the fact that the take-up of this legal advice is relatively low, with only one application in 2018 and four in 2017.  Amnesty International, in 2005, stated of the provision: "In practice, this provision has not been used and victims are generally unaware of its existence."

The Garda is aware of the service and the details of the service are on its website as well as our own.  I do not know what else we can do to promote its use.</p> <p>  Where the issue of prior sexual history is at play, for want of a better phrase, in a case, we provide representation.

The most common theme to emerge is the failure to analyse all systems, the failure to examine that system and ask what are the gaps and to give feedback on policy to the Government.  There is clearly a gaping gap in a theoretical service that, on the ground, is not being taken up.</p></speech>

I am the editor of an internal publication in the Legal Aid Board called <i>Legalese</i>where we look at different issues and our latest publication looked at the issue of representation of complainants in rape and sexual assault cases.  In conjunction with that, we provided a comprehensive document looking at the legal issues that arise in those cases, some of which are very technical.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked why we are not getting some of those complainants at an early stage, or a stage at which we can give advice.  Part of my research involved engagement with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and that was one of the issues that I discussed with representatives of the centre.  It was in one of the papers that they submitted to us.  It is partly to do with the fact that complainants may get advice from the centre.  Complainants are getting advice from some other outlets and may not always come to us for representation until they are in court and the net issue of sexual history is before the court.  While it is certainly something the board and I are interested in promoting, I am not sure what avenues are there for the victims to whom we can afford available services.  We are keen to provide that service and we have specialised solicitors.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we are in the midst of a 16-day campaign that happens every year in opposition to violence against women.  I am not asking our guests to sort this out but it should be highlighted and there should be an in-built analysis of the gaps and failures that exist and feedback provided to the Government thereon.  Is that happening at the moment?  Is the Government being told that the legislation is there but victims are not using the limited scheme that is in place?  I think our guests will accept that.</p></speech>

To have a healthy, functioning democracy, we need efficient access to the courts so that justice can be administered and be seen to be administered.  There are delays with many causes, including the absence of judges and insufficient barristers and legal staff.  Fundamentally, the costs also determine who gets access to the court and who does not.  I have focused on the Legal Aid Board but it clearly does not have that role, or is not using that role, which must be filled somewhere else as it was by Ms Airey and the legal team who had the courage to take the case with her in 1979.</p> <p>  I will come back to Ms Barry.

When the legal aid scheme, through the Legal Aid Board, was set up, it did not reflect what the Pringle report recommended and it was set up on a limited basis.

The figures in this area are significant.  The figure thrown out for domestic violence is &euro;2 billion.  Ms Barry is making the similar point that it would be cheaper, or certainly more cost efficient, to provide an appropriate service because, one way or another, it costs the State because money goes to health services, prisons or somewhere else.  The D&aacute;il has not reached the point where it analyses both the cost of failing to provide a service and the cost of providing a service.</p></speech>

People contact FLAC with a variety of legal issues and, if we were to solve them all, there would be an obvious and considerable personal gain for those people but if housing and homelessness can be solved, it will have a positive impact on these people's social inclusion and the cost to the State.  We are very anxious that it would be seen as necessary and critical to social inclusion that we target all of people's problems rather than just family law, as the Legal Aid Board does very effectively.  It does not make sense to us that the board is not also able to represent people in their social welfare appeals, or their eviction if that is happening at the same time.  Limiting action to a particular part of the problem is not the best use of our limited resources.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Connolly.  I have said before publicly that we are very good as a Legislature and we pass very good legislation in this country, but we are not so good at putting the resources in place to deal with the legislation.  The Legal Aid Board is the recipient of change without necessarily having the extra resources to deal with it.  When I came into the Legal Aid Board in 2011, we had waiting lists of 5,000 people.  We spent a lot of time working on those waiting lists and over the years, even up to last year, we were reducing the number on a consistent yearly basis down to approximately 1,600.  This year, it is going back up again because of the issue Mr. McDaid raised earlier about recruitment and resources.  As I said publicly - I have said it before - we are not sufficiently resourced in terms of the type of outreach work that we could or would like to do.  As Ms Barry said, we are probably the biggest family law practice in the country and the biggest childcare practice in the country.  We hold ourselves up as best in class in terms of the service that we provide.  To be fair, people recognise that, but in reality we do not have the resources to reach all needs.</p></speech>

I did not come to barristers yet.  I have run out of time.  It seems to me that the Legal Aid Board must have a role in deciding whether legislation is good and is needed but also in outlining that there are implications and that the Government must carry out a regulatory impact analysis of its consequences.  There must be a role for the Legal Aid Board to highlight that this is not happening.  Otherwise, it will continue in a very restrictive role of providing limited legal aid which is not meeting the need.</p></speech>

I agree with the view that if we keep doing the same things, we will not get a different result.  Our difficulty at the moment is that we spend almost all of our time trying to cope with waiting lists and trying to deal with the current need.  Recruitment is a big issue that is affecting us.  Not only do we find it difficult to compete with the private sector in terms of recruitment, which we do not want to do, but we cannot compete with the public sector either.  That is impacting on how we do our business.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the role that solicitors, barristers, FLAC and the Legal Aid Board play in facilitating people to gain access to justice in this country.  At this time, almost 11 a.m., throughout this country in District Courts, Circuit Courts and High Courts, people find themselves before what can be a very intimidating court system.  Without the help of people such as the witnesses, I think people would find the system impossible.  I acknowledge the role all of the witnesses play in that regard.</p> <p>  Sometimes, unfortunately, the interests of lawyers get conflated with the interests of the people who are before the courts.  It is very important for this committee that we put at the centre of our deliberations the person who is trying to access justice.  Let us leave to one side all the issues about the interests of lawyers.  I know there are representative bodies present and they are obliged in many respects to represent the interests of their members, but let us put the person at the centre of this discussion.</p> <p>  I will focus first on the criminal context because the State seems to play a greater role in criminal law than it does in civil law.  All the witnesses can feel free to respond but I am aware that Mr. &Oacute; hUallach&aacute;in is someone who has worked in the criminal area and he might be helpful in that regard.  When one looks at a person who wants to access justice in the area of crime, one has a victim of crime who will go to the police and then a file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for the prosecution of the case.  Then one will have an accused person who will want to be represented.  I know there are issues about the amount of moneys that are paid, but leaving that aside, from the point of view of the victim of crime and the person accused of the criminal offence, are they being provided with effective access and protection in the justice system?</p></speech>

There is an ongoing debate, as Deputy Connolly indicated, about how victims are dealt with.  Whether it is civil legal aid or the criminal legal aid, there are deficits in provision.  While budgets alone do not resolve it, one does need enhanced resources.</p><p>I certainly think there is room for significant improvement in staffing and proper victim support or resource people.  Other agencies might be more familiar with this than I would be, but I certainly think there is room for significant improvement.  In respect of the Bar's involvement, as Mr. Dignam outlined in our opening and as outlined in our submission, there is an acute problem building up where we find that up to 70% of those practitioners who start out in criminal law are gone by year six.  That is primarily down to what Mr. Ken Murphy called borderline economic pay rates.  In the future, that probably also will be reflected in criminal legal aid solicitors but there is an emerging problem there and that is not just a problem for the Bar.  It is a problem for the Bar at the moment.  We have young members who are desperately keen to work in that area, who have a vocational commitment to it, who have trained up for it and who would love to stay in it.  It is just not economically viable, however.  That is something that will rebound on not only the accused they are representing but possibly even also the victims, because the whole process will slow down, albeit perhaps not to a standstill.  It may not happen tomorrow but if this trend continues, we will find we do not have adequate solicitors and certainly not adequate counsel to represent people.</p></speech>

Various Ministers have said to me over the years that there are no votes in giving more money to criminal legal aid.  If the Chairman will permit me a slight moment of levity, it makes a point.  Many years ago, a survey was carried out by our counterpart organisation, the Law Society of England and Wales, about public attitudes to the funding of the criminal legal aid system.  It was a full professional survey and the question essentially was whether people who are accused of serious crimes and who have no financial capacity to defend themselves should be provided with a legal solicitor or barrister to represent them and defend their interests at the expense of the taxpayer.  The answer, properly analysed, was the public felt yes such a person should, if he or she was innocent.  I am making the point somewhat ironically but it shows that there is a degree of ambivalence in the public mind about the funding of criminal legal aid and one only has to listen to a radio phone-in programme on this topic and there is criticism of it.</p> <p>  While I take the point Deputy Connolly made about having a healthy democracy and an independent and strong Judiciary and what these measure in society, I would like to emphasise criminal legal aid a little and echo what has been said by the Bar, which is there is a real problem at the moment with the funding of criminal legal aid.  The Law Society in its submission read out by the president a few moments ago, has a phrase we have used in submissions to Government.  The phrase we have chosen is, "borderline uneconomic for the provision of criminal legal aid".  The firms that specialise in it and the firms that do a certain amount of it are just simply questioning whether they can continue to do so.  In neighbouring jurisdictions, like we have seen in England and Wales, there are now parts of the country where a far more generously funded criminal legal aid system is also becoming borderline uneconomic for certain providers such that the phrase that is used is "legal aid deserts".  There are big geographical areas in England and Wales where no solicitor participates in criminal legal aid because of the funding issue.</p> <p>  Again, the Law Society has explained the consequences of the cuts that took place.  We accepted the cuts that took place at the time of economic crisis in the State.  In 2009, 2010 and 2011, I sat in meetings with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, and he explained the public finances and the need for the cuts.  We did not protest the cuts, which were quite severe, and much more severe in the criminal legal aid system than in many other areas of State services.  The figure we said was 26% but in fact, calculated in different ways it could be measured as being up to 40% and the Bar had other figures.  Those were really severe cuts.  There has been absolutely no restoration.  While the State has restored funding to many areas where there were cuts during the economic crisis, there has been no restoration here.  The Law Society has made representations to the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald, and the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  There is sympathy for the case that is made.  There is recognition that it is becoming uneconomic.  I am looking at the public interest and not the interest of the profession in this regard if lawyers cease to practice in this area.  The people who do a lot of legal aid in the solicitors' firms cannot retain staff.  They are transferring to other areas where they are paid better with better lifestyles, instead of going out in the middle of the night to Garda stations and spending endless hours there,  They also spend endless hours, for example, on another feature nowadays, which is the review of CCTV.  Hours and hours of CCTV have to be reviewed by the solicitor as part of his or her preparation of the case.  That is not funded or paid.  It is a rate per case and there is no funding of that.</p> <p>  I will just finish on this point.  In the neighbouring jurisdiction of England and Wales, they have been able to document one consequence of this, which is the age of the cohort of the profession that provide criminal legal aid is increasing all the time.  I think they said 49 years old is the average age in England and Wales.  We have not done that research here but it is because young lawyers are not going into this work or, if they go into it, are not staying in this work.  That has consequences for the future of the entire scheme and we believe that unless there is funding and the capacity to address funding of the scheme and to make it economic again for solicitors to provide it, there will be long-term problems in the delivery of criminal legal aid in this country, which is one of the measures of our status as a democracy.</p></speech>

Obviously, the State does not have as much involvement in the whole area of civil law, because it does not fund it the same way as the State funds the prosecution of all criminal offences and it funds to a large extent the defence of criminal cases.  In civil cases, it is different, although the State plays a big part in civil litigation.  I do not know what Ms Barry would think of, if she had a wish list in FLAC.  What group of people does she believe is being denied access to the justice system because of the failure to fund a civil legal aid system?  Is that a fair question?  For instance, one can look at people who want to go to the Residential Tenancies Board or the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  They are all forms of access to justice, although they are not courts, for example in family law.</p></speech>

It is very hard to identify one particular group and say they are the people who are most denied access to justice but we have in the past provided services for members of the Traveller community.  We are running a clinic with the assistance of the Department of Justice and Equality for the Roma community.  We see huge, unmet legal need in the area of housing and homelessness.  I believe that in the independent law centre movement, there are almost ten law centres out there now and all of us could spend all of our time doing housing and homelessness cases and we would just be hitting the tip of the iceberg.  There are issues we are almost afraid to take on because we believe the need is so great and that would be in respect of people with disabilities and their families.  There is huge, unmet legal need in those areas, which is where the exclusions become really critical, because there is no legal aid if, for example, one wishes to bring a claim that one has been discriminated against on the grounds of one's disability in education.</p><p>It may sound like the exclusions do not matter, but they do because they affect discrimination, including housing discrimination in education.  They are all excluded at present so they are-----</p></speech>

That is why we are advocating that the Legal Aid Board be given resources and the function of providing information.  As Deputy Connolly said, if people do not know about the impact of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, they will not be able to avail of those provisions.  It is, therefore, important that someone, be it the Legal Aid Board, or the board together with the Citizens Information Board, be given the explicit function of providing education on legal rights.</p></speech>

I have no doubt but that many people are not aware of civil legal aid services.  We work with the likes of the Citizens Information Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, FLAC, Community Law and Mediation and various other NGOs that we see as potential information gateways.  They can give information about our services to potential users.  There is a statutory provision in our legislation that refers to us providing information about our services, but that is a balancing act in that we create a demand that we then potentially have a lot of difficulty meeting.</p></speech>

The vast majority of people who gain access to the justice system do so through going to solicitors who are prepared to evaluate whether they have a claim, and that if they do and the solicitors believe in it, they take the claim on the basis of a no foal, no fee arrangement.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As lawyers, when we meet our clients, the first thing is obviously to evaluate the claim.  If we feel it is a statable case, we evaluate it and take it on a no foal, no fee basis in the public interest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.251" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019112700002#O00800"><p>Sometimes people query the no foal, no fee process, but we view it as essentially an issue of access to justice and as entirely benign.  Solicitors will not take a case - or are highly unlikely to do so - in which they do not believe or in respect of which they do not believe in the legal merits or the prospects of success because they know that if the case fails, they will not be paid.  Clearly, then, the process screens out unstatable cases such that only relatively strong cases are ever initiated.  In reality, the process is a substitute for the absence of legal aid because most people could not fund cases themselves.</p></speech>

When a client goes to a solicitors' firm, the solicitor takes the case on a no foal, no fee basis.  Can a financially weak litigant get access to a good barrister to present his or her case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Dignam" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019112700002#O01000"><p>Absolutely.  I referred to most of the landmark constitutional law cases or public interest cases - and this can only be on an anecdotal basis - which were in fact no foal, no fee cases brought by the most experienced and expert barristers.  I was struck by what Deputy Connolly said in a question to one of the other witnesses, that is, that the Airey case was brought by the brave Ms Airey and her courageous legal team.  That is what this boils down to: it required a brave litigant and a courageous legal team to bring a case on a no foal, no fee basis because there was not an adequate civil legal aid system to bring the case on the basis of State support.  That is what is fundamentally inadequate about our access-to-justice principles and system.</p></speech>

People recognise that if there are lawyers representing people in court, they will be paid.  However, we need to look at making the system more efficient.  There is too much in the civil area.  There is too much control by the parties themselves of the litigation.  The State needs to play a much greater role in determining when a case will be heard, expediting it, having procedures to strike it out at an early stage if it is evident it will not win and just taking more control of it, as opposed to the present situation whereby the parties probably have too much control as to how the case meanders down the road.  I do not know if any of the witnesses have any comments to make about that.</p></speech>

According to the World Bank survey to which reference was made, one area in which we scored poorly was case management.  The point the Deputy made is that there is a greater need for case management to ensure efficiencies in the system, but that is also a function of the system being adequately resourced and having an adequate number of judges.</p></speech>

I am heavily involved in the International Bar Association, IBA.  Approximately two months ago, the IBA published a study of a number of different jurisdictions, not specifically Ireland, on how access to justice can diminish other costs to society at a later stage in the life cycle.  I will happily supply a copy of that to the committee if it is interested in it.</p></speech>

We live in a digital age.  We have a well-developed website that people can access and that has an awful lot of information on it.  It is a detailed website that sets out clearly the fact that we do not just cover family law.  There is sometimes a perception out there that we only cover family law.  In my law centre in Limerick, according to a quick analysis of the cases we have on hand, approximately 55% are separations or divorces; one eighth are other family law matters; another eighth are non-family law matters, which are quite extensive, ranging from probate cases to landlord and tenant matters to injunctions and lots of other issues before the courts; and a further 20% are childcare cases.  We cover a wide range.  My message as manager in Limerick, and I think many of the managers in the law centres have the same message, is that people should be encouraged to make the application.  People will often ring and ask whether something is covered.  It may require a lot of detailed analysis on our part to see whether it is covered under the scheme.  I am not making an apology for the matters that are not covered, and I accept the points made by Ms Barry and others about certain matters that are outside of our scope, but there are certainly an awful lot of matters within our scope and that the public are not aware of at times.</p></speech>

We are dealing with a substantive public address today and on 11 and 18 December.  It is our custom to have a photograph taken with all the witnesses and members at the end of each session.  Rather than the Chairman being left on his own, I would like colleagues to hold fast.  I see an empty bench and it is starting to concern me.  Deputy Pringle has the floor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019112700002#O01900"><p>The Chairman should have said that earlier.  Perhaps he would have held on to more of us.  We will never turn down a photo opportunity.</p> <p>  Many of my questions have probably been asked, which is good.  It is a benefit of coming to the meeting late.  One of the main issues is that nothing seems to be analysed in cost terms.  It is  something I have noticed as a new member of the committee.  We are great at bringing in legislation, and we probably have a very good suite of legislation by international standards, but we are appalling in respect of implementation and reviewing how our legislation is working.  Perhaps this is because we can bring in legislation that looks good and get the PR and so on from it and no one ever looks afterwards to see what happens to it.</p><p>I want to try to get to the Legal Aid Board, which is going to get a bit of stick since it is the only public body present.  I was a bit sympathetic towards it until the last question, when the witnesses said that they do not want to create demand by actually looking at how things are working.</p></speech>

Ms Catherine Ryan spoke about our website.  I spoke about the level of engagement that we have with the bodies that I would see as being gateways to our civil legal aid services.  In other words, those are the bodies on the ground, such as the Citizens Information Board, that people will go to if they want to find out what they can do about a legal problem.</p></speech>

Mr. McDaid has to manage within the restrictions of the board's budget and I have a fair bit of sympathy for that.  Having a good website is a very static, passive thing.  I think I have a good website.  People will not naturally come to my website to find out what is happening just because it is there.  It is clear from what Mr. McDaid has said that he does not really see it as the board's role to look at how things are performing or to report back on how it is working.</p></speech>

Who is the person who should be looking at this or which body should do this?  I do not believe that it should be the Law Society, the Bar Council or the Free Legal Advice Centres because that is not their role.  Maybe the Department or the Legal Aid Board should be.  Somebody should be looking at it.  One thing that has to come out of our hearings here is some structure about how things are looked at.  Rather than bring in more laws in future, we might look at how the laws we have are working and change how they work instead.  Maybe people have suggestions.</p></speech>

I see the function of the statutory board as trying to be forward looking about what we can do in the future and not just repeating what we have been doing over the 40 years, during which there has been very good work.  We are trying to look at other areas.  Access to justice is not all about access to the courts.  We are trying to improve the mediation service.  We are trying to improve co-location and are looking at opening a co-location office in Letterkenny next year.  These are new, innovative ways of trying to get people to access justice and they are very important.  I do not want to harp on about resources all the time but it is very difficult to make progress in new areas.  One of those areas is education and telling people about their rights and how to access those rights.  FLAC does a fantastic job in that arena.  We are hamstrung to a significant extent because we are trying to deal with the current demands on our service and staff.  The staff are stretched, including professional staff, mediators, solicitors and administrative staff.  We deal with people who are often at a very vulnerable time of their lives when they are under extreme pressure.  If it is a case that Tusla is trying to take a person's child from that person and we are the first-line defenders, that is a traumatic situation.  Ms Ryan might be able to talk about that more than me with regard to the actual situation on the ground.  That is what we deal with daily and where our oxygen goes most of the time.  We do not have much left in the tank with regard to other innovations that I and the board would like to pursue for access to justice.</p></speech>

If I might address matters in the public interest, not just from the Bar's point of view, it is important to not come down too heavily on the Legal Aid Board.  It performs a very difficult exercise, as its chairman has just said, with limited budgets and stretched resources.  I, as a barrister who used to practise in that area, know that only too well.  I think one would find it hard to find a barrister who has worked with the Legal Aid Board who would say that the staff, solicitors and support staff are anything but excellent and that they do their best in very trying circumstances.</p></speech>

I am highlighting the fact that there is a lack of information made available by people who have a responsibility to make it available.  It is not a personal attack on anybody.</p></speech>

I am trying to say that it has to be looked at with regard to wider public interest.  The Legal Aid Board performs a difficult function.  If I criticise the Legal Aid Board, it is more a criticism of the paymaster, that it needs more resources.  The staffing issue has already been identified.  It requires financial resources and buildings.  This committee has dealt at length with the family law issue and the crying need for the Hammond Lane building, for example.  When we deal with Dublin, resources outside of that must be addressed.  All of the agencies here and the others that will come before the committee in due course have a role in this regard and we can act as catalysts in the way that we deal with our own client base and how we interact with the Legal Aid Board.  This agency is often engaged in firefighting and trying to control a situation.  We need to note that in the public interest.  If anything is to come out of the deliberations of this committee on legal aid, I hope it would be that there is a crying need for far greater investment.  Mr. Ken Murphy has already adverted to the World Bank and International Bar Association survey, and that there are other downstream economic benefits from legal aid.  We have also highlighted that in our submission.  One cannot take the Legal Aid Board and its responsibilities in isolation any more than one can take costs in isolation.  There has to be a holistic picture of how we deal with this and how Irish society develops, not necessarily in the interests of my members but of all of us as a society.</p></speech>

Would Ms Ryan like to come back in?  Deputy Pringle has already eased off because Mr. O'Leary has indicated that the Legal Aid Board is coming to Letterkenny some time in the new year.  The point was not lost on me.  Well fielded.</p></speech>

It takes up much of our time.  On our last analysis in Limerick, defending those cases took approximately one third of our time.  Some 60% of our available court days since the start of this year have been spent in the children's courts, defending those cases.  They are important cases that should rightly take up much of our time.  Those clients are very vulnerable.  I am echoing that the service that we provide there is very important for access to justice.  I will echo what everyone else is saying today about the issue of resources.  My input as a solicitor on the board is to ensure that we are providing a quality service, which needs to be resourced properly.</p><p>Many of those childcare cases are very complex and various different reports are needed from professionals.  We need to be able to resource those so we can do our job properly, given it is a very important job that we do in the childcare arena.</p></speech>

It is not a given the task of going out and advertising the fact people can get legal aid in respect of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  It is also very important that when socially protective legislation is introduced, the Oireachtas would carry out a legal aid audit before it is passed so some cognisance is given to what impact it will have on the Legal Aid Board.  For example, there has been a lot of talk about the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act.  Potentially, well over 10,000 people may now be entitled to legal aid and, if that was to be advertised, it would bring the Legal Aid Board to its knees.  While it is useful legislation that we advocated for, we also advocated that the budget of the Legal Aid Board would be increased to be able to deal with the demand, and that did not happen in any shape or form.  If we are going to have education, which we would welcome, there has to be an audit and the resources have to be targeted at the Legal Aid Board.</p></speech>

I am trying to tease out is whose responsibility this is.  Ms Barry stated the Oireachtas has a role, and I take that on board.  We have a role, as does the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Legal Aid Board also has a role, although, unfortunately, it is not resourced to do it and is dependent on the Department for that.  This is vital.  We have no analysis of the measures we are bringing in and even the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act should be reviewed to assess the impact it is having and the potential costs, so we can see how the system works or does not work, as the case may be.</p> <p>  With regard to how the system works for people with disabilities, according to the National Disability Authority, people with disabilities face barriers in access to justice and reporting crimes, as well as within the court system and after a trial.  Do the witnesses have data on how the system deals with people with disabilities?  Do they train their employees to deal with people with disabilities?  What special measures would they recommend for people with disabilities? </p></speech>

For example, courtrooms are frequently unsuitable and inaccessible, so a lot of work needs to be done.  In terms of what goes on in the court and how a person with disabilities would be dealt by judges, for example, they make every effort possible to deal appropriately and adequately with persons with disabilities within the confines of unsuitable accommodation.  A lot needs to be done.</p> <p>  From the point of view the Bar - and Ms Murphy may be able to talk about this in greater detail - we recently had some training and education to upskill our members on dealing with vulnerable witnesses, and that includes witnesses with disabilities.  That is an ongoing process as it has to be for all of us. </p></speech>

We provide a more detailed submission with our statement.  On pages 29 and 30, we have set out the recommendations we have made to the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice in regard to people with disabilities.  There are quite a number of recommendations, from engaging in routine data gathering and monitoring, accessibility of the physical space and what the Courts Service needs to do to provide for people with disabilities.  We have recommended that an access officer be made available to assist people with disabilities and that court documentation needs to be in an accessible format, which it is not at present.  We recommend that Wi-Fi needs to be available in all courtrooms, the Courts Service needs to work with people to improve accessibility, the website needs to undergo periodic accessibility testing for people with disabilities and all legal documents need to be available in accessible formats.</p> <p>  Ms Malone works with PILA, the Public Interest Law Alliance.  Through PILA, Robbie Sinnott was involved in High Court proceedings seeking access to a secret ballot.  Throughout the hearing, which lasted in excess of ten days, PILA had to attend the court simply to provide support to Mr. Sinnott, who has a visual impairment, to get around the court system.  There is no proper provision for people with disabilities to access the court services.  He was being cross-examined during the hearing with regard to documents that he could not access, and there were huge delays in getting documents from the State in a format he could access.  They are very basic steps that need to be taken.</p> <p>  It is important to remind the committee that both the Courts Service and the Legal Aid Board are under a statutory obligation to promote equality under the public sector duty under section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  They are obliged to have regard to the needs of people with disabilities and to look at what steps they can take to improve accessibility for people with disabilities in the courts.  I hope the review of civil justice will look at people with disabilities in particular and will take on board some of our recommendations.</p> <p>  In regard to online services, people with disabilities may find it easier to access an online court.  We had a conference in May, where Lord Briggs, who was involved in a report on online courts in the UK, came over and, together with Andrea Coomber, gave a practical demonstration of how an online court would work.  I have to say I was amazed at how easy it was in practice.  It would be easier than booking a Ryanair flight, which can be difficult enough, and I was shocked by how easy it was.  It is time to look at that.  Obviously, there would have to be safeguards.  Ms Ryan referred to how the board's website is accessible.  It has to be recognised that many people who come to FLAC would have literacy and language problems, and would not find websites or online services accessible.  However, it is a resource that is there.  There is quite a cohort of people who are at ease with using technology, so it is something that needs to be examined.  Having said that, the Courts Service as it stands, if it was to look to introduce an online court, would have to cut back on its other services.  While we certainly recommend this, it would have to be properly resourced.</p></speech>

Our website is compliant with the blind requirements.  We have some training programmes around disability awareness, which is sometimes also linked in with equality awareness.  We have a disability liaison officer and an access officer.  Plain English is something we are committed to, although we can certainly do better than we are at the moment.</p> <p>  Ms Barry's point on section 42 is well made and it is something we are reflecting on.  To pick up on one recent case that was in the news, a 96-year-old in a nursing home was the subject of proceedings.  This might come back to the Deputy's earlier question on making people aware of our services.</p><p>It is something we are looking at more proactively in terms of people in those situations.  How do we reach them?  What is the level of our responsibility to be proactive in terms of engaging with them?  We would be very engaged at the moment with Sage, which is an NGO representing people with disabilities, particularly elderly people.  It is very much on the agenda.</p></speech>

I have one final question on class actions.  As a lay person, one sees how people have to go to such lengths to get their rights dealt with in the court system and through court procedure, and it only deals with that particular case.  Somebody else coming along has to go through the same procedure.  It is a very cumbersome and a wrong system for individuals to have to deal with.  Could class actions be dealt with in a proper manner?  What would be involved in making that happen and making it work in the justice system?  If the witnesses could respond to that, that would be perfect.</p></speech>

I think Senator Michael McDowell was the then Minister.  The sense I get from the Government response to this, which is perhaps not surprising but consistent, is that it seems to be unenthusiastic about class action because the State tends to think that it would be frequently the defendant to class actions.  I refer to the facilitation or encouragement of mass claims against the State in public health situations, for example.  We have had obviously controversies and scandals and the requirement of each individual who might believe they have a claim arising out of the way in which a public health scheme has operated and the damage they felt may have been caused to them through negligence having to prove their individual case cannot be real justice.  We believe there should be a better system.  The class action system operates in other jurisdictions, but I have a sense that successive Governments may look askance at that from the point of view of economics rather than of justice.</p></speech>

These are cases where the cost of taking the case is simply prohibitive, but there is a power when one can bring people together and bring cases on the basis of a class action.  FLAC has put in a submission on the multi-party actions Bill, which was introduced I think in 2017 and which of course is available.  We have seen no progress on bringing forward that Bill, on looking at the particular provisions of that Bill and at the efficiency and cost effectiveness and on what kind of mechanism one can introduce to the system.  Additional analysis of that multi-party litigation or multi-party actions would be very welcome.</p></speech>

I wanted to say exactly the same thing and to acknowledge Ms O'Boyle referencing the Bill in her opening statement on behalf of the Law Society.  Like so many other Private Members' Bills that go through this committee, I fear it is up there floating around in the cloud.  Money messages may be an obstacle to progress, but we are pursuing it.

FLAC referenced a rigid and out-of-date means test.  The Legal Aid Board spoke of how disposable income must be below &euro;18,000 per annum.  Are we talking about the same thing there?  The first reaction is that that needs to be increased, but that might only add to the witnesses' workload, and without additional resourcing, it is a chicken and egg situation.  We have to be very cognisant of that.  It has to be addressed, but resourcing is the first requirement.  Are we okay in saying that?</p></speech>

It is great to have consent.</p> <p>  The Bar did not mention it - it was not in Mr. Dignam's oral presentation - but the Law Society referenced the inadequate provision of judges.  I know there a little history in this area going back, but why do we have such a low appointment of judges across the board?  The statistic cited was 6% as against the international average of 22%.  It is another element and it has not been raised.  That is the only reason I am asking about it now.</p></speech>

True comparatives are probably to be found between the Irish system and other common law jurisdictions.  The inquisitorial civil law system is much more judge-heavy, because the role played by the judge is much more proactive than it is in the common law system.  The point was made that the burden on the parties is much greater in our system.  I do not know if those figures were complied before the increase in the number of judges in the Court of Appeal, which we welcome.  I remember then Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, constantly referring to statistics, which I do not have to hand.  She had statistics on the ratio of judges per head of population in Ireland compared to civil law and common law jurisdictions all over the world and it seemed to be very low.  I often say the judge is in many respects the cheapest part of the whole system.  Courthouses, staffing, infrastructure and technology could well be more expensive, and I think it is a false economy on behalf of the State not to appoint more judges, because there are economic consequences to delays in the justice system affecting "Ireland Inc." - the econony - quite apart from individual citizens and their entitlement to speedy access to justice.  I have never fully understood the rationale of the State in underfunding judicial appointment levels, except possibly that creating more appointments would require more courtrooms and more infrastructure.  We need that anyway.</p> <p>  Certainly, in the context of the joint Bar Council of Ireland and Law Society initiative, which has full Government backing, seeking to attract international legal business to Ireland, we cannot continue to operate with delays in our court system and expect to compete in this contested space internationally with other jurisdictions looking for a Brexit dividend as well.  We have to invest in this, and that means more judges.</p></speech>

Obviously, members of the Executive would have to be asked why more judges are not appointed, but it boils down to a very simple point, which is if one cannot get a judge to hear one's case, one does not have access to justice.  The imperative is to have a sufficient and adequate number of judges.</p></speech>

It was not touched on, so I said we had better bring that in.  Would anyone else like to comment on that or, most importantly of all, is there any other point anyone would like to expand on or introduce, because we will not get the opportunity to engage again in this particular series?  If there is anything that anyone wants to offer, please do so.  I call Ms Murphy.</p></speech>

It is a very important point and one this committee is probably best placed to pick up on, which is probably utilising the World Bank IBA report to do the economic evaluation of legal aid.  It is an excellent report that has looked at the economic value of aid in other jurisdictions.  We cannot do this alone but if the committee or the State decided to approach it in that way, it would be a very worthwhile exercise to undertake and would help decision-making in the future in relation to legal aid.</p><p>I thank Ms Murphy for that.

This includes international research that we can probably link in with the committee and direct the committee to.  There is some doctoral research, which is relatively new, called The Machinery of Legal Aid, which is informative.  Ireland is one of the subject countries that is part of that research.  Some Dutch research was carried out some years ago as well.  It looked at comparisons that might be useful for the committee.</p></speech>

Correspondence No. 2019/542 is an email from Mr. Se&aacute;n Murphy, the manager of public affairs at the ESB, 23 October, advising that ESB eCars plans to introduce pricing to support electric vehicle, EV, network expansion.  I propose that we note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/545 is an email from the policy adviser to the joint committee, attaching an article from the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, published on 2 November, on the school bus scheme, which refers to a meeting of the joint committee.  That has been circulated for the information of members.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/546a is an email from our Vice Chairman, Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe, attaching for the consideration of the committee No. 2019/546b, a letter from Mr. Niall McCarthy, managing director of Cork Airport, regarding statements made at a joint committee meeting.  Deputy O'Keeffe is not here at the moment but he may raise this when he comes in, with the agreement of other members.</p></speech>

The chairman of F&aacute;ilte Ireland was at the meeting for a different reason, and because of his background with Ryanair, he threw in a few nuggets of information which turned out to be false.  He claimed that the worst thing Cork Airport ever did was stay with Dublin Airport, as things have not gone well for it since.  That is not the case, as there has been substantial growth there since and things are going very well down there.  It is important that we publish those facts and correct the record because an impression was given at that meeting that staying with Dublin Airport Authority was a disaster, that the Shannon Group did the right thing, and that Cork Airport was a basket case.  As can be seen from this correspondence, that impression is totally false.  Will we be publishing this?</p></speech>

I propose to note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/548 is a letter received from Mr. Stephen Kent, CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann, responding to matters raised by Ms Sally Hogan and Mr. Brian Lynch in correspondence No. 2019/519.  I propose to note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/549 is an email from me forwarding correspondence between myself and the Italian ambassador regarding a meeting.  He wished to meet with me and I suggested he come before the committee as well.  We will hold that meeting as soon as we can arrange it.  The fact that I broke my leg in the meantime has not affected this.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/550a is an email received from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, attaching correspondence No. 2019/550b, which is a letter from its CEO, Ms Moyagh Murdock, declining an invitation to attend the joint committee meeting of 20 November 2019, conveying her apologies to the Chairman and committee members and proposing to offer a report to the committee on all RSA cycling related material.  I propose to note that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will hold a further meeting on this matter in January and are writing a report on it, so any information or input members might have would be extremely welcome.  Encouraging young people and students to cycle more is a particular issue.</p><p>Correspondence No. 2019/551 is an email from the private secretary to the Minister, Deputy Ross, notifying the committee of the Department&rsquo;s intention to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny on the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2019 before Christmas.  It is proposed to schedule this meeting as soon as the committee's schedule permits.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As I said earlier, we have another pressing matter to deal with relating to the FAI.</p><p>Our two priorities will be the KOSI meeting with that report with the Minister and with Sport Ireland.  Then obviously there will be the Minister's request.  Is that okay with everybody?</p></speech>

We had expected that it would be available long before this.  It looks like there will be a need for a second meeting and that will post-date the reconvened AGM of the FAI which is due to take place on 21 December.  We will have to do that in the new year.  It is really important that we put it in context.  The context is that this organisation has been denied State funding because of its accounts.  We need to see how that situation is rectified as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  Holding meetings four days before Christmas of such a controversial item leads me to believe that what she proposes makes a lot of sense, particularly in early January.  We should have a full meeting with the people concerned in the full light of the post-Christmas clarity.  I very much support that.</p></speech>

The longer that goes, the programmes for coaches and children are being denied.  In other words, there are innocent victims of all of this.  Euro 2020 is in Ireland next year and that is being funded by the Government as well.  Whether that is affected as well is a question.  There is an urgency that all of this be brought to a conclusion in a timely order so that the innocent people caught up in this do not continue to be discriminated against because of what has happened in the past.</p></speech>

I would love to see the committee take a position.  This clearly has gone on for a long time and is likely to go on for a considerable period more with the various reports.  I think our primary concern in the Oireachtas is the programmes, the people delivering them and the children.  As of today - I am conscious we were all celebrating a good performance of Ireland last week - we are the only country in the world not supporting soccer in any way financially at this time.  I think that it would be worth discussing and that the committee would develop a position that the funding could be made available, be it week-to-week, month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, with additional oversight, if necessary from this committee or, if not, by Sport Ireland or whomever satisfies the Minister.  The important thing is that we get this money back supporting the programmes that are there, without prejudice to all the other matters that have to be dealt with.  Clearly there is a process afoot that is going to take a lot longer than these programmes will survive.</p></speech>

That is the ideal situation but the loss of confidence in terms of the finance of the FAI was really brought about by the lack of proper governance and oversight.  We absolutely have to be confident that this situation is rectified and that we can be confident that public money is spent in the way it is intended to be spent.  I fully accept that is something that Deputy MacSharry would want as well.</p> <p>  We thought that we would see that second AGM in September and the KOSI report a lot earlier.  There is funding for soccer by way of capital grants.  It is not direct funding for the non-commercial side that was there heretofore.  We saw a scenario, for example, where the Olympic Council was denied funding for a considerable period.  Looking at that organisation now, it is not recognisable in comparison to what was there heretofore.  That is what the object should be in relation to this, so that we do not come back and revisit this topic in a year or two years time but that we can be confident that this organisation is fit for purpose. </p></speech>

I do not know if there are any Latin scholars here.  That means as quickly as possible.  I remember that from my leaving cert.  We should encourage and support Sport Ireland in its analysis and the restoration of funding with the Minister&rsquo;s consent.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It is a carrot and stick approach.  The carrot is that we have governmental funding.  The stick is that we hold people to standards and to account and make sure that they have proper processes in place.  If they do not, then we take away that funding.  That is the position the FAI is in right now.  With regard to the funding of programmes, they do effectively have a line of funding from UEFA.  It is important that we make sure we have proper process in place before another cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money goes to those programmes.  We will do that in the course of events.  We will scrutinise everything.  I do not think we should be restoring funding on a temporary basis at all until we are satisfied as to where that funding is going, that every penny is accounted for and properly spent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112700002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As we initially noted when the committee issued its invitation, we are not yet in a position, as requested, to discuss the specifics of proposed legislation to deal with the emergence of personal powered transporters, PPTs, as no such legislation is proposed at this time.  However, insofar as we can assist the committee to develop its understanding and appreciation of the issues which developments in this area raise, we welcome the opportunity to engage with the members.  It is, I may say, an important and positive development to see the committee take such a forward-looking approach to its work.</p> <p>  The use of devices such as e-scooters, Segways, electric skateboards, powered mini-scooters, electric unicycles and non-pedal assisted electric bicycles on the streets and roads of cities has become more common across the world in the past few years.  These various devices are often collectively classified as powered personal transporters.  Because many such vehicles are not easily defined in law, their regulation, particularly in terms of safe usage on public roads and other public places where they interact with other modes of transport, varies considerably from country to country and indeed, in federal jurisdictions, within countries.  The notable upsurge in the number of e-scooters used in many of the main cities in Europe and the US has focused recent discussions regarding their numbers, collisions, how and where they can be used and by whom, and the criteria in respect of the vehicles themselves.  There have been particular concerns where private operators have started to offer these items for hire on the side of the street by means of mobile phone apps, without having any regard to the regulatory or physical environment in which they are doing so, but not only in such circumstances.  This upsurge has been driven by new private firms, typically owned by venture capital and other private equity funds, and by a rapid increase in the production of the items by manufacturers primarily based in China.  A number of main cities have moved to introduced controls to restrict their numbers and to control and even license their use.  In some cases, cities have moved to ban their use, either for hire or more generally, because of the adverse impact experienced and risks associated.</p> <p>  In this country, section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 classifies such vehicles as mechanically propelled vehicles, MPVs.  Mechanically propelled vehicles cannot be driven on public roads or in public places without the appropriate driving licence, tax and insurance.  Due to the multiplicity of forms of PPTs and lack of established standards, they do not fall within the categories which we currently use for such purposes.  It is therefore not permissible to tax or insure them and no category of our EU-based driving licence covers their use.  Therefore, despite some opinions expressed to the contrary, there is no legal grey area and they are not considered eligible for use on a public road or in a public place.  Such an approach is also that of a number of other countries, including our neighbours in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  E-scooters and other forms of PPTs are treated differently in other countries.  In the UK, they fall under the definition of a motor vehicle, similar to our MPV, and their use is still illegal on all UK roads, cycle lanes and pavements, although they may be used on private property.  Riders found using them in a public place are subject to a &pound;300 fine and six points on their driving licence should they hold one.  Germany has recently taken a different approach.  There they are classified as personal light electric vehicles.  I am afraid I do not know the German for that.  These have recently been provided for by the personal light electric vehicles regulations, introduced on 6 June 2019, which legalised their use.  Users must be aged 14 or over and vehicles must be registered and insured.  There are stringent testing procedures and conditions regarding their use.  Much of this reflects the broad civil law environment where, as a lecturer told me many years ago, anything that is not specifically permitted is forbidden.  Everything is very tightly regulated in these environments.  </p> <p>  Arising from public discussion on the question of providing for legislation to deal with the emergence of PPTs on our roads and footpaths, the Minister, Deputy Ross, requested the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to conduct research into the use of e-scooters in other countries, taking account of the implications for the interaction of such vehicles with other vulnerable road users along with other normal vehicular traffic.  The RSA commissioned Transport Research Laboratories, TRL, of the UK to carry out this research on its behalf.  TRL recommended that if the Minister were minded to provide for their use, the use of such vehicles could be allowed in certain circumstances, with controlled and considered roll-out to mitigate against potential negative safety implications.  The RSA also recommends that a restrictive approach be taken when regulating the use of such vehicles.  I will not recap the details because the RSA will be touching on them in its opening statement.  The RSA also stressed that the suitability of our infrastructure is a critical factor in considering whether to allow the use of these vehicles.</p> <p>  A number of the recommendations in the RSA report raise fairly fundamental legislative and other legal and indeed practical issues.  Clearly, the additional administration required for licensing and so on would have to be funded, presumably by those who wish to avail of these vehicles.  The question then arises as to where such regulation properly should lie - the report refers to both local and national regulation - and of course as to whether any such regulation can be effectively enforced, if at all.  There are other key resource questions to be considered.  These include the implications in terms of additional infrastructure and its cost, and most of all there are a number of opportunity costs to be considered.  These include the potential loss of road space for other sustainable modes, such as public transport, walking and cycling, which are already highly competitive modes in urban areas.  Some Deputies from the Dublin area would, I imagine, note how contentious issues around road space have proved in regard to recent plans for public transport.  Other opportunity costs are the potential diversion of Garda resources to enforce these vehicles from wider enforcement of the law; and of course the general question of which sectors would lose out if additional funding is required.</p> <p>  These issues are to some extent reflected in the views of the National Transport Authority, NTA, which had a look at the issue of e-scooters some time back and took the view that they should not be allowed on our roads.  That view was reached following consideration of a number of key issues, including the question of how the top speed is to be enforced as there are a number of options available to upgrade the vehicle&rsquo;s software that will increase the top speed to nearly 80 km/h or 50 miles per hour for those of us who were taught in what one of my teachers called Christian units.  Other key issues include the suitability of their operation after dark, as the position of lights, particularly the rear lights, on existing models can be too low to be effectively seen by other vehicles sharing the road space; as well as the question of whether the onus will shift to road authorities to provide road surfaces suitable for tiny wheels as such an engineering requirement does not exist at present.  The NTA national cycle manual gives advice for road and street design based on the normal and expected road behaviour of existing road users and does not take account of e-scooters and so on.  This goes back to the issue of conflicting modes.</p><p>Our understanding is that these first came to be used by adults in the context of private firm and university campus environments in the west of the US where, very often, the standard of road surface is very high.  How will claims for compensation following accidents due to road surfaces, not to mind incidents involving other road users, be dealt with?  Given the size of the wheels on these vehicles, the speed at which they can travel and how prone they can be to imperfections in the road surface, including drains, their use could increase the number of claims taken against local authorities, which ultimately will reduce the resources available for road maintenance and improvement.  This is significant given the challenging budgetary situations faced by many local authorities.  These are valid concerns and must be taken into consideration when making decisions about legislating for or regulating these vehicles.  It is not a simple or straightforward matter of just legislating for them.  There are many factors to be considered and road safety is of paramount importance.  </p><p> At an EU level, anecdotal evidence on the high number of accidents is hardening, with many member states calling for technical harmonisation to improve the quality of the vehicles themselves.  As a consequence and recognising that the RSA and TRL, along with most researchers in this area, encountered significant difficulties in carrying out research due to a lack of robust evidence being available at this time, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport initiated a public consultation process which asked whether their use should be legalised.  The consultation process sought to investigate from a purely Irish perspective the conditions under which e-scooters and their like might be legislated for in this country, as well as the fundamental question as to whether the public interest, in terms of resources, public safety and sustainability would be served by legalising them.  The consultation concluded on 1 November and in excess of 500 submissions have been received.  The Department is currently examining those submissions with a view to submitting a comprehensive report to the Minister in early 2020 at the latest, at which time a decision will be made as to whether to amend existing legislation and if so, to what extent it should be amended.  </p><p> I am happy to answer any questions members may have but I will not claim to have hard answers, as noted in my statement.  This is an area in which sound, research based evidence is limited and we must rely on our best analysis of the facts that we do have.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

It relates to an item of correspondence, an email from the private secretary to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport notifying the committee that officials from the Department are available to attend should the joint committee hold a meeting to engage in pre-legislative scrutiny of the toad traffic (miscellaneous provisions) Bill.  While the committee would welcome engagement with departmental officials, it is our view that the Minister should also attend such a meeting because the issue is so important.  I am sure members will agree with me on that point.  While the email does not say that the Minister will not attend, we should make it clear that we believe he must.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms Murdock from the RSA to make her statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112700002#E01300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address this meeting on the issue of e-scooters.  I am accompanied by Ms Sharon Heffernan, senior researcher and Mr. Aidan McGinty, the RSA's vehicle standards engineer who is fast becoming the subject matter expert in the area of micromobility and e-scooters.</p> <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport requested the RSA to research how e-scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly in other EU member states.  A report was submitted by the RSA to the Department for the Minister's consideration.  I will summarise that report including the recommendations made by the RSA at that time.  I have also included some information on recent studies, events and publications for the committee's information. </p> <p>  In January 2019, the RSA commissioned the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, a world leader in transport innovation and research, to review current practice and the safety implications of powered transporters.  Powered transporters were defined as a variety of novel personal transport devices which are mechanically propelled, that is, propelled by a motor, as well as or instead of being manually propelled.  These include devices such as electric scooters, commonly known as e-scooters, segways, hoverboards and powered unicycles.  The aim of this work was to inform considerations for future policy and regulatory framework updates by the RSA regarding the operation of powered transporters in Ireland.  To achieve this, TRL adopted a two-pronged approach, first completing a literature review and then a series of international case studies. </p> <p>  Following a stringent search and selection process, 45 items of literature relating to powered transporters were reviewed.  Although there was a noted lack of robust evidence available for review, the findings of the literature review indicated that policy and legislation should be developed to encourage the use of personal protective equipment such as helmets, when using powered transporters.  This could be completed via a targeted public awareness campaign and by placing responsibility with the powered transporter providers to promote safety.  It also indicated that training be undertaken by operators of powered transporters prior to their use in public, the specification of safety standards for powered transporters, for example, weight or size restrictions, minimum lighting and conspicuity standards, which could possibly be enforced through a type-approval system or certification process, as well as the specification of user requirements such as age limits, licence conditions and how and where the different devices can be used, for example footpaths, cycle paths or roads, and the rules for each of these. </p> <p>  It is important to note, however, that there is currently little evidence on which to base these proposed standards and requirements.  Although direct evidence is lacking, it was clear from the literature reviewed that these devices have potential benefits for active transport, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.  However, anecdotal evidence suggests that e-scooter-related injuries increase with greater e-scooter use.  It was also noted that regardless of legislation and enforcement in relation to powered transporters, in most countries there has been increased uptake by users and as such, an outright ban would not be practical to enforce. </p> <p>  Eleven countries were investigated for the case study portion of this report, including Ireland, the UK, the US, Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Israel.  Summaries were produced for each country in terms of current powered transporter-related legislation, if any, safety standards and policy recommendations, restrictions on usage including minimum age requirements, restrictions to certain roads and the next steps in those jurisdictions.  The findings of these case studies highlighted the difficulties being faced by regulators, policy makers and the public in respect of these devices.  In particular, there is a lack of consistency in how different types of powered transporters are being defined and named.  The same make and model of a device can have different names in different countries.</p><p>This kind of technology is developing at a rapid pace, such that some countries have had to take a reactive approach when developing and revising policy and legislation as usage and the legislative context changes.<br/><br/>On the Road Safety Authority's recommendations, in light of the findings of the report, recommendations were made to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to guide the Minister if he was of a mind to legislate for the introduction of such devices.  The overall recommendation is that a restrictive approach be taken in terms of regulating for these devices in Ireland in the interest of road safety. Specifically, this means applying restrictions to the devices themselves, the operators who provide these, such as the names with which we are familiar already in other jurisdictions, the roads on which they can be used and the age of user.<br/><br/>Specifically, we recommended that consideration be given to the following items.  Electric personal mobility devices, including e-scooters, should be defined in legislation and, as such, any such definition should be sufficiently broad to be future-proof and to take account of legislation and the pace of development in this area of technology.  Consideration could be given to revising the classification of a mechanically propelled vehicle, MPV, or the creation of a new category of electric MPV, an eMPV.  Devices permitted on Irish roads should adhere to minimum safety standards, for example, a maximum speed of 20 km/h.  In addition, design features for devices permitted on Irish roads should prioritise safety features such as brakes, lighting and audible warning mechanisms.  A review of the draft EU standard, CEN, could be considered in this context.  Some jurisdictions allow such devices on footpaths provided they do not exceed a speed of 6 km/h.  However, from a practical perspective this would be very difficult to enforce, therefore, because of the risk these devices would pose to pedestrians if travelling at higher speeds, the recommendation is that they should not be used on footpaths.<br/><br/>There is merit also on safety grounds to limit their use to roads with a speed limit of 50 km/h or less.  Ideally, they should not be allowed travel outside 30 km/h zones.  They could be used in cycle lanes, where available.  A system should be put in place whereby device operators must seek a permit for leasing these devices, either from a national authority or a local authority.  They must adhere to certain guidelines, for example, the safety features of devices and the parking of devices while not in use.  These proposals need to consider congestion and street littering for the granting of a permit.  Each local authority should oversee compliance with these guidelines and mandate training as part of the permit approval process.  They could also limit the number of permits to ensure an over-proliferation of these devices does not occur because we cannot underestimate the volume of them in cities that have permitted them.<br/><br/>In some countries an age restriction applies to the user, depending on the power of the device.  This is a pragmatic approach that should be considered, for example, a minimum age of 16 for use of a device with a maximum speed of 20 km/h.  This does not include, however, making personal protection equipment, PPE, mandatory.  Users should be encouraged to wear helmets and high visibility clothing, as per our recommendation for cyclists.<br/><br/>Rather than regulating for the use of these devices at national level, it may be appropriate for local authorities to pass by-laws to regulate for these as they also have powers to introduce by-laws in terms of speed zones, depending on the suitability of local infrastructure.  Local authorities will need to give consideration to the future-proofing of infrastructure to account for the growth in popularity of these devices.  <br/><br/>Overall, from a safety perspective, it is critical that Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure is fit for purpose to accommodate the safe use of these devices and that dedicated parking spaces are provided or adequate collection measures are implemented, such as the city bikes systems, to avoid a proliferation of hazards on pavements or roads and cycle lanes.  The Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016 - 2035 calls out the inadequacy of the current infrastructure in section 3.2.  Consideration must be given by transport planners to ensure the current infrastructure is enhanced for all vulnerable road users and capable of accommodating electronic personal mobility devices.<br/><br/>Finally, legislation will need to be considered to give An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the necessary powers to enforce the safe and legal use of electric personal mobility devices, and any legislation will have to be enforceable.<br/><br/><b></b>With regard to personal transporters and casualties, from a safety perspective it is widely acknowledged, both nationally and internationally, that there is a lack of data in this area on collisions and injuries resulting from the use of powered transporters.  This is typically due to the difficulties in classifying the various powered transporter devices when they are captured in national collision data.  Definitive statistical information on safety and also mobility patterns, for example, modal shift and the proportion of modes that are being displaced by powered transporter trips, are needed to further inform policy and legislation regarding powered transporter use.  A series of studies referenced in the Transport Research Laboratory, TRL, report on electric personal mobility devices provides snapshots of injury rates from powered transporters.  For example, Kim <i>et al.</i>in 2018 reported that 65 patients were admitted to hospital in Korea between January 2016 to December 2017, while Do <i>et al</i>. in 2016 reported on 35 cases in the Canadian hospitals injury reporting system.  That was between 2015 and 2016.<br/><br/><b></b>There are other recent publications and events.  There was a micromobility conference in Ljubljana, in October.  A recent European Commission conference highlighted the need for renewed planning to ensure road safety as the popularity of these devices continues to grow.  Among the topics the conference participants discussed was the need to integrate micromobility solutions into public transport, such that they can be complementary to one another rather than replacing or displacing it.  Tailored infrastructure to accommodate this will likely be needed, which may be city or jurisdiction-specific.<br/><br/>The need for a minimum technical standard for powered transporters was also discussed, as was the recommendation that different modes of transport be kept separate to minimise potentially dangerous interactions with other road users.  It was suggested that over-regulation be avoided but that a common regulatory framework must be drafted which addresses safety aspects such as speed limitations, guidance for parking, minimum age requirements and technical requirements.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>The European Transport Safety Council, ETSC, PIN Flash report 37, Safer Roads, Safer Cities: how to improve urban road safety in the EU, was published in June 2019.  It examined how best to reduce road traffic collisions that occur on urban roads, the majority of which involve vulnerable road users.  It focuses in part on the safety challenges facing cities and towns across Europe in light of the rapidly changing means that people are using to travel in urban environments.  The need for tailored infrastructure, education and awareness campaigns, and national legislation and city-level regulations to accommodate growing use of shared and personal powered transporters, is highlighted, as is the unfortunate lack of data to further inform policy and legislation regarding their usage.  Given the often restricted space in urban areas for travel, this must be used efficiently to ensure road users are not put at increased risk.<br/><br/>Key recommendations regarding the use of powered transporters, particularly e-scooters, included that traffic regulations on space sharing be defined, for example, whether e-scooters should travel on the pavement, cycle paths or on the roads with motorised traffic, that e-scooter collision data are collected, and that further research on the road safety implications of powered transporters be conducted.</p><p>A report by the International Transport Forum, ITF, in August 2019 considers how new, app-based mobility services, including car-sharing, bike-sharing and e-scooter sharing services, can be effectively regulated to ensure innovative forms of urban mobility deliver their full benefits for society while ensuring the safety of road users.  Based on an ITF round table discussion, this report discusses the various benefits, including cheaper, more comfortable and timely transport options and risks, including safety and security concerns and cluttering public spaces with bicycles, e-scooters and associated vehicles with app-based mobility services.  Among a series of recommendations, the authors propose that the broader urban policy environment is taken into account when designing regulations for app-based mobility services.  Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing congestion, improving air quality and enhancing mobility particularly through the promotion of active travel are of substantial societal benefit and regulatory design for mobility services should account for such factors.  In line with this, it is recommended that suitable infrastructure is invested in to ensure these benefits are maximised while reducing road user risk.</p></speech>

This is an important issue of discussion.  It is future-focused and relates to something we see happening right now on our roads, particularly in our cities.  This exists and is real.  There are many hundreds of e-vehicles, if not thousands, on our roads and it is therefore good that we have a proactive, rather than reactive, approach because it is clear these devices are in use and, therefore, giving them a safe framework within which they should work is a useful exercise.</p> <p>  It is obviously something I am interested in seeing happen and that is why I proposed to the committee that we have this discussion today.  As Ms Murdock said, we can iterate on the experiences of other countries.  Having a head-in-the-sand approach is not beneficial to anybody and we need to put legislation in place.  </p> <p>  As I said, these vehicles exist and have environmental benefits.  They have benefits for public transport and can enhance catchment areas.  We have metros and BusConnects planned and catchment areas can be widened by allowing a service user to complete the first mile to get to the public transport, or the last mile to get from the public transport to their place of work or wherever they wish to go, on an e-scooter or e-bicycle.</p> <p>  My first question is fun and is directed at everybody.  Have any of our guests ever used an electric scooter?  Mr. McGinty has.  How did he find it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.364" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan McGinty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112700002#G00400"><p>I could see the attraction of them.  The perception of speed means that, at 20 km/h, it feels an awful lot faster.  There is an element of feeling a bit vulnerable.  We were testing them in the car park area and were not on live roads.</p></speech>

That is ticking the legal check box, just in case there are garda&iacute; at the gates.  E-scooters are obviously legal in private spaces and I understand that business and university campuses are considering trialling them.  My own local university, Dublin City University, will be commencing a trial of them in the coming weeks.  That is, of course, perfectly legal because they will not be on public roads and, with technology, one can do interesting and exciting things like geo-fencing them whereby one would be unable to take them off the campus even if one so wished.  We await the beginning of that trial with interest.</p> <p>  It is probably more appropriate that Deputy MacSharry asks this, but Mr. O'Leary said in his opening remarks that there is no legislation in this area.  There is, of course, a Fianna F&aacute;il Private Members' Bill on the matter.  Is Mr. O'Leary familiar with that?</p></speech>

My concern is the fact that the same pair of hands that goes through the 500 submissions is the only pair of hands that got a hold of the Bill.  That Bill came back with an instruction to kick it out and that is what the Government did.  That Bill is officially before the House.  What was voted on was that the Bill not be read a Second Time for a period of three months from the day in question.  Mr. O'Leary has been very helpful to me in the past but I feel he has inadvertently exposed the Department's failings and process failings in that this was never going to happen.</p></speech>

Let us dive into that.  E-bicycles are obviously considered legal and road safe by the Department and are, in effect, treated like regular bicycles.  What is the difference between an e-bicycle and an e-scooter?  As Mr. McGinty will testify, in order for me to commence my journey on an e-scooter, I need to manually kick start that scooter into action.  I need to achieve a speed of 5 km/h in order for the electric engine, or motor, to kick in and commence.  Therefore, no journey can be 100% completed by mechanical propulsion.  No matter for how long or how far I continue a journey, only 99.9% of it will be mechanically-propelled.  Where does the figure live?  Where does the number live?  If I am on an electric bicycle, for example, a certain percentage of that journey is mechanically-propelled.  What is the difference between one and the other, where is it set down in law and what led the Department to come to such a definitive conclusion that there is no grey area given that, as far as I am aware, no prosecutions have to date been enforced by a court?</p></speech>

There is also an EU legislative context whereby they fall within recognised categories of mechanically-propelled vehicles which then allow us to make the appropriate provisions in the domestic code.  There are standards and models of vehicular standards at EU level from which we can work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-27a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019112700002#G01700"><p>I think, although I might be mistaken, that Ms Murdock spoke in her contribution about how e-scooters can reach 80 km/h.  That was in one of the contributions, although I cannot remember which.  E-bicycles can achieve the same so I am confused, frankly, at the distinction between the two that has been made to date domestically and the reluctance to group them into a similar category as other countries have done.</p></speech>

As noted in our contribution, and as I said earlier, there are vehicular standards at EU level and international consumer standards for bicycles and e-bicycles.  E-scooters do not have an international standard on the quality of manufacture or their durability.  That is acknowledged by the hardware companies which are trumpeting the fact that they are now providing vehicles that last more than three months; most of the vehicles that have been put on the street have tended to be quite short lasting in life.  There are questions over their durability and environmental and safety standards.</p> <p>  There is also simple physics involved in the safety considerations as highlighted by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  The geometry of, say, the wheel size of a scooter creates a vulnerability that does not exist for somebody using a bicycle or e-bicycle in terms of the impact of road surfaces.  Road surfaces tend to be an area of great interest to bicycle riders.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that we are still trying to get back to the stage where we can fund local authorities in meeting their obligations, where they need support from central Government.  That is not the case for the Dublin authorities.  There is a challenge.  The National Oversight and Audit Commission has highlighted this in respect of local authorities and we do not pretend other than that we are making our way back to a stage where we can maintain the existing infrastructure.  This is our great challenge.  What some of my colleagues call "steady state" or what I would call "asset protection" is one of our great challenges.  In doing that we have a standard already if we are to try to maintain an asset for a much more delicate instrument that has further resource implications.  Often what seems a simple question can lead to other challenging ones if it is thought of in the round.</p></speech>

Safety is a paramount concern.  Given that these vehicles are already in use I feel we are coming at the same thing from different sides to an extent.  Road safety is paramount for me, the Department and the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  These vehicles are in use.  There is somewhat of a reluctance to enforce actions against them.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary does not need to speak on this.  When they go through the city centre, they pass garda&iacute;.  They go down Kildare Street and Merrion Street and they pass garda&iacute; but they are not stopped.  There is no framework of standards because they are all, in the view of the Department and the prosecution, illegal.  Therefore, there is no distinction between someone who is doing 40 km/h on one and someone doing 15 km/h or between someone using the footpath and someone who is not.  By enabling their legalisation and enforcing adherence to a certain framework of standards, we would be in a safer place.</p> <p>  In her statement Ms Murdock said: "Overall, from a safety perspective, it is critical that Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure is fit for purpose to accommodate the safe use of these devices...".  She might just as easily been talking about a bicycle.</p></speech>

It recognised the need, as we did, to improve on that infrastructure.  There is no argument there.</p></speech>

I am glad Ms Murdock agrees because I see the enabling of the use of electric scooters as complementing the safety of cyclists and that of scooter users as well.  It puts an onus, focus and impetus on the idea of developing cycling infrastructure in a cohesive holistic way which to date has not happened.  I do not know if Ms Murdock agrees with that point.  There are many roads in this great city that are sufficiently wide to accommodate a cycle lane, path or track, physically separated from the rest of the road with armadillos as they call them, or the rods we see around the city now.  Merrion Street is an example of that, as are Griffith and Collins Avenues in my constituency.  This could have been done yesterday but they are not being done.  Does Ms Murdock feel that enabling the use of scooters on our roads would put a greater focus on the need for this infrastructure to physically separate people on cycle tracks from the rest of the road and that therefore it might actually improve the safety of our roads?</p></speech>

While the pedelec is a mode of transport covered under road traffic legislation and the machinery legislation, our concern about these devices is that they are not regulated by any standard even if they had been legalised.  In no jurisdiction in Europe are they defined under the machinery Act.  They are coming in from manufacturers in China and other far eastern countries where there is no safety standard for machinery, covering structure, devices, brakes, lights and all of that.  We need to consider that as well.</p></speech>

It is playing catch up in terms of regulating for them with an EU standard.

As good civil servants we of course tell him it will be early 2020.  We hope to be in a position to at least give him some advice certainly by early 2020, possibly beforehand, depending on the various demands on all our time and any other significant information.  We have to keep our ears tuned to what may happen.  Safety is very important.  People are dying using these in many jurisdictions and circumstances and while I would not want to single out any individual case I noted that one of the first fatalities in the United States was a young man from the Chairman's constituency and on behalf of the Department and the Minister we would like to express our condolences to the man's family.  These things happen and we have to consider their context, even if we do not have the depth of evidence to draw scientific conclusions we have to acknowledge what has happened in trying to make the best judgment.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a good point about the challenge of trying to manage competing demands for road space and relieve the pressure on the shared infrastructure for cycling and buses, and the impact of additional demands on the current users.  Last week, the Department was very clear with the NTA that the ideal solution is completely segregated facilities but that requires space, investment and time.  At the moment we, the NTA and the local authorities are trying to manage the challenges around road space.  It is much the same as the money end of things, if we do not have enough we try to make the best use of what we have, accepting that it will always fall short of the ideal.</p></speech>

What happened to the individual from the Chairman's constituency is very regrettable.  Unfortunately, it is a sad reality and fact of life, no matter the mode of transport there are accidents.  This meeting is to tease out and investigate the issues around this mode of transport and to learn from other countries.  Mistakes have been made.  Paris is cited as one of the worst places in that regard, where they are unregulated and unlicensed.  It is a complete mess.  We can learn from that and build out something that negates some of the congestion difficulties Mr. O'Leary mentioned.  It could be a net positive if we see it in that way and do not take a head in the sand approach.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement today.  </p></speech>

It is a literature review so anybody with access to any university library and Google could have written it.  I am not saying it as a criticism of the witnesses in particular but this is the culture we have in the public service.  There is a significant deficit in terms of being prepared to make a decision and back oneself and one's own capabilities and research.  There is nothing in the report that was not already in the public domain.  Deputy Rock and I enjoy beating each other up on political issues.  A figure of &euro;30,000 might not do very much but I am sure it could fill a hole in some aspect of some Department.  That approach is being replicated in every State agency under the aegis of the Department week to week, month to month and year to year.</p></speech>

Obviously, we had to do the research in a short period.  We do not have those kind of academic experts to hand in house.  We have Ms Heffernan, who is our senior researcher, and one or two other people with a very full diary of commitments in other areas of research such as cycling and road safety.  TRL is the global expert in innovative transport modes and collision analysis and data so it is the go-to body to get independent research because not everything that the RSA produces sits well with people who will say something is not independent because the RSA did it.  It is important that we conduct independent research produced by experts who are respected in that area internationally, and it was not that much.</p></speech>

TRL set out what happens in the US and Belgium, the case studies, the 40 pieces of literature it reviewed and its recommendations.  I do not think there is anything in the recommendations that was not in my Bill and I only read this in recent days.  Ironically, TRL was set up to be the road safety authority in the UK in 1933.  It is famous for the bouncing bomb and the Disney bomb and for developing armour in World War II.  I know it is a big consultancy firm and that it was privatised in 1996.  I also know that was done so it could get funding from the private sector and that it is controlled and operated by 80 sectoral people.  My view on the report is that there is nothing in it that we could not have done ourselves.  Far from it being an RSA or departmental problem, it is a national culture where we throw good money after bad for fear of having to make a decision and the need for plausible deniability whereby we can say that independent research said something and that, therefore, a certain course of action should be taken.  I am cut from the type of cloth where I prefer to back myself.  Give me the advice and I will make the decision, get on with it and save as much money as I can.  Rant over, but I think it is a valid point.</p></speech>

The remit of the RSA involves conducting research into any policy decision we will recommend to Government and we did not have that research.  This is such a new topic that other jurisdictions are playing catch-up.  We do not have any evidence other than what we conducted during that report.  Time is of the essence.  We must come back to the Oireachtas with information that will help formulate policy.  We would not have been able to do that on our own.</p></speech>

One is where there is a particular level of technical or research expertise that it would not be in the taxpayers' interest to have permanently on the books of a particular authority but that is needed for a particular task while the other is where a particular task needs to be done quickly and a concentrated investment of human resources is required that, again, would not be justified as a permanent fixture.  I am sure members of this committee would be the first to criticise us if people were sitting around twiddling their thumbs for nine months of the year doing a three-month report.  If I might make a slightly personal comment, when I worked in the tourism sector, I took great personal pride in the fact that we managed to produce a tourism policy report in respect of which the only expenditure was on tea and coffee at the regional consultations.  I made sure we did not spend a penny on a consultant.  I always feel that this was a personal achievement that I try to bring to bear as much as I can in my job.  I cannot speak for the entire public sector but we bear in mind that there are always better things to use our money on than our own work.</p></speech>

The next time the RSA is throwing around &euro;30,000 and wants a report like that, it should give me a call because I, and many people like me, would happily pull it together for that kind of wage.  Regarding the opening statement, it is a case of 20 lashes for whoever drafted it.  No legislation is proposed at this time.  It was not just produced.  Regarding its template, it involves everything in that report and everything Deputy Rock had come up and it is still there.  As I understand it, it is to re-emerge on 31 January.  It is suggestive of the fact that nobody really looked at this.  We are here today to talk about e-scooters and Deputy Rock had to tell the witnesses that there is legislation.  The statement said that we do not have legislation.  "We" are the Oireachtas, not the Department and not the Government for that matter.</p></speech>

We should bear in mind the transmission of views from the RSA's consultants, who are drawing on international experience.  I am referring to the question of what legislation would be entailed.  The Deputy will have had this experience with his.  It would be a matter of creating an environment for regulating the items and then a matter of regulating their use.  One could have a system whereby the items come under some sort of regulation, with or without a recognised standard.  Their use, and particularly where they can be used, could then be provided for, subject to a permissive by-law regime.  We would have to sit down, scope this out, work with our colleagues in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consult our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  As the Deputy knows, the road traffic law code pertains to a mix of areas that are regulated nationally and at by-law level.  By-laws cover parking and one-way streets, for example.  Certainly, it is possible to have a mix of national and local regulations.  The other option would not be a common manoeuvre in the Irish context.  It would involve some kind of private legislation for a particular area.  In a sense, it would still end up with the same generic questions in terms of the vehicles themselves and so on.  I would not rule it out.  I am always slow to rule out an option until I have had a chance to draw out how it could work and its implications.  That is as much as I can say at this stage.  The aspect under discussion was a more surprising aspect of the conclusions but I believe it would be seen in the context of either the scope for a pilot or another context.  It relates to an earlier point we were making.  Not only is there the matter of how the user uses the vehicle but also the matters of the basic mechanical standards that need to be met and the safety fittings required.  Then the question arises as to what constitutes the best use of the road space that the vehicle might occupy.  Generally, the regulation of road space is led by local authorities.  There is, in a sense, a road-space aspect to this that might best be addressed at local authority level.  Equally, however, we do not want to put an excessive burden on local authorities.  It is a matter of striking a balance.  As ever, we are always trying to strike balances, accepting that we never come up with the perfect answer.</p></speech>

This has totally to do with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not relevant here but there is a link with enforcement given that many fines are road traffic fines.  The service is down by 38%, according its own figures.  Approximately &euro;27 million is outstanding.  There are in the region of 90,000 related court cases backed up.  We were trying to get our head around this at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and we were asking how it could be.  It is not the fault of the Garda.  It is doing its job and the GoSafe vans are engaging in enforcement at the required level.  The issue, however, is with the Fines Act.  The Act was to ensure somebody who could not pay a &euro;50 fine because he or she did not have the means would not go to jail and would instead be able to do community service.  The Department of Justice and Equality was advised the measures could not be implemented.  In the meantime, there is the unintended consequence of a huge drop in enforcement.  Can the delegates help this committee in any way in this regard?  Clearly, we know we need to take the matter up with the Department of Justice and Equality and its Minister.  Is there any assistance the delegates could give us while they are here today?  If they cannot answer, that is 100% acceptable.  I wanted to mention this while the delegates were here because the matter is in the media.</p></speech>

It is like match boxes.  The report does not even tell us whether they should be used, and have access to footpaths, bicycle lanes or even roadways.  We have no idea what way we are going forward with it and who will win the argument.</p> <p>  As for the good and bad scooters, down the road who will determine a roadworthy e-scooter?  We are miles off it, from what I can gather, and yet we can bring in other legislation the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport wants, such as to amend the Road Traffic Act, and that seems to be pushed through quickly.  The e-scooter issue did not arise this year.  It has been on the agenda in the past couple of years.

For clarity, a mechanically-propelled vehicle must be taxed, insured and have passed an NCT.  That is why it is a black-and-white issue.  They are not legal on the roads.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Keeffe talked about Google and the TRL report.  If people google these devices, they will find some outlets and suppliers reassuring the public that they are legal and that they have been approved.  That is why we needed a quality report to inform us of what is legal in each country and where we should go.</p> <p>  The purpose of the TRL report was not to give us a recommendation on what way they can be used.  It was to assess what was happening in all of the other European jurisdictions and other countries further afield so that we could inform our own decision-making.  We were not asking TRL to come back and make a recommendation as to how to implement them.  That was only to tell us what other jurisdictions were doing.</p> <p>  It takes time.  There are little data on injuries and deaths on these because they are so new on our roads.  I do not accept that these were around for a long time.  We have very little information, especially in this country, on injuries.  Thankfully, there are infrequent occurrences of serious injury and death in our near neighbours as well because they are not legal and they are not out there.  The downside of not having them out there is that we do not have good research.  That is the reality of it.</p></speech>

At one time, garda&iacute; were able to use their discretion in common sense cases.  Now, when a garda leaves the barracks, he or she is subject to mandatory checkpoint sign-off by the sergeant in charge.  If those garda&iacute; put up a standard checkpoint on St. Stephen's Green to stop everyone, when scooters approach them, do they just look left and then pass by?  What happens if, down the road, a girl coming out of school has an accident?  Has the garda failed in his or her duty there?</p></speech>

That will inform the debate.  We also want to know the outcomes of the court cases.  Obviously, we do not want to know not the personal details, but the outcomes.  I refer to the generic detail.</p> <p>  I was lucky enough to visit Paris during August where e-scooters were ubiquitous.  In fact, they were on the footpaths.  They were coming at me in open spaces.  Everywhere I went, I was at risk.  No matter where I went, they were dumped on the side of the street outside shops.  They were abandoned at traffic lights and there was chaos.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the importance of the issue, whatever we do, we must be organised in terms of where they can and cannot go and provide the dedicated lanes. I would be most concerned about safety, particularly that of pedestrians because they may not expect e-scooters to come out of the blue.</p> <p>  Can we see the medical evidence in the statistics published by the health authorities in Paris or wherever?.  I am not picking on Paris; I happened to visit there.  I am sure there are many significant accidents.</p></speech>

The quantum that is there, and even the time periods that they came along, has meant that what one might call academic research is not available.  I have seen press coverage of critical comments from medical professionals in Paris about the availability of e-scooters and their impact on the French equivalent of emergency departments in terms of injuries.</p> <p>  I was here last week to discuss issues relating to cycling and road safety.  The hardest part is trying to manage the conflicts between different classes of users.  In a sense e-scooter users are somewhat in the same bracket as cyclists but they are also different.  On the one hand, they are vulnerable road users with respect to somebody in a larger mechanically propelled vehicle such as a motorbike, car, van, truck or bus in terms of the spaces those vehicles use but, on the other, they are potentially hazardous vehicles, whether stationary or moving in respect to particularly what one might call - this is not a technical term - the highly vulnerable user, including the person with a disability or mobility issues.  We need to be incredibly conscious of those users.</p> <p>  We were recently preparing a response to a parliamentary question from a Deputy and we did not have the detailed information to provide on how many people with disabilities are among those killed.  As I said last week, we try to think about a hierarchy in road safety, from the most vulnerable to the least.  In that context, we are looking at how best to manage the arrival of this new form of mobility, as are all our international colleagues.</p></speech>

There is little evidence at the moment regarding injuries sustained in collisions involving e-scooters, but recently two research studies were published.  Austin Public Health published a joint epidemiological study with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US.  The sample was small comprising 192 people who were injured in collisions while they were using an e-scooter.  However, there are findings on the types of injuries.  For instance, 48% of these people received head injuries, 35% sustained a bone fracture and almost half had some kind of severe injury.  They were interviewed and were asked for their view of what happened at the time of the collision.  Some 37% said that excessive scooter speed, for instance, may have contributed to the collision and 19% said they believed the scooter malfunctioned.  This is just a small example of the type of evidence that is likely to come out over the next year to two years on these.</p></speech>

Within six months, earlier this year, they had to introduce further legislation to ensure that the cluttering of footpaths was reversed.  They introduced very severe penalties of up to &euro;5,000 for the littering of footpaths with these vehicles.  They had a scheme where the public were paid to take the scooters home to charge them and then return them.  We can learn many lessons to help us get it right if we are going to legislate for them.</p></speech>

I had mentioned Paris in my contribution.  It is a particularly egregious example.  It is probably regarded as worst in class for implementing a scooter scheme.  I notice Ms Murdoch nodding in agreement.  Anyone looking at the international comparisons would recommend against doing it that way.  Paris allowed every operator to operate freely with nine or ten rental companies competing with each other.  Every recommendation I have read was to avoid doing it like Paris.  That is an opportunity for us because it is iterative learning that we should take everything Paris did and not do that.  Please God the Chairman will go back to Paris soon.</p><p>I am sure he has an anniversary or something coming up.  He will then see a far improved scooter regime. </p></speech>

It is a technical question to which the witnesses might not have an answer, but I ask them to revert on it.   Are there plans to consolidate road traffic legislation?  It is challenging to draft a Bill when the legislation is unconsolidated.  It makes it quite difficult for one individual to draft legislation.  The Law Society recommended consolidation in 2017.  Has the Minister advanced plans in that regard?</p></speech>

Clearly, it makes the lives of professionals dealing with the law much easier if the law code concerned is consolidated.  That might reflect the views of certain organisations.  We are not aware of any specific cases where the lack of consolidation caused prosecutions to fall.  We have looked at a few instances where similarly lengthy and complex law codes have been consolidated.  There are only two proper examples to date, namely the Companies Act and the Finance Act, both of which have limited criminal elements.  I forget the technical term for that kind of comprehensive consolidation.  Whoever lectured me in law more years ago than I care to remember would give me a slap.</p> <p>  There are two kinds of consolidation.  One involves putting the words together and the other involves tightening up legislation without changing the substance.  Both the cases I mentioned used comprehensive consolidation, where the code was put together and some amendments were made to pull it together wherever there were existing inconsistencies or imperfections.  Given the scale of the road traffic law code and the investment of time required for any consolidation, that would be the best option in this case.  Based on those two examples - and this is where the challenges come in - it is probably a job for a dedicated team of half a dozen people with appropriate expertise who would almost have to be locked in a room for four or five years.

It is one of the things we would like to do, but we are also dealing with emerging technologies such as personal powered transport, issues around autonomous vehicles and unexpected international events such as Brexit.  Our legislative efforts are focused on responding to the fact that we are not meeting our road death targets, and we are, therefore, trying to strengthen the code on killing behaviours like intoxicants and speeding.  Given the resources we have, our legislative efforts have prioritised those areas.  I recently had a very informal discussion with some colleagues about this matter.  I am not making a commitment to the committee, but trying to show that this is something we think about.  We have been considering what do in the short term, not just tomorrow.  To start, we will probably need to think about getting somebody in to do some kind of project plan on this, if Deputy MacSharry will permit that.  It is worth noting that we have consolidated in previous iterations of the road traffic law.  For example, the drink driving code is consolidated, bar the most recent amendments.  There are elements where that has happened.  If one were to do a project plan for this, one would first take a part of the code and consolidate that.  There are models where it might be consolidated in phases as well as one big block.  There is a political bullet to bite in terms of the Oireachtas, Ministers and our own capacity to divert our resources to manage that.  It has not caused any identifiable damage to the law's enforcement, but it does make it more time consuming for all parties involved.</p></speech>

Following an RT&Eacute; programme a few years ago, I did not see the Minister or any departmental officials contradicting the comments made on television regarding violent car crashes that may have involved serious drink-driving.  I did not hear officials saying the Road Traffic Act was solid enough.  To this day, I get complaints from people saying that if the existing Act was enforced, we would not need the draconian laws brought in over the past 12 months.  All we needed was for the previous Act to be properly applied and enforced.  The consolidation Deputy Rock mentioned would have helped as well.  There is a perception that, no matter what provisions are included in the Road Traffic Act, there are ways and means of getting around them.  The number of cases being challenged in court also has to be acknowledged.  Bringing in more amendments is not going to get rid of that cohort of people.</p></speech>

We have had some initial conversations because if we start, for example, affecting the definition of mechanical vehicle, there will be knock-on effects.  I hate to say it but an awful lot of consolidation would be needed afterwards as it crops up in many places across the system.  We have had initial conversations about what might be implied but we have not gone into the details because before working on what our input would be, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what we would consider a desirable outcome.  We will look at the proposed legislation from Fianna F&aacute;il, as well as what elements are needed and whether this might be taken forward, with the necessary updates and amendments.</p><p>We would start with the high-level policy stance and then work down, in terms of what is both appropriate and workable, bearing in mind the overriding objective of road safety.  </p><p> I noted in conversations on this issue that a colleague advised me, because sometimes this issue is raised in the context of innovation, there is hardly another country in Europe that is more innovative in transport than the Netherlands.  It has consistently been one of the leaders in intelligent transport systems and connected, autonomous and shared mobility.  The authorities in that country have, following some tragic incidents, a very clear stance that safety must never be put at risk for the sake of innovation.  If that is the Dutch line, it is not a bad line to be adopted by the Irish authorities.  I am always a great believer in looking outside the Anglophone world.  For example, all too often we tend to look to those who share the same language even if it sometimes takes more work to look at the others. </p></speech>

Nevertheless, that approach has resulted in fatalities and tragic accidents, one of which was recently prominently featured in the media.  Perhaps the UK's head-in-the-sand approach is not necessarily what is required here.</p> <p>  There is a political imperative and I appreciate that the legislation is not the concern of Mr. O'Leary.  As Fianna F&aacute;il's legislation was parked for three months, it will be revisited early in the new year.  This is the genesis of my question as to whether the Minister has plans with regard to legislation or whether he simply intends to amend Fianna F&aacute;il's legislation.  However, I appreciate the answers given by Mr. O'Leary and where he is coming from.</p> <p>  The report is very good and useful, and I was sorry to hear the criticisms.  I do not know who could write a report on his or her lunchbreak.  If Deputy MacSharry was here, I would have to query how long his lunch break would be.  The report is 42 pages long, which is a tremendous lunch break and I could barely read it on my lunch break.  It is beneficial that the report went outside of the Anglophone world, as was said by Mr. O'Leary.  To use a word that I do not want to use again, it is a very good "consolidation" of a number of other reports that I had read elsewhere.  This report is a great one-stop-shop for educating people on this issue because it can be a little diffuse, and one cannot ask Members to read 11 different reports about a topic.  It will serve a tremendous use and, hopefully, will inform our debate in the months ahead and I have no doubt that it will come before us again.  </p> <p>  I have a question for both organisations on the taxing and insuring of this vehicle.  It is impossible to tax an electric scooter because it does not have a vehicle registration number and, therefore, it is impossible to tax.</p></speech>

I warn people, especially in the run-up to Christmas, that it is a case of buyer beware because there have been significant recalls of the devices that were on sale.  There is nothing to stop someone legally selling a device but buyers should realise that these devices are not CE regulated and there is no standard safety directive to say that they have been approved from a mechanical perspective.  We have analysed the types of failures, faults and, as Ms Heffernan alluded to, 20% of the injuries resulted from defective devices.  Even by their design, and these devices have a long stalk of a handlebar and a short wheelbase, they are prone to natural forces and torts and thus will break easily.  The brakes are not of a recognised standard plus the makers do not specify any kind of conspicuity of lighting.  All of that is a warning to buyers.  I do not know if there are any warranties on the devices.  They just give up the ghost shortly after being bought.  I urge buyers to be wary of them.</p></speech>

One could be in a public place without being on a public road.  Anywhere that the public has more or less free access to by right, or by permission, is a public place.  That puts an onus on some campus environments in the Irish legal context.  The Chairman made a good point.  That is why the Minister made a statement at the time of the RSA consultation to remind people that the use of these devices was not legal, notwithstanding what those who were trying to sell them were saying.</p></speech>

Clearly, there are concerns from a user's point of view.  Individuals and entities trying to take advantage of that in a narrow window while authorities figure out how to react and develop suitable standards.</p> <p>  Anecdotally, I was advised by one of my colleagues in the Department, but one of the commercial bodies under our aegis, apparently, considered these devices for in-campus movement.  The senior manager decided to demonstrate it to his colleagues and proceeded to find himself with several fractures.  The organisation involved is not proceeding with using the device on-campus. </p></speech>

Has either of the organisations researched how many accidents involving this mode of transport take place per 1,000 km travelled in comparison with other modes of transport?  We all appreciate that accidents occur.  Are there fewer or more accidents in this instance?</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p><p><b>Mr. Ray O'Leary:</b>Again, currently if it is a mechanically propelled vehicle, it requires tax and insurance.  It is not a question of a certain class of vehicle that is illegal; it is the use of vehicles in the absence of these and in the absence of clear standards. </p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners, in registering vehicles, have regard to certain categories they have for registration in respect of the vehicle registration tax, VRT.  Revenue refers to categories of vehicle that are largely set at an EU level with some national variations and they, in turn, are related to the motor tax levied on them.</p><p>As they have not gone through the kinds of processes that, for example, mopeds, motorbikes, cars, vans, trucks and buses have to go through before they are released onto the market, we are handicapped in trying to bring them within the regulated environment.</p></speech>
