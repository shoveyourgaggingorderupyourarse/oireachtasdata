    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D.J. Histon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#E00100"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee for inviting me here today on behalf of the Irish Coursing Club as a follow-up to a presentation delivered on 9 July on issues concerning the greyhound industry in Ireland.  I propose to deal with traceability, prohibited substances testing, and illegal hunting as part of the follow-up as requested.<br/><br/>On the traceability model, the committee is aware that the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has commenced a tender process to secure a full IT-supported traceability system with a closing date of 18 December.  The Irish Coursing Club, ICC, met the IGB since our attendance before the committee last July and attended the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's traceability facility in Clonakilty to receive a comprehensive review of that system.  There are differences between the objectives and requirements of both the cattle and greyhound systems, but there are lessons that can be applied from the former.  The cattle tracking system was developed with disease prevention and management as the main driver with limited movement of animals during its life cycle.  The greyhound system is concerned with full knowledge as to location and status of any individual greyhound in an environment where there is significant movement during its life cycle.<br/><br/>The specification of the traceability model is all-encompassing and robust in tracking every life event of a greyhound and will require significant input from participants and management from regulators.  The ICC is committed to supporting the IGB traceability model and has significant capability to offer to ensure the industry as a whole provides an appropriate solution to the knowledge gap that prevails, which must be remedied.  As the committee is aware, the ICC operates the Irish greyhound stud book on an all-Ireland basis and has developed strong information links with the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, which will assist in supporting the traceability model.<br/><br/>The ICC stud book records pedigrees, matings and transfer of ownership and has never purported to be a traceability system.  The ICC has significant information available to it as it records all matings, births, namings, transfers of ownership and issues identity cards for all thoroughbred greyhounds on the island of Ireland.  Currently, all litters are inspected, tattooed and microchipped via ICC control stewards who also act as authorised welfare officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  The ICC issues greyhound breeding establishment licences as per the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  The information required for a functioning traceability system is paramount, and as the tender process concludes, the ICC will provide support and expertise to ensure the systems are effective in delivering the desired outcomes.  The ICC considers the inclusion of Northern Ireland as necessary for traceability, given movement of greyhounds between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and this comes under our remit.<br/><br/>The ICC has enhanced its prohibited substance testing regime over recent years following a complete review of all processes, sanctions and scope.  The cases are pleaded before an independent hearing committee and adjudicated upon by an administrative body that is subject to judicial review.  While not a court of law it is required to act lawfully.  Its members include a solicitor, veterinary surgeon and one other and all decisions are subject to appeal.  The sanctions available to the independent hearing committee include financial penalties with a maximum permissible fine of &euro;13,000 and exclusion orders.  In the 2018 to 2019 season, a total of 149 tests took place and 98% reported negative.  Of the three cases that proved positive, the greyhounds were suspended in each case for a period of six months during a coursing season and fines of &euro;4,000 were levied on responsible persons, with one outstanding case due to be heard in January 2020.  The purpose of testing and the associated penalties is to protect the welfare of the greyhound, to protect the integrity of coursing, to maintain public confidence in coursing, to maintain proper standards for all coursing participants, and to bring about a positive behavioural change.  A sanction may be accompanied by an advisory notice to point out what changes in behaviour or attitude are required.  The ICC operates a code of practice for the hare and the greyhound, and this is supported by the code of practice that operates under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  As with any code, it is the heightened standard the industry expects of participants while observing the legal statutory provisions as per the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the rules of the ICC.<br/><br/>On illegal hunting, at the previous committee meeting of 9 July, there was Whiddy Island footage portrayed as illegal on the &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme and coloured with footage from some third-party event.  This matter is the subject of legal correspondence and therefore I do not propose to comment on it today.  Illegal hunting is ongoing throughout the country and is very easily identifiable from a layman's perspective.  The perpetrators typically travel in gangs with unmuzzled dogs.  They enter lands uninsured without landowner permission, with the intent of killing the hare or multiple hares at any time of the year.  They use this opportunity to conduct criminal acts such as theft, trespass and assault.  The Garda, National Parks and Wildlife Service, and interested parties such as the IFA and the ICC are working diligently on this issue.  Coursing clubs provide support with intelligence and monitoring of hare habitat.  There have been a number of convictions recently by the authorities.<br/><br/>On rehoming, the ICC provides administrative support to the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, IRGT, and other homing agencies by way of transfer of ownerships and microchip cert reissuance free of charge.  We deal with numerous queries relating to rehoming and ensure all matters are dealt with in a professional manner.  The Irish Retired Greyhound Trust has homed coursing greyhounds and the ICC met the committee of the IRGT recently to discuss how the ICC can contribute on a more formal basis by identifying new homing opportunities and providing financial support.  It is unrealistic and inefficient to establish a separate trust and structure to home coursing greyhounds versus track greyhounds solely given the high level of crossover of people who partake in both codes.  A new feature will be to note when a greyhound is homed on the registration system, so it will be evident when a greyhound is homed.  The ICC has established a sub-committee to progress welfare and proposes funding measures to include prize money deductions, fundraising events, sponsorship and legacies to assist the IRGT in its work.  All the foregoing is to be further agreed with the IRGT.  Given the staggered start and restricted meetings this season due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD2, virus surveillance and monitoring, it was not possible to introduce the prize money deduction initiative this season, but a fundraiser will take place at the national meeting in 2020 to support homing initiatives, and such events will become an annual feature.<br/><br/>The ICC recognises the importance of a working traceability system with all responsible parties playing their part to ensure the industry can withstand scrutiny from any quarter regardless of agenda.  The IGB has released the Indecon report, which has had significant implications for the overall industry, in particular the proposed closure of four tracks.  These changes will contract both the number of participants and breeders overall in the industry, and the long-term implications of this strategy require comprehensive analysis by both codes and stakeholders when settling the detail of an overall industry welfare strategy.  The ICC will always do what is required to ensure the future of the industry, although we do not have a statutory role <i>per se</i>or receive State funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Histon for his progress report.  There is a line about maintaining public confidence in coursing.  That is the job that the ICC has to do.  I see that 98% of the tests were negative but 2% were positive.  There is a substantial fine, considering that the prize money for coursing is at a low level.  I suggest that when people who definitely transgress and then have a second transgression for doping, the trainer or owner of the dog in question should also be suspended.  There is no mention of that happening in Mr. Histon's report.  At the end of the day, the person responsible for the dog has doped it.  There can be no tolerance of that in the industry going forward.  I fully respect that the ICC is very serious about doping and ensuring that no doping is happening in the industry.  If doping is found to have happened, both the dog and the person responsible for it should receive a suspension.</p> <p>  On revenue for the rehoming of dogs, the IGB was here a couple of weeks ago.  It was taking a percentage of gate receipts, of the tote takings and from the restaurant.  I fully accept that coursing is a completely different industry, held in the open.  There are definitely no restaurants in coursing fields.  Mr. Histon said that because of the delay in the start this year, there is no deduction from the prize money.</p><p>I see the ICC is proposing a collection at the national coursing meeting.  I respectfully suggest that the national coursing meeting is extremely well attended and there are extremely large crowds, so it would definitely be worthwhile putting a surcharge on the admission.  When coursing was under threat this year due to the virus that was present in the rabbit population, the worth of the meeting to the town of Clonmel was well quoted.  It is worth &euro;12 million to &euro;15 million to Clonmel.  I propose placing a surcharge on admissions to the national coursing meeting so that a reasonable amount of money could be contributed by the ICC to the IGB's efforts for the rehoming of dogs.  I accept that there is duplication and while duplication of rehoming of dogs is definitely not the way to go, looking after dogs after their racing lives is expensive.  The ICC has to show that it is contributing as much as it can to ensure that we can show the public at large that greyhounds are being looked after throughout their lives when they are finished racing.</p><p> Illegal hunting is a serious problem in my part of the country.  While I know there are some prosecutions under way, it is not nearly enough.  The hare population is being threatened by it.  We see pictures of ten and 12 hares being held up after being killed on a single day with these lurchers hunting across the countryside.  It is a problem given the closure of Garda stations, although we are not going start arguing about that here.  The fact is that it happens in rural areas and the nearest squad car can be a long way away when people report that there is a gang in their locality.  Even aside from the number of hares that are being killed, people feel very vulnerable with these gangs roaming the countryside.  There definitely has to be a lot more focus on it.  Garda resources are an issue and there are even problems in that the garda&iacute; cannot seize the dogs.  They have to have a dog warden with them to seize the dogs if they catch them, so it needs to be co-ordinated.  We have looked for the Department to come in to us on animal welfare.  This issue has to be stamped out.  Everyone likes to have the hare in its natural environment in the countryside but if a gang comes in with eight or ten lurchers, the hares have no chance.  That illegal hunting is intolerable.  We have to put more resources into ensuring that it is stamped out completely.  </p><p> I welcome the progress report and fully accept that the ICC recognises that we have to restore public confidence in the sport.  Getting financial resources behind welfare is key.  There is a captive crowd in Clonmel and I would respectfully suggest that use should be made of it to ensure that there is a reasonable fund to achieve our objectives as regards welfare.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Histon explain what way that works at the moment, what is in place and what the ICC intends doing?  I can see the logic in it and that a traceability regime would not work if it simply stopped at a stream, bridge or ditch.</p> <p>  If I could comment on the seizure of the 12 greyhounds at Dublin Port, they were all registered with the Irish Greyhound Stud and apparently some of them had been racing.  Obviously that is of great concern.  While there may be issues in terms of the programme that was shown on RT&Eacute; some months ago, nobody would dispute that there are serious animal welfare issues in the industry.  Coursing is fairly strong in my part of the country, and I hope that the coursing clubs would be vigilant and play their part in turning things around for the welfare of dogs and animals.</p></speech>

Figures were provided at that meeting on the number of dogs that died at IGB events.  Does Mr. Histon have figures on the number of dogs dying at coursing events?  Does that happen?  I note there is some correspondence between the ICC and the Department on hares that died through the coursing events.  Are there any figures on deaths of dogs?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D.J. Histon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#F00500"><p>The first issue Deputy Cahill raised was testing.  He indicated he would like to see greater sanctions against the owner, trainer or responsible person.  As I intimated in my submission, it is an independent committee that delivers the sanctions.  A wide array of sanctions is available to the committee, including exclusion orders against the individuals in question.  Where we differ from other jurisdictions is that we suspend the greyhound immediately once the dog has tested positive.  Pending a hearing, we suspend the dog immediately with a maximum period of six months in a coursing season.  We have recently changed the rule for this season that in the event of a greyhound being found in breach of rule 88, it is not entitled to run in any further classic event.  This limits the dog's competing ability so it is a fairly serious sanction.  For a repeat offender, the fines are automatically ramped up and exclusion orders are available for the committee to invoke.  We are independent of that so we do not issue the sanctions.  We will certainly take on board the Deputy's point.  I agree that we do not want people in the industry who are going to breach the rules and bring the sport into disrepute.</p> <p>  In terms of revenue and support to the retired greyhound trust, IRGT, as I said we currently provide a significant amount of administrative work which is quite time consuming.  It is all very necessary and we are very happy to do it.  As the Deputy said, we do not have the luxury of restaurants or other such facilities, unfortunately.  From the prize money end, on a rough count it would come to about &euro;900,000 in the round each year for all coursing meetings and all events at every coursing meeting.  We would be looking at a 5% contribution from that.  The Deputy is correct that the national meeting is certainly a good vehicle for fundraising given the large numbers who attend.  We will certainly take on board his suggestion about a levy on the admission charge or some other way that would make a meaningful contribution to the IRGT, which does great work.  I was involved with many of the welfare bodies in my previous role and have a good relationship with them.</p><p>There is no point in us all trying to fight for the same space.  We should work together to increase the number of homes available for all greyhounds, be they coursing or track dogs.</p><p> Illegal hunting will always be an issue.  It is very difficult to police because it can happen any time of the day or night anywhere in the country.  As we know, the resources of the Garda and National Parks and Wildlife Service are limited.  We held a joint meeting with the Irish Farmers Association, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the ISPCA, the PSNI and the NPWS.  It was a very good meeting because we all set out our stalls with regard to how illegal hunting impacts on the various bodies and the best way to combat it.  The PSNI gave an outline of Operation Lepus, which was how the authorities in the North tried to tackle illegal hunting.  Good information was shared.  The superintendent in Swords gave a good outline of how the Garda in the area has tackled the issue.  The superintendent in Kildare is also very focused on this issue and has brought a number of prosecutions.  The NPWS has established a memorandum of understanding with the ISPCA, as the Deputy mentioned.  Seizing the dogs is a difficulty.  The problem is that dogs that are seized must be held and the court case can take a long time.  To all intents and purposes, the dogs would probably be given back to the owners after the court case but there is an expense involved in keeping and maintaining the dogs during that time.  There is no easy solution to the problem.</p><p> Deputy Stanley asked how we include Northern Ireland.  The stud book we operate includes Northern Ireland, so it includes all thoroughbred greyhounds on the island.  We also regulate the greyhound tracks.  There are two greyhound tracks in the North that sit outside the IGB remit.  As a semi-State body, the IGB's reach does not go beyond the Border, as the Deputy said.  From that perspective, all the greyhounds are in the same system.  They are in the stud book and in the race management system operated by the IGB.  If a dog races in Northern Ireland, it is automatically on the IGB system.  At all times, therefore, information is available on dogs' performances.  Typically, a greyhound that races in Drumbo Park near Belfast would also race in Dundalk or Shelbourne Park and a dog that races in Derry would race in Lifford or another track in the west on this side of the Border.  That crossover occurs naturally in any case.</p></speech>

If a person holds four or more brood bitches, he or she must hold a greyhound breeding establishment licence.  We issue that licence.</p> <p>  I was also asked about the seizure of 12 greyhounds over the weekend by Revenue's customs officials.  The controls in place worked because the shipment or transport did not take place and was caught where it should be caught, namely, at the port.  The case is being investigated by the IGB and, I am sure, the Department.  A number of issues arise related to the transport authorisation that is required under the EU transport regulations and the requirement to have Balai certificates and pet passports.  There may also be issues under the Animal Health and Welfare Act  and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act.  There are a number of Acts in play that may or may not impact on this particular transport.</p></speech>

Some of the 12 greyhounds in the recent case had been used in racing.  If the industry is well regulated, it is a matter of concern that some of the people involved in the sector, be it in coursing or track racing, which falls under the remit of the Irish Greyhound Board, decided to move these dogs outside the country or on to a third party to have them moved out of the country.  What can the ICC do to curtail or stop this practice?</p></speech>

We do not know the full detail of this case involving 12 greyhounds.  We do not know what the owner's intentions were so I cannot comment on the case.</p> <p>  With regard to what the ICC and the industry can do about the issue, we could look to Australia for example.  Greyhounds Australasia covers all greyhound territories in Australia and New Zealand.  The organisation set up an export passport programme, which does not have statutory effect in that it is not federal law in Australia.  It obligates an owner to complete a greyhound export form that outlines where the dog is to be sent, where it will reside and the purpose of the sale.  Greyhounds Australasia did a review  of every country to which Australian greyhounds were being exported and examined the welfare in each of those countries using certain criteria.  These countries were then ranked and greyhound passports were no longer issued for export to countries that did not meet the export criteria.  The owner, however, could still send the dog to these countries under federal law.  The same applies here in respect of EU law and world trade law.  This process added another layer of bureaucracy and put greater focus on exporting dogs to countries that may not necessarily have the appropriate welfare standards.  The World Greyhound Racing Federation operated until some years ago and all the regulated greyhound racing jurisdictions were members.  The organisation has waned in the past seven or eight years.  There should be an appetite to reinvent it, harmonise welfare in all the member countries and agree what is and is not good practice in exporting to countries that may not necessarily have proper regulatory regimes or welfare regulations.  That matter was discussed recently at a meeting in London with the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.  I believe it also takes the view that it would be good to re-establish that organisation to get all those learnings into one place.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  If Australia has done something, for example, let us try to utilise its experience and apply it in each jurisdiction for the betterment of the industry in each area.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked a question about the number of deaths.  We have a clear record on the number of deaths of hares.  We have very few fatalities.  I do not have a number for the Deputy but it is extremely low because in coursing there are only two dogs at each course or event.  In track racing, however, eight dogs will race in Australia and six dogs will race in Ireland.  There are also different scenarios involved, with running on bends and so on whereas in coursing it is just a straight run up the field.  The chances of injury are minimised for that reason alone.</p></speech>

Currently, we provide daily all details on ownership and breeding to the IGB so we feed information to it.  We met the IGB recently.  It will introduce a microchipping and testing  IT solution for all its tracks, as it indicated previously to the committee.  We are working with it to provide the information it needs to run that.  This system will involve displaying the identity card of the greyhound on a screen.  The microchip will then be scanned and the dog will be shown on the screen.  I do not want to speak on behalf of the IGB but that is the gist of what the system will deliver.</p><p>We are more than willing to play our part.  As I have said all along, we are part of the industry and we want to play our part.  We will do anything we can do for the betterment of the industry and the decent owners out there who are willing to do it.  We will not be found wanting in that regard.</p></speech>

As a layman, I do not know anything about coursing.  How is it easily identifiable?  If it is a coursing club event, then people from the ICC are present, but if I came across illegal hunting taking place, I would not want to confront them.  How do I find out if the event is legal or not?</p></speech>

They enter the lands without permission, they do have any insurance and they could allow anywhere between two and five dogs to go after one animal, or they may very well let two hounds off the leash and then after a period release two further dogs to pursue the same hare.  The end result is the death of the hare.  From that point of view, the muzzle alone is the first thing one would look for.  I have never seen an illegal hunting event taking place where the dogs wore muzzles.</p></speech>

He also made a comment on international trade and the laws in that regard.  There has been a proposed Bill on the export of Irish greyhounds, which includes the establishment of a white list of countries to which it is in order to export greyhounds on the basis that they meet certain welfare standards.  Given Mr. Histon's knowledge of the international legal backdrop, what is his assessment on how that measure would stand up and if it would be possible to introduce it here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D.J.

That is where the issue arises.  At the same time, I still see merit in going down that road in terms of at least educating the greyhound public that certain countries are on a white list, even though the measure might not necessarily have the full legal effect one might like it to have.  I hark back to Australia in that regard as well.  Even though it does not have the backing of federal law, they still go to the bother of making an owner get a greyhound passport and giving all the details.  It is a case of putting it to the forefront.  Equally, what is important as well is that there is an opportunity to try to bring the countries identified as not being on the white list into alignment with proper welfare standards.  Australia has done that as well.  It has engaged with the countries that have fallen short in respect of correct welfare standards to try to bring them up to the right level.  It is up to the countries concerned to engage on the issue, but there is an opportunity to raise all boats, so to speak, in regard to exports.  Rather than saying we do not want to know anything about the country, let us see if we can help in any way and come from a positive point of view rather than a negative one.</p></speech>

The committee asked us to focus on our 2018 annual report and on our current and future plans.  I do not propose to read the statement in its entirety; I will just focus on some of the key points.</p> <p>  Last year, Teagasc's total expenditure was &euro;185 million and this year, we anticipate an outturn of &euro;186 million.  Approximately 70% of the total was funded through grant-in-aid, and that is 60% when expenditure on pensions is excluded.  Teagasc is unique among non-commercial State-sponsored bodies in having sizeable expenditure funded though non-grant-in-aid sources, including advisory and education fees, farm receipts, services to industry, industry levies, and receipts from its successful participation in competitive research programmes.  Currently, Teagasc employs approximately 1,262 permanent and contract staff.</p><p>We have approximately 248 researchers, but not included in that total are 253 Walsh fellows, mainly at PhD level, and approximately 40 masters' students being trained on agricultural extension programmes, in collaboration with University College Dublin, UCD.  Under our advisory programme, we have approximately 300 front-line advisers across all farming enterprises at our 51 advisory offices.  Some 140 of these are in dry stock, mainly beef; 89 are in dairying; and 16 are in tillage.  We have 76 subject matter specialists and these are a critical group of staff in that they provide a bridge between research knowledge and its on-farm adoption through our front-line advisory services.  Despite a significant reduction in the number of advisers over the past decade, we have maintained a client base of approximately 43,000.  In addition, of course, we provide a service to all farmers.  </p><p> The Teagasc education system is delivered through Teagasc's four colleges and three affiliated privately-owned colleges.  We also partner with many institutes of technology, UCD and, more recently, University College Cork, UCC, to deliver higher level programmes.  We have approximately 1,700 students enrolled in our colleges at present.  College enrolments have slowed in recent years as the economic recovery has taken hold, but this trend has been substantially offset by enrolments in our part-time programmes delivered across our 12 advisory regions.  Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in these part-time programmes.  That is about twice the level that prevailed prior to the establishment of the various incentivisation measures in the rural development programme, RDP, of the current CAP.  In addition, Teagasc delivered a wide range of short courses to almost 6,500 people in rural areas.  </p><p> In recent years, the agency has also set up an education and training programme known as ConnectEd.  It is dedicated to the needs of rural professionals, such as private agricultural consultants, agribusiness, banks and other financial institutions.  This service is the main vehicle through which we deliver, among other aspects of training, Teagasc's nutrient management planning programme.  </p><p> I will briefly refer to some highlights in our reports, first from 2018 and then from this year.  Last year was the year of the severe fodder crisis.  Teagasc's advisers up and down the country played a major role in supporting farmers through that crisis, including clients and non-clients.  We held a very successful open day in Grange in 2018 and this year there was a dairy open day in Cork.  They are held in alternate years.  There was also a crops open day at Oak Park.  All of those events attracted substantial attendance.  </p><p> In 2018, we published a major report, entitled Education Vision, on the future and long-term vision of agricultural education.  One of the main outcomes was implemented this year, whereby all students entering agricultural colleges now must spend a minimum of two years in college before they can qualify at level 6.  This year also saw the first students enrolled into the new Teagasc-UCC bachelor of agricultural science.  This is a third-level programme that will be delivered at UCC and at Teagasc's Moorepark and Clonakilty campuses.  Last year and this year, with the support of the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, we organised a series of smart consent workshops.  </p><p> On the research front, Teagasc led a successful consortium through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  This endeavour was also supported by significant funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This centre is known as the VistaMilk SFI Research Centre and it will engage in groundbreaking research on the application of precision-based systems across the dairy value chain, with an emphasis on pasture-based agriculture.  This investment is worth approximately &euro;40 million over six years, comprised of public and private funding, and approximately 40 companies are participating in the project.  </p><p> As far as Horizon 2020 funds are concerned, Teagasc was successful in 2018 and 2019.  We were ranked as the fifth most successful applicant for that funding in 2018 and third in 2019.  The greenhouse gases abatement report was also published in 2018, popularly known as the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.  This formed the basis of the Government's agricultural measures in its climate action plan published in June 2019.  The agricultural support and advisory programme, ASAP, was also initiated in 2018 to address water quality on the nation's farms.  It is a joint initiative of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Teagasc and the dairy co-operatives.  Teagasc has 20 advisers dedicated to the programme, with the co-operatives providing an additional ten.  This service is provided free of charge to farmers.  </p><p> Substantial investment is being put in place to enable Ireland to be Brexit-ready.  The challenge associated with Brexit is to encourage food companies to diversify their exports and this will require significant innovation.  With private and public support, Teagasc is investing &euro;30 million in three major initiatives.  These include the extension of its Moorepark Technology Limited pilot plant, at a cost of &euro;10 million, the establishment of a prepared consumer food centre at Teagasc Ashtown, Castleknock, also at a cost of &euro;10 million, and the investment of some &euro;9 million, provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the development of what we call a food innovation hub at Teagasc Moorepark.  Construction on that facility recently commenced.  </p><p> Finally, looking forward to 2020, in the first quarter, Teagasc will launch its statement of strategy that will cover the period 2020-2022.  We will also publish our regular sectoral roadmaps and these will provide an important input into the Government's successor to Food Wise 2025.  A key objective for us next year will be to implement the Teagasc recommendations as published in the Government's climate action plan for the mitigation of greenhouse gases and ammonia.  This will involve an intensive advisory campaign.  We also intend that all Teagasc research and college farms will adhere to the highest standards of sustainability and we will launch a plan to secure sustainable profitability across the beef sector.  There will be continued focus on good calf management on dairy farms to ensure the good health and welfare of calves and also a focus on working closely with dairy farmers to improve the beef quality of calves through the use of the dairy-beef index and sex semen.  </p><p> A major open day on beef will be held in Grange next year and there will also be a sheep open day at Athenry.  We intend to progress research on antimicrobial and anthelmintic resistance.  Teagasc also plans next year to consolidate and enhance our research programme on the sustainable circular bio-economy, especially in the area of food.  As I mentioned earlier, we plan to complete the construction of the food innovation hub at Teagasc Moorepark.  We also intend to continue our support for Irish Aid's development efforts in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Vietnam.  I left out one measure and my apologies for that.  I refer to our plan, now well advanced, to establish a CPD-accredited programme for all our Teagasc short courses.  </p></speech>

Teagasc can undertake research on climate change to show we are sustainable producers of food but it is essential that it is economically viable for producers.</p><p> On the last occasion Professor Boyle made a presentation to us he talked about salary levels for researchers and difficulties with retaining researchers.  Is retention still an issue?  It is a serious problem if one cannot retain people after having trained them to a high level.  I would like to hear his view on that.</p><p> I have raised the issue of the dairy breeding policy and its impact on the beef industry with the professor before.  As much as 60% of the product from the beef industry originates from dairy production.  In the past many of the research farms had cross-bred herds.  What is the composition of the herds on the research farms of Teagasc?  What is the composition of the herds on the farms of the agricultural colleges?</p><p> Calf welfare and their value is a huge issue.  Public confidence in the way we produce our food, etc., is paramount for us winning the battle as regards sustainable food producers.  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, is in the process of re-evalutating the economic breeding index, EBI, and how that is calculated.  There  people, including those in Teagasc, who hold a different view of the re-evaluation.  I strongly believe that not enough emphasis was placed on the beef value of the dairy EBI in the past.  Let us take, for example, the culled cow value and a 20% replacement rate.  If a Friesian cow is worth &euro;500 more than a cross-bred cow then that equates to &euro;100 per annum for EBI.  Similarly, for a calf, if there is &euro;50 or &euro;100 of a difference with half female and half male then that equates to a significant financial input into the EBI.  It is imperative that we get the breeding policy correct.  We can have a cow that can produce a reasonable amount of solids with a reasonable volume of milk, and also produce a calf that is of value to the beef industry.  Our research must focus on that going forward.  We cannot go down the New Zealand route.  A bobby calf is unacceptable to the modern consumer, which is an issue that must be faced up to by the dairy industry.  If we got the EBI correct it would be very significant in this regard.</p><p> I noticed that there are six advisers for the pig industry.  The industry is extremely intensive and challenging but six advisers is a high ratio for the number of pig producers versus 89 advisers for dairy farming and 140 advisers for drystock farming.  I appreciate that a high demand is placed on the six advisers and they must respond to very challenging issues.  However, the ratio is fewer than 1:50, which seems very high.</p><p> Last January, when we visited Moorepark I mentioned the impact of cross-breeding.  There is now a greater focus on the issue.  I know dairy farmers who have cross-bred herds and they say that cross-breeding is very beneficial.  However, the dairy industry cannot generate a waste product and we must be conscious of public perception.  I look forward to the ICBF re-evaluating the EBI and I would like to hear the views and comments of Professor Boyle on the issue.</p></speech>

It is important to ensure the expansion of the dairy sector is done in a way that does not damage the beef sector overall.  We must also ensure bull calves from the dairy sector are valuable to the beef chain.  Comments have emanated from Teagasc over the last number of months on the amount of policy thought that was given to the expansion of the dairy herd and how expansion would impact on the beef sector.  Teagasc indicated that not enough thought was given to the impact of such expansion on the beef sector.  I would like to hear the views of Professor Boyle on the matter.  What steps must be taken by Teagasc to ensure that the dairy sector positively contributes to the beef sector?  How can we ensure that the beef sector remains profitable and a sustainable industry for the people who are purely beef farmers?</p> <p>  A point was made about sexed semen.  The science offers potential but progress has been slow in recent years.  How does Professor Boyle view that science?  What role does it play?  How quickly can it play a positive role on the male progeny to come off the dairy herd or the beef progeny to come off the dairy herd?</p> <p>  Teagasc has produced a roadmap on climate change.  I ask Professor Boyle to update us on progress.  Is enough being done to tackle climate change?  How quickly can actions be implemented?  Tackling climate change is a big challenge.  The roadmap and the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, produced by Teagasc are very much agreed as being a way forward.  However, a massive amount of work must be done to achieve the targets and it is important that the agricultural sector, as a whole, plays its role in that regard.</p> <p>  Teagasc plays an important role in education.  The part-time Green Cert course has been subject to delays in the past.  What is it like at the moment?  Is there a sufficient number of places for the two-year programme?  </p> <p>  Finally, the beef sector has been under massive economic and financial pressures in recent years.  The beef sector is the largest part of the farming sector.  How do we ensure that the beef sector is financially sustainable for farmers into the future?  I ask because farmers are questioning themselves whether to continue in the beef sector as a result of what has happened over the last number of years.  What is Teagasc's perspective on beef and ensuring there is a margin for farmers?</p></speech>

On page 35 of the annual report there is mention of the fact that: "Teagasc have concluded their field study which investigated both the environmental and agronomic impact of a GM potato variety genetically engineered to resist late blight disease", which was conducted in both the Netherlands and Ireland.  Obviously potato blight has been a curse of this country at times.  I ask the witnesses to comment on GM.  There are huge concerns about this island being associated with GM or it creeping in by stealth or in any other way.</p><p>Will this have implications?  There is a strong belief in a wide sector of society that we should be trying to market as GM free.  Will the witnesses comment on this?</p><p> The next issue I want to raise is really glamorous altogether.  It is with regard to slurry tanks.  I do not know what the research has shown on this matter but recently it has been raised within and outside the farming community.  This is with regard to the spread of disease since we moved to slatted units and slurry tanks.  I can remember a time when it was not like that.  The dung from where calves were bedded was stacked up and spread early in the year.  People used to say frost killed any germs in it.  It was spread on top of the land or ploughed in.  Now, it is injected into the land.  Many animals are housed over the winter period and the tanks will soon be opened.  Antibiotics go into the tanks.  It is not great in a situation where animals are becoming resistant to antibiotics in the same way as humans.  In turn, this goes into the food chain.  Are we susceptible to this also?  There is also the spread of disease.  If animals are carrying bacteria or disease it goes into the slurry tanks and then it is spread.  With new technology, it is injected into the land as part of the spreading.  Has Teagasc done research on this?  I am glad to have had this opportunity to raise the issue.</p><p> There is only one very small mention of energy in the annual report.  This is with regard to the energy in agriculture 2018 event, which took place in Gurteen College in Tipperary.  At this stage, I do not know whether it is Teagasc's role or not.  It was highlighted in the symposium in big bright lights that beef on its own does not provide a sustainable income.  Having to depend on subsidies to pay the bills does not cut it.  There has to be additionality.  There has to be a second or third income on the same farm units.  What is Teagasc doing in this regard?  Do the witnesses see it as being somebody else's role?  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has a big role and I was my party's spokesperson on that portfolio until fairly recently.  We are a long way behind other countries on this.  We are a long way behind northern Italy and Germany.  We are even a bit behind mother England.  What is Teagasc's role in this?  Are efforts being made to drive it down?  Is there a role for Teagasc in it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#L00200"><p>I will take some of the questions and my colleagues will chip in as appropriate.  To start in reverse, Deputy Stanley raised the point about energy.  To answer his specific question, yes, Teagasc has a role in it.  The development of energy in agriculture and the use of biomass in particular has been very much affected by policy.  We have gone through a number of phases in our research work on energy over the years, which has mainly followed the ebb and flow of policy.  Specifically, we have mentioned the importance of energy efficiency in our marginal abatement cost curve as one of the mitigation options, although, as Deputy Stanley is aware, agriculture does not get the credit in terms of savings in fossil fuels because it is attributed to the energy sector at present.  This is one initiative.</p> <p>  Early in the new year, we will commission a demonstration of an anaerobic digestion unit at our site in Grange.  It is designed to utilise grass and other feedstock.  It is mainly about the utilisation of grasses.  It should have happened before now but, unfortunately, construction was affected by Carillion going bust a couple of years ago.  I hope it will be completed prior to June next year.  The whole point is to address exactly the issues about which Deputy Stanley is concerned.  There is definitely potential for anaerobic digesters to use our grasslands and our ability to grow grass.  The investment is very costly at present.  If we look at the marginal abatement cost curve we identify this option as among the most costly mitigation options.  There is also an issue with regard to the feed-in tariff if we were to convert, as we will be doing, the gas to biomethane, which will then be capable of being fed into the grid.  The willingness of farmers to undertake this will depend very much on the feed-in tariff they get.  We are aware of these issues.  We are working very closely with Gas Networks Ireland and we intend to use the plant as a demonstration facility.</p> <p>  We are doing a lot of work on milk cooling.  One of our foremost young researchers is featured in the staff profile on page 34 of the annual report.  He is someone who has been highly trained, including in the United States, on cooling systems for milk and reducing energy utilisation.</p> <p>  On our own farms our plan is to install solar PV panels starting with our dairy farms and colleges and research firms.  That project has commenced with an assessment.  There is a lot happening on this.  Mr. O'Mara will pick up on the point on the disease risk associated with slurry use and pathogens.  The issue of antimicrobial resistance is an increasing concern.  It is not just a concern for agriculture.  As the Deputy said, it is a concern for the Department of Health, and the so-called one health strategy is very much to the fore.</p> <p>  Moving on to Deputy McConalogue's points with regard to the beef sector and the fundamental challenge of profitability in that sector, this is a long-running saga.  This year has been exceptionally challenging, particularly for our top beef producers.  I cannot think of another year in recent times where our best performing beef producers have had such a difficult situation.  If we stand back from this year and look at the history of the production with regard to fattening and rearing, based on the Teagasc national farm survey, which is a positive outcome at one level, there is a small group of farmers who are able to make good profits from rearing and slightly higher from fattening but they are a very small group and they tend to be larger-scale producers operating to a high level of efficiency.  It is possible to generate a net margin before single farm payment and other direct payments of in or around &euro;500 per hectare.  That is the key target.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of beef producers do not generate a positive net margin.  The unfortunate consequence of this is that too many of our beef farmers eat into their single farm payment and that does not make sense.  We have been reflecting on this.</p><p>We will continue to work with those farmers who are receptive to new technology and so forth, or farmers who are generating positive net margins, but we have to recognise segmentation is greater within the beef sector than in other enterprises.  We need to address our programmes accordingly.  That is where our thinking lies at the minute.  For example, there is a very large group of part-time farmers involved in the production of beef.  They have particular needs.  Some of them are exceptionally efficient but there are others in respect of whom we need to adjust our systems to suit their time constraints.  Also, we need specific measures to address the needs of those farmers who may be elderly and who are finding it very challenging to manage their herds and, in particular, to maximise the single farm payment.  We need to tailor measures to assist those farmers with the aim of maximising the retention of their single farm payments.  My colleagues may pick up on this because it is a major preoccupation at present.  It has been for a number of years.  We have a number of programmes under way.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of part-time programmes.  Thankfully, we have moved through the heavy demand phase for part-time green certificate programmes.  There was a period during which there were enrolments of 1,500, which was three times the normal rate.  It is now more manageable.  We have not yet migrated the part-time programme to the full-time programme.  There is a different programme in operation.  That transition will commence shortly or certainly in the new year.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of sexed semen.  I will leave that Dr. O'Mara.  We issued a breeding statement on 3 December.  It is on our website.  There was a significant change from last year in regard to the use of sexed semen.  We have advocated that it should be used, where possible, for breeding dairy replacements.  If using Jersey genetics, the recommendation is to use only sexed semen.  We will be implementing that advice on our own farms.  There are obviously issues in regard to the availability of sexed semen, particularly fresh sexed semen.  Dr. O'Mara will take that up.</p><p> I agree with the Deputy's implication that dairy expansion should be seen as a positive development, not only for the dairy farmers.  The expansion in dairy can be leveraged for the benefit of other farmers, particularly traditional dry stock farmers.  We are certainly promoting a number of initiatives in that respect.  There are opportunities but there is a challenge in communicating them to farmers.  We agree wholeheartedly that one of the key implications of dairy expansion is that it cannot be to the detriment of, or create problems for, our beef industry.  Many of these points were also raised by Deputy Cahill.</p><p> A specific point on advisers was raised and I am happy to address it.  The Deputy observed astutely that we have a quite satisfactory ratio, although our pig farmer clients would not agree.  There is one major difference in that we managed to negotiate a levy worth about &euro;350,000 per annum during the recession when the service was in danger of being abolished.  Pig producers rallied around and agreed to a levy, which has enabled us to recruit a good ratio of advisers to pig farmers.  It is more challenging to get support for a levy in the other sectors, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  We have a small contribution from dairy but we have none from the other enterprises.  A small levy would enable us to put in place additional advisers and researchers.</p><p> Salary levels continue to be a major concern for us.  Obviously, trying to persuade somebody who has finished a doctorate, which takes a minimum of four years on top of four years doing an undergraduate programme, to take up employment at a salary of &euro;35,000 presents a major challenge.  There is a challenge in recruiting top-class staff and retaining them.  It tends to be more difficult in some enterprises than in others.  We are no different from other specialised groups across the public service, however.  It definitely is an issue.  We are certainly not able to compete with the private sector, nor would we want to.  The challenge for us is competing with the university sector.  It has somewhat more flexibility than we do in the setting of salaries.</p><p> Dr. O'Mara might pick up on some of the other points raised.</p></speech>

We have an options programme whereby we sit down with all farmers and discuss their current circumstances and options.  We certainly recognise opportunities within beef production.  We would be asking farmers to look very closely at the possibilities associated with heifer rearing, for example.  It gives a more continuous level of income.  We also say we see opportunities in the rearing of dairy calves.  We would be discussing those options.  It is challenging in the beef sector because the demographics do not encourage people to embrace change.  We need to segment the population and have a targeted series of measures along the lines suggested.  Forestry is another example.  I do not have to tell the Deputy that there are varying views on forestry.  We can certainly show that, on marginal land, forestry is quite attractive relative to beef production.  It is challenging, however, to persuade farmers.</p></speech>

Does there need to be leadership within farm organisations and Teagasc to drive forward an agenda of alternatives that will be more profitable than what is currently in place?</p></speech>

The only thing that makes me a little reluctant is that the farmer has to take the risk.  We do not have to take the risk.  We are in that position of privilege.  Leadership is critical.  Leadership was demonstrated in the past.  Leadership played a big role in the expansion of the suckler herd in the 1990s.  We need similar leadership now.</p></speech>

Antibiotic resistance is bringing this debate very much to the fore.  Ireland has a unified strategy on that.  The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are implementing a "one health" strategy owing to the linkages between what happens on farms and what happens with humans and food.  We had a very good conference on the agriculture side about two weeks ago in Tullamore.  People were talking about the issue of antibiotics used in animals getting into slurry and water and then into the food chain.</p><p>It is a relatively recent area of research for us to get into.  At this stage, because of the integrated nature of it, we would have researchers from our food safety side, our soil researchers and our animal researchers working together on the issue.  The use of antibiotics in Irish agriculture is relatively small.  We do not have a very large pig sector where most of the antibiotic usage is concentrated.</p><p> On the ruminant side, the issue of greatest concern is the blanket use of antibiotics at drying off - dry cow therapy.  That issue is being addressed through a programme involving Teagasc and Animal Health Ireland on selective dry cow therapy.  It is still in pilot stage, but there are encouraging results.  There is an encouraging reaction from farmers to the use of selective dry cow therapy rather than blanket dry cow therapy.  I think we will see progress on that issue, but many issues remain to be teased out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#N00200"><p>One issue is antibiotic resistance in animals and humans because of the way the link can be made.  The other issue is that of disease control.  Given the expansion in use of slurry tanks in recent years with greater amounts of slurry being spread, are there signs that it is assisting the spread of disease?  There are some suggestions in the farming community and beyond that it is.  I do not know the answer to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#N00300"><p>Unfortunately, I do not know the answer to it either.  I have no knowledge that there are any statistics or a report on that.  Anecdotally, I am aware of several cases of botulism.  In those cases, it was poultry litter that had been spread.  There are one or two cases I happened to be aware of in my locality.  I would not draw any conclusions on a national basis.  I am not aware of any increase or outbreaks of disease related to the increased quantities of slurry that have to be spread as a result of more cattle being housed on slurry tanks.</p> <p>  A number of years ago we were involved in a European-funded research project on GM potatoes.  The field work finished about three or four years ago.  The purpose was to analyse the environmental impacts of growing a potato variety that was resistant to blight through genetic modification and compare that with conventional potatoes.  There was no issue of stealth.  It was probably the best-known trial we had going on at the time.  The researchers involved did almost 100 public engagement events on the trial and it was widely reported in the media.</p> <p>  It obviously was licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, because to do any field work with genetically modified organisms we need a licence.  It was licensed by the EPA and was very public.  It basically showed an enormous reduction in the use of fungicides because of the blight resistance.  It might have been an 80% or 90% reduction in the use of fungicides and no impact on the environment in terms of the soil or the invertebrates that would inhabit the soil where the potatoes were grown.  Those were the scientific findings.  The use or non-use of GM potatoes goes wider than science.  As scientists, we provide the information and the facts to come out of that trial.  It is for society at large to decide if we should grow such crops.  We provide the facts into that debate.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill asked about our own dairy herds and crossbreeding.  Approximately 30% of the cows in our dairy herds would be crossbred.  We have a number of herds with no crossbreds, including the well-known next-generation herd which is our flagship herd for where the economic breeding index, EBI, can bring us in the future and what benefits will come from continuing to use the EBI.  That is a non-crossbred herd.  Our herds in the base station in Moorepark have no crossbreds and a number of our other herds might have up to 50% of crossbreds in them.  It is a mixture across our herds.</p></speech>

I do not think any of them is as high as 50%.  In Pallaskenry and Gurteen they are still black and white bred.  There is an expansion plan for the Pallaskenry herd involving introducing some element of Jersey, mainly because it is out there in the industry and it wants to follow that trend.</p></speech>

I think the industry is moving away from crossbreds.  Sexed semen will not solve the problem of the Jersey.  They are still producing a calf that is of no benefit to the beef industry.  We will have welfare issues.  We need to remember that the modern consumer expects farming to be done in a sustainable manner.  I believe the issues with crossbreeding have not been properly evaluated up to now.  I believe the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation is in the process of putting a new EBI together.  I think that will show the Jersey in a different economic environment.  That is an argument for another time.  I have made my point and will not labour it further.</p></speech>

Work has commenced on training our advisers, advisers outside Teagasc and other professionals in industry.  There is considerable work on some of the measures, in particular the fertiliser type, the slurry application method and, as always, general good husbandry.  I always say the first thing farmers should do is run the business well and try to make maximum use of grass and so on.  All those things contribute a low-carbon footprint.  If we want to go further and reduce the inventory, we need to do things like using the protected urea and spreading the slurry with a low-emissions method and so on.</p> <p>  Our programmes will have a major emphasis on that in the coming years.  We are planning - it might be under way - what we call a signpost farm programme around a number of demonstration farms.  We have discussed with the co-ops having a major focus on the climate measures in the joint programmes we have with them.  We have had similar discussions with the beef industry on having a demonstration farm campaign.  It needs to go considerably beyond demonstration farms.</p></speech>

We are embracing all the measures in the MAC in some way or other that we can feasibly do on our farms.  As Dr. O'Mara mentioned, through our demonstration farm network, we are branding them as signpost farms specifically so that we can show that they are addressing these issues.  We also take the approach that this is a job for every adviser and has been mainstreamed.  Across every action we take, the climate issue needs to be there in the background in terms of what advice we give and even in our education programmes.</p></speech>

One of the messages we hope to get across in our signpost farm initiative is that farmers generate emissions through their activities but they also contribute to sequestration.  While there are technical issues about the credit to be given for sequestration and grasslands, we continue to do research and hopefully, in time, it will be included in the so-called national inventory.</p><p> Other Deputies have raised issues about the inclusion of woodlands, hedgerows and so forth, and that is a positive indication of what farmers can do to offset emissions.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Boyle and his colleagues for coming in this afternoon.  How much is accrued from the industry levy?  How is it imposed and collected?</p> <p>  According to the numbers provided, there are 501 researchers in Teagasc.  What is the breadth of the research they are doing and what is done with the outcome of that research?</p> <p>  It is impressive that Ireland is the fifth most successful applicant for Horizon 2020.  What types of projects are being funded?</p> <p>  Our guests have mentioned the challenges of Brexit and the investment that will be required.  What does the innovation referred to in the report involve?</p> <p>  Is Teagasc doing anything about carbon farming?  There has been much discussion about carbon farming at the Joint Committee on Climate Action to try and encourage farmers to sequester carbon.  A number of methods such as sliver pasture, cover crops, mulching, composting and all of that kind of thing have been suggested.  The restoration of wetlands, regenerative and conservation agriculture are things we heard about at this committee.  Is that something Teagasc is examining and could be recommending for farmers in the future?</p> <p>  I turn to research on antimicrobial and anthelmintic resistance.  Those are worrying developments that have happened over recent years.  What kind of progress has been made on that kind of research?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#O00500"><p>I want to ask about climate action and related fields that are part of Teagasc's priorities for next year.  Should that not be a bigger part of what the organisation does, given the emissions that agriculture produces in Ireland?  It is something we must tackle.  The targets that Teagasc has proposed in the past are not insurmountable and farmers can still make a good living from their land while dealing positively with climate action.  That is something that Teagasc needs to concentrate on more.</p> <p>  Could our guests explain why hedgerows are not included when counting the carbon production of farms at the moment?  Hedgerows can provide medication for farmers and that is something that should be looked at more closely.</p> <p>  Teagasc has consultants to help farmers on their medication and agriculture plans.  There is also the Agricultural Consultants Association and I wonder what relationship has Teagasc with that organisation?  Is information passed between the bodies, or how does that work?  The Agricultural Consultants Association provides information for a lot of farmers across the country.  How does the information flow between the organisations?  Are there costs involved?</p></speech>

One is from the pig producers, as I mentioned, and that is worth &euro;350,000 or thereabouts per annum.  That levy is collected by Bord Bia and passed on to Teagasc.  Professor O'Mara might have the figure for dairy producers.  Is it &euro;2.5 million?</p></speech>

The PhD students are junior researchers and are a very important resource for us.</p> <p>  Approximately half of the 250 researchers are contract staff.  Horizon 2020 funding, for example, enables us to recruit contract staff and implement research programmes.  The PhD programme is globally unique.  We have the highest concentration in Ireland of PhD students in a single subject area.  It is a fantastic way for us to break open new frontiers.  That is the way it is done.  A student would devote perhaps four years to a new research programme.  We do work on antimicrobial and anthelmintic resistance and use a PhD student to look at new frontiers of research.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the breadth of research.  Our research activity addresses Irish agriculture and food processing.  We have a programme on animal production and grassland which covers all of our ruminant agriculture and the monogastric pig sector.  We have a programme on tillage and land use which covers all the cropping programmes plus forestry.  We also have an environmental programme which addresses issues such as water quality, climate change, biodiversity and so forth.  We also have a rural economy programme to address the economic issues.  We also have a food programme to address challenges around food processing, mainly in dairy and meat production, principally beef.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Brexit and we have a role in that.  Companies are, and will be, diversifying but products that are going into new markets often must be modified.  I give the example of China, which is important for us because it consumes a lot of our infant formula.  Thankfully, that sector is growing in double digits, but the Chinese do not seem to like our cheddar cheese.  We have a cheese for China programme and a laboratory in Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University.  That is an example of what our investment in Moorepark will allow us to do.</p> <p>  Our investment at Ashtown relates to what is called prepared consumer foods, which is quite a heterogenous sector.  That sector is very much dependent on the UK market and we will be helping companies in that area.  That relates to the likes of pre-prepared meals.  Our innovation will be supporting such companies to develop more competitive production and processing lines.  For example, we have a beef programme under way where we are looking at the relationship between the breed of animals and the taste and tenderness of the meat.</p><p>That is what we mean by innovation.</p><p> The important issue of carbon farming was raised.  My colleagues may wish to comment on that.  A lot of the issues raised, such as regenerative agriculture, cover crops etc., are very relevant to tillage systems.  We are well aware of those developments.  One aspect of the programme that we developed in recent years concerns the soil microbiome.  That is very similar to work on the human microbiome that we have been engaged in for several years with collaborators in University College Cork.  We have now extended that analysis to animals and soil.  The heart of regenerative agriculture is understanding the microbial life of the soil as well its physical structure and the role of nutrients.  The main aspect of carbon farming that we advocate concerns grasslands and how to manage them to enrich their carbon content.  That is a central plank of our work regarding nutrient management on farms.  That includes the old recommendation around the use of lime to improve organic matter and so on.</p><p> The management of wetlands was mentioned.  That features strongly in our marginal abatement cost curve.  It is a very important area and we are not the only body with an interest in it.  Bord na M&oacute;na is doing a lot of interesting work and has many interesting ideas.  We are certainly involved as well.  I might ask Dr. O'Mara to comment on research on antimicrobial resistance, AMR, and anthelmintic resistance.</p><p> I take Deputy Pringle's point.  Perhaps climate action did not get enough prominence in my opening comments.  It forms a massive part of our work now because it cuts across all areas.  We talk about sustainability in a holistic sense.  We are not just concerned with environmental sustainability, although that is obviously central.  We also talk about economic and social sustainability, as well as another dimension that does not get enough mention, namely, farmers' capability to change.  That is really at the heart of sustainability.  That is what it is all about.</p><p> We have already invested substantial resources at both advisory and research level.  Dr. O'Mara set out the programme we will be rolling out next year.  It will require significant additional resources, particularly in the advisory area.  We are talking about persuading people to change.  That is what our advisory role is all about.</p><p> I have discussed the issue of hedgerows with Deputy Fitzmaurice on a couple of occasions.  We strongly encourage farmers to put woodlands on their farms, especially on dairy farms.  We are strongly encouraging the establishment of hedgerows.  We will be doing that on our own farms.  At the moment they are not included in the so-called national inventory.  There is a lot of research to be done on the calculation of carbon sequestration contributions.  That work has not really begun in earnest.  There are a couple of sites around the country where that is happening and we certainly hope to accelerate it, particularly where hedgerows are concerned.</p><p> The Agricultural Consultants Association, ACA, was referred to.  Dr. Kelly might address that as it comes into his area of responsibility. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#P00200"><p>As Deputy Pringle knows, the Agricultural Consultants Association is quite a large body with about 150 members.  They are private consultants like ourselves, scattered throughout the country in different towns and servicing different parishes.  Many SMEs are members.  Three or four people are employed.  The ACA had a lot of work when the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, was in operation.  We also supplied the GLAS planning service to our clients.  We concentrated on our own clients and the ACA served other interested farmers.  Consultants' work on GLAS came to an end about two years ago, as did our own.  Several members of the ACA bid for work that we outsourced.  They were not successful.  We had to give it to the most competitive supplier.  FRS Farm Relief Services won that contract.</p> <p>  We have an ongoing relationship with the ACA in that we still buy services from private consultants.  They also buy services from us.  We set up the ConnectEd programme in recent years to cater to that demand as well as the wider demand for private consultants who are not members of the ACA and do not want to be part of a consultants' organisation.  We provided services to them under the knowledge transfer, KT, programme, which was in operation for the last three years and concluded in July.  It was obligatory for advisers to implement the profit monitor technique and draw up a nutrient management and fertiliser plan for the farm.  We supply the software for both of those tasks.  The only requirement is a fee to cover the cost of the support service.  We employ somebody on a contract basis to support those services.  Clients do not pay commercial rates for the software.  They pay a reduced rated.  As I say, they are customers of the ConnectEd programme, along with others.  Many people buy those services from us, including solicitors' practices.</p> <p>  A report by Mr. Jim Power was launched recently.  One of the recommendations was for us to formalise our working relationships through a memorandum of understanding.  We are very open to that and we look forward to agreeing that memorandum.  We hope to have the opportunity to work with the ACA.  Its members reach a large clientele that we cannot reach with our current staff numbers.  They are needed, and we feel obligated to support them fully.</p> <p>  Individually, we have working relationships at local level and at national level.  For about the first six years of my ten years in this job we had a very good relationship.  We sat down with the executives of the ACA twice a year and worked out issues around GLAS and other schemes that were very hot at the time.  However, the ACA is a voluntary organisation.  It is an NGO that appoints a president every year or every second year, so we find it quite difficult to have a continuous relationship with it.  Depending on who is in office, we may work very well with them or we may not.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I also missed the beginning of my colleagues' questions.  I just have one question.  If it has already been covered I will accept that.  I can look it up in the transcript.  How will Teagasc's advisory and research strategy have to change as a result of last week's announcements pertaining to the EU green deal?  I refer specifically to the proposal for such a significant reduction in fertiliser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#P00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  The first issue I will address is hedgerows.  Professor Boyle and others met me on this issue a while ago.  The information we have at the moment, based on the Department's statements to the Joint Committee on Climate Action, is that there is a possibility that agricultural emissions could be reduced by between 8% and 10% throughout the country.  The Department's officials say they hope to reach a figure of 20% or 30%, whatever they mean by that.  Perhaps Professor Boyle is up to speed on that.</p> <p>  There are 137,000 farmers throughout the country.  The witnesses have said that Teagasc has 43,000 members.  Are they worried that only one farmer in three is engaging with Teagasc, looking at new technology and so on?</p><p>There are not enough private companies and there may be people who are not engaging with anybody at all.  Is that a worry? </p><p> Turning to Dr Kelly, and to follow up on Deputy Pringle's question on trying to get farmers to do things better with new technology, programmes and research, on the &euro;165 million or whatever part of that, 60% or 70%, is Government funding, would it be worthwhile to ensure that there is a tie-in with private planners around the country?  FRS Farm Relief Services, the private planners, did the GLAS programme for Teagasc, because the agency would not have had these resources.  Would it be worthwhile to form some relationship and to talk to these companies in order that when any new technology arrives, be it carbon navigators or whatever, we are working together to make things better, even if it is State-funded and the price involved is the cost involved in keeping the programme going?  Dr. Kelly mentioned that there is a problem with the yearly period.  Did he suggest that a three-year period might work better?  It is not about us and them but it would be better for the country as a whole that the information is out there, be it for a planner on his or her own, Teagasc or the SEAI, as has been talked about.  This might be helpful.</p><p> A second question, possibly to Professor Boyle, is that, at the moment, farmers are under pressure and getting the living daylights kicked both of them day in and day out by the media at the moment.  A farmer now will nearly put his or her head down, which is the way it has gone if one is producing food.  Like everyone else we all realise we need food to live, and if we do not have it, we are going nowhere.  Has Teagasc done any research as to the big vegan debate where we put our chest out and hit back at those who want to be alarmist and are pumping a lot of money into putting out messages that might not be altogether the greatest message in the world for human health?</p><p> A third question concerns our importation of soya and such produce.  Is there are any research programme on whether we might be able to do more - we do not have an ideal climate and I would be the first to say that - to grow more protein crops here to reduce our requirement to bring in such produce from abroad?  Professor Boyle mentioned the big beef farmer is making some money but the reality is that we have to deal with family farms regardless of whether we like it because that is the composition of most farms.  Have we done any research on seeing if a cow could work two calves profitably with enough milk, that is, her own calf and another one along with that.  I was looking at the breed of Fleckvieh cows in Austria, and they look acceptable to both sides in the type of animal that it is.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Cahill that Teagasc must show leadership in the whole dairy sector.  Maybe I am incorrect, but a statement went to the media that Teagasc had not thought about the calves issue.  We have to cut to the chase on this because we cannot be breeding calves as things stand.  Every farmer, be they a dairy, beef, sheep or pig farmer, is brought up to stay up all night when an animal is born to ensure that animal lives.  We cannot have a situation where calves are being born with a worthless value.  I do not care if it offends some people but we must cut to the chase on some of these cross-bred or Jersey animals because it will not do anything for our image.  We want the very best in animal welfare and these breeds will not do anything for the image we require.</p><p> Does Teagasc still believe in derogations when one discusses climate change?  Does it look at maximum stocking rates?  I am hearing that it is 3.6 to 3.7 cows to the hectare.  In normal circumstances that would be a little outlandish.  We need to bring things back to normality.  In fairness to the British or Holstein Friesian breeds, we need to start producing a calf if we are going to be in a working relationship.  At one time in my neck of the woods a farmer might have had ten cows.  Every farmer would then go down to the south, as it was called at that time, and buy five, six or ten calves, but they were right calves in that they were proper animals.  Some were Herefords but they made good cattle.  We have gone away from that now and Teagasc needs to show leadership to see if we can haul that back.</p><p> What are Teagasc's views on the single farm payment for the future?  Will it be more focused on environmental matters?</p><p> I am aware that Teagasc has done work on anaerobic digestion.  Certain things like forestry have been mentioned.  What involvement has Teagasc or does it have an input in clear-fell or planting, which is at a standstill?  Environmentally, we have gone mad as a country as everyone is objecting to everything now.</p><p> Can Teagasc place more of an emphasis on land, from Donegal down to Clare, out to the River Shannon, and maybe including a bit of Monaghan and west Cork, which is more marginal land that is not ideally suited for dairy farming?  Parts of it will be but on the whole it is not.  Is an emphasis being put on how some parts of these lands can be made sustainable for beef or sheep farmers?</p><p> Also on the environmental side, there is no point in saying that beef farmers should be rearing the calves from the dairy farmer because that will only drive the beef farmers mad.  Can something be worked out, whereby having looked at different types of cows, it could be ensured that the second calf was reared and there was enough milk but not too much milk?  That might be a way forward that would also help the dairyman, if the right product was being produced.</p><p> The other thing is that at one time when Teagasc would issue a statement, it was virtually the gospel.  Many farmers went down the bull beef route as they had been told it was a new thing to do and that it was way forward.  Many people were left with a lot of stuff.  We have to be very careful as to where people are steered.  What are Teagasc's views?  Is it involved in the task force and has it done research on the 36 months or on all of the different criteria that these farmers are looking for?</p></speech>

Of the 43,000 clients that Teagasc has, has it a breakdown of those clients into the different sectors, be it dairy, beef, tillage, or whatever else?  Is it possible to furnish that information?</p></speech>

Senator Daly raised a very important point on the incoming European Commission and the remarks of the President of the Commission recently on the green deal.  The protection of agriculture and the growth of chemical nitrogen, N, particularly on dairy farms in recent years, will be the key challenge for us and is clearly a cause of concern.</p><p>There are two strategies we would strongly advocate.  First, as referenced earlier by Dr. O'Mara, farmers need to be encouraged to move away from calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, to protected urea, which we recommend as the alternative because it has the same efficacy in terms of grass yield but it does not have the negative consequence of CAN in terms of ammonia and greenhouse emissions.  Second, for the long-term ability of the sector to harness the use of nitrogen, we need to encourage farmers to adopt clover in their swards.  We know from our research that currently the efficiency of chemical nitrogen on average is only 24%.  For every unit of nitrogen used only 24% is utilised to produce livestock products.  The remainder either goes into the atmosphere or into the ground water.  We know from our work in Clonakilty, for example, that greater use of clover in swards not only makes economic sense, it is worth approximately an additional &euro;50 per cow in terms of additional milk solids, but most important from the environmental point of view, the efficiency increases from the average of 24% to 40%.  There is no question that there is a huge challenge in this area.  Nitrogen sales is an obvious indicator to which everyone can point.  We can talk all day long about the various promotion campaigns etc., but unless we can turn the curve in regard to chemical use it will continue to be an issue of contention and affect our ability to adhere to our ammonia and greenhouse gas targets.  We have the technology to deal with it.  As in many areas of agriculture, the adoption of alternative practices is forever the challenge.  I noted at many of our recent conferences an increasing awareness among farmers of the need to tackle these issues.  Hopefully, this will be manifest in actual decision-making on farms.  </p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice raised a number of issues.  I do not have the figure relating to hedgerows.  Any such figure would be a highly speculative estimate because the hedgerows are varied in terms of species and that complicates any estimation.  We do not yet have an idea on the biomass involved let alone the variety of species, so I am not in a position to comment on the Deputy's figure of 8%-10%.  There are many areas under continuous review as far as the so-called national inventory of greenhouse gases is concerned.  That is always the case.  As sciences evolve and provide us with more concrete results, that then leads to the incorporation of different estimates of sequestration potential and mitigation into the national inventory.  My own view would be that we are a long way off yet.  We are set on a path to 2030 in regard to the current inventory and the measures and targets.  Beyond that, one would hope that we will have the information that will enable us to broaden the sequestration options.  </p><p> The Deputy raised an important point in regard to the 43,000 farmers but, of course, that does not represent the totality.  As rightly stated by him, some farmers do not see the need for advisory support, which is fine, and they do not see the advantage in discussion groups or, maybe, they do not like participating in discussion groups.  There are a number of other farmers who exercise their entitlement to use private advisers.  As part of our work we hold a variety of open days, which is probably one of the main differences between ourselves and the private sector.  Everyone is invited and there is no cost involved.  In terms of breakdown, typically, it is 60-40.  In other words, 60% of the attendance typically are Teagasc clients and 40% would be non-clients.  All of the information that farmers receive on open days is freely available.  A similar ratio attend our marquee at the Ploughing Championships.  Naturally, we would like to have more but we are getting our message out through different fora.  </p><p> Dr. Kelly addressed the issue of the relationship with the ACA.  I reiterate his point that we are very open to having a memorandum of understanding if that would help the dialogue.  Again, most of our research information is publicly available but we provide tailor-made presentations through our ConnectEd programme.  We see that as an efficient vehicle through which ACA members who want access to our latest research can get it.  I will ask Dr. O'Mara to comment on the issues around veganism, flexitarianism and so on.  Teagasc is absolutely convinced about the comprehensive and nutritional benefits of meat and dairy products, in respect of which there is an abundance of evidence, such that there is no need for people to add supplements to create that well-rounded nutritional package we all need for our health.  More important, we know from our work that the grass based system provides additional nutritional value.  This has been well documented in recent years in our work at Moorepark.  </p><p> On the issue of low value calves, none of us here is unaware of this challenge.  It is a complex issue.  I do not believe it is all down to jerseys.  There has been a huge change in recent times in the size of the calf because the dairy farmer wants an easy calving cow and a cow that will return to milk and fertility quickly.  Less than 20 years ago, we had a massive problem with fertility of our dairy cows.  It virtually collapsed.  We are only now reaching the point of recovering the position we were in before that collapse in fertility.  It was suggested that if we were to rid ourselves of the jerseys and jersey crosses, we would solve the issue.  We would not.  Our preference is to examine the opportunities that exist for the selection of calves in the marts.  It is important buyers have full and transparent information on the potential value of an animal, including its beef potential.  This will happen in the not too distant future.  We would also argue that in the selection of bulls for dairy cows in regard to their beef trades as per the dairy beef index, that within the spread of quality, farmers should choose the animal that best delivers the outcome in beef terms.  That is how it will happen in the future.  We all know that prior to the introduction of the dairy quota, 80% of beef was sourced from the dairy herd.  The percentage is now 60%, but it is growing.</p><p>It is inevitable that more dairy calves will come onto the market to be reared as beef animals.  That is a challenge for us all.  The options that the Deputy proposed are important.  We believe that a large contribution can be made in the rearing of dairy calves, but I take his point that some sort of combination might be attractive if we can get an animal that is that good.  One of the problems in the suckler sector is that the efficiency metrics are poor.  We seem to have a real problem.  For example, one metric that has been stubbornly poor is the failure of many suckler cows to produce a calf per year.  That situation is worsening.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of derogations.  The derogation is important, but it ties into Senator Daly's point about nitrogen.  Look north of the Border.  It is evident that, if we do not manage to implement the measures laid out in the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, there will be restrictions on nitrogen use in particular.  There is no question about it, as that is the easiest way to do it.  Due to the concerns about ammonia in Northern Ireland, the restrictions have virtually halted any development in the dairy industry there.  We are alert to that issue.</p><p> I am not aware of the stocking rates that the Deputy mentioned.  Is Dr. O'Mara?</p></speech>

We anticipate a greater restriction in respect of environmental issues.  We are involved in the task force.  Perhaps Dr. O'Mara will take up this point.  We were also involved in the forum before it.  We have a specific role to play in the provision of technical advice.</p> <p>  Regarding afforestation and so on, I have been making the argument for some time that, if one considers our mitigation or sequestration measures, planting new forestry is the single largest sequestration opportunity that we have.  Going by memory, it accounts for 2 metric tonnes of sequestration.  Thankfully, that is already in the bank and we will benefit from it up to 2030.  As the Deputy rightly said, however, planting this year is down to approximately 4,000 ha.  That is approximately the same as last year.  The figure has not fallen below that level, but it is terribly low relative to our target rate.  We have been engaging in a promotion campaign for the past while.  We are trying to encourage farmers and to understand what the obstacles and blockages are.  Undoubtedly, part of it is social.  Issues that cannot be summarised in rational economic terms are preventing plantations.  Speaking personally, the requirement to plant in perpetuity needs to be examined.  People do not like their land being locked into semi-permanent use.  I must say that I have a vested interest, as I have a small forest.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. O'Mara or Dr. Kelly want to take up the other points, for example, nutrition.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle asked whether we were undertaking enough work on climate change and greenhouse gas.  Our research has given us the technologies to allow us to create a plan to meet our targets without a cut in the national herd.  It has been a successful research programme.  It would have been great if we had had more money to spend on it, but we had what we had.  The immediate challenge is in implementing the measures and achieving the reduction.  Deputies Cahill and Fitzmaurice mentioned the lambasting of agriculture and farmers over this issue.  The most powerful response that could be made is to reduce emissions from agriculture, which I hope will happen soon.  It will be a great headline when that happens, as it has been going in the other direction for the past number of years.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked about the green deal.  The challenge for research is to go beyond the MACC.  We have a certain level of technology developed and can achieve a certain level of mitigation, but if we are to participate in the green deal, we will have to go beyond the MACC.  There is a great deal of research into developing new technologies around fertiliser, methane mitigation and sequestration, be that in grassland, hedgerows or wherever.  Sequestration will have to form a part of agriculture's participation in a zero carbon future.</p> <p>  Regarding veganism, and as Professor Boyle stated, we are clear on the nutritional benefits of meat and dairy products.  At particular stages, they are almost indispensable for certain cohorts of people.  However, we are not public health experts and are not in a position to give dietary advice.  We came upon an interesting piece of data recently.  We have access to the national statistics on what people eat.  A survey was carried out.  Our research has divided it up into three cohorts: the people who have a good few jars and then a burger and chips on the way home, which is not a healthy diet, but we all have a stage of life where we do a little of that; the people who try to follow good nutritional advice; and the more traditional "meat and two veg" people.  Surprisingly, the carbon footprints of the last two diets were the same.  Obviously, those who follow good nutritional advice are not all vegans.  Rather, they are people who are conscious of having a low meat and dairy intake.  When everything they eat has its carbon footprint measured, though, it is no different than the diet of those who like their meat, dairy, potato and vegetable products.  It is a complex debate.  The people with the unhealthy diet had a much higher carbon footprint.  It is bad for themselves and the environment.  When what people eat is counted, however, moving towards a vegan-type diet might not be the solution.  It is a nuanced debate.  The good news story for agriculture will be when we see a headline about agricultural emissions falling 5% or whatever it might be.</p> <p>  Professor Boyle has addressed the calf issue, but it has been stated a couple of times that we did not think of the calves.  What my colleague, Dr. Pat Dillon, actually said was that he had been part of the dairy activation group, which was set up around the time that Food Harvest 2020 was being dreamed up ten years ago.  The group was considering what would need to happen on the ground, given the potential for an increase in milk production thanks to quotas going.  The type of questions that came to the fore were, for example, where would the necessary cows, land, processing capacity and labour be found?  He was saying that the increase in the number of calves was not flagged in that mix of priority issues.  Hindsight is always 20:20, but it was not envisaged as an issue ten years ago.  That is not to say that we have not been well aware in the past couple of years of the issue of the growing number of dairy calves and the changing dynamic in the farming community, that is, there are fewer farmers interested in rearing calves than there were 30 years ago when we had many more dairy cows.  We have been working on the dairy beef index, which will help dairy farmers to select bulls to breed better calves after they finish with their replacement breeding.  This has to be a major part of the solution.</p><p>Sex semen, which was mentioned earlier, is another part of the solution.  We see that going beyond the Jerseys because the problem cohort of calves are the male calves born when a farmer is trying to breed replacements.  The more we can reduce the number of those, the less of a problem we will have.  It is certainly not only an issue with Jerseys. Of the approximate 200,000 calves exported this year, the majority were black and white.  We have to think about the long term as well and how are we going to be able to rear those calves for a good future in Ireland.  Live exports may not last forever.  </p><p> This is a complex problem and the solution is not as simple as just a change in the EBI or anything like that.  That in itself is a complex issue because the EBI is not just a group of people sitting around a table dreaming up ideas for more of this or that.  An economic model is involved in putting weightings on things in the EBI, so we advise care in meddling with something that has been successful for dairy farmers for the past 20 years.  We should stick to the principles of science in setting the weightings on the EBI.  I am not stating that the EBI is not part of the solution, but there are other ways.  I refer to sex semen and the dairy beef index that will turn around the problem much faster than can be achieved via the EBI.  </p><p> Regarding those calves, we started a new research project at Grange.  It involves a new self-contained herd of dairy beef calves.  We are rearing three groups - Angus, high EBI Holsteins and low EBI Holsteins.  The first results are coming in now - we do not have them yet - and that project will be ongoing for the next couple of years.  The results will be very interesting.  For me, the one thing that will come out of it is that management trumps all.  If a farmer has a good calf but rears it badly, he or she is still going to lose money, while a farmer with a bad calf who rears it well will have a chance of making money.  That aspect should not be lost in the story either. </p><p> The biggest contribution we can make is via advice and research on how to get the best performance out of calves on the farm, whatever type of calves they might be.  The current issue regarding dairy calves is more a beef price issue than a dairy calf issue.  If the price of beef was &euro;4 or &euro;4.50, then there would be no problem selling all the calves born in the country.  The problem is we have a major profitability problem for every beef animal.  For a suckler farmer, the calves are arriving and there is not much that can be done about that.  They are coming-----</p></speech>

We have about the same number of calves in the country as in recent years, but the balance is shifting.  If there was profit in it, however, there would be farmers willing to buy them, and that is the challenge.  On imported protein, there are two issues.  Beans have been a reasonably successful crop in recent years.  We have a research programme on other crops as well, such as soya beans, but they will be more challenging and require as much or more support as the beans to get going.  The other side of this issue concerns how much protein we need.  We are clear that there is overfeeding of protein to most of our animals, including pigs and cattle.  In the MACC curve, cutting back protein levels is one of the things that will contribute to reducing emissions and that is an area we will address with the feed compounders.  Especially when cows are at grass, there is no need for high protein in the diet.</p></speech>

The next CAP is where farmers are going to get paid for doing these things that are going to make a difference.  How does Teagasc's advice feed through the Department and into the CAP?  I am referring to urea, slurry, clover etc.  This comes down to the fact that if farmers are being paid to do something, they will do it.</p></speech>

There are several mechanisms.  Firstly, we worked very closely with the Department in the preparation of the climate action plan.  Most of the measures in the plan relating to agriculture stem, one way or another, from our research work.  That is one channel.  In addition, Food Wise 2025 is implemented through a steering group of which I am a member.  All the CEOs of State bodies involved in agriculture sit on that committee and it is chaired by the Minister and climate action is a central plank in that process.  Since the publication of the climate action plan, additional steering groups, of which we are members, have been set up.  We work very closely, therefore, with the Department on this area.</p></speech>

There is, however, awareness and I anticipate - though it is not our responsibility - that many of the measures in the CAP will have to reflect the suite of measures we have proposed and are in the climate action plan.  Incentivisation measures will be required at some level and the CAP is the obvious vehicle to push through those.  Again, it is not our direct responsibility but that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is, however, the way I think it will be driven.</p></speech>

One of the big challenges in the years to come will be the availability of labour.  Are structures being put in place by Teagasc to deal with this issue?  I refer to encouraging more joined up thinking.  There is plenty of labour available in the agricultural community, if it could all be harnessed together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019121700002#T01200"><p>A lot of emphasis has been placed on having structures in place, particularly regarding farm partnerships.  Those partnerships could be within farm families or with farmers who want to step down their farming activity or who may need additional labour because of expansion, etc.  That issue is being dealt with.  We have resource specialists in place and Macra na Feirme is very involved through the land mobility service.  This is a good example of where there is much collaboration between different organisations to ensure support systems are in place.  There are ways of doing that and they start with the education level of people.</p> <p>  Even outside of those effects, we are working with farm relief services, FRS, and have been for some years, to provide short course training in milking skills, calf rearing etc.  If a farmer wants to get somebody to help, he or she needs to trust that the helper knows what he or she is doing.  The farmer does not want to have to spend all his or her time showing that person what to do or training him or her.  This is a big step up, therefore.  It has been difficult enough to convince people to release somebody during the first two weeks on the job, in January or whenever.  I refer to that person going down to Kildalton or Clonakilty and spending two days a week for two weeks doing that kind of work there and then returning in a month's time and doing it again.  That is, however, really effective in respect of training programmes for people.  People on those farm courses will have great confidence when they return and farmers are telling us as well that those people come back very assured of what they are doing.  The farmers themselves are even learning a few things or at least asking questions about how things are done.  </p></speech>

Co-operatives use it but it can also be applied to farms.  We are applying those principles to both pig and dairy farming.  The allow farmers to identify more efficient uses of their time, the management of cow flows and the development of a standard operating procedure at calving time, milking and so on.  Farmers waste a lot of time looking for implements or such and getting the milking kit out.  That is an interesting development that we are doing a lot of work and research on.</p></speech>

While farmers might be struggling to get help, especially in the labour-intensive sector, contractors do most of the work nowadays because the best advice was that a busy dairy farmer would be better off getting someone in to do the work.  They are struggling.  There needs to be a holistic view for the farmer and the contractor in order to make it attractive to enter the sector.  There is an idea that some type of apprenticeship should be brought in.  If we do not do that, we will continue to struggle in all areas and there is no point in saying that we will not.</p></speech>

One of the issues we have identified is that there is a requirement for training.  In an area such as land drainage, for example, it is very important that the contractors are trained to the highest possible level.  We can provide that training through our ConnectEd system.  The challenge is that contractors do not always have the resources to avail of that training.</p></speech>

They also impact on television coverage and web streaming.  The second item on our agenda is engagement with Mr. Paddy Malone, chairperson designate of the governing body of Dundalk Institute of Technology, and Mr. Sean Aylward, chairperson designate of SOLAS.  I also welcome Ms Nikki Gallagher, who is accompanying Mr. Aylward.  All the witnesses are very welcome.</p><p>The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement and to allow members of the committee to discuss with Mr. Malone and Mr. Aylward their visions and priorities for the short to medium term and any challenges facing their respective bodies and the people whom they represent.  On behalf of the committee, it is my pleasure to welcome Mr. Malone and Mr. Aylward.  The format of this part of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make brief opening statements of three minutes each.  These will be followed by engagement with members of the committee.  The witnesses will then have the opportunity to respond.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that any opening statement they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>This is an opportunity for us to engage with both of our witnesses in public session.  I call on Mr. Malone to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick W. Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman very much for inviting me to attend today.  I have already circulated my CV so I will not laboriously read through what members already have before them.  It is boring enough.  I am an accountant by profession.  I was born in Dundalk.  I did my bachelor of commerce degree and then trained with Arthur Andersen, which was the largest accountancy firm in the world at the time.</p><p>I, therefore,  have a good grounding in procedures and large companies.  I specialised in taxation, which I will come back to in a few minutes.  After qualifying, I stayed in Arthur Andersen for a year to pick up some experience.  I then worked in the construction industry for two years in Dundalk at which point I was headhunted and asked to get involved in a medium-sized practice in Dublin, which I did.  As part of that, I worked on the audit of a large insurance company that collapsed in the 1980s.  It will not take a genius to work out what company I am talking about.  At 24 years of age, I was the one who wrote the report that caused that company to collapse.  I did it because I was able to prove to everyone's satisfaction that my report was correct.  That was despite the fact three other accountancy firms had audited the company in the previous 18 months on behalf of the Department so I have a forensic way of looking at and reading things if I have to.  That created a lot of challenges for me with other people and I have proven I can stand up to being bullied and whatever else.  I do not like to do that but I can do so if I have to.</p><p> I bought a practice in 1989, which was based in Drogheda, and I ran it while my father was running his practice in Dundalk.  When he died, I merged the two practices and brought everything together in Dundalk.  The practice is wide and diverse.  I deal with everything from small operations to some large companies because of my taxation work.  I have considerable experience, therefore, in the accountancy and business world.  I have been president of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and I have had various posts since 2000 relating to that.  As president of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, I worked in schemes with the then Department of Industry and Commerce and DkIT to advance accountancy students in DkIT to work with the accountancy profession in Dundalk.  I also contacted DkIT, brought it on board and got it actively involved on the board of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce.  To this day, there has been no break in service between Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and DkIT working together for the business community in the area.  I feel strongly about that.  I have also lectured on tax in DkIT on a part-time basis.  As part of the brief on what I have done in recent years, including addressing committees similar to this, I have been responsible in part, or have been the lead, in producing four reports on cross-Border issues and the various economic circumstances in the area.  The first report was done with Louth County Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council in 2010.  The second report was for the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in its discussion on an all-island economy.  The third report was for Project Ireland 2040.</p><p> In the submission for Project Ireland 2040, I was the only one out of more than 300 submissions who called for the recognition of the Border corridor, which is the M1 from Drogheda and Dundalk to Newry.  I am glad the Government listened to what I suggested and it is now in Project Ireland 2040.  The DkIT is ideally placed to maximise the advantage of the M1 corridor.  There are 2.3 million people within an hour's drive of Dundalk and Drogheda.  O'Connell Street in Dublin can only claim that 2 million people are within an hour's drive of it.  Belfast has 1.5 million within an hour's drive and Cork has 500,000 within an hour's drive.  Dundalk and Drogheda can reach a significant area because both Dublin and Belfast are in their proximity.  That is a unique situation.  DkIT's role is to maximise the advantage it has in the region.  The submission I made on the M1 corridor showed I talked about the region and not just about Dundalk.  I am not Dundalk-centric but I see the whole region.  That region is as defined by DkIT, namely Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Cavan.  I feel strongly that the M1 corridor is the route to take forward but it also needs integration between the DkIT and business.</p><p> One success DkIT has had is WuXi Biologics, which is the latest Chinese company to invest in Dundalk.  Some 76% of its intake so far has come from that M1 corridor region.  We are positioned strongly but we need an institute that can grow into a technical university that can stand on its own two feet.  While we have a large population beside us, we also have the threat of National University of Ireland, Maynooth, NUIM, and Dublin City University, DCU, on one side and the University of Ulster and Queen's University Belfast on the other side.  That is both an advantage and a negative but I see it as an advantage overall.</p></speech>

I will take questions from members, starting with Deputy Thomas Byrne.</p></speech>

As I understand it, these jobs are not paid.  It is a labour of love and I know Mr. Malone has a love for his town and his region.  That is an important starting point and I welcome that.</p> <p>  I see DkIT as a pre-eminent education provider, as will most people.  I do not see it as being in competition with NUIM or DCU but as providing an education for the people of the four counties Mr. Malone has mentioned.  We need to make sure an appropriate range of courses is available in DkIT for the region.  The vision of people such as Patrick Hillery and Donogh O'Malley had when these institutes of technology, ITs, or regional colleges were set up originally was to make sure people had somewhere to go in their local area and to ensure the education was of a high standard.  Following on from education, we see research and other things happening, such as links with business.  I do not see business as the be-all and end-all of an education facility.  It is much broader than that.  Business is an important part and third level institutions in general are important economic drivers in their areas that should be maximised to the best advantage but they are institutes of education first and foremost.  It is always important for us to remember education is good in and of itself, at whatever level people take it up.  I want that vision to continue.</p> <p>  I met the president of DkIT last week and it was a productive meeting.  I spoke to Mr. Malone outside just now about it but as a Deputy in the region, with a special interest in DkIT having had family members attend there, I look forward to working with him and Mr. Mulvey as a public representative in the area in whatever way I can.  I wish Mr. Malone well.  I do not have any questions for him.  His good reputation goes before him in the region and I welcome him to the job.</p></speech>

I was impressed by his presentation.  He has gathered a wide range of skills in his life to date and I am hopeful he will bring the expertise he has gained into his new role as well.  I am impressed that rather than talking about Dundalk singularly, Mr. Malone talked about the region.  As someone who represents Monaghan and Cavan, that is important to people in the neck of the woods I come from.</p> <p>  On that point, could he explain the extent of the current relationship between DkIT, Monaghan Institute and Cavan Institute?  Where does Mr. Malone see that role and what room is there to expand upon that relationship that will be mutually beneficial to all the citizens who live within that corridor that was mentioned earlier?  What changes would he like to make to the current set-up in DkIT?  Where does he see room for expansion and where does he see potential risk going forward?</p></speech>

I was impressed with his presentation.  He is clearly well qualified for the position and, like previous speakers, I acknowledge a regional view was taken and a cross-Border view was also taken, which is important and welcome given the location of DkIT.  He identified that there is a less than optimal number of students crossing the Border from the North to study in DkIT.  Can he elaborate on that?  Are there any plans to address that?  A number of issues with the DkIT have come to our attention.  I appreciate Mr. Malone is the chairperson designate and not the president but there are two issues I want to address.</p><p>One is the balloting for industrial action in DkIT in recent times.  Can Mr. Malone offer any observation on whether there is progress on that issue and if positions of the union representatives and the management of DkIT are coming closer together?  The transition to a technological university is also going to be a key issue for DkIT.  Many other institutions have already made applications.  It is going to be a big change for them.  From the perspective of DkIT, how far along is the process?  How does Mr. Malone intend to support DkIT and encourage that process along?</p></speech>

What thoughts and plans does he have as he takes up his position?  I read his CV and listened to what he had to say.  He brings a great deal of experience to the role.  He spoke about the region.  I am a firm believer in the region.  I would like to hear Mr. Malone's thoughts on how he would like to see DkIT developing.</p></speech>

I was going through his CV and I was very impressed.  I have one or two questions.  Mr. Malone mentioned the M1 corridor and North-South relations.  Will he elaborate on that aspect?  What direction or vision does he have for DkIT, and for the students and businesses it serves in the area?  If Mr. Malone is as successful in this as he has been with Dundalk FC, he will be very successful indeed.  I am a great supporter of Sligo Rovers, but I have seen Mr. Malone's track record in recent years.  I wish him well in his new position.</p></speech>

He is taking on a role in which I wish him well.  DkIT has more than 5,000 students and 500 staff.  As others have stated, the institute makes a great contribution not only to north Leinster but also to south Ulster.  We have 1,400 students qualifying every year from the various faculties, including engineering, humanities, business, informatics, creative arts and health and science.  Mr. Malone referred to WuXi Biologics.  More than 90% of DkIT graduates remain within the region.  That provides a powerful injection of fresh talent, energy and motivation to enterprise and the community in general.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Malone well for the future.  His new role will be a big one in the context of seeking technological university status and developing research, innovation and teaching.  I have come here to endorse Mr. Malone as somebody whom I have known for a lifetime.  I know his total commitment, not only to Dundalk but also to the wider</p> <p> region.  He referenced the region several times in what he had to say, including in respect of his contribution to the county development board and, in particular, regarding the M1 corridor.  That is a crucial part of the role DkIT can play in developing our region.  I wish Mr. Malone well in working with the President and the staff of DkIT.  Colleges are struggling at present to decide their direction.  We all accept that technological status is important.  There is a major contribution to be made in the context of cross-Border co-operation.  I wish Mr. Malone well also in getting that co-operation from the board and the politicians who will serve on the board, as well as businesses across the region.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#E00600"><p>I thank Mr. Malone for his presentation.  The big issues have been raised by others.  I add my voice on the cross-Border issue in particular.  The geographic location and history of DkIT indicates that there has been co-operation, along with Letterkenny Institute of Technology which has a similar relationship with the North.  My question concerns Brexit.  It is probably going to go through, considering the results of the British general election.  Talks are also ongoing regarding getting the Stormont Assembly up and running.</p><p>My understanding is that in the North there are two departments with responsibility for education because higher education comes under the remit of a different department from primary and second level education.  Assuming that the assembly gets up and running, will DkIT, under the leadership of Mr. Malone, be engaging quickly with Northern Ireland and the assembly to ensure that the kind of relationships built up can continue?  Discussions are underway concerning who pays if students from the North come South or <i>vice versa</i>.  In general, there will be issues regarding British students because of Brexit, but as I understand it they will not cause too much difficulty.  What are Mr. Malone's thoughts on those issues and engaging north of the Border in the new context we are likely to see in the next few months?</p></speech>

Many of the questions I wished to ask related to Brexit and they have been well formulated by my colleagues.  Mr. Malone can answer the questions in any order he wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick W. Malone" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#E00800"><p>First, I will pick up on what Deputy Thomas Byrne said.  He made an important point.  My father believed in education for the sake of education.  The education he gave me was much broader than a narrow business focus.  That was the case to such an extent that when I wanted to follow in his footsteps and be an accountant, he would not allow me to study any accountancy subject when I was in secondary school.  I got that view of education from my father and I have continued the same process with my children.  I agree completely with Deputy Byrne on that.</p> <p>  Turning to the question about Monaghan, my situation is that while the Minister indicated he was appointing me in July, the first meeting I was able to attend, for various reasons, was only three weeks ago.  I have only recently been able to come up to speed on this topic.  The problem we have is that neither Cavan nor Monaghan is feeding into DkIT in the way that was envisaged.  This is evident from the statistics.  That is why I made reference to Maynooth University and DCU.  People from the Cavan and Monaghan area, particularly the southern parts, are heading towards DCU rather than DkIT.  We are well aware of that challenge and we have begun to address it.</p> <p>  The new plan being drafted envisages the establishment of outreach programmes in Cavan town and Monaghan town and the initiation of blended services by using Skype and other methods of engaging with students in the Cavan and Monaghan area.  We do not have to physically move everybody to the same spot anymore.  We need to get our heads around how education can evolve over the years so that it is not a case of a classroom situation.  That is happening and DkIT is well positioned in the process because one of the great advantages it has is what is referred to as the Carroll Building.  That was bought by the Government in 2004 or 2005 and the interior was completely renovated.  Another &euro;20 million was spent on it and if anyone here is ever going through Dundalk, I strongly recommend stopping and going to have a look at the building.  It is an incredible feat.  It is the only building on the island of Ireland constructed in the 20th century that is considered worthy of world architectural importance.  Bus&aacute;ras and similar buildings did not make it.  The building is so important that if it needs to be cleaned someone has to come from the National Museum to supervise it.  The building works as media centre, however, and it gives us the facilities to reach out beyond the campus.  We have the technology to do that and it is already in place.  The draft plan refers to that.</p> <p>  The draft plan also envisages contact with Northern Ireland and dealing with cross-Border matters.  We have a problem in that area and it is a big one.  It is one I have been campaigning on for nearly 20 years, and Deputy Breathnach will be aware of it.  I am referring to the CAO's attitude towards A levels.  A student in Newry will pursue three or four A levels.  The ranking for that is 150 points, which means that if that student in Newry gets three A1s in her or his A levels, she or he will only get 450 points.  Such a result will not get that student into half the colleges that it should do in the South.  I am talking not only about Dundalk but elsewhere as well.</p><p>The closed attitude towards looking to Belfast or the British mainland in education must be shifted.  That is a challenge for DKIT.  Ten years ago, as president of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, I got Newry Chamber of Commerce to bring final year students from secondary schools in the area to DKIT to show them the institute.  That has been done on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis since then.  I intend to repeat it in Newry and large towns in the area to make them aware of DKIT.  When one talks to people from Newry, Newcastle, Banbridge or elsewhere in south County Down, it becomes apparent that they do not know what DKIT is.  We need to get that message across.  When I first became involved in DKIT it had fewer than 80 students from Northern Ireland, which is 10 km from the campus.  Today, it has approximately 250 students from Northern Ireland.  However, we have 400 Chinese students who have travelled halfway around the world to attend DKIT.  There is something odd about that.  Those Chinese students are paying full whack but, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan pointed out, students from Northern Ireland will not be asked to pay full whack.  It has been settled that Brexit will not have an impact in that regard.<br/><br/>Brexit is the elephant in the room.  I wish I had a pound for every time I have misspoken on Brexit through the past three years, whether on local radio or to international organisations.  It has become a significant problem.  It is infesting all aspects of life along the Border, as Senator Gallagher is probably aware.  Everything one touches is affected by Brexit, and education and DKIT are no different in that regard, even though we do not have many students from Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Opportunities as well as challenges will arise from Britain leaving the EU, as we must accept it will.  A significant amount of research funded by Horizon 2020 and other EU programmes requires the involvement of an English-speaking university.  Oxford, Cambridge and other British universities are being removed from such programmes, which offers an opportunity to universities and technical third level institutes in the Twenty-six Counties.  There will be changes in research carried out in a European context.  Since the Brexit process began in 2016, Queen's University Belfast has been unable to fulfil certain research jobs because it was only able to guarantee up to 2020 or 2021. There are opportunities.  I do not wish to profit from the problems being experienced by Queen's or Ulster University.  I would prefer to work collaboratively with them.<br/><br/>On the 2040 plan, I addressed Queen's University Belfast on what the 2040 plan could mean for the island of Ireland.  I have been critical of the 2040 plan since it was published even though, as a member of Louth County Council pointed out to me, it contains sections on Brexit and the M1 corridor.  The feedback on the 2040 plan is a closed loop.There are three regions in the Twenty-six Counties and they can feed into the national plan, but there is nothing to allow direct feedback on it from Belfast or Stormont.  It is possible that such feedback is gathered indirectly.  Louth County Council and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council signed a memorandum of understanding allowing for co-operation between them on various matters.  I signed it on behalf of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce and Deputy Breathnach also signed it.  It was the first such memorandum between two local authorities in different jurisdictions within the EU.  It has worked well and allowed Newry, Mourne and Down District Council to feed in its views on the 2040 plan.  There is a gap in that regard.  I do not wish to deal too heavily with the 2040 plan.<br/><br/>I refer to the M1 corridor, which forms part of the plan.  I approached Drogheda Chamber of Commerce and Newry Chamber of Commerce with the idea that the M1 corridor would be a single homogenous unit from Drogheda to Newry.  They both bought into it.  It would not be defined on a county border basis.  Although it is to be hoped that County Louth will lead and drive it, it will involve counties Monaghan, Meath, Armagh and Down.  The idea behind it is to advertise the region as a whole.  One of the problems with being a Border county is that people tended to plan up to the Border such that by the time one got to Drogheda, it was already dissipating, by the time one got to the next town, Dunleer, it was almost dead, and by the time one got to Dundalk, it was dead.  We did not see the benefits and we suffered in that regard.<br/><br/>I trained in Andersens in the late 1970s and was exposed to much international business.  The only IDA business to come to the Dundalk region in the period between 1974 and 1994 was Heinz.  It came to the area because its chief executive, Mr. Tony O'Reilly, knew that Dundalk was not El Paso.  I do not like using that term but do so to emphasise my point.  The region must be sold as a region.  If I try to sell Dundalk or Drogheda, it will not work.  We must get across the message that it is a region.<br/><br/>Cross-Border co-operation is of great importance.  I have spoken to people in Queen's, Newry and Warrenpoint about the 2040 plan and the idea of looking North and South.  I have also discussed it with Newry Chamber of Commerce.  The Belfast Region City Deal, which is about to be launched, extends to the Border.  We need to see an integration between it and the M1 corridor.  I strongly believe that there should be integration between all aspects of the two projects.  I have a bee in my bonnet about it.<br/><br/>DKIT is at the centre of this process.  There are 2.3 million people within an hour's drive of Dundalk or Drogheda, whereas there are only 2 million people within an hour's drive of Dublin.  We have three airports and the fastest broadband in Ireland, with speeds of 1 GB compared with an average speed of 250 MB in the IFSC.  We have everything going for us.  We can take the pressure off Dublin and allow for expansion in the region.  There is more zoned land in the area than anywhere else.  Many required aspects are geared up for expansion.  DKIT has the capacity to be the lead partner in it.  I hope I have addressed all questions on Brexit and not flogged it too much.<br/><br/>On technical university status and industrial relations, the industrial action is an operational matter, not a strategy matter and, as such, is not a problem directly for the board.  Of course, the board must address our strategy regarding technical university status.  The president took considerable time over making that call.  The commitment from the governing body based on the draft plan, which will be approved in January, is to go for technical university status.  As such, we will have to merge with another organisation and consideration has been given to the identification of a suitable partner.  Technological University Dublin, which is already up and running, has been suggested.  My personal opinion is that our joining it would be like sticking something onto a much bigger element and would not work.  Limerick IT and Athlone IT were also suggested but they are being funded possibly to link up and create what is being referred to as Shannon technical university.  DKIT is nowhere near the River Shannon.  The third involves Letterkenny IT, Institute of Technology Sligo, Dundalk and the Border counties.  That goes back to tapping into the potential that Brexit offers from the point of view of students wanting an EU education as well as the research funding available in respect of EU projects.  I do not have a closed mind to the first two options, but I know where most work would have to be done.  A decision has not yet been made.  That is the challenge we have.  There was some talk of staying where we are, but if we do, we die.  We will move on and go in that direction.  We envisage servicing a wider area.  There will be technical problems relating to delivering education in two jurisdictions where there are different ways of looking at things.  There has already been co-operation with Queen's and Ulster University.  It is a matter of working out what must be done and then addressing it to the Oireachtas, the Department or elsewhere if necessary and stating that we wish to do this and that it is good for everyone.  The more collaboration there is between universities, the broader the education, as Deputy Thomas Byrne stated, and the greater the variety.  That opportunity is in front of us.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me to set out my vision for SOLAS and further education and training in Ireland over the next five years.  In short, my reason for appearing before the committee is my lifelong belief in the importance of realising everyone's human potential, that is, the capacity to achieve, inherent in every individual, irrespective of his or her initial life circumstances.  Those of us who have been fortunate enough to build our lives and careers in this country know well the value of solid pathways to advancement.  Building and maintaining those supportive, vocational pathways is the central mission of SOLAS.  It is early days, especially in my case, but I have been impressed by how the new SOLAS chief executive and his executive colleagues have embraced the mission.  My board colleagues, whom I met for the first time a few weeks ago, are also fully supportive of the strategic direction being adopted by the CEO and his team.  I do not come before the committee with ready answers to all the challenges SOLAS faces.  It is clear that fundamental issues have to be addressed.  As chairperson, I will work with my board colleagues and the staff of SOLAS to ensure that the highest standards of governance will be maintained in achieving our objectives.</p> <p>  This is a pivotal time for further education and training, FET, in Ireland, as the committee members will probably know better than anyone.  SOLAS and the education and training boards, ETBs, were established and reconstituted, respectively, in 2013 and the concept of an integrated FET system was set out at that juncture.  SOLAS initially focused on setting up a good establishment and developmental approach.  The immediate priorities in 2013 were setting up the organisation, getting the structures and relationships right, and embedding the systems and processes to support planning and funding in the field and the gathering of learner data.  In turn, the first stab at a further education and training strategy 2014-19 was developed as what was intended to be an all-encompassing plan.  It set out many complex and multiple stakeholder arrangements, five goals and 52 detailed actions.  It was an ambitious and challenging agenda. </p> <p>  The year 2016 saw the launch of an action plan for apprenticeships and traineeships, as well as the agreement of national FET system targets with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It also involved the establishment of strategic performance agreements between SOLAS and the 16 ETBs.  This was perhaps the breakthrough moment for SOLAS.  It was the juncture at which a sense of the future direction in which the FET system needed to evolve began to emerge.  The significant progress made over the lifetime of the 2014-19 strategy has put a really strong foundation in place for SOLAS to lead the system into an exciting and perhaps challenging new era, working closely in partnership with the ETBs and the other FET providers to deliver integration, reform and performance improvement.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of the partnerships that SOLAS has forged and will forge in the future.  It is part of SOLAS&rsquo;s statutory responsibility to propose an FET strategy to the Minister every five years.  The work to prepare the second strategy for the period 2020 to 2024 has produced an exciting draft and transformational vision for the next, critical phase of FET development.  Its adoption is not far away, given that 2020 is rapidly approaching.</p> <p>  I was delighted to be put forward to chair the SOLAS board as the new strategy neared completion.  It is an exciting time for SOLAS and the wider sector.  I am impressed at the level of stakeholder buy-in to the ambitious vision for the future in this vital area of education and training.  The new strategy will be based on a structure that goes to the core of FET, a sector that embodies and embraces diversity.  Our learners in the sector come from all walks of life, are aged from 18 to 70 years and above, and span the globe in their places of origin.  In 2019, there were learners in our system in various parts of the country from more than 180 countries, all of them taking part in FET courses.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, FET revolves around skills development, learning pathways and inclusion, and the system&rsquo;s future strategic priorities have been framed around those pillars.  Nevertheless, there is a parallel focus by SOLAS on the main factors that should enable this, namely, staffing and structures, digital transformation, a performance and learner-centred approach, and investment in capital infrastructure.  This will mean that over the next five years, the FET sector will be focused on simplifying the delivery landscape for its services for participants through: the development of an integrated FET college of the future, which will break down the existing divide between further education colleges and training centres; ensuring that communities can more clearly identify with their local FET facility, its diverse array of learning opportunities and wider afield; and a focus on the establishment of much clearer learning pathways, including developing potential links with second level and a more consistent transition approach to higher education, alongside a more modular and technology-driven approach to learning delivery, which will facilitate continual engagement with FET throughout the lifetimes and careers of the individuals who take part.  There will also be a future need in the sector to create more space for flagship developments, which will help to change hearts and mind about the potential of FET for the development of their lives and careers.</p> <p>  On current staffing and structures throughout the country, there are concerns at SOLAS level about the need to break down rigidities in respect of HR, learner support and operational regulations, to facilitate cross-FET service delivery.  Some of our structures may be somewhat traditional and rigid in the sector, and while this has to be explored delicately, I am sure that progress can be achieved with goodwill and full consultation with all the interests involved.</p> <p>  On systems and technology, we all need to acknowledge that the way we in Ireland work, learn, do business and interact with one another is fundamentally and rapidly changed, and that it has changed.  It is clear that we, too, have to change the way learning is delivered and how data drive service delivery, and we need to develop shared financial and other systems to support more robust and efficient management approaches.</p> <p>  Despite the challenges faced by the sector, I am assured that the tools are there within SOLAS to change fundamentally the way that FET is viewed and valued in Ireland, in order that more and more people will recognise that FET can change their lives, allow them to develop themselves personally, engage with their communities and go as far as they want in life.  It can also help people to re-engage with education and take the first steps in returning to work.  When briefing myself for the role, I was impressed when I stumbled across a course for professional lorry drivers that has been developed in consultation with, and to a degree driven by, the industry in the Waterford-Wexford region.  At that ETB, a group successfully completed a 29-week course, delivered at four locations.  I was struck that the participants had an average age of 37 years, they were all unemployed at the time they signed up, and the vast majority of them completed the course and are successfully employed.  It is a success story that illustrates all the points I made earlier about re-engaging, and the opportunity and pathway to future success the sector can deliver.</p> <p>  Another advantage of the FET sector is its flexibility.  It is not tied to a rigid four-year academic experience.  While many of us will have revelled in that experience, it is not for everybody.  There are other options, and the time has come to champion and shine a spotlight on them.  Given the committee's interest in apprenticeships, it is important to state that the direct routes that FET offers into solid careers are invaluable.</p><p>What is truly unique about further education and training in this State is that it offers an opportunity to engage in learning in every community in Ireland, regardless of any previous levels of education.  It puts in place a pathway to progress as far as any individual wants to go.  The impact of further education and training is already transformative.  However, I believe that with the strong direction set out in the new SOLAS strategy, which will shortly come before the committee, this sector can grow its profile and make a crucial contribution to the next critical phase of Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic development.</p><p> There are many other things I would like to say but I feel the hour is moving on so I will stop there.  My further thoughts are set out in the written remarks I submitted in advance.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I am very impressed with his CV and educational experiences over the years.  I would like him to expand on a number of questions.  How does he see his role with regard to growing apprenticeships, which he mentioned?  He was appointed in 1999 and has had experience of engaging with offenders and the role of education in the Prison Service.  Mr. Aylward might expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#H00300"><p>I thank Mr. Aylward for his presentation.  He clearly has a wide range of experience to bring to the role.  His presentation was very impressive with regard to the wide range of opportunities in the further education and training sector.  The sector is now moving in a dynamic way, having gone through considerable changes in recent years.  It has been an adjustment for many people working in the sector.  From my own experience, I believe they have responded very well.  If we are still here as a committee, we look forward to engaging with the strategy for 2020 to 2024.</p> <p>  I have great interest in the area of apprenticeships, having been involved in setting up the council.  I understand the heavy goods vehicle course to which Mr. Aylward referred is an apprenticeship programme.  I may be wrong.  Perhaps Mr. Aylward will clarify.  A wide range of new apprenticeships are being established.  Is that likely to continue?  Is there a continuum of new programmes that are likely to come on stream?  Obviously, we also want to see an increase in the numbers taking up traditional construction apprenticeships because these skills will be needed for the economy.</p> <p>  That brings me to an issue with regard to SOLAS's role.  Mr. Aylward talked about the importance of everybody having the opportunity to develop their full potential, but SOLAS also has a role with regard to identifying skills that will be required in the economy in the future and matching those with individuals coming through training for the first time or returning to educational opportunities at different stages in their lives.  I have just one question in that area.  Mr. Aylward talked about flexibility.  It is certainly a very flexible section.  Obviously, we now have very high levels of employment in Ireland in percentage terms, but many of those who are at work are not highly skilled or qualified and they are often low-paid for that reason.  I want to ask Mr. Aylward specifically about the opportunities for people to increase their level of skills or qualifications while holding down a job, which most people must do to survive.  That is an area in which the further education and training sector can really play a positive role.  I again thank Mr. Aylward for his presentation and I wish him luck.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#H00400"><p>I thank Mr. Aylward for his continuing service to the State.  It is welcome that he is getting involved with SOLAS.  I will not ask him questions.  He is clearly qualified for the job and determining whether that is so is not our role anyway.  For what it is worth, I will share some of my views arising from what we have dealt with in recent years.</p><p>The back-slapping about apprenticeships has to stop.  There have been some improvements but they are coming from a low base.  The challenge is monumental but it must be met.  I am confident Mr. Aylward and the new chief executive can do so.  That is no reflection on SOLAS.  It needs Government direction and direction from society in general, which is not forthcoming.  It needs to come from the media, which continue to publish college league tables with no regard whatsoever to apprenticeships, which are equivalent to degrees, as Mr. Aylward has outlined.  A level 8 apprenticeship is equivalent to an honours degree and a level 9 is equivalent to a masters degree.  There needs to be a change in direction.  I do not know how this would be done.  Should we call them apprenticeship degrees?  I do not know but we need to do something different to give people the sense that the qualifications are exactly the same.  We have to get on the page.  I do not know what writer said that he or she would never encourage someone to do an apprenticeship until official Ireland's children were doing apprenticeships.  People are still of the view that a college degree is required.  Society in general has failed to change that perception.  Mr. Aylward needs to take a radical approach.  We are almost at the floor with regard to the number of apprentices this country is producing.  Statements issued by the Department of Education and Skills have said the overall number of apprentices who ever qualified in Ireland is more than 100,000, which is a meaningless figure.  The figures have improved but they need to improve dramatically.</p><p>I look forward to the strategy with regard to the further education and training colleges.  At the moment, their overall direction is a mishmash.  They are all doing very good work individually but there is no shared direction.  There seems to be a block on the construction of such colleges.  I mentioned one in Dunboyne in my own constituency that is awaiting this strategy.  There is effectively a block on the construction of colleges, the development of the sector, and the education it attempts to provide.  They simply cannot cope with the numbers.  That needs to change.</p><p>A fundamental change needs to be made with regard to developing new apprenticeships.  The current system is essentially employer-led.  A call is put out and employers or organisations are sought to put together apprenticeships.  That will not work.  We cannot continue with the low numbers coming forward.  We need to put other pathways in place to develop new apprenticeships.  That is the only way numbers will actually increase.  I put forward a proposal to start an apprenticeship scheme in the Oireachtas such as exists in the House of Commons.  I ask the Oireachtas to copy and paste that scheme.  I would love it if Mr. Aylward got involved with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and the Ceann Comhairle to look at the House of Commons scheme and get something similar off the ground here.  There are a number of internship programmes in the Oireachtas but we could also have apprenticeship programmes in cooking, media, or other jobs that exist within the Oireachtas.</p><p>If we start doing that within the public sector, it will start to branch out into the private sector.  People want to get with the programme.  The public sector is not coming up to the mark with regard to the provision of apprenticeships.  Some of the semi-State bodies do fantastic work in employing people and always have, but Departments need to get involved.  Mr. Aylward's background and experience provide a real opportunity to get the public sector much more involved in the provision of apprenticeships so that the talk coming out of the mouths of Ministers, ourselves and others - I am including everyone in this - will be met with action.  If the public sector sets an example, this will work.  We need to champion apprenticeships.  The media need to be involved as well.  I urge the <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Times </i>and so on to consider how they could include apprenticeships in their league tables.  It is not good enough simply to have an asterisk to say that other people do apprenticeships.  Maybe SOLAS can provide some help in that regard.  I do not know.  The media would probably need assistance.</p><p>We are aware of another issue that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, highlighted.  This is the issue of the world apprenticeship champions who contested the world apprenticeship games.  They were given very little media coverage on RT&Eacute;.  That is a shame.  I really hope the Minister of State's intervention will change RT&Eacute;'s approach and that they will be given a greater profile.  We are delighted to have them here.  They are such an example to everybody.  The more examples we give, the more readily we can achieve a change in respect of apprenticeships, thereby changing our education system.  It is really important to remember that we are starting from a very low base.  The challenge ahead of Mr. Aylward is absolutely massive.  If I can do anything to assist him, I will.  That has to happen.  The number of female apprentices is also shocking.  It is the one part of society in which there is an absolutely unbelievable gender imbalance.  It is unprecedented.  I would love to see further action taken in that regard.  I am sure it will be.</p></speech>

The percentage of female apprentices last year was 4% and at some previous stage it was 2%.  I commend Mr. Aylward.  He seems entirely qualified for the position.  His presentation was very impressive.  Like Deputy Byrne, I will highlight a few areas.</p><p>Many of the same themes were raised by Deputy Thomas Byrne.  We had a very interesting engagement with the world skills participants.  It was striking that these were world-beaters in their given trade or occupation but many spoke of the support or encouragement they received in their schools to pursue apprenticeships.  That was not uniformly the case but they indicated that there was no great emphasis on apprenticeships in their schools and they were not really encouraged to pursue them.  Third level institutions, universities, the technological universities and institutes of technology might do a bit more but is there scope for SOLAS and using the world skills participants as exemplars to go into schools and outline the potential?  The number of apprenticeships is increasing in recent years, from about 6,200 to 12,000, but is still very low.  The combined allocation for the national training fund and SOLAS has only increased by about 9%, which is not appropriate relative to the increase in apprentices. The number of different trades and occupations is much less than exists in some European countries, where it is well into the hundreds.  In Ireland the number is somewhere in the 40s.  </p><p> I raised instrumentation with Mr. Andrew Brownlee when he was before the committee previously.  It is a really attractive trade with a real shortage of workers.  Many businesses, particularly pharmaceuticals, are crying out for them and it is great for the people who are currently in the trade but many more people could make a very good living at it.  </p><p> I do not mean to be parochial, but I understand that it is not possible to do a painting apprenticeship in Cork now.  One may serve one's apprenticeship in Cork but the classes or SOLAS element requires travelling to Dublin.  This is causing people to pick other trades or discourage them from taking on painting.  That might be more of an operational matter so if Mr. Aylward cannot respond, that is okay, but perhaps he can take a note and look into it.  It is one of the big trades with countless people involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Aylward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019121700002#J00200"><p>We have taken a careful note of everything that the members have said.  My response will not be comprehensive but I will do my best.  I will first touch on the role of the chairperson <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the chief executive.  I have served as CEO to a board in a number of capacities.  I am clear in my own mind that it is up to the board and its chairperson to steer and provide direction and a bit of strategic vision, scanning the horizon, and for the executive and the CEO to do the rowing.  That is not to say that the roles are not equally challenging but it is important that we do not blur them, nor would I want to.  That probably means the committee will see much more of the CEO than me.  However, I hope members are assured that I am prepared to give this all the time that it will take.  I will try to be strategic in my input to the board and in dialogue with the executives who serve it.<br/><br/>I will try to draw together some of the points raised by members.  I spent nine years of my life working with prisoners.  From the perspective of a civil servant, some were very high risk.  At one point I was making decisions every day on what prisoner to release in what was a revolving door situation.  It was a terrifying situation but I took a chance many times, as did my colleagues before and since, on prisoners who we felt had a chance and an offer of a start.  No matter how damaged or how risky the proposition, if there was a chance of a start in life, either a place in a school, college or tech, or just working with somebody, we took that risk on behalf of Ireland Inc. and we were let down very few times.  It is worth taking a chance on people.  I was delighted when I came to SOLAS to discover that it already supports initiatives with prisoners, long before my advent.  It has forged a particular link with one of our most challenged prison institutions, Mountjoy, where it has held TEDx talks and a choir with the prisoners.  It is very interesting to see the people at HQ level making that symbolic involvement.  There are impediments to people who have a criminal record getting jobs in civvy street.  It is tough and every society wrestles with it.  I do not want to anticipate the ongoing consideration on that box-tick issue, that people have to tick a box on a form if they have a criminal record which tends to knock them out of the park even if it was only a modest infraction.  People are very scared of others with certain predilections but as a society there has to be room for redemption, they must be allowed to move on where ever it is possible and safe to do so.  I would like to see more done on my watch on this.  <br/><br/>On apprenticeships generally, the employer is the elephant in the room.  Employers must be sold on the idea of hiring, paying and investing in a young person as their apprentice.  In a recession, risks like that tended to be ducked or avoided.  Now as skills shortages emerge, there may be technically full employment, or close to it, but there are still huge skill shortages.  Employers are waking up and smelling the coffee, realising that this is a good strategy.  More and more are buying into apprenticeships.  The Apprenticeship Council, led by the current CEO of the ESB, clearly is an important actor.  I will sit down with that chairperson.  The dialogue between the Apprenticeship Council and SOLAS is already well developed and cordial.  Things can be done there.  We have to work on it.  We need more stellar examples such as those who came before the committee some weeks ago from the skills competition.  They are the hope for the future.  They have as much to offer as the people in prestigious college PhD programmes.  They will make a great difference in the future and will help to build a new Ireland.  <br/><br/>We are taking a pilot approach on some of the schemes.  The short course whereby people qualify themselves as professional drivers is a 29-week course.  It is not formally an apprenticeship.  The way that employers have embraced it is very heartening.  There are more programmes like that in the pipeline.<br/><br/>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned the need for flexibility by an ageing workforce in order to hold on to their jobs and careers.  An upskills programme is under way all around the country.  Employers can see that their workforces will be challenged in the future and are engaging with it.That is a good programme and I would like to see more of it.  It shows that at any age, one can learn and progress and that both employers and the ETBs and SOLAS are embracing this.  <br/><br/>I have looked at the record, and I know that Deputy Thomas Byrne has often spoken of the social status and esteem in which apprenticeships are or are not held.  Parity of esteem, as I believe the Chairman has put it, is needed.  I would like to see an Ireland where the same gathering is around the CAO form as people look at options for apprenticeships.  Perhaps the CAO form should be given a few more pages and we could level out the landscape.  I know that is an independently managed structure but I would love to live in an Ireland where people and the recognised flagships in the system gave equal value to apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities.  We need to broaden this out.  Were the pages outlining how to apply for an apprenticeship on the same website, it might have a psychological effect.</p><p>The penny might drop and we might see more middle class participation.</p><p> In the context of the capital programme in this area, there were years of recession - to quote the Bible, the years the locusts ate - but money has started to come back into the system.  The Department of Education and Skills controls that capital budget.  I would like to see an evolution whereby more responsibility for that capital budget might be vested in SOLAS.  We have to earn that trust but I think it is the way to go, and it would be coherent and congruent with the other side of our funding operation.  Clearly, a case has to be made to the Department.  While I do not want to sour the view of anyone in Marlborough Street too soon, I would say to them and to anybody else that there is a logic to bringing the two together and putting in more money.  However, I am not making any promises to the Deputy about Dunboyne as that is a process above my pay grade.  I feel the State has to reflect within its investment in the sector a parity of esteem for this important technical branch of education.</p><p> I was intrigued about the reference to Oireachtas apprenticeships.  I was thinking back to my very early days as a civil servant, carrying Jack Lynch's bag into a meeting in Strasbourg and other little moments.</p></speech>

However, it was born out of the Civil War.  One of the people who set up the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation was Una O'Higgins O'Malley, whose father was Kevin O'Higgins, the Minister for Justice in the first Government after partition.  She described the assassination of her father as being difficult, even though she was a small child at that time.  Her entire life was devoted to bringing North and South together in a sense of reconciliation.  Her life was devoted to bringing people from different traditions in Northern Ireland together and to engaging them in the work of the Republic of Ireland.  When the Northern Ireland conflict started in the early 1970s, she responded to that and that is how the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation came about in the first place.  As I said, it has been nearly 50 years and for most of its life the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation has brought warring sides together and has created a safe space that enabled people to work out complex ideas.  There were often heated discussions and there are heated discussions on different matters but we encourage people to listen to each other respectfully, something that is difficult in a world that is dominated by social media and the immediacy of communication challenges but we continue to do that.</p> <p>  Over the years, the scope of our work has evolved and continues to play a vital role.  I mention the threat of Brexit and the political impasse in Stormont and the hope that the talks that are ongoing will come to fruition.  We continue to facilitate meetings with political leaders in the North at the request of the Irish Government.  We engage with political, religious and community leaders; paramilitary groups; victims and survivors of the Troubles.  We partner with individuals and groups working in peace building.  At the same time, we recognise Ireland is changing and that 17% of our population is born outside of the country now.  In recent years, we have opened an integration and intercultural programme, which brings people from different cultures together and engages them in conversations with Irish people in the Republic of Ireland in the interests of developing relationships between people.  That was always core to the work of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.</p> <p>  The other interesting matter from a foreign affairs perspective is we see that women who come from conflict-laden areas and who have suffered greatly as a result of what has happened in their countries arrive in our country still suffering from the legacy of that conflict.  Increasingly, we see that people coming from abroad who are suffering from the legacy of such conflicts and women who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict in Northern Ireland find they have a great deal in common.</p> <p>  The global Ireland strategy, which was launched in 2018, recognises the need to increase Ireland&rsquo;s influence and footprint in a globalised world in the areas of diplomacy; peace; tourism; culture; business; overseas aid; and trade through greater investment and by leveraging relationships with a scattered but influential diaspora.  Through its foreign policy, the global Ireland strategy also supports the global goals of the United Nations, particularly in the areas of international development; peace; education; climate change; disarmament and; security through programmes such as: Irish aid, a better world; UN Resolution 1325, recognising women as important actors in the negotiation and mediation of conflict; and the national development plan.</p><p>Glencree strongly supports Ireland&rsquo;s quest for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in 2021 and the work that is undertaken by our UN peacekeepers as part of the Defence Forces.  The UN Secretary-General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres's, report on peacebuilding and sustaining peace of 2018 stated that sustaining peace in the current climate was a shared task, a responsibility of government with national and regional stakeholders, civil society including women&rsquo;s and youth groups and the private sector.  The secretary-general also stated that there was a need for a "more predictable and sustained financing" of peace actors and emphasised the need to grow a cohort of skilled peace-builders and facilitators who can respond when needed at different levels when conflict arises throughout the world.  Glencree's current work to feed in to the Global Ireland strategy includes supporting the Good Friday Agreement; community and political dialogue, tracks 1 to 3; facilitated negotiation and mediation; women's leadership; future young leadership and peace education, and also sharing the lessons of the peace process.  Mr. Hynes will talk a bit to the international work we have been engaged with so far.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the committee for having us.  Ms Walshe has outlined broadly the work we have been engaged in.  In terms of our own national efforts in respect of the island and the islands of Ireland and Britain, clearly the past three or four years have proved to be unique as regards the pressures that have come on the relationships as a consequence of Brexit.  Despite our own particular stresses at the moment in terms of where we might ultimately end up, we remain committed to the three-stranded process whereby we want to strengthen and develop the relationships between North and South, within Northern Ireland and between Britain and Ireland, with all of the uncertainty that rests around it at the moment.</p> <p>  We have to be cautious in our international work.  No two conflicts are the same.  Our conflict is not identical to any other in the world.  However, we have found in recent years that there is quite a large appetite around the world for the kind of processes that we put in place throughout our conflict.  In a sense, the experience we have and the lessons we have shared are being sought out around the world.  I have just returned from Bougainville where I was working with the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, last week.  Many of the experiences and skills that he had garnered as a consequence of our process in Ireland were deployed as he sought to facilitate a referendum that would consolidate the peace agreement that was made 18 years ago in that part of the world.  Experiences and lessons can be shared as regards the process of taking a particularly violent conflict and creating structures and processes to encourage once violent, perhaps paramilitary organisations to transition into a political atmosphere and political process; issues of trust; issues of weapons; and the big challenge in front of us at the moment, the issue of legacy and how we deal with all of the pain and suffering that is left as a consequence of any conflict involving armed action.  There is an opportunity for Ireland.</p><p>What we have done on this island in the past 20 years or so has been quite dramatic.  I am old enough to remember the 1970s and the transformation of life across the island as a consequence of the peace process is nothing short of profound.  There are possibilities for us through our role in the UN Security Council, should we secure a seat, and those lessons and experiences can be shared around the world.</p><p> I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

All of us in this room and other Oireachtas Members have had good engagement with the organisation over the years in Glencree and at other meeting places.  As Ms Walshe pointed out, it was always important that those meetings were private and confidential to ensure the people who participated regarded them as a safe space.  I compliment them on their work over the years.  I know from speaking to some members of the board that our guests operate a tight ship.  Funding is not always easy to come by and all Oireachtas Members will appeal to Departments or statutory agencies to support the work of our guests.</p> <p>  Mr. Hynes pointed out clearly that there are significant legacy issues to be dealt with and Ms Walshe rightly noted how the conflict affected women in particular, that there was violence against women and that there are legacy issues in this regard.  It is unfortunate that we have not gotten away from the polarisation of politics although, I hope we will.  I wish both governments and all the political parties in Northern Ireland well in their talks, which commenced yesterday.  We sincerely hope that early 2020 will bring about the resumption of the Assembly and Executive because people need decisions made at local level.  Confidence would come from the restoration of the Assembly and Executive.</p> <p>  We need to deal with the legacy issues.  All of us have met families who have been bereaved and never secured justice.  That is true in our cities, my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and the adjoining county of Louth where there were murders and bombings in which people lost their lives and for which nobody has been brought to justice.  Those issues need to be dealt with.</p> <p>  I have made the point at this committee previously that everybody is getting older and families are worried that they will go to their eternal reward without seeing justice for their sibling, parent, son or daughter.  People say to me that they will be gone without hearing the truth about who murdered their brother or sister.  An urgency needs to be attached to this particular work at Government level and within the NGO sector.</p> <p>  I met a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of my constituency work yesterday.  He asked me what I thought were the chances of progress in the Northern Ireland talks and I told him that I sincerely hoped there would be progress because we need it.  He remarked to me that he was a young Garda recruit on 16 December 1983, the day of the murders of Garda recruit Gary Sheehan and Private Patrick Kelly during a kidnapping incident in County Leitrim.  He said that we would want to ensure that we never go back to that era in our country.  We do not want a vacuum in politics either.</p> <p>  I commend our guests on the work they do not only in our country but abroad as well.  I am sure that myself and others are not as aware as we should be of the international dimension to our their work but we welcome the opportunity to listen to them today, compliment them and wish them well in the work they undertake.</p></speech>

I read from the briefing that there are particular physical needs at the centre.  What is the extent of the funding that is needed and what will happen if it is not provided?  How many staff has the organisation?</p><p> We know there is a demand for the centre's work.  Is the centre turning away a number of demands because of constraints?  I would like to get a sense of what the centre is unable to do but which it would like to do if it had more resources.</p><p> I said this on Leaders' Questions when I was questioning the Taoiseach.  I am a bit dubious about Ireland looking for a seat on the Security Council and what Ireland can bring to that because I see our role on the Human Rights Council as being more in keeping with the kind of work we do, our principles and so on.  The centre is supporting Ireland's campaign for a seat.  Why?</p><p> I know that business is part of the Global Ireland strategy.  This committee has been involved in this regard and we have had presentations on business and human rights.  Has the centre had any input into our national plan, which some of us feel is very weak?  There is a need for mandatory due diligence on this.</p><p> In our Good Friday Agreement committee we had a very interesting presentation on legacy from Dr. Thomas Leahy of Cardiff University.  I was just recently reading work that Irish historian P&aacute;draig Yeates has done on a different way of approaching legacy.  Legacy is the real unfinished business from the Good Friday Agreement.  The witnesses might outline what the centre is doing on that.</p></speech>

I have chaired the centre's board for the past five years and have been six years on it.  It is a voluntary board comprising 12 really good people.  We have worked really hard within the constraints that exist.  We are funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the reconciliation fund, which funds four core posts within the centre.  While we are grateful for this funding, it really just keeps the lights on.  There is a big demand for our work, particularly over recent years, with Brexit and the need to facilitate back-channel conversations between people who are not speaking to one another.  It is also a matter of speaking to paramilitaries about a range of things within all that.  Mr. Hynes can speak to that a lot better than I can.</p> <p>  It is also about the vision for the place, which is nearly 50 years old.  The site is owned by the OPW.  It has buildings that are derelict and buildings we use.  In some way we have developed a vision for the place that could be a centre of excellence for peace.  It could be the type of place that would enable a conflict to be engaged with at not just a national level but also a local level and an international level, a place that would bring people together and be able to facilitate learning about negotiation, mediation and alternative ways of dealing with conflict.</p> <p>  For the first couple of years when I joined the board we were nearly wiped out by the recession - there is no point in saying we were not.  The board was in recovery during that time.  The place is moving again, and the work that has been done over recent years has been high-quality.  A lot of that work has been silent and behind-the-scenes, and the thing about being behind the scenes is that nobody sees what is done so it is difficult to get it funded.  That is the situation at present.  We are very confident, however, and looking at other sustainable sources of income that will enable us to support the growth of the centre ourselves.  We need an investment from the Government, though.  I am looking for that investment that will support the growth of the organisation and enable us in the long run to be sustainable.  I do not know if PEACE tenders can ever be fully sustainable, but it is a matter of being more sustainable than we currently are.</p> <p>  Looking at the current Security Council and the power blocs on it, the reason we support the Security Council seat for Ireland is that we think a small country that has had conflict, suffering and trouble may have something to bring to the Security Council.</p><p>I have not given it much thought other than that.</p><p> Did Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan ask me other questions?</p></speech>

I was looking at the global goals.  The UN and other countries have made commitments to meet global goals on the eradication of poverty worldwide and on education, women's issues, peace security, climate action and so on by 2030.  I noticed recently that businesses around the world have also rode in behind this in an effort to mobilise business towards meeting those global goals.  There is always a tension between the protection of human rights and the goals of business.  I wish I could give the Deputy a better answer than that.</p></speech>

The work they are doing fits in well with the image of Ireland and our emphasis on peacekeeping.  I am ashamed to say I did not know as much as I should have known about the work the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation is doing.  Now that we have the witnesses here, we should not let them go because, having read through the documentation provided to us, it would be worthwhile for the committee to ask the Glencree centre for its assistance in part of our work.  The concept of a global peace centre and the fact that the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation is recognised as a UNESCO world heritage site are not well known.

Organisations such as the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation often quietly do valuable work and the public, including me, do not know enough about that work.  Now that the witnesses are here, I hope the work of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation will be a project for us to work on into the future.  It is an exceptionally worthwhile goal to develop a global peace centre.  This is what the world needs.  We can then marry that with the tremendous work done by the Defence Forces over the years as peacekeepers.  When I was Minister for Defence, I had the pleasure of visiting our peacekeepers in various parts of the world.  The respect that Irish troops are held in is fantastic.  We are renowned for our ability in peacekeeping.  We do not go in with all guns blazing and force peace on people.  We have built up tremendous goodwill through the methods we use to build peace.  This is probably one of the most important issues we can get involved in, as is the development of a global peace centre.  The world is bad enough and it needs people like the witnesses to be pushed out to the front.</p><p>We need to show the world we can play a leading role in peacekeeping because our troops have done a tremendous amount of good work through their peacekeeping methods in various parts of the world.  The Chairman has probably visited our troops on peacekeeping missions.  It is tremendous to see the respect that exists for Ireland due to that work.  There is no aggression involved.  It is a skill that has been built up over the years and it is something that cannot be bought.</p><p> I fully support the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation and its development.  We cannot do or say enough to encourage greater publicity for the work it does.  The image of Ireland as peacekeepers is tremendous but much of the work being done is unknown.  We need to push it out front and let the public know.  We will get public support because people have tremendous respect for our peacekeepers.  Those of us who were fortunate enough to serve as a Minister saw that at first hand.  It has been extremely worthwhile to meet the witnesses.  I support the ambition of the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation to develop a global peace centre.  It is a tremendous goal to have and we should push forward with it.  It is entirely in keeping with our peacekeeping missions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Hynes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019121700002#K00400"><p>I thank Deputy Barrett for his encouragement.  As a former Minister for Defence, he is correct that the way in which members of the Defence Forces have conducted themselves in difficult and intractable conflicts in many parts of the world has done a huge amount for the image of the country.</p> <p>  We have experience of building and sustaining a peace process.  At the time, many people considered the conflict here to be unsolvable, yet we did it.  In very complicated circumstances against the backdrop of violence in the 1990s, people changed and took a different path.  Through the encouragement of political leaders of all persuasions on this part of the island, experience has been built up, whether in the period of John Bruton's leadership of the country when he was Taoiseach in the mid-1990s or during Bertie Ahern's leadership of the country as the Taoiseach in office when the Belfast Agreement was signed.  There is a bank of talent available to us at leadership level.  We see the former T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, in his role at European Union level and we have seen him in his former role in Colombia.  All of this serves to illustrate that there is a role for the country and former leaders in this part of the island to bring to bear the experience they acquired in what were politically difficult and testing times.  Many of them took risks in encouraging the peace process.  Deputy Barrett is right to identify that in a world that is not becoming more secure or peaceful, there is something to be said for offering our experience as a small island in a passive way.</p><p>In that sense, I would revert to Deputy O'Sullivan's point.  It is important that we secure a seat on the Security Council and bring the kind of experiences and values that we have to the world.  They are described in many ways as soft power values.  They are not muscular values that go into an area in a dictatorial sense.  They are based on facilitating dialogue and discussion over longer and more sustained periods during which trust is built between parties that have either been in conflict or continue to distrust one another.  In many cases, poor development and poverty in regions around the world are a consequence of conflict.  The destruction that conflict wreaks in various parts of the world has real impacts on ordinary people's lives.  Through a seat on the Security Council or a place like Glencree, Ireland can illustrate that, through long periods of sustained dialogue, one can see the development of trust and the breaking down of enmity between once violent traditions.</p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to the legacy of the past.  This is perhaps one of the most difficult issues with which we have had to grapple.  If we never had Brexit, this issue might be the most dominant facing us in the context of our peace process and the relationships that we have been attempting to cement and sustain over the past number of years.  We acknowledge the role that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, played as the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade during the creation of the Stormont House architecture when we believed we had something that was going to provide a basis for getting people into processes where, even if they did not get justice in all cases, they could as a minimum get the answers they had been seeking for decades.  We remain hopeful that the Stormont House architecture can be activated and that agreements between the governments and political parties can see the activation of those processes.  As the Chairman pointed out, people are getting older and time is running out for many of them to get the answers they have been seeking.</p><p> Regarding the initial point that was made, one of the successes of the centre has been the ability to attract down to our walls or our building very fearful communities and people, people who would be nothing short of terrified at the idea of coming south for repeated dialogues.  Engaging in these conversations represented a major fear on their part, given their particular constituencies or communities.  Unfortunately, we have to keep these conversations confidential.  In many cases, successes are not available to be heralded by virtue of the fact that we are dealing with fearful communities.  As we look forward from today and see the results of last week's British general election, nothing is brought into starker relief than the changing nature of all of the relationships across the two islands, be they between Scotland and the UK, us and the UK, us and Northern Ireland or so on.  We will require an ever more focused, sensitive and careful conversation around what relationships are going to look like over the next number of years.  Nothing brings that issue into sharper relief than the results of last week's election in Northern Ireland.  We will require conversations that are inclusive and continue to manage the concerns, hopes and aspirations of the two communities based on the fundamental principle of the agreement, that being, parity of esteem.</p><p>Both communities are equal, the aspirations of both are equal, and both cultures and traditions are equal.  This will require careful management in terms of how one gives the concept of parity of esteem practical application.  That is important.  In the years since the Brexit referendum, and recognising as we did what a profound impact it would have, we have continued to believe that these conversations are as vital as any public debate.  While public debate is important, it is in quiet and carefully managed environments where people can relax and move into a sense of ease around their concerns about what the future might look like.  In that sense, those conversations will continue.  They will not necessarily get publicity, because they cannot, but it is important that they continue, given the challenges that we will face following Brexit and the ongoing shifts and trends emerging from last week's elections.</p></speech>

I wish them well in their future endeavours.</p> <p>  I appreciate that our guests have to respect the confidentiality and privacy involved in much of their work, but speaking in the broadest sense, has the centre had any role in working and speaking with the various parties in Northern Ireland since the Assembly crashed almost three years ago?  Talks are under way at the moment to try to restore a functioning Assembly.  We are broadly aware of the issues that divide the main parties in the North, for example, the approach to the Irish language.  Could our guests give us an overview?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the importance of integrating refugees and ending direct provision.  Those are goals or aspirations to which we would all aspire if we want to bring the situation to a better place.  In the D&aacute;il last week, I raised the issue of people who found themselves undocumented.  They came to Ireland on some type of visa or permit and overstayed it.  They represent a significant cohort of people - we are told that there are approximately 26,000, including their families.  The majority are working in our communities and contributing very positively to society, but they have found themselves in this lacuna and needing to work in the shadows.  The committee and its individual members advocate for the undocumented Irish in the United States.  There is a parallel here, but our country has been found wanting.  We are lagging behind in addressing this issue.  Do our guests have relevant experiences that they could relate to us?</p> <p>  On the matter of a centre of excellence, it was mentioned that our guests were hoping to enhance their facility over the next one to three years.  Have they drawn up detailed plans?  I presume this issue links to what the Acting Chairman has been saying about the UNESCO world heritage site.  I agree with him, and it was news to me.  It is something about which our guests need to make people more aware.  How far advanced is the work?  Will the facility be on the existing site?  Will it be a new build or will the old building be refurbished?  Have our guests been speaking to the Office of Public Works or Departments about it?</p><p>Does the OPW have a plan for how this will be rolled out?  In its submission, the centre spoke of fostering new streams of sustainable income.  Will our guests provide further details on that?  Will they provide an overview of one's existing fundraising models and the type of fundraising events they do with support from some corporate bodies?  What are the limitations the centre is experiencing with its potential and capacity because of the constraints on its funding?</p></speech>

I meet representatives from various parties, several times a month in some cases.  In addition, I meet with particular communities, drawing from the loyalist community as well, to encourage discussion around the issues which have bedevilled us over the past two years.</p> <p>  As stated previously, Brexit has caused a profound disturbance with regard to everything in terms of where we are going.  I do not think we can discount the impact of Brexit on the politics of relationships over the past several years.  We also had the opportunity to meet many of the European Union's Foreign Ministers and Ministers with responsibility for and European affairs.  I would have brought them either to the Border or met them here.  We would have included political representatives, North and South, in discussions with them, as well as the 27 ambassadors resident in Dublin as part of the EU missions.  This is an effort to explain and broaden the discussion around where we think the issue will go in the future.  For many of these ambassadors, this is a complicated issue.  For many of them trying to understand the sensitivity of the Border and so on, this has proved worthwhile as an exchange.  We were able to introduce people to concepts and challenges at European level, as well as to engage with political people north of the Border with a view to getting their fears and concerns around where Brexit might ultimately leave the island, not just in political but economic and social terms.</p> <p>  For the past several years - I am somewhat constrained by confidentiality in terms of names and details &ndash; there have continued to be conversations which touched on all of the issues affecting the resuscitation of the institutions, as well as the wider impact of Brexit, the issues which will fall out of that and wherever we may end up in the years ahead.</p><p>These conversations touch on legacy, as well as economic and social issues.  For example, they touch on education issues in Northern Ireland, particularly where communities are disadvantaged as a consequence of poor educational attainment and poor employment opportunities that follow.  All of these issues are important to these communities.  We continue to host discussions and dialogue on them in an effort to make people both in the South and the North aware of the importance of addressing these issues.</p></speech>

As a result of Brexit, they have become fractured.  We are looking to develop a piece of work across the island that would engage young aspiring political leaders and civil society leaders to develop relationships and get to know each other.  The past couple of years has made people return to their own tribe or particular perspective.  There is also a sense of disengagement in the South around that.</p> <p>  The other issue which comes up in those conversations is the binary nature of a border poll, namely, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  There is a limited engagement with the complexity of a border poll.  When one looks at the referendum on Brexit, which has taken three years and, God alone knows, how it will work out in the coming years for them, we need to be cautious around this binary point of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</p> <p>  What do people from the South understand about unionists&rsquo; and loyalists&rsquo; attachment to the British Crown and being part of the union?  There needs to be conversations among unionists themselves around this issue.  Those of us in the South need to engage a bit more with that.</p> <p>  Around the intergenerational issues, there is a lot of emphasis on the legacy of the past.  There is a younger generation who are caught by the past, by what has happened to their people and their neighbours, and who see reconciliation as a betrayal.</p> <p>  That shows some of the complexities involved.  As most members know, 21 years in a post-conflict situation is a short period.  There needs to be attention to the legacy but also the capacity of and space for young people to make their own decisions.</p> <p>  The Glencree site has a complex ownership arrangement.  It is owned by the OPW.  We will complete a feasibility study soon, which is looking at what can be done on the site which will enable us to look for sustainable sources of income.  The site itself is owned by the OPW.  We own some of the buildings on the site.  We own 16 acres at the back of the centre itself.  We have a plan for that.  We are engaging with a range of agencies, such as Wicklow County Council, the LEADER programme, as well as private finance, in the development of that.  We have engaged with the OPW which has given a commitment to refurbish a particularly important building on the site.</p> <p>  In terms of our fundraising, for the past five years I have been there, it has not been particularly successful.  In a sense, the public profile of the place is poor.  We have not had the resources to develop and document public profile or what work has been done.</p><p>This is the reason we are looking for investment, not just from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but from the Government itself as a confidence measure in building the momentum to develop Glencree, that has 50 years of all this experience that we could share not only with the world but with ourselves and develop it as a peace centre.  We are probably a bit further than the beginning of that.  We seek support across the Government for the investment we need in human resources so that we can respond to the work we are being asked to do as well as the capital investment that will be needed in the centre itself, while also recognising that we have one fairly developed idea for a sustainable source of income.  That is something I can speak to the committee on if it wishes.</p></speech>

Mr. Hynes and Ms Walshe are very welcome.  I am sure they will get the sense from members that we want to be supportive of Glencree's work.  I wish to record my thanks for the work the centre has done over the past 45 years, it is ground-breaking.  Glencree's geographic isolation helps with its work.  It is not that easy for people to drift off or go out but it also brings people together on the one site which helps in discussions.  People can meet and interact over a cup of tea or sandwich, which is one of its positive things.</p> <p>  The representatives spoke of funding and so on.  We need to get a sense of what percentage of that they seek from the Government, from private sector and so on.  Can they give a ballpark figure?  They do not have to give us that today, but it would be helpful if we are making a recommendation to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p> <p>  Ms Walshe said that the centre would do more if it had more.  I am trying to tease out what more it would do.  We are all struck with the idea of the global champion for peace and reconciliation.  That would involve the Irish Government being more vocal, taking the lead and new approaches on many issues.  Is the international peace centre of excellence modelled on anything in other countries?  Can the representatives expand on where it has worked elsewhere and how it could be tweaked?</p> <p>  I note what Ms Walshe said on Brexit.  It brought fear, uncertainty and the potential for greater division on the island.  The long shadow is still there and there is still potential.  I read the appendix to the opening statement with which we were provided.  Language is important.  According to the appendix: "The threat of border polls along with the concept of a united Ireland being used as a weapon by some and a justification for a return to violence by others, has reignited old fears and tensions as people retreat towards their own tribe."  To whom does this refer?  I do not like the language referring to the tribal conflict.  I am proud of the tradition that I come from which is very much a republican tradition.  There are different traditions within republicanism.  One of the successes of the current Sinn F&eacute;in leadership was that it convinced those who believed in the tradition of armed struggle that there was a peaceful way forward and part of that was a border poll.</p><p>We told people that if they believed in a united Ireland, there was a peaceful way to work towards that goal.  A very important concept in the Good Friday Agreement was that there is a way forward towards unity and peace in Ireland.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on that.  </p><p> The work Glencree does is significant, not only for Ireland but also in creating a space for people from abroad to travel here and have these conversations.  During the Irish peace process, it was felt necessary at one point for republicans or members of Sinn F&eacute;in to travel to South Africa when Nelson Mandela was the country's President.  Unionists and others also travelled in those early days, which meant people could interact for the first time.  Having people in the same room and having conversations was important.</p><p> We need to put our heads together collectively and see how we can move this project forward.  It would enhance the view of Ireland held by people around the world.  We have been through a troubled past.  I like to think that conflict is behind us and we are moving into a new era.  I am conscious that the political parties are sitting down in Stormont.  I have every confidence that we can find an agreement to move on.  We tend to look back.  There is agreement among the parties on legacy issues.  Many of the big issues on which there has been tension have been agreed in other meetings.  It is about people putting their heads together and tweaking existing agreements.</p><p> I did not want to bring a negative note to the discussion but I would like the witnesses to expand on where they see the threat coming from with regard to a Border poll.</p></speech>

The remarks on the Brexit poll reflect what we have heard in many loyalist and unionist communities.  It is the absence of a conversation about what a new Ireland would look like in the event of a Border poll switching sovereignty from London to Dublin.  Article 1(5) of the Good Friday Agreement asserts that whoever holds the sovereignty over the territory of Northern Ireland shall exercise it with rigorous impartiality in regard to the hopes, traditions, aspirations, cultural identities and so on of the two traditions based on the concept of parity of esteem.  Many loyalist communities are not feeling parity of esteem.  We in this part of the island must acknowledge that we may have to do more by way of engagement around the concept of a united Ireland, an agreed Ireland or whatever we want to call it.  Loyalists see Border polls and the concept of a united Ireland as an age-old republican demand.  From my discussions with republicans, I am confident that is not what is intended, but it illustrates that in the absence of an appropriate conversation and a real level of engagement with loyalists on an inclusive basis, we will see an increased sense of fear.</p><p>It is the potentiality of their minority status in Northern Ireland which is creating a huge level of disturbance.  As I said in earlier remarks, the results of the recent elections will only serve to deepen their sense of estrangement from the direction that things are going, which is away from where they feel most comfortable.  Whatever happens in the future, from their perspective, and I do not want to get into the detail of what they felt is wrong with the arrangements on Brexit Boris Johnson made prior to the general election, clearly many of them have a deep sense that this was a betrayal of what they thought they had got before.</p><p> In the context of the general movement towards a new set of relationships, whatever they will be post Brexit, we have to endeavour as best we can to include them in these conversations.  We have to recognise that the starting point will be, "I do not want to be Irish", "I do not want a united Ireland", "I do not feel Irish" and "I am British and I want to stay part of the Union".  If we accept that, and in that very first section of the Good Friday Agreement we all acknowledge that as a legitimate aspiration, the challenge for us is to frame a conversation in that context so they do not feel threatened and so we can have reasonable conversations around the nature of the relationship we will have to have with them, as a community, and, in essence, with the United Kingdom.  In the future, they will be a community who will have a British identity and, I suspect, they will in all probability seek, as nationalists have done in Northern Ireland, the involvement of the United Kingdom in some role or way in an effort to give expression to that identity in the future.  Again, what is that conversation and what does that new architecture or structure look like?</p><p> It is important that we start those conversations in order to assuage the fears they have that, in some way, they are going to be trampled upon or there will be a small corner somewhere that we will find for them.  The conversation has to be that they will be equal.  Everybody on the island is equal.  It is a matter of equality, and they are as equal as me or anybody else in that conversation.  That will be the best start.  Their fear will be that the long sought-after victory of a united Ireland will be their defeat but we cannot embark on that road.  That is the challenge for all of us on this island, namely, how we frame that conversation and how we develop those structures and that architecture, so they do not go into a room feeling that the outcome is front-loaded to their detriment. </p></speech>

At the weekend, I attended a funeral in Dundalk of a former German refugee from the Second World War.  There were three of his original comrades there who spoke about how they came to Glencree, which was the original refugee centre during a portion of the Second World War.  I could not help but think of the importance of the iconic Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.</p> <p>  More importantly, I came here today to support, acknowledge and thank Mr. Hynes, Ms Walshe and their staff, and Mr. Hynes mentioned the voluntary board of 12 people, who have impressed me greatly.  I am delighted to be part of what they are trying to achieve.  People talk about the heroes of conflict but I see them as the unsung heroes of conflict resolution.</p><p>It has been a privilege to be involved since I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I acknowledge the work our guests do tirelessly, to use their choice of word, and behind the scenes.  More importantly, as someone who - as I often say - lives the Border, I understand, like most people, where they are coming from and the importance of discretion.  They are not on the radar in the way they should be to get the centre up and running and in that regard, I support them and wish them well.<br/><br/>Our guests spoke about the need for people to engage.  There are initiatives such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, youth parliaments and so on.  It has struck me, as a public representative of 25 years, that often we do not know our own local public representatives on the far side of a little drain or what they are doing and <i>vice versa</i>.  There are great opportunities for Glencree with schools, youth leaders of various persuasions and local public representatives.  Since I was elected to the House, I have been struck by the need for further engagement, such as is done through the Good Friday Agreement and the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, to get to know our public representatives of different faiths, hues and opinions.  Perhaps we would have a better understanding of one another if we did more of that.<br/><br/>I hope our guests will keep up the good work because they are making strides.  Without divulging any sensitive information, given that I am conscious of the discretion of the centre's work, it is important to mention one aspect of their work of which they may not even be aware.  An elderly father of one of the first disappeared victims, when people did not talk about the disappeared, eventually visited the scene of where his son was murdered, shortly before he died.  That, in itself, is a testament to the centre's work.  It was a simple gesture, not through Glencree but through other organisations with which it has worked, that linked the father with the site.  I am also aware of many similar cases.<br/><br/>I commend our guests on their work.  That was my purpose for attending the meeting and I thank the committee for allowing me to say a few words.</p></speech>

Sometimes the language used could be softer or more mindful of people coming from different perspectives and world views, and sometimes language is used as a weapon.  We need to mind our language in respect of what we want or what is needed.</p> <p>  We seek an investment of &euro;2 million over the next three years, which would be invested in human resources at Glencree to enable us to do more.  We do not expect it to be an ongoing drain on Government resources but we are operating at a thin level.  In order for us to be able to do what we need to do, we need the investment over the next three years.  We are looking for approximately &euro;700,000 per year for three years to help us to resource the organisation.  The resource the organisation needs is a human one, that is, skilled people, as well as the need for IT equipment for the centre.  We need to be able to employ people who can do the work and develop sustainable streams of income.  Other capital spending will be needed through the Office of Public Works and other sources but we have not tied that down.  The most immediate requirement is an investment in the work of Glencree.</p><p>That is aside from the reconciliation fund.  We get approximately &euro;270,000 a year from the fund, which pays for some activity and a few core positions.  The organisation needs that to develop.  We are not looking for that money from the fund; we are looking for it from the Government itself, as a confidence measure in our work going forward.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome to the meeting Mr. Stephen Teap and Ms Lorraine Walsh, both of whom were patient representatives of the 221+ Patient Support Group.  Stephen Teap remains the representative for this group.  In advance of our meeting tomorrow with the RCOG assessors, the Department and the HSE, it is important that we hear from representatives of the women and families impacted where there was failure to prevent cervical cancer or a failure that led to a delayed diagnosis.</p><p>I wish to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements you have made to the committee can be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on Mr. Teap to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to highlight the importance of the cervical screening programme.  Since the beginning of this debacle, I, along with Vicky, Lorraine and others, have spoken about the importance of women continuing to get their smears taken and continuing to participate in the screening programme.  Screening saves lives and the CervicalCheck screening programme has saved many lives.  The odds of the screening programme picking something up are in favour of the women who participate.  This has been a difficult conclusion for me to overcome given how it completely, 100%, failed my late wife, Irene.  However, the facts are evident and even CervicalCheck screening, a programme "doomed to fail", as described by Dr. Gabriel Scally, has saved lives.  That being said, many lives have been lost as well.  Many families have been torn apart and destroyed.  Many women have beaten cervical cancer but have to live with the high price of beating such a disease with life-long complications, including infertility and psychosexuality.</p> <p>  When I went public in May 2018, it was to raise myself to a level where I could have a voice to get the answers for my family on what happened to Irene.  It was also to influence those people to uncover the failures in our screening programme to ensure what happened to my family never happens to any other family.  If the true meaning of failure is to highlight the mistakes of the past, learn from them and correct them to ensure they never happen again, then Dr. Gabriel Scally's recommendations are key to this and should remain the backbone in addressing these failures.  Of the 116 actions the HSE has identified in Dr. Scally's recommendations, a total of 95 are now complete.  A little over 80% of the implementation plan has been completed.  I acknowledge the hard work of many people in the HSE who have been working tirelessly in achieving this and the transparency they have provided to Lorraine and I over the past year in oversight of this plan.  That being said, I have concerns about its fulfilment and reaching 100% completion.  Oversight of the implementation plan will drive it to fulfilment.  We need to continue to shine a light on the progression of the plan.  The oversight needs to continue.  We must ensure a plan is in place to review the ongoing actions that have been implemented, while following up to ensure they are still being worked on in future.  Restoring trust in the screening programme will not be achieved simply by this plan.  We must start listening to the voices on the ground especially those of doctors, consultants and nurses in clinics throughout the country as well as the staff within CervicalCheck.</p> <p>  Currently, in the colposcopy clinics throughout the country, the wait time for referrals to be seen within four weeks for high grade abnormalities is at 70% while for those waiting to be seen within eight weeks for low grade abnormalities the figure is at 57%.  This, in addition to what we have heard about staffing issues, in particular the inability to retain staff due to the extraordinary stress levels they face daily, is of major concern.  If we do not get this right, it will only continue to worsen as we see the introduction of human papillomavirus screening next year.  While the HSE and the Department of Health will argue that additional funding has been put in place to address this, I am concerned that not enough is being done and that this will be another problem facing all of us next year.</p> <p>  I have spoken on several occasions about the importance of patient representatives and medical professionals working together with one voice to give a view from the ground up.  We talk about the culture in our healthcare system that needs to be changed.  We know this cannot be changed overnight but we can start to dilute that culture by voicing our concerns together on the back of our common goal, which is to improve healthcare for everyone, not only for those who rely on the system but for those who work within it as well.</p><p>I have spoken to the Minister for Health and the Department of Health on a number of occasions about setting up a proper, structured, patient representative platform to help with this.  Patient representatives who enter our healthcare system do so to make positive change but most, like Ms Walsh and I, do so coming from tragic backgrounds.  There needs to be more of a structured platform to support us while proactively encouraging the patient voice to be involved in shaping our healthcare system, instead of exploiting those who enter on the back of a tragedy.  It needs buy-in from the medical professionals, along with the colleges.  They should be a part of shaping this platform also.</p><p> I want to acknowledge those who spoke out recently on the ongoing issues on the ground and commend them on their courage, in particular to those voicing their concerns around the staff in the clinics and CervicalCheck, whose voices are limited in what they can say.  I want to thank them for speaking out.  Working together will be the key stepping stone as we move forward to not only restore trust and confidence in our screening programme, but also rebuilding the confidence in the key relationships in our medical care, and also that of our GPs who we all rely on.</p><p> Now that RCOG has finally reached a conclusion our focus has been on those who have been impacted by this.  I want to especially highlight the 159 women and families who, over the last three months, received discordant results from their participation in the CervicalCheck screening programme.  These women and families like the 221 last year have come to learn of missed opportunities due to a delayed diagnosis on the back of slides that could have been read differently first time round.  Now all these families are left in the dark, like those of us in the 221 who received audit results last year.  They now face the many questions we faced when receiving this news.</p><p> What does all this mean?  For the last 17 months, Ms Walsh and I have been requesting that funding be put in place so those who wish to have independent reviews can have them in order to get to the truth of what went on.  Many of the families cannot afford them.  They are complicated and are not cheap.  One gentlemen who learned about the misreadings of his late wife&rsquo;s smear tests called to my house recently.  He said that he owed it to his wife to find out the truth of what happened to her and that he also owed it to his family.  This is what it is all about - the truth.  To us the truth is all that matters.  I never bought into the RCOG review from day one because I knew it would not give the women and families all the answers they required.</p><p> We are all fully aware of the limitations of screening and for some an independent review has highlighted this for them.  Now these families can get closure.  Others have not been so lucky and our journey continues in the adversarial system that is the only route available to us in getting to the truth of what went on in these reviews.  The limitations of screening have been spoken about on a number of occasions.  Some critics refer to these limitations as the only thing at play here.  Without a properly defined explanation of these limitations, the conversation has gone askew.  For many of us, it has been hurtful to listen to.  Without a proper, recognised, published document we can all refer to, we have started to see this term being used as a blanket excuse to downplay what is going on here.</p><p> We must remember that screening is not perfect and that it comes with its limitations.  However, we must also remember the labs that outsourced smear tests to other labs, behind the HSE's back and without approval and the lack of quality assurance that was in place and that none of the labs that were outsourced to was ever checked.</p><p> We must remember that Dr. Gabriel Scally only visited seven of the 16 labs, as the remainder either did not exist anymore or there was no point in visiting them.  We must remember also that Dr. Scally could not comment on the quality of those labs back in the day as he physically could not go back in time to review this.  He was clear that any opinion he had was based on whatever information was provided to him.  For the most part that information was extremely difficult for him to obtain.</p><p> For all these reasons, it is so very important for us to find out the truth individually.  It is why we have been asking for the support of the Government in helping us achieve this.  Not supporting the women and families in determining the truth will be this Government's biggest failure in this debacle.  Contracting our screening programme to labs in the United States, the systemic failures within CervicalCheck and the lack of quality assurance around the additional labs that the HSE was unaware of have all had a devastating impact on many lives.</p><p> We are years away from determining a final conclusion on all this as we are waiting to hear how many of these slides either fall within the limitations of screening or breached the duty of care of the women who participated in this programme.</p><p> For now, all we can do is focus on the women and prioritise on correcting the wrongs of the past.  Screening will and should save lives.  We need to continue to focus on implementing Dr. Scally&rsquo;s recommendations, so we can have the best possible screening programme, one that the women and families can rely on.</p><p> We also need to continue to build on the incredible legacy the amazing Laura Brennan left for us, and continue to move forward with the HPV vaccinations for girls and boys, which is being done.  To get to the point of eradicating this dreadful disease, we need to look after women with the best cervical screening programme we can all trust and rely on while at the same time we must protect our future from HPV by educating and supporting parents on the importance of the HPV vaccination.  I very strongly believe we can achieve this and prevent what happened to my wife and family from happening other families in the future.</p></speech>

No citizen of this country would seek this trauma out.  Myself and the other women in the 221 group were told of a potential missed opportunity to detect our cancers at an earlier stage.  This was compounded by the fact that this information was withheld from us.  It threw us into a black hole.  We all needed and wanted the truth.  As patient advocates, this is what this journey for Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. Teap, and myself is all about.</p> <p>  Why do we do what we do as patient advocates?  We do it to try to restore trust in the system for ourselves, which in turn will help restore trust in it for others.  We bore the pressure of that for the benefit of everyone.  We did not want what happened to us, the needless pain, loss and suffering, to happen to anyone else.  Advocacy has been a chance for us to rebuild hope and trust but it comes at a price.  It has been cathartic, heartbreaking, emotionally draining and has had a huge impact on our everyday lives and work, relationships and mental health.</p> <p>  Dr. Scally&rsquo;s investigations and subsequent reports brought many answers but not every answer.  Dr. Scally stated it was a system doomed to fail.  He said the scoping inquiry concluded that on the basis of visits to laboratories and examinations of their records, there was no reason those laboratories currently providing screening for CervicalCheck could not continue to do so.  He said it was not feasible to reach conclusions on how satisfactory, or otherwise, the operation of the laboratories which provided services to CervicalCheck in the early years of the screening programme was.  Some of the labs no longer exist, some no longer conduct screening and, in any event, making such retrospective judgment was not feasible.  The final report of the scoping inquiry recommended that audits should continue to be an important component of cervical screening.  It is important that clear priority is given to clinical audit of contemporary screening services so that improvements can benefit women in the short term.  Dr. Scally reported on huge deficiencies in oversight, procurement, quality assurance and auditing of the system.  His findings gave insights into what went so wrong for so many of us.  The real success of his report and recommendations can only be appreciated when it is fully implemented.  This is paramount for the future success of screening.</p> <p>  The Royal College of Obstetricians Gynaecologists was commissioned to compile a report into individual cases to see if there were missed opportunities, and if so their implications for women.  RCOG found an array of missed opportunities in relation to screening, together with some colposcopy management concerns.  The HSE worked on the communication and disclosure of this information and put much effort into working with clinicians to ensure that the women and families were treated with sensitivity, respect and compassion, and given the appropriate support they needed to process what was for many heart-scalding information.  I want to thank each and every person involved in this process, as by and large the feedback from women and families was very positive in relation to the disclosure.</p> <p>  However, my own experience has not been positive or reassuring in seeking the truth in relation to RCOG.  I had worked closely with the HSE over the last year on the planning of RCOG and giving the patient&rsquo;s voice in this.  The reports finally started to filter through in late August-early September.  From an early stage, it was clear there were various issues in relation to accuracy of the information in reports, which were continuously returned to RCOG by the HSE.  Examples of these included incorrect smear dates, incorrect diagnosis dates and incorrect staging of the cancer.  On one call to discuss the issues it was suggested that there were cutting and pasting issues arising that may have been contributing to the inaccuracy of the reports.</p><p>On 2 October, I was contacted by the HSE and informed that following the return of the slides from RCOG to the laboratories that a mislabelling issue with regard to the slides of three women had been identified.  The labels had been removed and replaced on the incorrect slides.  Two of the three women involved in this mislabelling were Vicky Phelan and me.</p><p> On 3 October, I attended a CervicalCheck steering committee in Department of Health, where I voiced my concerns about the verification of reports and the quality assurance process involved in the checking of reports before releasing.  I had been appointed to this committee in June 2018 by the Minister for Health to give a voice to the women involved in the CervicalCheck debacle.  Meanwhile, women were feeding back to me that the reports they were receiving still contained inaccurate information.  I was placated and informed there was no need for any concern and was also informed that people did not like my tone.  I knew what that meant so I retreated to a position of silence.</p><p> Finding the reply at the CervicalCheck steering committee unsatisfactory, I raised the matter with the 221+ board group.  We wrote to Department of Health on 9 October reiterating our concerns.  It replied on 11 October.  I have copies of this correspondence for the committee.</p><p> People often forget what is said, but we do not forget how we are treated.  Eventually, I had enough of being treated as though I was not worthy and did not matter so I removed myself completely.  My resilience could no longer sustain the pressure.  A culmination of feeling irrelevant, the inaccuracies in the RCOG reports of which I was aware from the HSE, women contacting me directly regarding inaccuracies, and the amount of time I felt I was wasting not being listened to, forced me to resign, an act I did not take lightly but had to for my conscience.  I wrote to Minister for Health on 31 October advising him of my resignation.  I did not include my concerns in my resignation letter as I did not have any proof at that stage, but I did tell him exactly the reasons I was resigning when he called me that day.</p><p> On 15 November, I receive RCOG's first report, which outlined that my one and only slide prior to diagnosis from June 2011 was unavailable.  By the report's classification, this slide was in the concordant group.  On the same day, my solicitor received a three page letter from HSE outlining the movements from June 2011 of my slide, which was deemed "unavailable" by RCOG.  Ironically, the first and last paragraph refer to the fact that the errors would have no impact on my RCOG review.  At approximately 6 p.m. on that day, the HSE called to say that RCOG had produced its second report and that it would be hand delivered to Galway.</p><p> On the following day, 16 November, two very kind and compassionate ladies from the HSE, with whom I had worked closely through my advocacy, hand delivered the second report to my home.  My husband was so angry that he could not even stay in the house and had to leave.  He was angry but, I think, more hurt that I was so upset.  For the record, I have the utmost respect for the HSE employees who have worked with us.  They have always treated us with absolute respect.  RCOG's second report showed that the missing slide had been found and my report was now classified as a discordant result.  I became the victim of my own concerns.  I voiced my concerns to the most senior people in the health system but it would seem that women are still not being listened to.</p><p> It is important from our experience to caveat the RCOG aggregate report findings with the following points.  A little over half of the approximately 1,850 women invited to participate, who had screening prior to diagnosis through the CervicalCheck programme, did so.  A total of 1,038 participated, which is a 56% participation rate, so we are not looking at the full picture.  While not questioning the clinical assessment of each case, from our experience the accuracy of the administration of these reports and how the information was processed has not been accurate in some cases.  A statement signed on 18 April 2019 by RCOG and three other organisations working in the UK&rsquo;s cervical screening programme stated there was an urgent need to address the outdated IT systems that support UK screening.  It also stated the UK programme's IT infrastructure was deemed not fit for purpose in 2011 and that since then, little progress has been made.  This raises concerns about the integrity of RCOG's statistical reporting capabilities.  RCOG's success is based on percentages of discordant versus concordant but the percentage of concordant would seem skewed and non-intuitive.  Cases involving missing slides were classified in some cases as concordant when they should intuitively have been classified as inconclusive.</p><p> Further concerns about the integrity of the processing of the information were raised by the mislabelling incident.  The circumstances surrounding the removal of labels, which were then incorrectly replaced on a different woman's slide were not adequately explained.  Where a system produces incorrect reports subsequently spotted by the women concerned, the reliability and the accuracy of all reports cannot be trusted.</p><p> I cannot face another year of negativity and anguish, leaving myself and other women feeling distraught, hopeless, powerless and burnt out.  It is not good enough that we are still going around in circles seeking the unpalatable answers to allow us to try to regain our peace of mind and the ability to sleep at night.</p><p> Last week, I met my consultant for the first time since this broke in April 2018.  I was feeling apprehensive, hurt and broken.  I had trusted with my life this doctor, who has always treated me with the utmost respect.  We had an honest and frank discussion airing our views, concerns and criticisms, with both of us desiring the same outcome, which is a screening system in which women can have faith.  I am asked all the time by Irish women whether they can trust the results of their smears.  We need to encourage the uptake of HPV vaccinations for girls and boys in order to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer but this takes time and faith on behalf of parents to vaccinate their children.  In the meantime, every day women are being diagnosed with cervical cancer and are battling the disease through treatment.  We have a huge survivorship that desperately needs care in dealing with and living with the after-effects of this cruel disease.  No Government should condone substandard care for its citizens and all of the patients suffering as a result of cervical cancer should have access to adequate post-treatment care and support.  I had to go to the UK to get a definitive diagnosis of lymphedema last year, which is another horrible aftereffect of cervical cancer that I must live with.</p><p> We need to focus a number of supports, including a psycho-oncology service and oncology social workers.  Onco-fertility should be available in the public system.  At present, the Government funds this through a private clinic so the pathway is not direct.  Psychosexual support is also required, as are dieticians to help with gastroenterology and post-radiation bowel toxicity, pre-clinical lymphedema assessment and early diagnosis, management and physiotherapy for pelvic floor and lymphedema.</p><p> We must recognise and acknowledge that clinicians feel unsupported, isolated and undervalued.  All involved have felt the strain but in different ways.  As patients, we must value the concerns of the clinicians on whom we absolutely rely.  Healthcare professionals, such as colposcopists, nurses and smear takers, are essential to the provision and promotion of good healthcare and healing and they deserve respect.</p><p> Screening is so important and helps save lives.  It is hoped that any impasse can be lifted by constructive dialogue, such as that from Dr. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n Russell and Professor Donal Brennan.  We all have a vested interest in preserving life, health and good relationships.  We say this today in a place of neutrality in the Houses of our Oireachtas and invite doctors to work with us and come together for mutual benefit.  We need them.  We must heal any divisions and emerge united and strong.</p><p> Perhaps we have established as much of the truth as is possible and the time has come for us to come out of the trenches and focus on better futures and outcomes for women and their families.  For Vicky, Stephen and I there is no going back or undoing the past.  We must all live with the consequences of these failures and in doing so we should not forget but should strive for a stronger voice for the patient and to build better communication channels and synergies with all working in our health system.</p><p> Advocacy has been a heavy burden at times and I want to thank the health committee for the invitation to come here today and give us a voice instead of the usual talking about us.  The references often made to us sound like we are an army of people but generally it is just Stephen and myself.  We are far from perfect but we have always been honest and we have done our absolute best.</p></speech>

It is never easy to speak in public.  To speak about matters that are so personal and have caused so much hurt and distress is particularly difficult.  We volunteer to be in the public eye but neither of our guests is here by choice.  I acknowledge the extraordinary work they have both done in patient advocacy.  Listening to both of their statements, these have come at a cost.  They have done their country a great service.  I want to acknowledge that service and the price they have paid to stand up for other people and I thank them both for that.</p> <p>  I will start by asking Ms Walsh about the CervicalCheck steering committee, which is chaired by the Department of Health.  She has given testimony to us this evening that suggests not much has changed and that women and patient representatives are being talked to.  The language she used was very upsetting to hear, which essentially was that she was being handled and made feel irrelevant and unworthy.  At no time is that acceptable.  In the context of the CervicalCheck scandal, it is beyond comprehension that that could have happened.  Does the CervicalCheck steering committee have the governance in place it needs?  Do the patients on that committee have the support, voice and influence they must have?  Is the steering committee sufficiently independent to act on behalf of patients and in doing so, to hold the State to account?</p></speech>

It did not come with a set of guidelines but I thought it was to give the women and families involved in this a voice.  What happened in October, was that I voiced my concerns to the committee.  I had not received my Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, report at that stage but had worked very closely with the HSE and was privy to the ongoing problems within it.  I brought those concerns to the committee and to the Minister.  When one tells the most senior people in the country of one's concerns and one is not listened to, what else does one do?  My only option at that stage was to resign as I felt that the committee was not listening to me.  What is the point in having a patient representative voicing concerns when they are not being listened to?  One issue raised by the Deputy was that the oversight of this has been chaired by the Department of Health.  Perhaps it should have been or should be chaired by an independent person or body, that is, somebody who was outside of this issue, which may be better.  One thing that has come up a lot over the past 18 months is that women have not been listened to.  This has happened multiple times over that period and prior to that.  It seems that this is still not happening in my experience.</p></speech>

I was told at the time that there was a verification process in the HSE that would take up all of these issues.

Many of the recommendations have been implemented, which is obviously welcome.  He raised concerns, however, about the ongoing implementation.  Are there aspects of this that are particularly important, that he would like to see happen and that he believes are not being implemented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Teap" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#D01300"><p>The biggest issue I have is the longevity of the oversight of the plan and that it remains in place.  We have seen earlier this year, around February, an attempt to wind down the CervicalCheck steering committee.  Right now, I am not confident that it will stay running for the next couple of months either.  For me, the biggest reason it has been so successful in its implementation to date, with over 80% of the recommendations implemented, is the fact that there has been so much oversight of it.  The unfortunate thing about this is it is because of the media spotlight also.  That aids its progression as well, in that people are interested in seeing this report fulfilled but we should not need the media interest to move this along.  It needs commitment from the Department of Health to ensure that it continues.  This oversight makes the job easier for the people mainly involved with this within the HSE to continue with this process.</p> <p>  Another issue I have is that it is one thing to tick a box and fulfil an action but it is also necessary to follow up on that action to ensure that in years to come, it is still continuing and that some sort of review process is in place  for it, which currently does not exist.  Right now, with 116 actions, it is a tick-box to ensure that it is done but there is nothing to follow that up in a few years' time to see that it is still running or working.  We need to ensure the continuity of this aspect of it because many of these recommendations are in respect of governance, employment, staff quality assurance, as well as auditing and tendering.  There are many important elements that impact not just CervicalCheck but the healthcare system as a whole.  Open disclosure and many other important items should not just be isolated to CervicalCheck but are matters that will impact the whole healthcare system.  It is important that proper oversight of this remains in place.</p></speech>

The related Bill was before the D&aacute;il last week on Second Stage.  One point I made to the Minister on Second Stage was that it is all well and good telling clinicians through legislation that they have to disclose, which is correct.  I imagine the single biggest cause, however, of clinical error is overworked, overwhelmed, understaffed and under-resourced clinicians.  It is a bit rich for the Government to be legislating for mandatory open disclosure of clinical errors when it is failures in the public health system that are putting our clinicians in an impossible position.  I note the witnesses - without putting words in their mouths - have said something and have referenced this.  In both of their opinions, where they obviously are engaging with clinicians a lot, are our clinicians working in a safe environment and in a position where they can do the job safely?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Teap" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#D01500"><p>I would honestly say they are not working in a safe environment.  The stress levels they are all going through are public knowledge.  We read about it every day.  We have heard a great deal about people involved in clinics around the country and within CervicalCheck and that the support just is not there for them.  That, of course, creates risk for them but also for the patients and the people who rely on the system.  Mandatory open disclosure is important.  If it is not done, how will we ever get to the bottom of the problems that exist?  An error, for example, may take place due to being overworked, tired, or understaffed.</p><p>Those issues need to come to light so they are addressed.  If an error of some description is inflicted on patients due to staff being overworked, tired or understaffed then they need to be made aware of that also.</p><p> In terms of medical professions having a voice, they are very limited in what they can say.  When we say patient representatives and medical professions work together, it is in our interests, your interests and everybody's interests in this country that these issues are highlighted at a very early stage.  If medical professions are coming out and giving a view from the ground up, they are not listened to.  If patient representatives are doing it without the backing of the media then they will not be listened to either.  This is why a combination of both voices is the key, in my opinion, to addressing these issues.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where we still work to a very Victorian style system where everything seems to be dictated to from the top down and very little attention is given to the voices from the ground up.  Probably the biggest failure in our healthcare system is not listening to the voices on the ground.  I mean the people who have to walk into medical centres and rely on our healthcare system but also the people who have to work within the healthcare system - the doctors, nurses and administrators.  I mean everyone.  It is quietening those voices that really is the backbone to a lot of our problems.  We really need to start looking at those voices.  </p></speech>

If I understood her correctly, she was given a report that said there was no discordance and no miss and then another report saying that there was.  Also, her slide seems to have travelled all over the place.</p> <p>  Ms Walsh said something very important about whether the women who received these results should have confidence in their results.  There have been some deeply upsetting results for the 159 women, many of whom the witnesses, the members of this committee and I have met.  Should these women who have these results have confidence in them or should they now opt for an independent review?</p> <p>  In terms of supports for the women and their families, we have the 221+ group whose members have engaged with the system for some time and we have the new 159 women and families from the RCOG review.  At this point are all of the women and their families getting the support that they need?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#E00300"><p>My experience of the RCOG review has been catastrophic so I could not have any faith in it whatsoever.  I got report No. 1 that said my slide was missing.  On the same day, I got a letter from the HSE explaining that the same slide had been mislabelled so, in fact, it was not missing.  My question here is not about the clinical reading of these slides but more about the reporting of them.</p> <p>  On page 20 of the RCOG report, they allude to the process of the generating of letters in saying that it required a recheck of both the CervicalCheck database, the National Cancer Registry database and their own master RCOG database.  That is three databases they were supposed to be rechecking before issuing each individual letter.  How could it possibly be that they issued a letter to me telling me that my slide was missing when, in fact, they had it, they had reviewed it and produced another report that evening to say they had reviewed it?  To me, it would seem that when they were compiling the individual reports they were not checking them individually even though their report states that they had a three-step check.  On top of that the HSE had a verification process, that they were trying to pick up on any inaccuracies as well.  If both of their processes were that good and that accurate then how did I, who happened to be just the one patient representative that was involved in this, get an inaccurate report on top of them taking my slide, mislabelling it and putting Vicky Phelan's label on my slide?  I cannot say I have faith in the review.</p> <p>  To me, if any women and families are involved in this, regardless of what result they have got through RCOG, my advice to them would be to get an independent review to get the truth.  Let us remember that is all people want - the truth.  People only want to know what happened.  We were all brought in and told there was a potential miss in our cases but people were not sure if it fell within the limitations of screening or whether there was negligence in the case.  One cannot undo that.  One cannot just say, "Fair enough, I will take that" and walk away and get on with one's life.  One must find out the truth.  It would seem that this review is not going to give those answers.  </p> <p>  In terms of supports, there are two layers to this.  There are supports from the 221+ perspective and the supports for women who are living with and past cervical cancer.  Last week, I met my clinician and he said to me: "My big problem is not cervical cancer.  My big problem is women coming in here living with the aftereffects of cervical cancer and I do not have the supports to help them."</p> <p>  Last year, when I started getting symptoms of lymphoedema, I was sent around in a circle because there is no clinic in Ireland at the moment to treat people with lymphedema, to get early intervention and early diagnosis, which is critical in the management of lymphoedema.  Lymphoedema is a horrible sideeffect of cervical cancer and one can get it from other cancers as well.  We have got to start looking after these women.  There are a lot of young women who are surviving with lots of problems post-cervical cancer.  That is something that the Government needs to start looking at.  It must improve the qualify of life for women who are living with and after this disease. </p></speech>

I ask about them because I speak to women from both groups.  Maybe the 221+ group is more advanced but certainly, the women in the 159 group do not appear to be getting the administrative, psychological, clinical and financial supports that seem to be needed at this point.</p></speech>

In May of this year, we asked the Minister for Health to replicate the supports that were in place for the 221+ group for those who were going to be impacted by RCOG and, thankfully, that was done.  So anything that was available to the original cohort of people is also available for those who have been added on as a result of RCOG except the <i>ex gratia </i>payment of &euro;2,000 that was recommended by Dr. Gabriel Scally in June of last year.  Over two weeks ago we wrote to the Minister for Health.  Bar reading a couple of headlines there still has been no confirmation on this.<br/><br/>What triggered the discovery that the <i>ex gratia</i>was not being paid is that somebody contacted the support group who, due to having cancer, had to finish up work on sick leave and it was going to take three or four weeks to process illness payment.  I do not need to go into detail on the financial impact of cancer on the individuals and families affected because the Irish Cancer Society recently compiled a fantastic report that highlighted the real cost of cancer.  What was apparent when it was highlighted to us that the <i>ex gratia</i>payment was not included in the supports, even though the Minister for Health did say he would essentially copy and paste the supports, was when last Wednesday, I think, the Taoiseach said he supported it being paid.  I raised the matter with the steering committee on Thursday but it was not in a position to commit to it and we still have no confirmation of that.  The <i>ex gratia</i>payment is the only support that is not available and everything else is like for like.<br/><br/>A fantastic team of liaison officers around the country are contacting the women and families who are affected, as the report highlighted.  I am not too sure about the status of that.  I do not know whether everybody has been contacted or whether some people may be waiting to be contacted.  All of the supports that are available to us are available to the RCOG group and the people implicated by that, except for the <i>ex gratia</i>payment.</p></speech>

They have spent a large amount of time away from their families working on behalf of women like me, my daughter and people who use the service and want, need and deserve to have confidence in it.  We can say &quot;Thanks&quot; for everything the witnesses have done, but that is clearly not enough.  They are here doing that work, so they are clearly not at home with their families.  For that, they are to be commended.</p><p>I had not intended to ask this question, but the matter has been raised.  Despite the assurances given by the Taoiseach and the Minister, has the &euro;2,000 <i>ex gratia</i>payment been paid yet?</p></speech>

I will set out the timeline of events for the payment.  On meeting a number of the women and families, Dr. Gabriel Scally last June identified a financial need from a lot of the suffering that he had seen.  I have explained the financial impact of a cancer diagnosis.  That is where the payment came from.  We raised the matter two weeks ago and wrote to the Minister for Health, but there is still no official confirmation that it will be paid.  From what we saw of the Taoiseach last week, the word is that he is trying to move this along, but unless "It is going to be paid" is in writing, the HSE is not in a position to pay it.  The answer to the question is that the payment does not exist right now for the people impacted.</p></speech>

What has characterised this situation from the beginning up to the present is an unsubstantiated media report followed by repeated questioning by people like the witnesses, us and journalists and evidence then emerging.  The hope is that the payment will be made, but people in the HSE cannot action it until they get a piece of paper.  Of course they cannot.</p></speech>

We will collectively try to do as much as we can.  I read the Irish Cancer Society's report, but I would have known the situation anyway.  If someone has to go off work at the time of the initial diagnosis, having to face additional charges is regrettable.  I hope that we will be in a position to follow up on that.</p> <p>  We will have an opportunity to ask questions tomorrow.  We have heard of some of the difficulties experienced by women engaging with RCOG.  Are there other examples that pursuing tomorrow morning might be worthwhile?  Much of this is anecdotal evidence.  Some of it I already have, as people have contacted me.  People have also contacted other committee members.  Are there examples of what we should be honing in on tomorrow?</p></speech>

I refer to page 14 of the report, No. 3 on which reads: "All slides missing i.e. not retrievable, or slides not available for review having been obtained by a third party at the woman's request."  By "All slides missing", is RCOG referring to all slides prior to diagnosis or all slides in general, including the one at the time of diagnosis?  A number of women have come to me with concerns regarding their one and only slide prior to diagnosis being unavailable even though their results were classified as being concordant.

We see that there was a 30% discordance and a 70% concordance.  If there were a number of women's slides missing that were deemed concordant, though, then that does not seem right.  When I got an answer to that previously, I was told that many of those were called "partial reviews".  I have contacted a number of women whose one and only slide prior to their diagnoses were missing about this issue.  They said that "partial review" was not mentioned, only that the review was in agreement.</p></speech>

When Ms Walsh asked questions, it became a "partial review".  Before then, it was simply advised that the slides were concordant.</p></speech>

That was one of the issues.  I referred to another in my opening statement relating to a report in the UK about RCOG's IT system and how it raised questions about how RCOG was managing the data for this review.</p> <p>  The 2018-19 cervical screening programme quality statement in England, which was published in November, reads: "There is generally no accepted or expected level of false negatives in the NHS Cervical Screening Programme."  Despite this, RCOG expects us to accept a 30% false negative rate.  That is what RCOG wrote.  I wonder why it is telling us that this is an acceptable rate when it says that there is no acceptable rate.  That is a question.</p></speech>

For reasons that I will not go into now, I am someone who has had occasion to engage on a regular basis with the service.  I know the limitations, because I asked my doctor and my doctor knew.  Dr. Peter McKenna did not know, though.  The first time I asked him, he gave an assessment of 10%.  According to the literature that was distributed, no screening test is ever perfect.  It is good that there has been a discussion so that everyone understands, but women who asked their doctors could have found that out.  It is unfortunate that information was not available in this room on that day when we asked the question.  It is readily available to everyone now, which is probably a good thing.  Anyone who would have had occasion to ask would have been told by her doctor something that the head of the women and infants programme did not know.  He put the figure at 10%.  There is a great deal of information in the public domain now, which is a good thing because women in particular are able to ask questions.  Judging from Ms Walsh's submission in particular, though, it seems that women can keep asking questions but will still not be listened to.  That is regrettable and has to change.  We cannot continue in this vein.</p> <p>  Mr. Teap referred to "a proper, structured, patient representative platform".  Clearly, it does not exist at the minute, but what would that forum look like, who would be on it and, more importantly, how would it be resourced?  I am conscious that much of the work that has been done was done in the witnesses' own time and at their own expense.  People have to be free to participate and they must be supported.  Will Mr. Teap give us an idea of what "a proper, structured, patient representative platform" would and should look like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Teap" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#F01400"><p>Certainly.  It is important to highlight that Ms Walsh and I never applied for this job.  No one advertised it.  Ms Walsh and I both come from tragic backgrounds.  All of a sudden, we were given the title of "patient advocate" or "patient representative".  After a month of going public, I saw myself being referred to with different titles.  It was not just "widower" anymore.  Now, I was a "patient advocate" or "patient representative".  The main problem is that, when one comes from a tragic background, one is reacting to something that has happened.  There are other areas of the HSE where people are required on a more proactive basis, but when people come from tragic backgrounds like ours, they could be anyone.  Instead, who we are looking for are people who have time and money to fill these roles.</p><p>Ms Walsh and I do not have these either.  Dr. Scally or someone else used the word "exploitation".  There is no support whatsoever for us.  There was no induction pack or explanation as to where the Department of Health, the HSE and its staff fall.  There is no psychological help or any assistance like that at all.  There is nothing whatsoever.</p><p> The issues raised in the conversations I have had with the Minister and the Department were first raised on the back of something Dr. Scally said to me but also because of something said by a friend of mine who works in the HSE in Cork and who attended a conference.  The conference was led by someone from the United Kingdom, which already has a system in place for patient representatives.  In the United Kingdom, there is a proper, structured platform for patient representatives, who are supported in every way.  When Ms Walsh and I sit at a table, it is not about money but about respect and coming from an area of respect.  The patient representative system does reimburse one for one's time but it also puts the associated supports in place.  It is also to get away from having people who come from the backgrounds Ms Walsh and I come from.  There will always be a scandal and something will always go wrong, and people will step up to the plate, but when they do they should be supported.</p><p> Other issues arise in the HSE, and within CervicalCheck, concerning the marketing and putting the programmes and information packs together.  Many people have volunteered their time to do this but we need to get the right people to volunteer.  They must be of the right age profile and gender.  The volunteers should be relevant to what exactly is going on in the healthcare system.  It is about ensuring that we can attract those individuals and have the supports in place.  Those in their 30s, male or female, are probably going through a very expensive time in their lives, particularly if they have a small family and big mortgage.  How can people of that age profile be asked to volunteer a day per week or per month in the HSE to improve it?  That cannot be expected.  The majority who volunteer, while they are needed to represent their own age profile, are retired, because of their age and the time they have available.  It is not ideal that they would be representing people our age.  Obviously they are important to represent themselves but we would be lost without them.  It is about having the relevant people on this platform.  This is what we have been discussing with the Department of Health.  It has examined the UK model.  Right now, it is only a conversation.  Everyone's support is needed to try to drive it on and put the arrangement in place.  When I talk about diluting the culture of patient representatives and medical professionals working together, I am suggesting that the platform is what gives patient representatives respect.  The platform obviously has to have buy-in from the medical profession and also the colleges if it is to be put together.  It is important to try to have something in place for-----</p></speech>

We had to move in the D&aacute;il towards that culture.  As Mr. Teap will know, open disclosure was voted down but now enjoys full support.  It is good that people are coming to this conclusion but there will have to be a massive cultural shift in the HSE.  That will mean all the health professionals will have to be supported and-or represented, as required, because, ultimately, we are also asking them to take a leap.  To be fair to everyone concerned, that will have to happen.  This will require a certain amount of leadership.</p> <p>  It is welcome that there is a conversation being had on the representative forum but, as Mr. Teap says, we probably need to work collectively to give it a wee shove.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that I am saying to these people that they cannot trust this report despite the fact that this is their only avenue to get some form of the truth.  I do not say it lightly.  Many are now wondering where they will get the money to find out the truth.  These independent reviews can cost anything from &euro;2,000 to &euro;5,000.</p></speech>

To get the truth about what happened with the smear tests, there is a need to find an independent medical professional, a cytologist, to read the slides and write up a report on them.  I do not know any cytologists.  We do not know these people.  The protocol in place in the HSE is that, in order for the slides to be released, the name and address of a cytologist to whom they are to be shipped are needed beforehand.  I can speak only about myself.  The only people I know in this country who have any experience of carrying out reviews of medical files or anything like that are solicitors who practice in the area of medical negligence or such a field.  Those are the people one has to approach because there is no other way to do it oneself.  There is no body or individual one can refer to in order to get this done.</p> <p>  With regard to Irene, she had two slides.  It cost up to &euro;2,000 to have them read.  There was also the cost of a solicitor to co-ordinate it all for me.  I was brave enough to go into the solicitor's office and ask for this to be done but I realise people fear going to the solicitor's office, and this is preventing them from getting to the truth.  They fear it because of the litigation process, which we all witnessed in the case of Ruth Morrissey during the summer.  People fear that they are going to be dragged straight to the High Court and that their name will be all over every newspaper in the country.  Unfortunately, that has happened very many people.  I know one woman who passed away without knowing the truth.  The reason she did not contact a solicitor beforehand was because she was afraid she would be the next Ruth Morrissey.  I was trying to explain to her husband that all he was doing was contacting a solicitor to get access to her slides, which would in turn be sent on to someone to review them.  Ms Walsh has got this done and I gave got Irene's slides done.  We both know now what is on the slides.  In order for us to take it further, unfortunately, the system is such that we have to go to the High Court.  As my solicitor's firm said to me, it has got many slides back which showed the limitations of screening.  That is fine.  It gave the people in question closure.  Actually, they were very happy there was no foul play in their medical care.  They are able to move on from that because they have got the truth.</p></speech>

I know them quite well at this stage.  I compliment them both on the work they have done and continue to do.  The journey they have come on and the way they have put themselves forward are simply incredible.  I admire them both greatly.  This is along with a certain woman who is now watching us on her phone at Dublin Airport on her way to New Zealand, Vicky Phelan.  We can all give her a wave.  Hello Vicky, who is watching in.  She will probably give out to me for saying this.</p> <p>  Today, we have gone through much detail.  I know Stephen Teap has been in front of the committee before.  This is Lorraine Walsh's first time.  She was brave putting forward her points and telling her story.  The level of detail she gave of her personal story is unprecedented.  I note the solidarity the two witnesses have shown for one another.  Many people think that there is a big team involved but it is just the two witnesses and Vicky Phelan.  They have gone into an extraordinary level of detail and educated themselves.  This learning process across a whole range of issues has been seismic.</p> <p>  I asked for the witnesses to be invited before the committee as part of this process.  The most important point is that they get to say what they want to say.  I am conscious that much of the information is important before we meet the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, tomorrow morning.  Is it fair to say that the witnesses do not have faith in RCOG?</p></speech>

That has not been confirmed yet by the Government.  We know the issues about the supports and the one outstanding issue, namely, the &euro;2,000 award.  That still has to be confirmed but will be, hopefully, in the coming days by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who must sign an order.  That is where we are now.</p> <p>  Lorraine Walsh went into the RCOG process, the criteria and the slides.  There is quite a level detail on the process around the slide availability and who was part and should be part of that process.  Then there was the detail about the letters sent out about being concordant, discordant and the fact that there was not a third category which is basically unknown.  Will the witnesses outline the criteria where the RCOG process from the beginning did not work?  How did that then manifest itself through slides missing, as well as discordant versus concurrent and the fact that there was not a third category.  That is a critical issue.  How can there not be a third category?  How can there not be a category where slides are missing?</p></speech>

When she got her review back, it had only reviewed the slide that she was actually diagnosed from.  It said that the other slide was unavailable.  By virtue of this, they had found that she could not have been diagnosed at an earlier stage and there was no missed opportunity.  That would have classified her as concordant.  The actual opening paragraph in the letter stated that the process of RCOG was to look back at cytology prior to diagnosis.  In my opinion, that should have eliminated her from it if the slide prior to diagnosis was unavailable.  It does not take a rocket scientist to know that the slide she was diagnosed from was read correctly because obviously she was diagnosed.</p> <p>  When we look at the 70:30 rates, we are told the screening programme is working within the norms that are expected of a 30% rate of discordance.  Clearly, we cannot work off those figures.  One has to look at the fact that just over half the women involved in this actually consented to the process.  One is only looking at half of those screened in the system, basically half of the overall picture.</p></speech>

One cannot have faith in the results generated from them, not just from individual examples but from the manner in which criteria were not executed in the way it was claimed they would.</p> <p>  Three women&rsquo;s slides were mislabelled, those of Lorraine Walsh and Vicky Phelan and one other woman.  Lorraine Walsh is the patient advocate who is participating in the programme.  We have the details of the two reports.  Of the 1,038 women, Ms Walsh is one of three whose slides were mislabelled.  As she outlined in detail, there are two reports, one of which came 24 hours after the other.  Both stated the complete opposite, based on the fact that they could not find the slide that they did not know existed.</p></speech>

Three people having their slides mislabelled and then ending up in this scenario with two reports is incredible.</p><p>I want to ask about the sensitive topic of the Department of Health which was raised earlier by Lorraine Walsh.  How would Ms Walsh describe the <i>modus operandi</i>of the Department of Health regarding her treatment as part of the CervicalCheck steering committee?</p></speech>

As an individual, I have to be careful in what I say.</p><p>The Minister for Health appointed me as a patient representative to question this situation and what happened and to try to work with the people trying to put it right.  Then, when one looks at and questions that, one can be reprimanded for it, so I must be very careful.

This is not my committee, but she does not have to be afraid in here, as the Chairman said when he read out the note on privilege at the beginning of the meeting.</p> <p>  A lot of questions I was going to put forward have been dealt with so I will drift into a little more detail.  I have two questions for Mr. Teap.  First, we know of the story of Bernadette Kiely, and I say her name purely because it has been spoken publicly in the D&aacute;il.  Ms Walsh might wish to come in on this.  Does that case raise additional concerns and issues for the witnesses?</p> <p>  Second, in any of the witnesses' analysis have they looked at comparative, cross-jurisdiction changes as a result of screening and, for instance, mortality rates?  Are there any lessons to be learned in this regard or anything that would not necessarily jump out to the committee or the public but that we should be aware of?</p></speech>

The 221 came on the back of an audit.  Discordance was discovered on that audit and that is where Ms Walsh, my wife Irene and all the other women's names came from.  Obviously, there were other audit results that did not show discordance that are on women's files today.  The HSE just needs to give the clarity that everybody who had discordance in that audit has had disclosure.  That is probably the biggest thing that came out of that audit.</p></speech>

I met her with the RCOG review panel back in May.  She was one of the patient representatives who came to meet RCOG.  What happened, I believe, is that she had an issue with her colposcopy management and the RCOG found discordance in her case, but when she received her file, which she had requested, there was a partial audit report on it but there was a page missing from it.  She now wonders, now that the RCOG has found discordance in her case, whether there was discordance when it audited her file previously and, if so, why she was not told about it.  The woman deserves to know and to get that second page of her report.  She is traumatised-----</p></speech>

They seem to focus on just the slides but not the programme as a whole.  After I lost my wife, many of the people who have lost people in this made contact with me.  This is obviously a burning question for me.</p> <p>  People - researchers and so on - say to me the real measure of whether a screening programme is working is that we should see a downward trend in mortality.  From what I have been given and what I have here, which I could share with the committee, I think the statistics show that out of the UK, France, Finland, the Nordic region and Ireland, Ireland is the only country that does not show a downward trend in mortality.  If our screening programme is successful, why has our mortality rate stayed static over recent years?  We hear about instances at early stages being picked up, but people are still dying seemingly at the same rate as they were years ago.  That question needs to be looked at and it has not been to date.  All the statistics from the current mortality incidence data seem to stop in 2013, and RCOG's reporting of it stops at 2015.  It is 2019.  Why are we not up to date with the statistics, given the nature of and the ongoing concerns with the screening programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#J01700"><p>That is very interesting information that needs further analysis because it would cause deep concern.  Mr. Teap might share that information with us and we will then perhaps process that through the right channels.</p> <p>  I have two last questions.  Both witnesses can give them quick-fire answers.  First, we talk about the limitations of screening.  I am very much taken by the way in which both witnesses have said everyone needs to come together now.  At the end of Ms Walsh's submission she said, "We must heal any divisions and emerge united and strong."  I know she means that passionately and believes we should work collectively for everyone.  In fairness, let us not forget about all the good stuff happening such as the HPV vaccine, screening, the legacy of Laura Brennan, the implementation of the Scally report and so on.  However, there has been some conflict in recent times, with clinicians talking about the limitations of screening, and we know of all the other issues that have arisen.  Those of us who are into detail know that certain things are outside the limitations of screening.  However, the fact that we do not have a definition in any way of the limitations of screening, as currently constituted or whatever, is a real issue.  The witnesses' comments on what I have just said would be helpful.</p> <p>  Second, based on what Mr. Teap said earlier, do the witnesses believe that the new audit process which must be brought in, and which is under something of a review at present, should commence the day after the old one finishes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Teap" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#J01800"><p>Yes, definitely.  The audit process must commence from then because the information there is obviously vital, but also, given the ongoing situation of those of us who have been impacted by this audit, something must be put in place.  I believe it was originally reported that this audit review would be announced in quarter 4 of this year.  I have not seen anything yet.</p></speech>

Page 42 of the RCOG review makes it clear that &quot;Screening failures do have serious consequences for affected women&quot;.  It continues:</p><blockquote>	These are unfortunately inevitable given the limitations of cytology-based cervical screening.  This however should not be taken to suggest that the programme overall is not working. </blockquote><p>This is an interesting conclusion, given that the report does not even provide an explanation of the limitations being referred to.</p></speech>

When I talk about these matters, I try to base my explanations on fact.  When Irene was diagnosed with cervical cancer in September 2015, she had already participated in CervicalCheck on invitation on two occasions.  She knew exactly what cervical screening was about.  She knew what going for a smear test meant.  She understood the information that would be gathered.  The day she was told she had cervical cancer, she immediately asked how it was not picked up by her smear test.  That was the first question she asked.  I did not have a clue what she was talking about, but she knew.  I now know what she meant.  The explanation that was given by her consultant at the time was that screening has limitations because it does not pick up everything.  It was suggested to us that when Irene went for her smear, it might have been taken next to the tumour rather than on the tumour, or that the number of cells on the slide might not have been adequate to determine the reading.  That was the explanation we were given, essentially.  I know for a fact from the independent review of Irene's slide which was carried out that the opposite actually happened.  The suggestion that was made to us was not reflective of what was actually the case.  I know that Irene's case does not fall within the limitations of screening - it falls outside those limitations.  People need to understand this can happen.  We must remember that six or seven people have gone through the High Court to prove their own independent reviews.  The laboratories have admitted liability.  Human error is a factor.  Error is a factor in the breach of duty of care to women with regard to screening.</p></speech>

This debacle has pushed us all into a position of defence.  When one is pushed into a position of defence, one will come out fighting.  That is what happens.  I realise that the patients and the clinicians all want the same thing.  As a woman who has survived cervical cancer, I am left with the scars and the life-changing conditions.  The same thing applies to every other woman in this country who has had cervical cancer, regardless of whether she is in the 221+ group or whether she has been part of the RCOG review.  They are all suffering in some way and they have all been left with scars.  The clinicians here do not have adequate support to support these women in living with the after-effects of cervical cancer.  We spoke earlier about the supports that are in place for the 221+ group.  I accept that some supports are in place.  More importantly, the system must support these women.  Earlier, I provided a list of ways in which these women can have a better quality of life.  That goes across the board.  We need to focus on that.  That is why I want to stop looking backwards.  We have got all the answers we are going to get here.</p> <p>  The RCOG review was not ideal, as I have said, but we have got many answers from Dr. Scally's work, the implementation of which is really important.  All of that involves looking back, but we need to start looking forward now.  This is the time to start working together to ensure the clinicians can give support to these women when they come in.  If a woman complains of a swelling in her foot, her clinician should be able to refer her to somewhere appropriate where she can get early intervention.  Similarly, a woman like me might come in at 34 years of age to say that she really wants to have a family and to ask if there is any way this can be done.  Maybe I could have had my eggs frozen.  I believe the Government is currently providing &euro;300,000 towards oncofertility to a private clinic.  It used to be a public clinic, but it is now a private clinic.  That money should not be going to a private clinic.  It should be in the public system so that a person who is in the public system can be referred directly into it.  Some provision should be made for the future fertility of a man or a woman who is about to go through treatment, for example by preserving his sperm or her eggs.  No direct path exists in this regard at the moment.  That needs to be re-examined.  It is about supporting these women so that they have a better quality of life.  That is what the doctors want.  As survivors, that is what we want too.  That is what we have to achieve.</p></speech>

It is nice to see Mr. Teap again.  Ms Walsh is very welcome.  I will pick up where she left off when she spoke about wanting "to stop looking backwards" and needing "to start looking forward now".  It is probable that nothing more important has been said here today.  We need to work together.  This has been going on for a long time.  There is a lot of hurt.  There is a lack of trust.  Many of us in this committee have uncovered things.  At the time, we were made to feel stupid as well.  Everything came out in the wash in the end.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the 10% limitation rate, or whatever arbitrary rate it was, that we were quoted here at an early stage.  The lack of knowledge about the limitations of screening caused a lot of trouble from the start for the witnesses and for those of us who were trying to get to the bottom of things.  At the end of the day, we are all trying to improve people's lives and improve survival rates.</p> <p>  I would like to examine some of the witnesses' proposals.  Before the regime started, we had the highest rate in Europe of people dying of cervical cancer.  I take it from what the witnesses have said that one of the negative aspects of advances in healthcare is that it is not good enough for those who have survived life-limiting conditions to be able to say that they have lived if they cannot live the best lives they possibly can after their aggressive, invasive and personal treatment has come to an end.  I fully support Ms Walsh's call for supports for oncofertility treatment.  It is tragic for a woman to have to shelve her dreams of having children at an early age because of a lack of direction or support at a moment when she could have done with such assistance.  I would be very supportive of that.</p> <p>  I would like to look back at this from the start, insofar as that is possible.  The witnesses have tried to find the truth and to restore trust in a system in which many of us had lost faith.  Although many of us had faith in Dr. Scally's recommendations, I understand Mr. Teap's point that it is not good enough just to tick boxes.  We need to track these recommendations and make sure they do what they set out to achieve.  From day one, there was a huge lack of governance in the HSE with regard to the handling of the cervical cancer issue.  As Dr. Scally said, the system was "doomed to fail at some point".  One of the greatest failings of this whole debacle relates to the impact of having an audit without considering that there were real people at the end of it who had lost their lives.  It showed a complete disregard for Mr. Teap's late wife, for his children and for our lives as people.  Not much consideration was given to the significant investment in this area, the whole point of which was to prevent the things that happened to Mr. Teap from happening.</p> <p>  I understand that all of this is very hard because I have had difficulties with it.  Members of the committee met representatives of RCOG a couple of weeks ago.  We will see them again in the morning.  There are many questions we have to ask.</p><p>I do not want to misquote Ms Walsh, but I do understand that everything falls within the limitations of screening.  As a logical human being, it is very hard to swallow when we see that despite the best efforts, somehow some people's lives appear to have been saved.  There was the outsourcing of the service abroad, which many people had an issue with at the time.  There was the lack of concordance with the standards on the contracts with regard to the American College of Pathologists versus other standards.  There was the explicit statement in the contract that there was to be no outsourcing to other laboratories, yet this happened.  There was the issue of people going on quality assurance visits and not noticing pretty much anything that was going on.  Then we had the guy in Salford just to finish it off.  Does Deputy Kelly remember this individual who was on his own?</p></speech>

We have listened to the witnesses today and we will interrogate more witnesses tomorrow hopefully.  I stated last week at a meeting of the committee that I have faith in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists with respect to its professional capacity and whose side it is on.  In terms of somebody having a smear looked at - not the one on which the diagnosis was made but the one previous to that - I have a major concern that the default position was that it was concordant.  I hope I am not misinterpreting what Ms Walsh said in that regard earlier.  That is a serious flaw in the review and I hope to interrogate it more at tomorrow's meeting.</p> <p>  I do not want to trivialise the administration issues - for want of a better term - but the witnesses spoke of getting a smear result that was over-labelled or re-labelled.  The whole point of the RCOG review was to instil confidence in a system we had lost confidence in.  I can only imagine what it must have been like to receive a call to say that a slide was missing and then that it was concordant and then that somebody else's label was on it.  That all feeds into the view that this was sloppy work that has had a real impact on people's lives - the witnesses' lives in this case.</p></speech>

Their input to this committee has been extremely valuable in uncovering and guiding us in trying to do work on their behalf.  A huge learning arising from the lack of governance in this case can be applied in future in the HSE.  Many of us were very shocked at the mess of the governance structure.  Mr. Teap made a very important point that the patient representative groups should not be from a particular age group just because people are available, and that provision is made for it to be truly representative.</p> <p>  I am concerned by Mr. Teap's comments on the rates of cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer rates in Ireland were rising higher than anywhere else before cervical cancer screening was introduced.  When RCOG was before us for a private meeting - we will speak to its representatives tomorrow - I asked what the outcome would have been if we had not bothered screening or if we had taken smears and not read them.  The gist of the response, which we will check publicly at tomorrow's meeting, was that Ireland had a 4% year-on-year increase in mortality and now we have 7% year-on-year decrease.  I am not sure where RCOG is getting those figures from but I hope, on the witnesses' behalf, to interrogate them tomorrow.  It is very important that screening is having a material impact and is not just an inconvenience.</p> <p>  I hope we will get the witnesses' questions answered tomorrow insofar as possible.  Despite the difficulties, I encourage them to stay as part of this process.  We need Mr. Teap and Ms Walsh to help us to do our job.  We have not been where they are and I hope I never will be.  To improve things for the future, we need the witnesses to stay involved, if possible.  I know that will be very difficult but-----</p></speech>

I acknowledge the stress they and their families and friends have been put through.</p> <p>  Arising from Deputy Louise O'Reilly's earlier question on whether there was a 10% - or a more vague - conclusion arising from the tests, when was the group told how imprecise the system was?  If a system has a 30% variation between one and the other, the people concerned are entitled to be told.  They were not told.  The ridiculous excuses that were given at the time caused a great trauma and difficulty for the people concerned and their wider circle.  As Ms Walsh stated, different action could have been taken if that information had been made available.  How did the group react when the question was asked about the accuracy of the test?</p></speech>

I have brought a copy of that letter which I will pass on to the committee.  It basically gives the same answer that there was a verification process in the HSE.  If we take the RCOG report, RCOG had its own verification process in putting the letters together.  This was a three-step process that involved checking three databases.  If RCOG was checking three databases, how did I get an inaccurate report?  In addition, if I did not have as much information as I had, I would not have known to question it and go back.  How many women are sitting at home who do not know to question the result or go back to get the right answer?</p> <p>  On the colposcopy management, I understand that the case files of 106 women were reviewed.  This was to do with the length of time between their colposcopy and their diagnoses.  RCOG, on page 43 of its report states: "We found evidence that CervicalCheck clinical practice guidelines have not always been adhered to...".  However, it then states: "This is far from concluding that colposcopic practice in the CervicalCheck programme is substandard...".  Correct me if I am wrong, but this means that out of the 3,000 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer, only 1,038 were part of the RCOG review, and only 106 of those files were actually reviewed in relation to colposcopy management.  I am not sure how RCOG can say that despite finding 57 cases of colposcopy management issues, this is "far from concluding that colposcopic practice in the CervicalCheck programme is substandard".  I would love to have clarification on that.</p><p>Rightly so.</p></speech>

I remember being glued to the proceedings of this committee, the D&aacute;il and the news at the beginning of this when I saw all these figures, the 10%, 15%, 20% and 30%, being thrown around.  Nobody had a clue or had been given an explanation at any stage of what the limitations of screening were.  They still do not know today.  Some clarification is being given in the percentages, but the first time everybody started singing from the same sheet was when Dr. Gabriel Scally released his report in September last year.  He said that 15 out of 20 women will be read correctly and in HPV screening 18 out of 20 women will be read correctly.  That is the first time we got some form of clarification on the numbers.  This is what I mean about having one document we can all refer to but, unfortunately, we still do not have a document that gives an explanation of what somebody means when they speak about the limitation of screening.  Every time we hear somebody say the words "limitation of screening" we must ask the person what he or she means by that and listen to what he or she says.</p></speech>

It is obviously better for a patient suffering from a condition or suspected of suffering from a condition if somebody can say that it is absolutely accurate or 50% accurate because the patient knows what to do.  The patient can take action, whether that is getting a second opinion or whatever else, if he or she has that crucial information at the start.  The sad part of it is that the system has undoubtedly saved many women's lives, but it was in operation for several years with an imprecise nature and failed to give the information to the women on time so they could decide for themselves what had to be done next, whether to get a second opinion or to go elsewhere.</p> <p>  My next question is on the attitude of the Department of Health.  Ms Walsh mentioned that it was impervious to her concerns, to say the least.  What type of bullying and threats occurred and at what level did they take place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019121700002#M00400"><p>On the last day I was in the Department of Health, I brought up my concerns and I was told that the HSE's system was going to cover it.  I said that women were contacting me at the time and telling me that they were receiving reports that were inaccurate and I asked: "When this goes wrong who will they blame?  They will blame the HSE".  In fact, of all people in this situation the HSE has put a huge effort into getting this right.  It worked closely with the clinicians to ensure women were treated properly.  It listened to us on how women should receive disclosure.  Instead of telling them how they would receive the disclosure, it offered them options as to how it would be most appropriate to disclose to them, be that a letter or a meeting.  I was told in the Department that they did not like my tone.  I was shot down.  It was not the first time.  We have had tough days in the Department of Health previously.  I have been reduced to tears many times in the Department.  It was a tough spot.  Notwithstanding the fact that it has been an emotional 18 months, it has been life changing for us and that has an impact as well.  Funnily enough, the people in the HSE never made me feel like that.</p></speech>

In the meetings in which Ms Walsh was reduced to tears and so forth, was there nobody there who could have said: "We understand your concerns and trauma, for obvious reasons".  People could have taken Ms Walsh and people in that situation aside and told them they understood why they were upset and offered to help them.  Was there nobody there to say that?</p></speech>

When Ms Walsh says we must stop looking back and go forward, I know where that feeling comes from because she is surrounded by reports and analysis and even attempts to hoodwink, obfuscate and hide the truth.  On the other hand, and I put this to the Minister and the head of the HSE at the RCOG meeting last week, what has happened with the 221 cases is a little like an aeroplane crashing in Dublin Airport in which a number of people are killed and we respond by saying that this is within the statistical norm so we should move on because there is nothing to see.  We would never do that if there were such a tragedy, but with this tragedy I am sick of being mansplained to by being told that I do not understand that this is within the statistical norms and falls within the limitations of screening.</p> <p>  The audit of the 221 has gone under the radar.  There was a big palaver when the Scally and RCOG reports were coming out, but the breakdown of the percentage is clear in the 221 audit.  I repeatedly asked Mr. Tony O'Brien, the Minister and the Taoiseach the laboratories that the 221 slides came from and never received a reply, but it is buried in that report.  The slides from Quest Diagnostics in Illinois were five times higher than those from the Coombe and the slides from Quest Diagnostics in New Jersey were four times higher.  Those from CPL in Texas were seven times higher than those from the Coombe and even those from MedLab Pathology based in Dublin, an offshoot of CPL, were twice as high as those from the Coombe.  The point I was trying to get at is the one that Ms Walsh made with regard to colposcopy when she said it should not be private, but public.</p></speech>

I concur.  The roots of this, and this is just as if we were looking at what happened in Dublin Airport when people lost their lives in an accident, is that we gave the screening for women's health to four for-profit laboratories in the US.  Many of them were simultaneously conducting clinical tests for the US military, which is a massive industry, and nobody looked at what happened.  Dr. Scally looked at how the laboratories are performing now, but did he look at worker X who got Ms Walsh's screen wrong, how many tests he or she did that day and in what length of time, what type of pressure he or she was under, what was his or her qualification and what was his or her rate of pay.  None of that was done.</p></speech>

The slides of both Vicky Phelan and myself were reviewed in CPL in Texas, or that is where they were reported from.  In the Quest Diagnostics slides one could see where they had been read and reported.  Dr. Scally looked into this because it is something we raised with him after his first report.  We wanted to know where our slides went, who read them and where they had been sent to, but he could not find that out through the CPL process.  CPL said at the time that it did not have those files, they were not available and that they had been destroyed.

They may not be able to delve into the matters I mentioned, including conditions and standards, but we know the outsourcing was to substandard laboratories that were not ISO-accredited, with 100 slides done per worker per day as opposed to 60 slides per worker per day done in Irish labs.  This is the substandard nature of what has gone on.</p> <p>  I understand the witness saying we should stop looking back in anger and move forward with a proper process but if we do not look back, history will be repeated.  Outsourcing to private and for-profit services, whether it is for fertility issues or CervicalCheck, will bring such issues.  Fertility treatment probably will not kill a person but not having the correct analysis of a cervical smear test may do so.</p> <p>  What do we say to women who fall outside the audit being closed?  Where do they stand in all this?  I have a friend who is terminally ill and she had four clear smear test results in a row, having been tested on an annual basis.  All of a sudden she has stage four cancer.  She had to go private to get the audit done, and as has been mentioned it cost approximately &euro;4,000 plus solicitor fees.  Only yesterday she was informed definitively that there was a serious misreading of her slides, as there were plentiful dodgy cells.  It is a clear case of negligence that still must be proved.  What do we say to people like her?  She is a working class woman whose community had to fundraise in order to get the audit done.  Could we not do something while they are still around to show we care and are looking after their interests?</p></speech>

We must believe what Dr. Scally has told us and he and his team have done extensive work on this.  I specifically asked where my slide went, who read it and what happened to it.  He said he tried extensively to get those answers but he could not.  We must arrive at a particular stage when the people tasked with getting answers say they cannot get them.  I am ready to try to move on with what is left of my life.  I am not saying I am happy about what happened, as I am definitely not.  We have seen all the reports that have been commissioned and we have their results.  We can either accept what we have been told or we can spend the rest of our lives trying to get answers and perhaps still not getting them.  I do not want to waste any more of my life.  I have already wasted so much of it.</p></speech>

It is a question we have faced as many people consented to the RCOG review but the Deputy knows the massive delay with that.  These people were not part of the original audit either.  One gentleman contacted me whose partner passed away and, like the Deputy's friend, a number of smears had reported as negative also.  He asked me what to do and I told him there were two options.  These were to wait for RCOG to come back or to get an independent review, which would cost money.  The Deputy's friend got the independent review.  With the people diagnosed with cervical cancer since the audit stopped we have no option but to say they should either wait until the audit reopens or they can get an independent review.  That is all that is available, unfortunately.  It is not right.</p></speech>

My experience and, I am sure, that of many members of the committee is that patient voices are the most powerful voices coming to give evidence to committees.  It is extremely important that we hear patients or their voices because they are so powerful.  I thank the witnesses for their clear, calm and detailed evidence given today.  They have certainly raised a large number of questions that we will be able to put as a committee to the Department, the HSE and the RCOG reviewers.  I thank the witnesses for their time and eloquence.</p></speech>

As he noted, we have been speaking mainly about the services provided directly by the Department itself.  That is principally because, under the Official Languages Act, many of the large agencies under the aegis of the Department are designated bodies required to produce, administer and implement their own schemes.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in that category, as is the Courts Service, the Irish Prison Service, the Legal Aid Board, and some others.  The Department is not directly involved in administering the Irish language scheme in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is in keeping with the general institutional approach whereby the Garda Commissioner is responsible for managing the force, its resources, deployment, and so on.  Due to our position in the sector, we are aware of the work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing around the Irish language.  I can speak a little bit about it in general terms but I just want to make clear that it is not at my direction or something in which I have decision-making role <i>per se</i>.<br/><br/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has an Irish language scheme.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides that &quot;the Garda Commissioner shall determine the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to be distributed and stationed throughout the State&quot;.  In carrying out this function, the section further states: &quot;The Garda Commissioner shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stationed in a district that includes a Gaeltacht area are sufficiently competent in the Irish language to enable them to use it with facility in carrying out their duties.&quot;  The Garda authorities have taken a range of steps around that.  The force has an Irish language co-ordinator.</p><p>Since 2013, it has had a specialist Irish language recruitment route in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has started to bring people through who can be deployed to Gaeltacht areas, having established their proficiency to a level of fluency.  It has also invested extensively in in-service training, particularly in areas where there is a particular requirement for Irish language skills.  I also have information, which is in the public domain, that a Garda headquarters directive from September 2018 has put in place a new process whereby sergeants and garda&iacute; who are interested in transferring to a Gaeltacht Garda station must pass an oral Irish proficiency test.  That programme is being put in place in consultation with an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, the idea being there will be a panel from which suitably qualified people can then be selected and deployed.  There is a considerable amount of effort under way on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and as was said, there have been various attempts to pre-plan in particular situations, but those are ultimately decisions for the Garda Commissioner in assigning resources rather than for the Department.</p></speech>

The monitoring and accountability mechanisms under the Act are not mediated through the Department insofar as the other designated bodies are concerned.  Whether it is the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, those oversight bodies, to the extent they have an oversight role in these areas, deal directly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

We have an awareness that there was a larger hinterland of people who are comfortable with bits of the language in a casual sense.  We do a lot of cultural work around the Irish language in the Department and that tells us there is a great interest in the language in the Department.  I mentioned in my opening remarks the events we have around Seachtain na Gaeilge, and hundreds of people attend some of those events.  However, when somebody is put on the spot and asked if they are willing to deal with a potentially complex matter involving someone's personal affairs, some people will answer that they are not quite there yet.</p> <p>  We find that number to be adequate for the demands on our services.  This may be coming back to the point made earlier that our Department is largely concerned with policy, governance, legislation and so on.  It does not provide a great deal of direct services, so we find the number of people we have who are willing to provide those services is adequate.  We are not turning anybody away, we are not failing to answer any letters, and if something needs to be translated, it gets done.</p> <p>  We would like to grow the number of people we have who are willing to provide services through Irish and we would like to refresh it because we always have new people coming into the Department.  Sometimes those people will put up their hands when they come into the Department and say they are ready to work in Irish, and other times they might need a little bit of mentoring, they might need to go on a course, or maybe Mr. &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il or one of the more experienced members of staff will need to work with them.  We would like to grow that number, but the key point is it is not hindering our service provision.</p></speech>

To be honest, when these queries come in they attract attention, and it is very easy for us to quickly deploy somebody to address it.  If the underlying query is a complex one or if one would be waiting for a long time for a decision on a case on its original merits, that is, course, different.</p> <p>  On the recruitment question, we work in the main with the Public Appointment Service, PAS, for recruitment.  We do a small amount of direct recruitment but it is mainly done through PAS.  PAS was before this committee recently and debated some of these issues.  Like other Departments, we will be studying this new legislation.  PAS will already have spoken about the types of specialist panels it has and the numbers coming through that.  It is fair to say that the numbers coming through are a good deal lower than the 20% target.  There is clearly a job of work to be done about that.  To the extent that this will provide more staff who can come to us ready to use Irish, that is welcome, but a substantial amount of work needs to be done to reach that target.

My sense is that the scheme has been largely successful in meeting the needs that we have.  I expect that the main things we will need to do with the next version of the scheme will be to reflect the changed legislative environment, but to reflect also the changes that have taken place, in particular more recently within our own Department.  I mentioned these in my opening remarks.</p> <p>  The Chairman will be familiar from the presentation of our Secretary General that we now have a whole transparency function that is about communication, engagement and awareness rating.  A key question will be how those people should be positioned to deliver all of those things as Gaeilge as much as as B&eacute;arla.  That is likely to be the focus.</p> <p>  As Mr. &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il has mentioned, the area of forms is clearly one that has been prioritised in the legislation and is something that we will take up.  I expect we will also look at some of the types of communications that are different since the time of the first scheme. We were probably dabbling in social media when the first scheme came into being.  That has clearly all changed now.  We need to look at how we engage in those sorts of environments.</p></speech>

Nuair a bh&iacute; Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il isteach ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, d&uacute;radh linn go mbeadh sc&eacute;im ag gach duine agus d&aacute; r&eacute;ir go mbeadh Gaeilge n&iacute;os aitheanta i ngach uile Roinn agus go mbeadh na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; ar fad ag caint le ch&eacute;ile as Gaeilge, ach n&iacute;or tharla sin.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; sa Bhille nua at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair ach an oiread.  Tarl&oacute;idh ruda&iacute; eile agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh dualgais sa bhreis de thairbhe ar an mBille ach n&iacute; g&aacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; gur tr&iacute; dhualgas n&oacute; tr&iacute; bhata a bhr&uacute;imid daoine chun sol&aacute;thar a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.</p> <p>  Cad iad na ruda&iacute; breise ar f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh?  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil an freagra ag na finn&eacute;ithe agus don chuid is m&oacute; n&iacute;l s&eacute; agam agus n&iacute; raibh s&eacute; ag na Ranna eile.  Cad gur f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh go hinmhe&aacute;nach, ar bheag&aacute;n costas go minic, chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn?  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&iacute; chun cinn, d&eacute;antar &eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca do dhaoine sa Roinn iad a chur chun tosaigh chun glao guth&aacute;in tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a fhreagairt mar shampla, agus is f&eacute;idir leis na daoine sin na t&eacute;arma&iacute; teicni&uacute;la a sheice&aacute;il sa ch&aacute;s sin.  An fhadhb at&aacute; ann de ghn&aacute;th n&aacute;, m&aacute; dh&eacute;antar iarracht dul i dteagmh&aacute;il le Roinn St&aacute;it tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, gheofar an freagra nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag an duine a bhfuil ar an taobh eile den ghuth&aacute;n agus iarrann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; ar an duine ag glaoch isteach to ring back when the Gaeilgeoir is here.  Uaireanta, n&iacute;l ach Gaeilgeoir amh&aacute;in ann agus m&aacute; t&aacute; an duine sin tinn, hard luck agus n&iacute; bheidh f&aacute;il ar sheirbh&iacute;s tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Sin an bhuairt at&aacute; orm.</p> <p>  Sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann, ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os &eacute;asca sa ch&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os aon seirbh&iacute;s a fh&aacute;il, ach go h&aacute;irithe toisc r&iacute;omhair&iacute; go mbeadh focl&oacute;ir ar f&aacute;il as Gaeilge agus go mbeadh gach uile dhuine at&aacute; ag freagairt f&oacute;n in ann an beag&aacute;n a r&aacute; ar a laghad.  Ina dhiaidh sin, tagann an dualgas &oacute; thaobh na seirbh&iacute;se a bheith ar f&aacute;il, ach n&iacute;limid ag f&aacute;il an bunleibh&eacute;al fi&uacute;.  N&iacute;l siad ag d&eacute;anamh comhr&aacute; bun&uacute;sach linn tr&iacute; Ghaeilge fi&uacute;.  Is minic a deir an duine a fhreagra&iacute;onn an f&oacute;n nach bhfuil Gaeilge aige n&oacute; aici agus ansin iarrann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; ar an duine at&aacute; ag glaoch an cheist a chur ar&iacute;s i mB&eacute;arla.</p> <p>  Luadh an figi&uacute;r de 2% toisc gur phain&eacute;al de 43 at&aacute; i gceist.  Deir s&eacute; sin go bhfuil breis agus 2,000 duine sa Roinn.  M&aacute; th&oacute;gtar an liosta de na feidhmeannaigh agus &eacute; sin ar fad a tugadh d&uacute;inn sna ceisteanna san &aacute;ireamh, agus t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil athruithe ag tarl&uacute;, n&iacute;l ach 30 ansin.  Sin 1.5% den fhoireann a bheadh obair acu seirbh&iacute;s i nGaeilge a thabhairt.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin scannalach i sl&iacute; amh&aacute;in.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an Bille nua ag caint faoi 20% de na st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh nua a bheith in ann Gaeilge a labhairt, agus n&iacute;l s&eacute; ach ag caint faoi sin, agus is rud &eacute; a bheidh muid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis i gceann c&uacute;pla seachtain, feictear an jab m&oacute;r a bheidh ag an Roinn dul &oacute; 1.5% n&oacute; 2% go dt&iacute; 20%.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin ach amh&aacute;in m&aacute; thagann athr&uacute; ioml&aacute;n inmhe&aacute;nach, mar n&iacute; earc&uacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh an t-athr&uacute; sin n&oacute; beidh ar gach uile dhuine at&aacute; earcaithe ag an Roinn don ch&eacute;ad deich mbliana eile l&iacute;ofa i nGaeilge agus s&aacute;sta seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge a shol&aacute;thar i nGaeilge.  Sin an difr&iacute;ocht.  D&eacute;anfaimid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis seo nuair at&aacute; an Bille &aacute; phl&eacute;, ach t&aacute; jab m&oacute;r millteach anseo.  Bh&iacute; eagras laistigh den St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s ag cur an Ghaeilge chun cinn darbh ainm Gaeleagras agus cuireadh deireadh leis.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil s&eacute; thar am againn f&eacute;achaint ar sin an athuair chun cuidi&uacute; leis seo.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil dream eile go bhfuil an r&oacute;l sin aige n&oacute; b'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an r&oacute;l sin ag Foras na Gaeilge.  M&aacute; t&aacute;, n&iacute;l ag &eacute;ir&iacute; leo n&oacute; linn mar t&aacute; an dualgas orainn ar fad an t-ardleibh&eacute;al at&aacute; muidne ag tn&uacute;th leis a r&eacute;iteach.</p></speech>

We have done various things over the year and we have had various conversation groups.  We have our own departmental f&aacute;inne and we have networks to support people who want to exchange and engage with one another in Irish in a more informal way.  We have found all those things helpful.  We do not dwell on the figure of 43 so much.  As I said earlier, we do not find that it inhibits our ability to provide services in Irish.</p><p>We would like it to be higher but we believe there is a much larger hinterland of people who are happy to engage in Irish at various levels in the Department.  We have put much effort into the cultural promotion around the language in that regard.</p><p> It is also important for people to have visible role models in the organisation who are clearly comfortable using the Irish language and who have got on very well in their careers.  We have several such dynamic people getting ahead in their careers, including many who were only very recently promoted.  It is not unusual to see people briefly interact in Irish in a casual way around the Department.  That is ultimately how to get more traction, by giving some people who might be holding back a bit the confidence to use Irish.  Mentoring and encouragement go with that as well.  The new people coming into the organisation are very important in that regard.  I take the Deputy's point that it cannot all be about recruitment but there are many new entrants to the Civil Service in recent years because of the increase in recruitment generally.  A big job we have to do is to go back over that cadre, many of whom may have been educated to a very advanced level in Irish depending on their qualifications, to ensure we are giving them an opportunity to use the language.</p><p> As to the broader debate in the context of legislation, that discussion on the challenge of the targets being discussed will engage all of the Government and the Public Appointments Service.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to continue our deliberations on the topic of employment and how it impacts the Traveller community.  This will be our second session on this subject, and we will examine the disproportionate levels of unemployment among Travellers.  I welcome those in the Public Gallery as well.  We have been looking at many different aspects of this issue, and we want to paint a picture of the situation based on Traveller voices, perspectives, and lived experiences.  We are also seeking to generate recommendations on how it could be different.  We started our public work in September and since then we have met at least 50 people and received as many submissions and more.  We have a huge body of work, which we are anxious to ensure is captured in our report.  Time is of the essence for us.  Last week, Mr. T.J. Hogan from Minc&eacute;irs Whiden told us that five and six year old Traveller children in primary school are not asked what they want to be when they are older.  The expectations are lowered even before they begin.  We were also told about the 80% rate of unemployment among Travellers and the prejudice they face in accessing employment.  Good, capable people must hide their identities and give fake addresses just to get past an employer's front door and get a job.  We will hear more about that today.  I will not repeat the statistics because the witnesses' presentations include plenty of them, as well as real life lived experiences.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Bernard Joyce from the Irish Traveller Movement back again.  He has put enormous effort into this process.  We realise that participating in these committee meetings puts Traveller organisations under pressure, and our report will reflect and reward that participation.  I acknowledge that because much work goes into these submissions.  I met Mr. Hugh Friel, men's health and development worker in the Donegal Travellers Project, in Mayo earlier this year.  I also welcome Mr. Kyle Quill, youth worker from Donegal Travellers Project; Ms Joanna Corcoran from the Galway Traveller Movement; Ms Doreen Carpenter and Mr. Oein De Bhairduin, who I know rather well, from Clondalkin Travellers Development Group; and Ms Brigid Quilligan and Mr. Michael McCarthy from Kerry Travellers Health Community Development Project.  As well as the issues we are here to discuss, we will also hear many good examples of what could be possible if we were active about tackling unemployment among Travellers. </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mobile phones interfere with the recording system so they should either be turned off or put into flight mode.</p><p> Any submissions or opening statements made to the joint committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  After the presentations there will be questions from members of the joint committee.  I call on Mr. Bernard Joyce to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

As a community we have played a significant role within the economy over many generations, if not centuries, through markets, trade, including trade in horse ownership, music, arts and labour on farms, as well as being social entrepreneurs.  When recycling was not fashionable, Travellers were frowned on by the vast majority of the population for their recycling of goods and materials.  It is now highly regarded.  Travellers are the social entrepreneurs of Ireland and have played a significant role in this regard.<br/><br/>A recent survey carried out by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, indicated that 83% of the general population said they would not employ a Traveller.  That is very disturbing and worrying.  As a community, we are ten times more likely than white Irish to experience discrimination in Ireland, and the discrimination is far higher in the hospitality sector, where Travellers are unable to even get beyond the front door to access services.  Like all the other social determinants of our lives, our opportunity for economic security and progression has a deep effect on our life opportunities and is a significant contributing factor to poverty, mental health issues and exclusion.  The natural instinct for all of us is to strive to become better and remove ourselves from the chains of poverty.  We work harder at times for less.<br/><br/>My colleagues will today articulate these matters better than I can but it is a national disgrace that 80% of Travellers are unemployed at a time of economic success.  I do not just want to focus on these matters; we now need to ensure progression towards economic stability for the Traveller community.  There is a need for significant commitment from the Government if Travellers are to fully experience quality of life and benefit from wealth at a time of economic success, where the description is &quot;full&quot; employment.  It is vital that our community is facilitated in sharing the benefits of increased wealth.  It is no longer a question of just surviving as we want to strive and achieve.<br/><br/>There are 13 actions towards employment and the Traveller economy within the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  Seven of these come under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but there is no executive lead within the Department where those actions should be ring-fenced and driven as part of a specific strategy.  The inclusion strategy's action No. 25 relates to youth in particular, and it requires the development of targeted initiatives to increase Traveller and Roma engagement with employment and training.  None of the youth-related actions is segregated by Travellers and Roma and it is not proposed to report on this regularly.<br/><br/>In Ireland&rsquo;s country report to the EU Commission under the Youth Guarantee, no data were provided on Travellers but they represent the largest unemployment group, <i>pro rata</i>, in the country and they are the earliest school leavers.  These people are a significant cohort for targeting within the Youth Guarantee but no specific monitoring is undertaken due to the lack of an ethnic identifier.  The Department also reports that the &quot;mainstream indicators used to monitor unemployment and labour market changes are detailed in Pathways to Work.&quot;  However, Travellers are not specifically targeted or named in the Pathways to Work strategy.<br/><br/>Within the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, for 2018 to 2022, led by the Department of Rural and Community Development, there are aims to reduce poverty and promote social inclusion and equality in Ireland through supporting communities and individuals using community development approaches, engagement and collaboration.</p><p>In its last report at the end of 2018 it noted: "Only a small proportion of the LCGs primarily targeted members of Roma (less than1%) and 3% of Travellers.  The difficulty in identifying and engaging with these groups was reported by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) and continues to be one of the key challenges of the programme.  Travellers, members of new communities and Roma were the least engaged groups in training, volunteering and employment by the SEs".  Some 52% of Travellers on the SICAP case load in 2018 were placed on a course, yet only 3% in 2018 progressed into employment.  This is with a budget of &euro;39 million.</p><p> The task force report recommendations of 1995 said that the public service should take a lead in the recruitment of Travellers in the mainstream labour force in Ireland.  There are 31 local authorities and funding for local government is provided mainly by the Government as well as the local property tax.  There are approximately 27,188 employed by all local authorities in Ireland.  Dublin City Council is the largest employer with 5,330 staff.  There are 304,000 people employed across the public service.  Surely there are opportunities for employment there.  "Opening Pathways to Employment for Travellers in South Dublin County Council" from March 2006 to March 2017 developed a model that can be replicated in public sector bodies.  Overall, the State has not established a national Traveller employment strategy to look at the innovative and ring-fenced programmes needed to reduce Traveller unemployment in a time of economic success.  There is no strategy in place to oversee this, yet there are employment opportunities that could be delivered in public bodies.</p><p> I am happy to address questions from members of the committee and to draw on the submission and recommendations we sent to the committee.</p></speech>

It is disgraceful in my community.  I will speak about the rural perspective of Donegal, where I come from.  Sometimes at national level the rural areas can be forgotten in terms of transport and other matters.  Donegal Travellers Project has been running for the past 20 years.  Like me, the majority of the Traveller community, approximately 94%, is employed in Donegal Travellers Project.  The other 6% of Travellers who are employed outside the Donegal Travellers Project have low paid jobs.  Two of them, my son and a lady, are employed in the HSE.  The other few jobs are low end jobs where they must hide their identity or not identify themselves as Travellers.</p> <p>  The population of Donegal is 160,000 and just over 1,200 are individuals in the Traveller community.  Outside Letterkenny, there are no members of the Traveller community employed in Ballybofey, Donegal town, Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Killybegs or Buncrana.  We talk about changing attitudes in Irish society to the Traveller community and other ethnic and minority groups.  Consider the relationship building from the perspective of Travellers taking up public sector jobs.  Mr. Joyce alluded to the local authorities.  I can speak about that with regard to County Donegal.  No Travellers are employed in the local authorities or in social welfare.  We talk about SICAP and local development companies which are supposed to be the platform for funding and leading the way.  It is the opposite.  They are not leading the way because Travellers are not employed in those sectors, and one cannot dictate to a community about employment and funding when there is nobody employed there in terms of role models.</p> <p>  There were no advocates 20 years ago in Donegal.  It was the settled community, thank God, which came out to the Traveller community and set up Donegal Travellers Project.  Twenty years later there are Travellers here who are capable of and educated to advocate on behalf of Travellers for employment.</p><p>The social change within the community has been transparent.  There is a percentage of Travellers who need the handholding mechanisms to build their skills, ability and confidence to take up employment; whether local authority or public sector jobs or hotel catering, not every employment suits everybody but we need to create the conditions beyond the Traveller organisations.  Many Travellers say they are stuck in Traveller organisations because they have the qualifications, the ability and the skills to take up other employment but they do not have the platforms because there is blatant employment discrimination within the public sector.  We need to create the conditions for apprenticeships that are transparent throughout the public sector.  Is it not quite disgraceful that there is not one member of the Travelling community in the staff?  That shows the blatant racial profiling of Travellers within the employment sector.  They cannot take up employment or if they have taken it up they have to hide their identity. </p><p> The mental health and self-esteem of young Travellers is zero.  They have no ambition because there is no ambition in the State or the community to drive people who are social welfare dependent.  That is the only light those who are social welfare dependent see in the room because they do not see any other; there is no hall light turned on, only the kitchen light because social welfare is the only benefit they have.  They cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel to take up employment.  There are no initiatives for those on social welfare.  There is jobpath which is a disgrace.  It is not creating the conditions for employment for the members of the Travelling community.  There is a landscape of work to be done in respect of employment for Travellers.  When we talk of transparency we need to look at ourselves and ask what platforms the State is creating for Travellers to take up opportunities.   </p></speech>

Members of my community experience higher levels of unemployment when compared with the settled population.  According to the CSO, 2016, the Traveller unemployment rate is 80%.  The main barriers currently experienced by Travellers as regards the labour market as well as enterprise activities include discrimination, direct or indirect - half of all Travellers feel that they experience direct discrimination, according to the all-Ireland Traveller health study; lack of appropriate enterprise guidance and support from mainstream enterprise support organisations, and lack of trust among Travellers with traditional business support providers; loss of benefits, or fear of loss of benefits particularly in relation to the medical card, given Travellers' poorer health status than that of the general population.  This can mean that Travellers will be fearful of taking up employment or testing new enterprise ideas; lack of visible role models as many Travellers need to hide their identity to succeed in a hostile and anti-Traveller work environment; a national survey of Travellers in 2017 found that 52% of Travellers said they had experienced an obstacle when accessing employment, and 43% indicated they have encountered discrimination while accessing employment.</p> <p>  Discrimination against Travellers, racism, unemployment and social exclusion have a negative impact on all Travellers - women, men, young people and children.  Travellers are not gaining employment from the mainstream State investment in enterprise programmes, foreign direct investment, training initiatives, and local development programmes.  There is a national Traveller Roma and inclusion strategy, NTRIS, but there is no additional money or resources attached to the employment and enterprise actions in NTRIS.  We fear that the strategy will end in 2021, and there will no improvement in the situation of Travellers in employment.</p><p>We need to create opportunities for Travellers to gain real jobs.  We in the Galway Traveller Movement, GTM, alone have created 16 jobs for members of the Traveller community through our social enterprise activities.  Since 2007, GTM has pursued an ambitious enterprise and social enterprise development strategy.  We have formed two social enterprises: First Class Insulation which has provided home insulation services in the west of Ireland since 2010 and has delivered the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI's better energy warmer homes scheme to more than 1,500 homes; and Bounce Back Recycling which has recycled mattresses in the Connacht and Ulster waste region since 2017.  We are one of only three mattress recyclers in the country.</p><p> Our social enterprise mission is to explore and expand new social enterprise opportunities in order to increase employment opportunities for Traveller men and women; develop a powerful model of economic self-determination to inspire the wider community; reclaim the community&rsquo;s role in environmental and economic sustainability; and, finally, promote the visibility of our work in order to challenge racism and discrimination.  A third social enterprise, Springback Upcycling, which will provide furniture refurbishment and up-cycling services, is at start-up stage.</p><p> Our most recent achievements in 2019 include the following.  Bounce Back Recycling was nominated for a Green Award 2020 in the green NGO category, the winner of which will be announced in February 2020.  A feature on Bounce Back Recycling was broadcast on RT&Eacute; Radio 1&rsquo;s "Today with Sean O&rsquo;Rourke" on 21 November 2019.  The model of Galway Traveller Movement&rsquo;s social enterprise activities, including First Class Insulation and Bounce Back Recycling, was featured as a key contributor and the basis of a workshop at the first National Social Enterprise Conference, organised by the Department of Rural and Community Development on 21 November 2019.  Bounce Back was one of 16 national awardees of the Social Innovation Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s Social Enterprise Development Fund Award 2019.  Bounce Back is working with the Climate-Kic Accelerator programme with Trinity College Dublin.  First Class Insulation, FCI, has successfully tendered for appointment to the panel of SEAI contractors.  FCI has delivered the better energy warmer homes scheme to more 1,500 homes in County Galway.  We have also developed a model and toolkit for supporting Traveller women entrepreneurs.</p><p> We have made recommendations relating to enterprise, employment, social enterprise, and local enterprise strategies based on our experience and track record.  We have made some recommendations that apply to all enterprise and employment bodies.  It is essential that the needs of Travellers, and other groups, are assessed in preparation for all enterprise and employment programmes so that services will be appropriate to the needs and experiences of members of the Traveller community.  This means that Travellers decision-making is part of the decision-making and planning processes, at local and national level, with State agencies involved in enterprise, employment and labour market support.  Equality impact assessment should be mandatory in all policies and actions plans relating to employment and enterprise and Travellers should be involved in this process.  All enterprise and employment agencies and bodies must collect data on the participation and access of Travellers in their programmes.  To do this they need to introduce an ethnic identifier.  Once they have the data, agencies should report and monitor the ongoing engagement of Travellers with their services and take action where there is a low take-up.  Anti-racism and cultural awareness training should be mandatory for staff of State agencies and funded bodies.  It should not be a one-off process.  If the above actions were undertaken, they would support the legal obligations of agencies and bodies under the public sector equality and human rights duty.</p><p> Our specific recommendations relating to employment include the following.  There should be a positive action programme in the public sector which targets Travellers in recruitment processes.  This should be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service with the involvement and partnership of Traveller organisations to support its implementation.  Given the significant funding provided by the State to support private enterprises, the State should require private employers in receipt of State supports to put in place strategies and actions to secure a diverse workforce.  The State should also put in place resources to support this.  The special initiative for Travellers, SIT, aimed to explore approaches to tackling unemployment and underemployment of Travellers and to support Travellers in the Traveller economy.</p><p>GTM delivered SIT programmes for two years.  We were granted a further programme when it was moved from the then Department of Social Protection to the Department of Justice and Equality.  However, with this changeover, the funding stream was lost and we were informed that no new calls would be made under the programme.  GTM calls for SIT to be reinstated, and for all SIT programmes to be located within Traveller representative organisations.</p><p> Regarding Traveller-led social enterprise, we welcome the recent national social enterprise policy and recommend the following actions under its implementation.  Key performance indicators and targets must be established under this programme, including targets and strategies for Traveller-led social enterprise.  GTM could be funded as a selected organisation to support Traveller organisations on a national basis to explore social enterprise development.  We are well placed to do this, and as a result of recent national radio and conference coverage, we are receiving requests for support from Traveller organisations and local development companies.</p><p> Given the role of communities in national climate action and renewable energy strategies and the significant role of social enterprises in the green economy, we need a green economy and climate action social enterprise strategy.  Communities need greater access to capital infrastructure, such as for enterprise and social enterprise activities, and should be facilitated in acquiring these from State agencies which are disposing of assets.  This is already the case in Scotland.</p><p> The use of social clauses and social considerations in the procurement process is provided for in the procurement directives, and a pilot to explore how this could work should be developed.  GTM has experience of delivering social benefits through the procurement process as it is a community-based provider of the SEAI better energy warmer homes scheme, and it can use its expertise in working with communities to support their take-up of this scheme.  We are well placed to participate in such a pilot.</p><p> Much support for enterprise development is managed and planned at local levels, through local authorities' local enterprise offices, and is informed by local economic and community plans, LECPs.  For the next round of developing LECPs and local enterprise support, local planning processes must include the formal participation of the most disadvantaged communities, including Travellers.  Local structures must give an explicit commitment to this when developing local plans.  Unless Traveller organisations are involved, the plans that emerge cannot address the employment and enterprise needs of Travellers.  The strategic policy committees for economic development and structures to develop LECPs must have Traveller participation.</p><p> Equality of outcome should be a key objective of the LECPs.  Reports on the outcomes of the plans must include data on the take-up, outcomes and supports accessed by Travellers.  Specific provisions to include the Traveller economy must be part of the LECPs, including making resources available for targeted initiatives to support Travellers.  Enterprise supports at local level should be culturally specific and target the engagement of Traveller trainers and mentors.  Collaboration should take place with Traveller organisations in designing, delivering and promoting targeted supports and programmes, including enterprise programmes and social enterprises.</p></speech>

We can read more about Galway Traveller Movement in its submission to the committee.  It has truly led the way here and given us much food for thought.  That is why I allowed Ms Corcoran to go over time, but I also want to hear from the other witnesses.  GTM has had some really practical experience and I congratulate it on its groundbreaking work.  It is truly impressive.</p> <p>  I now call Ms Doreen Carpenter from the Clondalkin Travellers Development Group. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Doreen Carpenter" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019121700002#H00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to be here today.  I work in the Clondalkin Travellers Development Group, CTDG, which was established to address the needs of Travellers in the Clondalkin area.  Over time, it has expanded to other areas and now works with Travellers in Lucan, Newcastle and Palmerstown.  Almost 8% of all Travellers in Ireland live within the south Dublin area.</p> <p>  CTDG is a partnership between Travellers and the wider community, working to promote the rights of Travellers as a nomadic ethnic group within Irish society, and we seek to address issues through a collective mechanism of work.  Historically, both national and local policies have challenged the traditional employment routes and access points for Travellers, either directly through the repression of nomadism, for example, or indirectly through legislation such as the Casual Trading Act, which forced many Travellers, particularly women, out of the labour market due to a lack of appropriate supports.</p><p>Subsequent State policies and strategies on the stimulation and development of the economy have either been weak or entirely lacking in vision for the inclusion of Travellers in the journey towards a more prosperous Ireland for all children.  The barriers to employment for Travellers are a multitude because of the lack of a robust education strategy, the ongoing accommodation crisis, issues regarding the gaps of understanding by institutes and employers of Travellers and the very real fear of the loss of supports such as medical cards. </p><p> It has been our experience that many of the Travellers who are in employment outside of Traveller organisations and networks actively conceal their identity to improve their employment possibilities, a strategy that has had many long-term negative consequences for those forced into such practices.  Mental health issues and stressors have also continued to challenge the employment possibilities for Travellers.  The issues of accommodation, education and health are all linked to employment and underline and undermine progressive strategies and actions aimed at increasing the numbers of Travellers in employment.  These factors need must be taken into consideration -  there are multiple levels of discrimination and challenge that Travellers experience daily.  In the past there were some particularly successful employment programmes such as South Dublin County Council's employment initiative which created positions in the outdoor duties section of various departments and clerical administration roles.  Many of those who took part in the pilot programme progressed to full-time and part-time roles within the council.  This was of dual benefit, with the community recognising the importance of council activities and the council creating specific inclusion and access points for Travellers who could be seen not just as clients but also as colleagues.  </p><p> Currently we run the crossbar bike enterprise training and employment programme, an initiative supported by the Department of Justice and Equality that has created opportunities for Travellers to engage and receive training and certification in City and Guilds bike mechanics and electric bike maintenance.  The programme has delivered bike safety training and road safety training in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local schools.  It has also created spaces at health fairs; developed local relationships particularly with prison services; engaged young people by providing mentoring and work experience; and has established itself as a repair unit for bicycles as well as a retail unit selling both bikes and bike parts.  The programme has been particularly successful as it provides a wide range of wraparound services such as accommodation support, drug and alcohol support and access to a Traveller-specific counsellor.  This work is further supported by a steering group that is led in partnership with the community, board of management, local enterprise office and the South Dublin county partnership.  Further development of this programme, including seeding it in different regions, would be a positive step towards increasing the employment and engagement of Travellers in different areas.  A past participant has now taken over the management of the programme which has sent a strong signal to the Traveller community that programmes such as this can and do work.  While the State can encourage private industry and companies to create space for Travellers among their teams and employees, it can also lead by example by creating different positions at appropriate levels in Government Departments and agencies under their remit.  This is something that is immediately doable and would lead to a dramatic shift in community relations and understanding and reduce the percentage of Travellers who remain outside of the employment market. </p><p> Clondalkin Travellers Development Group supports the specific provisions within the community employment scheme structures that waive the need for 12 months of unemployment in order to access the scheme.  In the past this waiver has supported our work and engagement with young Travellers in the context of higher level education, employment exposure and training.</p><p>Internship programmes could be supported to particularly target bringing Travellers into their structures.  Employer exchange programmes could be established, the grandparenting of established skill sets could be considered for different training courses, and cultural awareness training for employers could be made more accessible for employees in order to challenge the pervasive misunderstanding and racism towards Travellers.  It is not about ability; it is about ethnicity.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  I hope our recommendations are taken onboard.</p></speech>

My name is Brigid Quilligan and I am a Traveller woman from Killarney.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. Michael McCarthy, a Traveller man from Listowel, who is our men&rsquo;s health worker.  We are joined in the Public Gallery by representatives of our community, Ms Nora O'Brien and Mr. Martin Mahon, our vice chair.  In solidarity, we are also joined by Ms Hillary Scanlan from the Kerry HSE community work department.</p> <p>  Details of our project's work can be found in our submission.  This is our second time before the committee and due to time constraints I ask people to refer to the submission.  We come here today with recommendations which if actioned would create meaningful change for our community.  On Friday, 6 December we held a county-wide consultation for older Travellers in Kerry.  I have been directed by my elders not to ask or seek, but to demand change for our people.  I hope we will show honour and respect to our elders and all who paved the way for us today in bringing their voices forward.  They would like it to be known that we are a proud, dignified, resourceful, clever and great people.  They wish to relay, particularly to our younger generation who are watching this, to never to forget that we have gone out into the world and made a living for hundreds of years, without reading or writing.  We have travelled all over the world and been successful, and we can do that in Ireland too with some supports and the removal of some obvious barriers. </p> <p>  Using a social determinants model of health in Kerry Traveller organisations, we see clear health implications associated with poor living conditions, the high levels of exclusion and discrimination faced by Travellers and a lack of opportunities for progression.  These issues, experienced to a greater or lesser extent by most Travellers on a daily basis, impact negatively on both mental and physical health.  Employment and progression have a major impact on physical and mental health as well.  Our organisation has a long track record of supporting local Traveller leadership, further education, mentoring and employment within our own project.  We have a diverse cross-cultural team and board, which is Traveller led, though we work in meaningful partnership with others.  We also work with education providers and employment services to develop opportunities for Travellers, with Travellers.  The thinking and actions around Traveller employment are too small minded, are not ambitious enough nationally and do not reflect a serious approach to supporting an indigenous ethnic minority group with an unemployment rate of 80%.  Travellers report being fed up of being on a hamster wheel of consultations, short courses, training courses, or schemes with no meaningful outcomes for individuals or their families.  Change is needed.</p> <p>  In our experience, the community is the best judge of what is successful and what changes are needed.  If there is an opportunity to make money and have a better life for their families, we can say with authority that Travellers will take it.  It is often reported that Travellers do not want to engage in the mainstream workforce, or that we do not want to engage in legitimate self-employment.  We challenge this.</p><p>We have a waiting list of 38 people in our project who regularly contact us actively seeking employment.  We also engage with several small business owners who are Travellers who advise us on leadership, business development and social enterprise.</p><p> With an unemployment rate of 80% nationally, while we do not have the county breakdown for Kerry, we know in the course of our work that there is a high unemployment level and poverty throughout the county.  The largest employer of Travellers in the county is Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project.  On the island of Ireland, we know that Traveller organisations are the largest employers of Travellers.  For example, of the 972 Traveller women employed in Ireland in the 2016 census, 400 of them are employed as primary healthcare workers, with approximately 100 women employed as co-ordinators - women like myself - community development workers, education workers and Traveller workers within Traveller organisations.</p><p> Kerry Traveller Health Community Development Project has a health action zone with five Traveller community health workers.  We will recruit two more in 2020.  This model of training, mentoring, supporting and employing Travellers to deliver services to Travellers is extremely successful.  We are supported by the HSE community work department and the Traveller health unit.  This funding is ring-fenced nationally and these positions are only available to Travellers, making this an affirmative action programme.  This system demonstrates that Travellers in high numbers can be successfully employed if affirmative action programmes were developed across the public sector, the Civil Service and the NGO sector.</p><p> A small number of Traveller women in Kerry are employed in social care, home help, as personal assistants, cleaners and shop assistants.  A number of Travellers in Kerry own their own business in the areas of market trading, construction, cleaning, catering and the beauty industry.  We are highly innovative and resourceful people, very hard-working and with a great work ethic.  There is a high value in sole trading and employment in the county.  In the county, as happens in all communities, we have people who are doing very well financially and independent of the State and we have people who are experiencing great poverty.  In a recent survey conducted by us on the mental health issues among Travellers in Kerry, two relevant findings were that, first, young men aged 17 to 30 are at a loss because of unemployment, leaving them vulnerable to mental health issues and addictions; and, second, poverty and inability to provide basic needs for one's family are cited as the third biggest stress after discrimination and lack of appropriate accommodation.</p><p> The factors that affect Traveller participation in the labour market are outlined in detail in our submission.  I will name the headings and might give an example.  A very basic one is institutional racism and commonplace discrimination that impacts on every Traveller in the country in the areas of health, accommodation, education, employment and social activities.  Prejudices, stereotyping and negative generalisations among the general population cause widespread discrimination against us.  That has a major impact on the labour market also.</p><p> The labour market in rural counties such as Kerry, and I am sure it is the same in Donegal being another isolated county, is very competitive.  That puts us at the very end of the barrel.  Many Travellers who work as nurses, teachers and solicitors in the county do not reveal their identity.  To a degree, these people&rsquo;s employment is secure once they are established in their roles.  What is more precarious is the position of unskilled workers such as the cleaners, the people working in factories and shops or those with their own small businesses.  They have to hide their identities and tolerate people talking about Travellers as if they are not in the room using the "K" word and making derogatory comments about Travellers.  We have case after case, and I have outlined a number of examples in the submission, about people we are supporting who have experienced discrimination in the workplace.  Sadly, most of those are young people who are very vulnerable and need support.  On their entry into the workplace at work experience they are encountering deep discrimination.  That mars their impression of the workforce for the rest of their lives.</p><p> The accounts of experiences of discrimination faced when trying to access the job market are too numerous to outline.  That is a genuine comment.</p><p>Anyone of us here today could give members several examples in our own lives of our path here today.  I will outline these because they are really important for educators, employers and anybody in positions of power.  Three men in our county in the past two years wanted to do apprenticeships.  One condition for being accepted on an apprenticeship programme is having a sponsor.  The education provider was brilliant and used personal contacts to try to support the young men.  Unfortunately, they could not find sponsors and, therefore, did not qualify for the apprenticeship scheme.  None of these men progressed in education.  The same thing happened to a young woman.  Another example involved a self-employed man who was a fully qualified and experienced roofer and fully tax-compliant.  He was asked to leave a job he was about to start.  An off-duty Garda in the area went to the house owner and told the house owner that this man was a cowboy and "one of the boys" and would overcharge the householder and do substandard work.  This self-employed man has no dealings whatsoever with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is a legitimate tradesman but had to leave the premises.  There is a stereotype that Traveller tradesmen are con men who rob the elderly and are not legitimate businessmen so Traveller businessmen and businesswomen conceal their identities in large numbers.  </p><p> There is a disproportionately lower level of attainment in education than in the majority population.  Poor outcomes for Travellers over generations have had a devastating effect on their ability to compete in the jobs market based on an applicant's qualifications.  Generations of Traveller children have experienced substandard segregated education.  Investment in Traveller education is the 1990s saw improvements but cuts in 2009 saw a massive roll-back around that.  </p></speech>

I know we have the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy and it is strong but this problem is so significant that we need a dedicated Department with dedicated staff and resources to oversee this plan.  This involves working on the areas of health, accommodation, employment, education, equality, culture, history, language and our representation.  Our recommendations also include a national employment action plan for Travellers developed in consultation with Travellers; the inclusion of Travellers in mainstream national employment policy such as the national action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work; and education, training, employment and social enterprise with financial remuneration aimed specifically at those aged over 55 in Kerry.  Investment is needed to address the inequality of outcomes in Traveller education.  Traveller economy and enterprise should be supported to develop building on the strength that already exists in our community.  Internships, apprenticeships and traineeships designed to facilitate Traveller culture should be introduced.  Barriers in accessing current further education should be addressed.  Affirmative action programmes of employment across all Government Departments, the public sector, the Civil Service and publicly funded non-profit organisations should be introduced.<br/><br/>We thank the committee for the invitation to present our story and trust that we will action and change following the committee's deliberations.  I will finish by reading a quote from one member of our community in Kerry.  </p> <blockquote> 	Your respect and your dignity is everything.  That was taken from me and a lot more.  We are only numbers.  They have completely messed up our young people with this education system.  They ask you what you want or need and they do the complete opposite.  I'm not wasting any more time telling what I need.  A quick look around the cold houses, empty purses, broken-hearted mothers and wives over the drugs, drink and suicide will tell them all they need to know if they care.  We have smart people working for us but are ye listened to?  No, girleen, ye are not.  </blockquote></speech>

It is not something that happened overnight.  It has been a prevailing attitude right throughout the Departments of State and within my own community - the settled community.  When there is 80% unemployment such as in the working class areas I represent of Crumlin and Drimnagh, and areas such as Cabra, if people are unable to access work, their only option is to depend on social welfare or find money somewhere else and do something else to get the few extra bob in one's pocket if one wants to feed one's children, purchase all those basic needs and pay bills.  In many ways when the settled community says, "Look at that person on the make" or that they are not accredited, they will do a sub-standard job or they will rob, it is that racism that the State has allowed to develop.</p><p> All the submissions that the witnesses put in as groups are positive.  They are putting forward ways that we can deal with it.  The proposed Department of Traveller affairs is something that we should highlight.  The point the Travellers have made from the beginning is: everything with us, not without us.  The Traveller input must be included all along the way.  It looks as though with all the reports we have had, there has been some input by the Traveller community but in many of them, there was not.  That is what we will have to push in the recommendations we make.</p><p> It is brilliant the work that the Galway Traveller movement and the Clondalkin Traveller Development Group have done in those enterprises.  They are brilliant initiatives but they are not enough.  We need targeted ways of developing the skills that the Traveller community has, and can bring into employment.  I support every recommendation.  I refer to Ms Quilligan and the Kerry Travellers' recommendations.  Different ones are crucial.</p><p> There are members of the Traveller community over 50 who are not working.  How can they be targeted to get back into work?  As I said at the previous meeting, I know a number of people who are in that position.  They just do not have the confidence, the education and the skills, and the Intreo offices are not supporting them.  It is a matter of bringing that down into those Departments to direct those people into employment.  Then there are those in their 20s, 30s and 40s who have not been able to get jobs and young people in education for whom it is a matter of ensuring that they get the proper education that they need.  We have had hearings on education, social inclusion, etc.  I do not have many questions to ask.  How can these groups be targeted?  It is all there.  We have it from the community.  We have it from the witnesses saying what needs to be done.  I support, in particular, the affirmative action programmes across the public sector.  We have done it with disability where one walks into Agriculture House and on every floor one will see somebody in a wheelchair, with a walking stick or whatever working full time and contributing to the workplace.  We need that same action throughout the public sector.  One seldom sees it in private industry; one mainly sees it in the public sector.</p></speech>

It came strongly through our latest consultation where we had a whole room of over 55s stating that there is nothing there for them.  The training centres were closed down.  Although not ideal, as there was little progression for people, it was something.  People now are at a loss.  They have nothing.  They are at home.  Their mental health is suffering.  They are living in poverty.  They have been completely let down, both in my opinion and their opinion, by the Irish State.</p><p>They told us they felt very let down.  It is about activation programmes, training programmes where there is a little income to lift these people out of poverty, and targeted programmes in consultation with them about what they want to train as and would like to do.  That includes social enterprises.  One woman relayed that she would like to set up a curtain-making business.  Some people would like to set up a market trading enterprise.  There are many country markets around the country that people could be supported to get back into.</p></speech>

We were recently working with a man who wanted to become a farrier.  He has worked with horses for his entire life.  The process of becoming a qualified farrier is quite a long one but there would be repetition in that he would have to learn things that he already knew.  One might look at people who already have skills and ask how one can quicken the pace towards them getting the qualification that they have almost achieved already.  That would be very doable.</p></speech>

One should not have to go through an education process to have one's experience and skills recognised.  That is an extremely interesting point that I never considered.  We should definitely think about and look at that.  Whoever feels they want to comment can take this question.  I was thinking about the public sector and recommendation No. 8 from the Kerry Travellers Health Community Development Project.  Ms Quilligan mentioned the public service, voluntary sector, local authorities and such.  I think we are all waiting for those sectors to change internally and suddenly care, and it is as if we have to wait for them all not to be racist for Travellers to apply.  What suggestions can we make for affirmative action?  There have to be employers in this country who do not feel like that.  If they were to say that they are quite happy to employ Travellers, then what do Travellers need if they have been out of employment for a long time or have been burnt by negative experiences before?  If an employer was not looking at traineeships or apprenticeships but was just employing Travellers in general, I feel that more work has to happen for Travellers to feel comfortable, welcome and valued by their peers.  They should not have to wait for their peers to be ready.  What supports can the State provide to employers for a Traveller who may have been out of employment or school for a long time, so that he or she can work for three days a week and the other two can be for development?  The expectation of going in from nine-to-five might not be enough for a Traveller to be able to feel comfortable, since he or she might want to upskill.  How can the State and employers work together to create a more flexible system?</p> <p>  Throughout the austerity period, there was a middle class coup of jobs that ordinarily we in working class communities or the Traveller community would have had the most access to.  There is now a system where we are battling a whole other class of people for the jobs that we always obtained.  Is there any sort of analysis of the types of jobs, such as recycling or related to horses, that Travellers would ordinarily have done that have been somewhat taken over?  People from the private sector were no longer able to get jobs and came in to this, then started to demand that people should have a third level degree to do the job they have done for their entire lives.  It pushed out people with that local knowledge and understanding of the communities in which they have grown up, lived, worked and provided services.  Ms Carpenter and I worked together nearly a decade ago in the community sector and much has changed in the addiction, community and voluntary sector with regard to the expectations of what a person must have on his or her CV to get a job that he or she has been doing for 20 to 40 years.  What can be done at a community development level to push back and battle this?  We are guilty of not seeing our job as bringing in people who might need a little bit more investment on the way.  They might not be job-ready.  No one wants to give up time in their working day to invest in people who are maybe younger and entering the workforce for the first time.</p><p>Everyone says, " That is not my job", so people have to come in with a super-ready skills set and if they do not have that, they are not good enough.</p><p>  I wonder whether we are failing at community development level.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is why we are failing because it is all about job activation.  If people are not job-ready, why would anyone invest in the Traveller community in the first place?  I do want this to be a PR exercise at that community level and in regard to employers.  I never want to see employers or Government bodies, for example, all of a sudden saying they have taken on three Travellers in a Department and then selling it as some sort of "Aren't we great?" exercise.  It should not happen quietly but, at the same time, it should not happen in a way that exposes Travellers who are coming into organisations as some sort of charitable exercise.  We have a  problem in that we have a ruling class in our employment sector who think they know better than the Traveller community and while consultation happens, they say, "We know better, so we will provide this".  That came up earlier when someone mentioned that people are ignored when they put the solutions forward.  The organisations represented here are putting forward solutions.</p></speech>

Why is that?  It is because they think they know better.</p> <p>  The point about cold houses and empty purses struck me.  If that basic need of safety and standard of living is not met, how can anyone be expected to self-actualise in respect of the skills and power they have as a human being?  It is important that if we are going to move towards creating spaces where employers start to consider the diversity of their workforce, they also need to understand the living conditions someone is coming from and not put unachievable expectations on them when they are only beginning that process of employment.  There are some questions in there somewhere.</p></speech>

First, the quality of outcome for members of the Traveller community is no more than for the settled community in terms of employment.  Second, not all Travellers are job-ready.  There are different pathways to employment and there are some people at the bottom of the stairs, others in the middle and some at the top.  It is a question of how we can create the conditions through community development to get the people from the bottom to the top of the stairs.</p> <p>  The Senator alluded to the point about the local authority and not holding up Travellers, and I point out that we have employed three Travellers.  On the platform that needs to be built for the Traveller community, to which Ms Quilligan and others alluded, role models need to be created within the community and that has to be transparent throughout the country.</p> <p>  We ran a mental health conference on 15 November, to which I referred in the submission.  We had 43 men in attendance, including two settled men who were Traveller workers, one from Sligo and one I brought in from the mental health services to talk about suicide and mental health.  I was trying to get them to understand the social determinants and what affects people's health, education, employment and inequality.  I asked how many in the room had passed their leaving certificate and only one person said, "Yes".  I asked how many had passed their junior certificate and the same person was the only one, and he was sitting beside me.  There were four employed, one from Sligo, myself and two of the workers from Donegal Travellers Project out of the 44 people in the room, and nobody else stood up.  It was shocking for me to think, on a human level, that this was the case in my community.  Even driving the car up this morning, I was thinking how many Travellers are driving to work this morning, given we see thousands of people doing their commute to work every morning.</p><p>Cultural awareness training and information around the Traveller community are needed because people are sometimes ignorant of these matters and they can be blinded by racially motivated discrimination and a sense that Travellers are inferior to the settled community.  The ignorance of people towards Travellers leads to inaccuracies in their perceptions of them.  A lot of members of the settled community never meet a Traveller, never engage with a Traveller and never have a conversation with a Traveller.  Stereotypical and negative views are portrayed through the media, family resources, friends or associates in the workplace.  There is much work to be done on cultural awareness and building relationships.  Relationships are crucial to getting to a stage where Travellers who are in employment are not hiding their identity but are proud of who they are.  As Ms Quilligan has alluded to, there are Travellers in employment who are hiding their identity.  I spoke to a man who is in a high position in his workplace who is hiding his identity and he said his life would be hell if he revealed that he is a member of the Travelling community.  He did not want to express that, even though he is as a role model in his profession.  There are Travellers who are in the position of role models but they have to hide their identities because of society and recent profiling.  I mention the Aboriginals and the Native Americans.  We have an overpopulation of Travellers within the prison system.  Why is that?  We must look at the low levels of attainment in education and employment.  People have to buy their bread and butter, as was alluded to.  There are a lot of mechanisms that need to be changed and put in gear to change the circumstances and the platforms that exist.</p></speech>

That is one good initiative that is taking place.</p> <p>  I have been around these tables a long time and I was joking with Mr. McCarthy about this at our staff team meeting.  I pointed out we were saying the same thing 20 to 25 years ago.  He told me I was repeating myself but I told him I hope he is not here in 25 years saying this same thing to young people.  We need to stop taking the crumbs from the table because that is what we are getting.  Matching up with employers could have an impact for individuals but if we want a mass impact and if we really want to create change, the State will have to live up to its duty and take affirmative action for Travellers to redress and address the inequality that exists.  The State could do that easily.  The primary healthcare programme is a phenomenal success.  We need programmes such as that for education, equality, home help and carers.  We need that right across the system.  We have made that change in the Department of Health and in the Department of Education and Skills there are employers in place already.  We have the people ready to go in and train.  I have 38 people in Kerry, which is a small county, who would walk into a traineeship or a job today, as some of them are work-ready.  That is the tip of the iceberg.  We have the people there.  We just need the State to meet us halfway.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations to achieve that was to have a positive action programme in the public sector that targets Travellers in public sector recruitment.  If Travellers feel there is a safe space to go into, they will apply for jobs.  One way to provide that is to address the issue of hate speech and hate speech legislation and to get that issue sorted in order to ensure Travellers are covered under that.  Along with that, actions should be taken to challenge employers.</p><p>If the challenge is put to the employers on addressing inequalities when it comes to employing ethnic minorities, for example, then we will definitely see change.  On the way in which a lot of jobs are advertised, we are seeing some unnecessary entry requirements.  I know there are plenty of Travellers who would be able to take on roles but part of getting an interview is having a leaving certificate.  Life skills and life experiences are not taken into account, as was gone into a little bit earlier.  In a room full of Travellers who have not done their leaving certificate, none of them can apply for that job or will not apply for it because that in itself will put them off.  It is one of the recommendations that employers avoid having unnecessary requirements just to apply for a job.</p></speech>

I must say the contributions over the last number of weeks have been very enlightening and will really help inform the recommendations of our report.  With every document I read and every contribution I hear, I am thinking about what recommendations to make to ensure that witnesses' voices are heard and that there are actually actions as a result of it.  From what I have been hearing over the past number of weeks, the biggest barriers seem to be the racial profiling, stereotyping and institutional racism.  The other problem I am hearing is lack of funding.</p> <p>  It strikes me that as a committee, we have to think about the whole approach that any future Government is going to have to take in dealing with this matter.  There has to be a whole-of-government approach and a whole-of-society approach.  We have to take that approach because if we do not, there is going to be a certain pocket of money here and a certain pocket of money there; some agencies will be productive and others will not.  There was a reference to a gentleman who lost business because a Garda with prejudices allowed those prejudices to influence the fact that he damaged a man's reputation and his opportunity to make a business deal.  That would be unacceptable and is unacceptable now.  What I am trying to get at is that every single Department would have a proper education system in place and that it would be part of their training, so that they would understand much better the outcome of their actions and understand about racial profiling, stereotyping and the impact they can have.  That is one thing.  The other thing is around media and how the media report certain things.  I am going back to the whole-of-society approach.  In third level institutions where people are designing degree programmes, perhaps there should be specific modules for those who are training to work in media, business or whatever, so that there would be a piece there for them and they would learn about all this.</p> <p>  There is something much broader here than just picking certain areas where we need to put in funding.  I would love to hear the witnesses' views on that.  There will be a general election coming up quite soon and I was just wondering if any engagement has been made with political parties in terms of their manifestos and what actions they will putting into them.  I know this is a bit broader but it is no harm to be thinking about it anyway.</p><p>That could be engaged with straightaway and would be important.</p><p> I agree with what has been said about affirmative action and mainstreaming, which would be crucial.</p><p> I also thought what was said about older people was interesting.  I think about the skills of some older men and women.  The Irish Men's Sheds Association is a great organisation with which I have had many dealings and I wonder has there been engagement with them at national level.  It is a good organisation, which receives quite a lot of public funding.  Some of the recently retired men I know in the settled community are finding them fantastic outlets and similar organisations would be good for the older community.  I heard recently that women's sheds have also been established, which is interesting.  Ms Quilligan's statement on the elders and their demands for action was moving.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure the change that has been demanded takes place and I would be interested in hearing the views of our guests.</p><p> The pilot scheme with the SEAI is a great idea but we need more than pilots; that must be mainstreamed.</p><p> This is the direction in which we need to be going and I would like to hear the views of our guests about the whole-of-society approach.  If change is to happen, that is the only way it is going to work.</p></speech>

I also like the idea of women's sheds as I might sometimes like to hide in one.</p></speech>

It needs to be a whole change, part of which will start with education that should never stop at any age.  One of our recommendations is something that we always say: anti-racism, cultural awareness training and dignity should be embodied into everything.  If dignity is embodied into all kinds of training, it will be brought out everywhere.  It will not happen overnight but we are thinking about future generations because the struggle we have faced has been going on for years.  As Ms Quilligan said earlier, we are where we are because of the continued fight and challenging of attitudes.  We must start that now in the development of the education curricula for nurseries and primary schools so that change happens.  Cultural awareness training needs to be mandatory in all organisations, public and private, in all sectors.  That is a recommendation that would have far-reaching consequences.</p> <p>  The pilot schemes with First Class Insulation, FCI, and Bounce Back Recycling are brilliant.  We have done that on the back of the small amount of support that is there now.  Imagine the success we could have if we had proper funding and support across Ireland for the Traveller economy.  It would be brilliant.</p></speech>

I will not put them on the spot, but I encourage them to come forward if they would like to make a comment on anything they have heard.</p></speech>

I heard mention of people over 50 years old, men's sheds and other things but nothing has been said about younger people, including those in their 20s.  There is no dedicated target planned to support Travellers in training facilities and that needs to change.  Those facilities are where one is supposed to go for employment and there is a long-term unemployment problem for Travellers, especially young Travellers.  Young Travellers come to me all the time asking if I can get them a job, and I am stuck because I cannot.</p><p>They are leaving school early because they face racism and discrimination.  They themselves and their families have very low expectations of them going on to get a junior certificate, a leaving certificate and going to third-level education.  There is no real support for them to go on and get employment either.  There is no real support for them to push on to third-level education.  Nowadays education is key.  It needs to be implemented strongly, with agencies such as Intreo and SOLAS.  There must be a dedicated plan for the young people to support them and get them employment.  For me, it is like, "Kyle, can you get me a job?"</p></speech>

A safe space whenever one is working is a major issue because there are many Travellers hiding their identity and they are trying to get work.  Whenever they are hiding their identity, they are hearing discriminatory and racist comments about Travellers.  I myself experienced it.</p></speech>

When I was working for a different organisation, I was in a retail store and they would say that whenever the Travellers would come in one should press the button on the phone, make an announcement or something like that so that everybody in the store would know who was coming in.  With me sitting there, that made me feel low.  I had low self-esteem.  It angered me.  Channelling that anger, I wanted to do something.  I wondered how other young people would challenge this.  That is why I became a youth worker.  I wanted to change it.  The likes of these training centres should be making a dedicated target plan for young people to proceed in long-term employment.</p></speech>

It is best that they do not have more time on their hands.  Drug and alcohol addiction is picking up.  More young people are vulnerable to it.  They are going drinking all the time.  They are getting into drugs.  They are trying to make fast money.  It should not happen.  The education route is the way it should go and it should lead to employment.  These services should pick up on it.</p></speech>

It is sad that one has such a young population and yet when one looks at the employment opportunities, they will not live beyond that age.</p> <p>  The other side of that is one is also looking at people living in the housing crisis.  Travellers are living in some of the worst conditions that any human being could live in.  They are expected to go into mainstream employment without having adequate facilities.</p><p>People are generally not living but surviving.  We have to move beyond survival to people living, and thinking about opportunities that can prevail.  Having to hide one's identity because of shame, stigma or ridicule is fundamentally wrong and flawed.  The onus should not be on a young person to have to live with that but must be on the State to respond in such a way that it creates a very open, diverse, inclusive society that is fair and just and supports people regardless of their ethnicity.  That is a shame for society and it is a shame that we do not have a national anti-racism strategy in place, that we do not have hate crime legislation<i>in situ</i>and that we do not have the political leadership to drive home the message that a person's participation in society is crucial and important, and what a person can bring with his or her skills and trades is part of what our society and economy needs.  Travellers have played a fundamental part in the past.<br/><br/>I refer to matters such as the criminal trespass legislation for Travellers who are nomadic, which was introduced in 2000.  By-laws have been introduced about horse ownership and the conditions that apply for horses.  Ironically, the horses needed to have better living conditions than the Travellers who were living in those conditions.  That was quite flawed.  Not many Travellers have got permits and licences from local authorities because the conditions have been indirectly discriminatory towards Travellers.  The Casual Trading Act 1995 made it hard for Travellers to trade.  That vibrant pattern of the Traveller economy and trade was certainly hindered overnight.  There is a need to look at not only innovation and employment but also at legislation which has impacted Travellers.  To have full employment in society and 80% of Travellers unemployed is flawed and needs political attention.  I welcome the political representation in manifestos.  We would welcome working with all political parties about how that can be progressed in the lead-in to the general election.</p></speech>

As previous speakers said, if one is sitting here again in 20 years and there is no change, that will not be good.  We need to make sure that there is a plan of action, and enforcement and funding for recommendations.  All of us, no matter what political party we are in, need to work together for that.  There needs to be significant cultural awareness, as previous speakers said.  That would open many doors.  In my constituency,  mental health is important, as are apprenticeships.  It is worrying that young men want apprenticeships and cannot get them.  That is not right.  This is 2019 and men and women who want apprenticeships cannot get sponsors.  That is worrying and needs to be examined.  We discussed housing, which is a significant issue, and the supports available, whether one is looking for a bathroom adaptation grant, for work on windows or doors or a ramp that might be needed.  There are some supports, which are welcome, but we need to work to have more supports.  It is worrying that there is 80% unemployment.  I support these recommendations and all of us working together can make that change.  The witnesses have spoken well and everything that I was about to say has been said, so well done to them for coming to outline their recommendations.</p></speech>

There is obviously a reason for that.  Systematic discrimination happens daily and that is extremely difficult for the Traveller community to take.  As we have said each week, this has been internalised and can cause all sorts of difficulties socially and civically.  I have a question for Ms Quilligan about affirmative action.  I know there is a history of this in the United States.  I think it was called positive discrimination.  I presume that is not the terminology.  I think affirmative action was relatively positive in the United States.  Black people were discriminated against civically and this was a basis for them to access employment.  Once they accessed employment, they then opened up other pathways.  Is there a history of affirmative action in this country?  I know there is for people with disabilities.  Is there a history relating to the Traveller community?  What would pathways look like, especially in the public sector?  I think there are 300,000 people working in the public sector.  That would be another pathway.  What would it look like for the private sector, which I know is slightly more problematic?  If 80% of the Traveller community are unemployed, an extraordinary statistic, what does the pathway look like and how long could it take to make an impact?</p></speech>

What does affirmative action look like and does it work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-12-17a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Quilligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019121700002#V00300"><p>It does work.  It has been proven to work globally in many different areas.  There is a history of affirmative action in the State relevant to Travellers.  I call it affirmative action.  It is the primary healthcare programme.  That budget is ring-fenced specifically for Travellers, arising out of the findings of the all-Ireland Traveller health study about the poor statistics relating to Traveller health and the social determinants of health.  We have a group across the country of more than 400 primary healthcare workers who go out to deliver healthcare in a peer-to-peer way every day.  They do magnificent work.  They have all benefited from a national training programme which was rolled out before people around the country, including myself, were taken on.  That is one model of affirmative action.</p> <p>  Another is smaller but as effective if one is looking at the small numbers of Travellers in employment in the State in the public sector.  Lord have mercy on Joe Horan's soul since he was a great man.  When he was in South Dublin County Council, he introduced a programme of affirmative action where he took on people under the special initiative.  Some of those people are employed today across local authorities around the country.  That was a small sample of how that could work.  They were brought in at a very low level and supported to work their way up the ranks like anybody else.  In doing that, one has to look at all the barriers that exist for Travellers such as the leaving certificate.  One has to look at par learning, skills and experience and at people's aptitude.  We have to change the way we look at things.  I know I am deviating a little but the apprenticeship model is perfect.  There are 12 and 13 year olds in Kerry who want to do apprenticeships.  A normal person working in the education sector will laugh at them and say they are 12 or 13.  We have 12 year olds who know what they want to do.  There are possibilities of affirmative action but we have to change our way of thinking and listen to the needs of the community.  In my own town, among nomadic people, I could ask ten young fellows if they will stay in school if I can have them trained by the age of 17.</p><p>We could negotiate a partnership with their families to keep those young people in the system and ensure they graduate from an apprenticeship scheme but that requires a shift in thinking.  All of these affirmative actions are very easy to do if one is willing to change one's thinking.  There are models in the United States and Australia.  Anywhere one has had an ethnic minority who have been oppressed and marginalised the powers that be had to bring in affirmative actions because there is no other way to leverage things.  A whole community here, and I mean people my age, were segregated.  Now, children of six and seven years have been put on reduced timetables and attend schools for one hour a week or one hour a day.  What are their chances of success when they have less of an education than their parents and grandparents enjoyed?  I am passionate about this matter because we are dealing with children who are experiencing this.  </p></speech>

In Kerry, we can have all of these people on board but the problem is they are coming up the line nationally at NTRIS or whatever the powers that be.  That is why we recommended a dedicated Traveller Department to specifically consider Traveller issues and our history.  We cannot be treated in isolation like we arrived in this country in 2019.  We must consider our history, how we got here and try to unpack that.</p></speech>

In my opinion, the all-Ireland health study is out of date.  There is an epidemic within our community - certainly in Donegal and it is transparent throughout the country - that mental health is at a crucial stage.  As a men's health and developer worker, I had this discussion one day that I could name five or six people eight or nine years ago who had alcohol addictions but now I can name 50 people who are on drugs.  That transition happened within the community because drug addiction was hidden.  If people were addicted to prescription medication or other illicit drugs their addiction was hidden within the community.  Now the issue is exposed everyday when one talks to individuals and young people.  The issue is transparent in all of the Traveller organisations in terms of the younger generation.  I never knew my grandfather and granny, which is the experience of many Travellers because their grandparents died at a young age.  As a Traveller man I am expected to live until 65 years.  It is deplorable to think about early mortality in terms of the younger generation of Travellers between the ages of 16 and 30 years.  As alluded to by Ms Quilligan, people have expectations at 13 years.  That is not unrealistic for Travellers because we are job smart, education smart and street smart at the age of ten or 12 years.  Our life is compacted into us having a lot more pressures as young people.  We have all of these things stacked on top of us from the ages of ten to 14 years and are expected to have the brain of a 30-year old.  As Ms Quilligan alluded to, that is why young Traveller men and women talk about apprenticeships.</p> <p>  I sit on NTRIS and, as I have said, everyone's language must change around the expectations of Travellers because people think that Travellers are inferior when it comes to employment, education and health.  The settled community get bursaries from the State to handhold Travellers but we do not need such assistance anymore.  There is a bit of that but certainly we are a people who are well educated in terms of advocating for our rights and have the ability to go forward, which is why we are here today.</p><p>A cohort of people in university in Dublin and in colleges in Donegal need that apprenticeship model going out of colleges and need a helping hand or stepping stone from the State to make them job ready because they wonder after they have done the junior and leaving certificates and spent five years in college doing social and health care what the State will provide for them.  Apprenticeship is what the State can do.  There are Travellers who are well educated and job ready.  Any Traveller I engage with and other Traveller organisations all say the Traveller comes to Traveller organisations that run men's and women's development programmes to socialise because they are not allowed to socialise anywhere in society due to the discrimination and racial profiling they face.  We are not allowed to go into cafes if there are three or four of us together.  We sit there wondering if we are going to be put out.  We cannot go to a pub or a venue to socialise. That is why I say we need role models in every sector of the State that Travellers can look to and say there is one of us in there to make a safe space. </p></speech>

I agree with everything Mr. Friel said.  We hear so much about diversity in the workplace, particularly in the corporate sector, we could use up forests full of paper on it but, as Senator Ruane said, the workplace is not so diverse even if it has a wide range of genders, races and sexual orientation but everyone is middle class.  There are companies that pour thousands of euro into the Dublin LGBT Pride march.  In addition to the<i>quid pro quo</i>for companies in receipt of State funding there should be a <i>quid pro quo </i>attached to the low corporation tax rate because the result of it is no money for mental health services, housing or social protection.  We are talking about companies that channel profits worth &euro;18 billion through this city and State at the expense of the services we need.  I am glad that the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, will be here next week because I will raise this with its representatives.</p></speech>

A people cannot be criticised for not working if the opportunities and supports are not put in place and if those opportunities that are put in place are not provided in consultation with the community.  We often hear people say Travellers are not taking up the service and they are not participating.  We would participate if the service suited us and was designed in consultation with us.  The next time anybody present hears the line that Travellers are not engaging they should challenge it and ask why they are not engaging.  I like the idea of anybody profiting from State funds having to answer that question.</p></speech>

Mr. Joyce gave us the idea of Travellers as the social entrepreneurs of Ireland.  That is the history and tradition.  He also spoke about Travellers removing themselves from the chains of poverty.  Why would any community or group of people not want to do that?  The 80% unemployment rate is a national disgrace.  Mr. Friel echoed that comment.</p><p>Despite that statistic, however, there is no official mention of Travellers in Pathways to Work, so they have no monitoring or data.  They do not know.  Then it is said people are not engaging.  How do we know?  Perhaps the offer is not the right one.  Perhaps all these offers must be flexible and consequent on what Travellers themselves say.</p><p> There is a very strong rural perspective, from both Kerry and Donegal.  The fact that there is a preponderance of Travellers employed in Traveller NGOs is great, of course.  Who else should be?  At the same time, however, there are plenty of organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors that would benefit from Travellers being a part of them.  There are useful examples of what can be done, such as South Dublin County Council, if there is a will.  Why not replicate that?  There are some fantastic ideas and innovations - First Class Insulation, Bounce Back Recycling, Springback Upcycling, Crossbar Bikes - but they are run on a piecemeal basis and on a shoestring.  They need to be put on a more solid footing.</p><p> We have good models of affirmative action from the primary health initiatives that were taken.  If private enterprises are getting money, they should give something back in terms of diversity.  Every workplace in the country should be a welcoming one, where nobody has to hide his or her identity but can be out and proud, as we said of a different community, such that people can come to work and be themselves.  It is not a matter of asking or seeking, as Ms Quilligan said, but demanding.  As Deputy Corcoran Kennedy said, we need a whole-of-Government, whole-of-society approach and need to go up a level.  The NITRIS is great but needs to be given an absolute shot in the arm.  Deputy Stanton is a very serious and dedicated Minister of State but he needs more powers at his disposal to shift the mental health, unemployment, education, accommodation and health crises.  We need serious actions if we are to do that, and our committee is determined to make strong recommendations.</p><p> It is hard for the witnesses to have to come here to tell their stories.  They have done it well again.  We learn from them every week we are here and read their submissions.  We will honour the effort they have put in.  I thank them so much.</p><p> The meeting is now adjourned until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 15 January, when we will continue our deliberations with IBEC; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU; SOLAS; Enterprise Ireland; Irish Life; and, I hope, the ESRI.  The work goes on.</p></speech>
