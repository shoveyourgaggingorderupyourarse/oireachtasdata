    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#A00400"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Neasa Hourigan and Sean Sherlock.  I welcome everybody to the meeting.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure that we are adhering to that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today, we will engage with officials from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to examine its 2019 financial statements.  The HEA has been advised that the committee has an interest in the following matters: the recurring deficit in third level institutions; the impact of funding cuts; occasional and hourly staff in third level institutions; how funding is used to support scaling up and spin-out companies; private company funding of third level institutions and training; ring-fenced funding for Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology's Mayo campus; and the HEA's role in the University of Limerick's purchase of the former Dunnes Stores site.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following representatives from the HEA: Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive officer, Ms Orla Nugent, deputy chief executive officer and head of system funding, capital funding and system governance, Ms Pearl Cunningham, head of finance, and Ms Orla Christle, senior manager with responsibility for system governance.  We are also joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Mr. William Beausang, assistant secretary general of the tertiary division of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witnesses are giving their evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask the witness responding to state his or her name when first contributing.  I call Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#B00200"><p>The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is the statutory planning and development body for higher education and research in Ireland, and the primary State funding source for Irish universities, institutes of technology, ITs, and other higher education institutions.  The HEA&rsquo;s income in 2019 was &euro;1.4 billion, with more than 80% coming from Vote 26, education and skills.  A further 13% came from the national training fund.  Following the establishment of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the bulk of the HEA&rsquo;s funding from 2020 onwards will come from the Vote for that Department.  The payment of recurrent and capital grants, totalling &euro;1.39 billion, to higher education institutions represented almost all of the HEA&rsquo;s expenditure in 2019.</p> <p>  The HEA&rsquo;s operating costs in 2019 amounted to &euro;11.8 million.  I issued a clear audit opinion on the 2019 financial statements.  Members may wish to note that I certified the authority's 2020 financial statements earlier this week.  These will be presented to the Oireachtas in due course.  My audit opinion on the 2020 financial statements was also unqualified.  </p> <p>  Most of the HEA&rsquo;s expenditure involves grant funding to higher education institutions, which I audit.  As the HEA has oversight responsibility for the sector generally, this presents an opportunity for us to provide feedback on sectoral problems or on patterns identified during audits.  This is done mainly through regular meetings, usually held quarterly, between staff of my office and HEA officials.  This approach has proven useful in resolving common concerns, advancing accounting and governance issues, and exchanging information.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#B00400"><p>My colleagues and myself are pleased to assist the committee in its consideration of matters which are of specific interest to it, as indicated in its letter of 4 June.  I will provide some general comments on the HEA's role of supporting the Minister in the achievement of national policy priorities and ensuring effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher education institutions, HEIs.</p> <p>  The past year has been a difficult one for students and staff, and the HEA has worked closely with all parties in the higher education sector to help overcome the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Throughout, a quality student experience has remained the core consideration and I look forward to a more holistic higher education experience for students in the coming academic year.  Recent years have been a period of significant and ongoing reform of the higher education landscape.  We now have a sector that is moving towards a smaller number of institutions but with greater opportunity for development and innovation, and which will continue to play a central role in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic development.</p> <p>  The HEA is accountable to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for the achievement of national outcomes for the higher education sector.  These national outcomes are supported by the authority through its policy advisory role and through the allocation of targeted funding supporting national policy priorities for skills.  The authority also has responsibility for the effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher education institutions and it takes this responsibility very seriously.  The remit of the authority is under review with the development of the new higher education Bill 2021, which is due to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas later this year.  The new Act is expected to give the HEA appropriate regulatory legislative powers.  The original HEA Act is 50 years old and while it has done the nation some service, it is no longer fit for purpose.  The new legislation will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities, including those of the institutions and the Minister.  Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the HEA continues to evolve the governance mechanisms for the sector.</p> <p>  Building on existing governance frameworks for higher education, since 2021, the HEA has required each institution to sign an oversight agreement confirming that it is conducting its activities in line with statutory requirements and the requirements of code of governance for State bodies, as reflected in the relevant sectoral code.  This agreement specifies that the chief officer of an institution is required to keep the HEA informed, on a timely basis, of any governance issues, concerns or major risks that may arise for the institution.  If an institution does not comply with these requirements, it must provide an explanation to the HEA and set out the actions agreed by the governing body to achieve compliance and an agreed timeline.  The auhtority also requires an annual governance statement and statement of internal control from each institution.  The annual governance statement needs to include confirmation of compliance by each HEI with a comprehensive list of governance requirements.  Non-compliance in any matter must be identified in the statement.  The template is signed by the chair of the governing body and the president of the institute.  Set-piece meetings, such as budget meetings and strategic dialogue meetings, also allow for any material issues relating to governance or financing to be declared to us.  In exercising its oversight role, the HEA seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy within an accountability framework.  The role of the authority is distinct from the responsibilities of the governing authority of each institution and from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p> <p>  I refer to the HEA&rsquo;s financial statements for 2019.  I am pleased to note that these were signed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2020 with no issues arising.  Regarding recurring deficits in third level institutions, the HEA monitors the financial position of all higher education institutions continually.  Over the past year, the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened the financial challenges facing higher education institutions and in May 2020, the authority prepared a report on the implications of Covid-19 for the sector.  Following engagement with the Department, a Covid-19 related support package of &euro;130 million was agreed to for the sector with an additional &euro;52 million in student supports, which were disbursed by the HEA.  Three institutions have been operating with accumulated deficits and I refer members to our briefing paper for further information on this.  While progress has been made in reducing these deficits, it will be some years before they are fully eliminated.  The HEA continues to engage with the institutions that are in deficit to ensure they are financially sustainable and return to a position of growth.</p> <p>  On the impact of funding cuts, a 2018 spending review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform noted that funding for higher education decreased by approximately 20% between 2008 to 2014, while, from 2015 to 2018, there was an increase of 9%.  In parallel to this, student numbers increased by approximately 30% from 2008.  Recent initiatives to increase funding to the sector and meet the challenges of increased demographics are set out in detail in our briefing paper and include human capital initiative investment, increased investment in apprenticeships and Springboard+, a transformational fund for technological universities, Project Ireland 2040 funding, Covid-19 funding, and funding to support additional CAO places.  The general impact of previous funding reductions continues to present challenges in areas such as increased student-staff ratio, a lag in investment in capital infrastructure and limited industrial relations tools to address inescapable pay costs.  The HEA contribution to the annual Estimates process identified areas where additional funding is required for 2022.  Work has also been advanced by the Department on an independent economic review on the future funding options for the tertiary education sector.</p> <p>  In reference to occasional and hourly staff, the HEA appreciates the concerns of the committee relating to casualisation of work, precarious employment, employment rights and job security of occasional staff in the higher education sector.  Employment contracts are the responsibility for HEIs as employers, while sectoral industrial relations are under the remit of the Department.  The HEA notes the intention of the committee to write to the Minister to highlight concerns.  In response to queries from the committee, the HEA liaised with the HEIs and provided data on the use of occasional hourly-paid staff.  We have also raised these matters with the HEI representative bodies, the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association, with the aim of providing further and better information to the committee before the end of 2021.</p> <p>  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for national intellectual property, IP, policy and the funding to support the scaling up and spin-out of companies in higher education institutions.  Through the annual governance statement, each institution is asked by the HEA to confirm it has an IP policy that reflects the requirements of national IP policy.  This requirement for HEIs has evolved from two reviews of intellectual property policies by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the HEA.  With regard to private company funding of third level training, the HEA has written to all HEIs seeking confirmation that governance requirements are being met in their associations with regard to third parties and receipts of non-exchequer funding specifically as these relate to climate change concerns.  We will revert to the committee on its queries in this regard.</p> <p>  In 2017, ring-fenced funding of &euro;750,000 was committed to the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, campus for five years to support the implementation of a plan that had been recommended by the working group.  A review of progress of the implementation of the plan has been completed by Mazars on behalf of the HEA.  The final report has been provided by the HEA to the Department with the recommendation that consideration should be given to specific policy and funding arrangements for remote campuses such as GMIT, Mayo.  A copy of the report and the HEA&rsquo;s letter to the Department has been provided for the information of the committee.</p><p> While significant challenges remain with the evolving higher education landscape and the clarity the new legislation will bring, I believe we are at a point of opportunity for significant reform and modernisation.  I am happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

Deputies Cormac Devlin and Jennifer Carroll MacNeill have sent apologies.  Deputy Verona Murphy has had to leave for an interview.  Some members are tied up with D&aacute;il duties.  Deputy Matt Carthy is held up for the moment but hopefully he will join us later on.</p> <p>  The lead speaker is Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has 15 minutes.  Deputy Neasa Hourigan was due to be the second speaker but she is chairing the Committee on Budgetary Oversight this morning and cannot take up her speaking slot.  I propose to give each member six minutes.  I will give a reminder after five minutes when the speaker has one minute left.  I hope we can move along through it and get people back in for a second time if necessary.  Deputy Murphy has 15 minutes and I will give a reminder after 12 minutes.</p></speech>

Time is limited so I will try to be as brief as possible with my questions and I would appreciate if the witnesses would give me brief replies so that I can get through the questions I want to ask.</p> <p>  The HEA is the statutory funding authority for all the higher education institutes on the capital and current sides.  In particular, I wish to pay attention to University of Limerick, UL, and the Dunnes Stores site.  We had representatives from the university before the committee recently.  Professor Mey accepted that how this was handled was not best practice.  There was no written valuation.  The site was valued two years prior to purchase at &euro;3 million but there was an &euro;8 million purchase tag.  There was non-compliance in terms of the procurement of the consultant.  What information did the HEA have?  Three options were given in the first instance but the Dunnes Stores site was not one of those.  Approval was sought from the authority.  What documentation did the it require to approve the funding?  What funding did it approve?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#C00400"><p>In the context of the competition that was being run for capital expenditure we noted that a change of site was being made as part of the application.  The change was from the opera site to the Dunnes Stores site.  Under the legislation, it is a matter entirely for the university to make land purchases.  It can undertake purchases and does not require oversight or any permission from the HEA to buy land.  In the past ten years there have been dozens of land purchases by universities.  We have not had sight of them and we do not generally have sight of them.</p> <p>  What happened here is that in the context of the competition we got a letter, which said that the board of governors had signed off on the purchase, that it was a good deal and that they thought it was a good deal.  That was in the letter we had in that context.</p> <p>  We also had the annual governance statement from 2018 to 2019, which we require everyone to sign.  In the statement we had a place where any financial risks or new financial information could be disclosed.  The &euro;8 million was disclosed there by the UL.  We also asked about capital investments and whether the governance requirements were observed, and we have a statement saying that they were.  The board signed off with no issues.  There is a general question in the template asking whether there are any general governance issues that we need to be aware of.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#C00600"><p>I can answer it in the following way: we are anxious to talk to UL in case we have misunderstood what is in that.  We asked direct questions further to that.  I mentioned in my opening statement that we had two set-piece meetings, the budget meeting and a strategic dialogue meeting, in early 2020.  They were rolled in together.  At the end of the meeting I asked whether there were any governance issues I needed to be aware of.  "No" was the answer.</p></speech>

What was the estimate to begin with?  What were those involved provided with?  What has the HEA committed to in the funding of this particular site?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#C00800"><p>The answer is nothing.  There is no funding for this.  We are not funding anything to do with this site or the development.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  The second thing is that we would not have committed to anything because we would not have been aware of it.  The Act allows for the universities to make decisions about purchase of lands without any reference to us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Wall" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#C01000"><p>As things stand at the moment, and from what I know, we are not happy.  We are anxious to talk to the university about what we know.  We have correspondence in respect of other matters in which we have asked about general governance questions at UL.  We received no indication that there were difficulties.  A budget meeting was held recently and this did not come up at all.</p> <p>  The Deputy should remember that we have limited powers - this has been well rehearsed - but we ask direct questions in terms of the annual governance statements.  In my view we are entitled to rely upon them.  If we misunderstood them or if there is something we have not picked up on in those annual governance statements, then we are anxious to have a number of meetings about this and other issues with the university.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#C01100"><p>To be honest, the expression used was "not picked up".  That is pretty tame stuff when we consider there is non-compliant procurement in respect of the consultant.  That was a finding from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is not at issue.  It is a significant governance failure.  The university put forward three proposals and Dunnes Stores was not part of that.  It was suboptimal in terms of how this was done at a late stage without any valuation.  There is nothing in dispute about that.  Professor Mey has pretty much confirmed those things.  It is not something that the HEA has taken up wrong.  We know some of those things.  The HEA may well have misinterpreted the statement.  It is really not credible, to be honest.

Was this something that cropped up in that respect or in respect of any other site in terms of a controlling mechanism of the HEA?

Where universities borrow from European banks, for instance, there is a gearing requirement that we observe.</p> <p>  I wish to make one point in respect of this case.  This is not a defensive position.  If the university was not applying for capital development work - it was not applying for money for the site but for capital development work in respect of the expansion of the university - then we would not have had any record of this at all.  We would have relied on the annual governance statement to disclose the amount and to tell us about the governance arrangements around it.  That is consistent with the legislation.  From where I am sitting now, that is what I have.</p></speech>

I appreciate the work being done by the HEA.  Regarding governance and governing bodies in third-level institutions, I was on a governing body for a short period of time.

The vehicle for that is the legislation before the House.  I am here about 20 months.  I had a previous job as deputy director of the Teaching Council of Ireland.  There are limits to what we can do as things stand at the moment.  We are not an ombudsman and we do not have investigatory powers.  We rely on governing authorities to provide with undertakings that we have to use.  We are trying to fix upon a more global, systemic, organised and modern approach to governance, which is a cascade of governance from us down to the governing authorities, which have a responsibility to exercise them, and assurances.  It is another case of trust but verify at an appropriate level.  The legislation before the House is about that kind of subsidiarity and co-regulation so it is not a case of a police force but rather us being able to rely on and governing authorities being empowered to do what they need to do.</p></speech>

What is really needed is a board of management.  I know governing bodies delegate powers.  Is the best way forward with regard to developing our third-level institutions?  Has the way it has been structured restricted development?  A smaller structure allows decisions on developing policy to be made more quickly.  Does that need to be reviewed in view of how the world changes by the hour and minute compared to when those structures were set up, which in many cases was over 100 years ago?</p></speech>

The review has essentially been carried out through the consultation process, leading to the publication of the general scheme of a Bill.  I think that Bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny in July and certainly the Minister is anxious to have a Bill enacted by the end of the year.  Just as the Deputy said, the priority - or one of the priorities, in the interest of securing stronger governance of HEIs is to look at governing structures which are, as the Deputy said, very large and sometimes quite intractable when it comes to providing effective oversight.  The objective is that each HEI would have an independent chair, a majority of external members and competency-based membership to ensure it was equipped to address the very complex issues HEIs are called upon to look at.</p></speech>

With the return on investments now, it is a different world from what it was even three or four years ago.</p></speech>

I think he is referring to the pension control account which exists in Irish universities now and has the inflows and outflows.  They were set up following central Government's taking over of the pension arrangements which were in five, in particular, of the seven universities.  At the moment, those pension control accounts are in deficit, in other words they are paying out more than they are getting in, given that more and more people are retiring and there is a change in the structure there.  We follow that very closely and we are working very hard with the sector.  We have seen the figure there; it is quite large at more than &euro;140 million and I know that is an issue.  Clearly we have told our parent Department about it and we have also done projections showing how this will grow.  I know it is an issue the Department is raising centrally with central Government so it is being watched and being monitored and is a live issue of discussion, as things stand at the moment.</p></speech>

The pensions themselves are public sector pensions effectively so they are being managed as public sector pensions are.  They are paid by the public sector; they are a public sector debt.</p></speech>

Pensions are paid on what is called a "pay as you go" basis, so there is not a central fund that must be fund-managed.  The reference in the HEA statements is because there are liabilities between the HEA and the third level institutions in relation to how the contributions that are collected are actually disbursed.  Thus it is a kind of balancing account between the HEA and the third-level institutions.</p></speech>

What we do is we get an application and we play it very straight there.  We get an application on behalf of the Minister to go through a process to see if the conglomeration is capable of meeting the requirements.  That is what we manage.  We manage that process.  There is an independent panel and international experts and we manage that.  The university - or rather the conglomeration, before it is a university, organises itself, that is part of what it does, in terms of meeting the criteria.  Thus if it hires advice then it hires advice and it is not something we generally get into.  We go through the process and then we advise the Minister whatever the outcome is.</p> <p>  There is an ongoing discussion in the technological universities space about what the structure of a technological university should look like.  That is a live discussion and we are playing a part in that.  We are part of a group that has asked the OECD to look at what the structure looks like for technological universities across Europe.  We are, therefore, in that space and as Deputy Carthy knows from other briefings, we are not really in the contract terms and conditions space or industrial relations, IR, space.  We are playing a role in looking at a new university and what the structure should look like and that is an ongoing discussion, if that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I can make inquiries internally to see if any conversations went on that I am not aware of but I do not believe there have been.  However, I can certainly find out.  We have had only two institutions so far and we are doing two now at the moment.  We have only got two through the process so there is not a standard arrangement, if you like, this is a kind of one-off situation where we have a conglomeration of institutions becoming universities.  Some of them were done before I got here and some where done while I have been here.  I know they get expertise.

The Deputy asked me two questions.  He asked if we had any role in the appointment and if we were aware of it.  The answer is "no".  The appointment happened.  The individual in question does liaise sometimes with our people.  There have been conversations around the preparation of a proposal, which is part of the role, as I understand it.  That has happened.  I am not pretending otherwise.  We would have had that kind of contact with others previously.  That is a separate question.  To be clear, institutions sometimes get advice on how they are going to prepare an application to be a TU.  Representatives of the institutions talk to us and they have talked to my staff.

I am talking about the structure after the institution has become a TU.  What you will find is that a number of institutes of technology are being brought together, but they want to create a university structure.  I participate in those discussions.

I ask him to be brief.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#F01900"><p>It is hard to be brief on this point to assist the Deputy in the question he has posed.  I will be brief and the Deputy can make another contribution later.  The Department engaged with the presidents of the two institutions involved in TUSEI in relation to discussions about who could fill that really important leadership role in terms of the driving forward the technological university project in the south-east.  There were a number of suggestions from the TUSEI consortium and the Department facilitated engagement.  Members of the consortium suggested a number of people who they believed could assist them in driving forward the project, which, as many Deputies will know, has been very challenged over a long period of time.</p> <p>  Briefly, on the particular capacity and capability that Mr. Boland brought to the role, he played a similar role in relation to the Munster Technological University, MTU, another project that encountered quite significant challenges in being delivered.  Obviously, I am happy to answer further questions, but we should not lose sight of the strategic importance of achieving delivery of the technological universities and the transformation in the higher education landscape that is involved in that.  At previous meetings of this committee, questions legitimately were asked about the length of time it was taking to see the technological universities be designated and come into existence.  The kind of role that Mr. Boland played in MTU and in TUSEI, given the progress that has been achieved, demonstrates the importance of that executive leadership role that the Department actually championed with the institutions in terms of their planning.</p></speech>

I wish to start by focusing on the GMIT Mayo campus.  My first question relates to the duties and responsibility of the HEA in respect of the delivery and implementation of the 33 recommendations from the working group report that was published in 2018.  Does Dr. Wall accept that the HEA has failed on the delivery of the recommendations following the publication of the independent report in May 2021?</p></speech>

There is an evolving situation in GMIT.  As the Deputy is aware, there is an interim report that we will share with the committee.  The GMIT has not reached its targets.  However, it has done good things and numbers have gone up.  It has changed the mix of what it is offering, but it has not solved the problem.  The question that we are raising, and which our board is considering in relation to GMIT, is whether a different approach needs to be taken in a broader policy space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070100002#F02300"><p>What level of consultation did the HEA have on the implementation of the recommendations?  It is quite clear that both GMIT, in consultation with the HEA, had responsibility for delivering these recommendations.  It is clearly summarised that 13 out of 33 recommendations, or 39%, are reasonably established in terms of their implementation.  The report also states that a further 14 have been progressed and have yielded initial results.  Where is the evidence that the actions agreed by Kieran Mulvey and Dr. Richard Thorn, the previous vice president of the Mayo campus, have moved the Mayo campus into a different space now in terms of its financial viability?</p></speech>

It is too early to say that we have failed.  The report to which the Deputy has referred is an interim report.  We are half way through the process.  We have engaged with GMIT.  We will engage with GMIT throughout the summer to see what we can do next to speed things up.  However, it is important to note that we are just slightly over halfway through a process.  We are three out of five years into it.  Other things have impacted on it.</p> <p>  It is also worth considering that the Connacht-Ulster Alliance process will have an impact here.  As I mentioned earlier, there are three campuses in that alliance.  The Letterfrack and the Killybegs campuses are part of it.  Having facilitated the GMIT report, our board has asked that we engage in discussion with the Department on the broader policy issues around remote campuses.</p> <p>  I accept that progress is slow and it is not what we would have liked.  I do not accept that it is a failure yet.  We need to keep plugging away at it and we will.  We have gone through the report.  We are anxious to engage with GMIT on it in the next few weeks.  That is where it is at.</p></speech>

I am referencing a paragraph, contained in the letter in respect of the review of the implementation report, which states that 2021 is year four of the five years of ring-fenced funding for the Mayo campus.  It states that the question of long-term sustainability of the campus post-ring-fenced funding needs to be considered.  What considerations is the HEA taking?</p></speech>

To be honest, it is a campus that is providing real services to an area.  Nobody is asking primary schools or post-primary schools to be sustainable.  I am wondering if there is another way to look at the issue.  The board has asked us to examine it in broader terms.  Our view is that the long-term sustainability needs to be seen through another lens, in the context of the kind of services being given throughout the region by the CUA.  We should not just look at GMIT in isolation.  We should look at other such campuses.  That is the discussion we will have with the Department.  That is what we hope to take forward.</p></speech>

It is a good question.  What is it we expect of higher education institutions and remote campuses and how do we value that?  We have had time and space to consider how it was working under the old regime.  We will look at it into the future.  It will be a value for money issue but how value for money is measured in some of these educational provisions is a key question.  It is one our board is anxious to address.</p></speech>

The primary, principal and expected use would have been to implement the recommendations and put the campus on a better financial footing.  However, what we have seen from the HEA correspondence is that it is being used to service the deficit.</p></speech>

However, it is also being used to give us the time and space to consider these issues.  A vice president has been appointed, we have done certain things and there have been changes.  There have been delays but there have been changes.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending today.  To follow on from Deputy Verona Murphy's point on Waterford, it is very clear there are now three institutions with long-term deficits.  How does the HEA intend to address that, particularly in relation to the intention to establish a long-term funding model for higher education?</p><p>Are there institutions under the HEA's remit that consistently have deficits of this order?  Is it because of numbers?  What solutions have been put in place?</p></speech>

They are all different in origin and came about in different ways.  There is not realty a commonality around them.  In all three, solutions are being worked through.  NCAD is close to breaking even, while the projections for Waterford Institute of Technology showed 25% or 26%.  For IT Tralee, there is a solution on the table about reducing costs.  There are solutions, and while they are difficult to work through and take time and it is mucky work, it is done more or less.</p> <p>  I cannot yet talk to the funding model because I have not seen it.  It is a matter more for the Minister than for us.  I do not know whether it is the issue.  There is a funding issue but I do not know whether it would help here.  We have identified the three ways out of these and they are slightly different for each of the institutions.  That is what we are relying on.</p></speech>

IT Tralee is slightly different.  It bought land and it is a fine site, but it meant its reserves went.  NCAD had a range of issues.  One cannot identify it is an issue around funding, in my view.  It happened for a number of different reasons in those cases.  They have been there for a while and they have long tails.  Ms Cunningham-----</p></speech>

The new technological universities have a reduced level of representation compared with that of the traditional ETB sector.  What is the rationale for that?  There has been some disquiet within the ETB sector that its traditionally strong representation on some of those governance arrangements is not as strong as it was in the past.</p></speech>

We also have set-piece meetings, as I said before, and an oversight agreement, all of which gives rise to the capacity of the institution to tell us about any issues.  They do, and we hear about procurement things particularly, in general.</p> <p>  In respect of the academic year 2018-19, we have a governance statement that indicates that &euro;8 million was spent.  On the question of capital investment, there are no issues with governance, as we read it.  On the general question about governance, it is stated that there are no governance issues to be raised either.  In subsequent meetings when I asked questions about governance, we did not get any indication there was any issue here.</p></speech>

The meeting was this week arranged for next Monday, yet it has been plastered all over the papers and the representatives of the university appeared before the committee a short while ago.  The HEA was in no real hurry to look into the matter, question the university and find out exactly what had happened.  It is fair to say there was no real haste on the HEA's part to carry out an investigation.  Until Dr. Wall said that, I had planned to ask what investigation the HEA had carried out, and then I realised it had done nothing.  Dr. Wall then confirmed that the meeting had this week been arranged for next Monday.  The HEA is charged with oversight of governance and Dr. Wall stated that he takes it seriously, but they did not bother their backsides - pardon the phrase - to do anything about it.  It arranged the meeting only this week.</p></speech>

One would imagine the HEA would have had all its ducks in a row before its representatives appeared before the committee.  One would have imagined that the HEA would have carried out an investigation into the university in order that it would be able to come to us and tell us it had exercised due diligence, met the board, discovered something and was now carrying out X, Y and Z as a result.  It could have told us there were serious issues and questions to be answered, and outlined what it was doing in response.  It did not do any of that, however.</p></speech>

The answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I got a copy of a letter which was a protected disclosure to the chancellor, which we acknowledged.  To be clear about this, to get a protected disclosure sent to me which is marked &ldquo;private and confidential&rdquo; and says &ldquo;for your information only&rdquo; puts me in a kind of strange position in regard to how that is handled.  We had a difficulty there and we had ongoing correspondence around another piece of correspondence that we had with the university.</p></speech>

I understand Dr. Wall's difficulties and I understand there are anomalies in legislation and we will get to that shortly.  Is it fair to say that, notwithstanding the limitations placed on Dr. Wall by legislation and by previous practice, he was sent information about the Dunnes site that he just was not in a position to use?  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

I want to say something and the Deputy might give me the opportunity to say it.  With regard to a reading of that in isolation, having had an annual governance statement, AGS, signed off and having had a meeting with the institution where no governance issues arose, I read it at that point as an issue around HR and being bypassed in terms of decision-making, not as a specific issue around governance of the site.  No reading of the letter gives any understanding of an issue around the site, other than fast decision-making.  When we looked at it, our sense was that this was a HR complaint and had it been one for us, we would have treated it as a HR complaint.  We knew we would try to get a report.  We have been asking for the report since October and we have not got the report, and that is the outcome of that.  What we have got is the high-level recommendations, which are around HR, but that is another one of the questions we will have and that we have been working through to try to get some clarity on that.  Therefore, no, it was not usable but, also, it was not clear to me on a reading of that.</p> <p>  In fairness, on the question asked by Deputy Munster, reading backwards on a whole range of things is changing our perception of a number of things that have happened.  We have limited powers.  As the Deputy knows, we have no investigatory powers and there are very limited things we can do, and we rely on the statements we are entitled to.  Reading backwards from where we are is why we are preparing to take a long, hard look at a number of engagements with the university.</p></speech>

There is an interim president at the moment.  It is a matter of concern to me that the corporate secretary to the board reports to the chief corporate officer, who was in with us, a Mr. Flaherty, and Mr. Flaherty did not go through a recruitment process and was appointed by the interim president.  I think the integrity of the recruitment process is, therefore, compromised and I think that none of the above should be involved.  That is a personal view, based on evidence given to us on the last day.  What will the HEA do about it?  What can it do about it?  Would this not concern it?</p></speech>

In his opening statement, he said the HEA also had responsibility for the effective accountability and oversight of governance in HEA-funded higher institutions and that it takes the responsibility very seriously.</p><p>Deputy Munster dealt with some of this.  One of the authority's main functions is as the funding body for the different institutions.  In the year that concerns us, &euro;1.4 billion went to those institutions from the HEA and there was a deficit of &euro;4 million in Limerick.  UL got &euro;47 million in special grants in 2019.  Can Dr. Wall confirm what I have just said?  Am I correct as regards the HEA's role?  The &euro;1.4 billion was mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement so we can take that as read.  Am I correct about the State grants of &euro;47 million in 2019 and that Limerick had a deficit of &euro;4 million?</p></speech>

UL does not submit anything to us for approval.  It makes an application for funding and describes the elements of that funding but it requires no approval from us for the purchase of land under the Act.

I find that incredible.  It is unacceptable that on the week the HEA comes before the committee, it suddenly decides it will meet with UL next Monday.  The red flags are up.  There is not one red flag; there is a bundle of them and they have been there for a long time.  I will come back in with other questions later.</p> <p>  I will let Deputies in for three minutes each.  If they want to come in, I ask them to put up their hands.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

In fact, "Prime Time" did a special report on it.  There were conflicts of interest and problems with things like spin-out companies and how the accounts were presented.  Dr. Wall spoke about taking people on trust.  I certainly would not take this sector on trust.  Taking it on trust is a box-ticking exercise.  The previous committee concluded that the HEA was toothless, as did I, and I stated that on numerous occasions.  The HEA itself accepts that and that is why the Government is bringing in new legislation to increase its powers.  That needs to happen.  One can only work with what one has.  Governance is the one area where the HEA has a role.  Dr. Wall spoke at the beginning of the meeting about the Dunnes Stores site.</p><p>I know it was not funded - Dr. Wall has told us that - but he told us that the HEA would take it on trust.  He spoke about reading things backwards from now.  Was any attention paid to the previous hearings of the Committee of Public Accounts with regard to this sector?  It is a sector that is likely to feature in this committee's meetings again.  I wish it was not.  I wish it would clean up its act but we continue to see matters arising.  Is the HEA taking it on trust?</p></speech>

One trusts but one verifies.  I will tease out a couple of these issues.  I know we do not have much time but I ask the Deputy to bear with me.  In my 20 months here, we have been involved in tightening up the governance arrangements as much as possible without legislation.  The oversight agreement is much more specific about what bodies sign off on when they get money from us.  The annual governance statements are much more specific and we require sign-off on very specific issues.  As the Deputy will be aware, the issues she has raised, such as the issues of spin-out companies and intellectual property, have all been subject to rolling reviews and changes have been made that have affected the annual governance statements.  However, there can be frustration because, even if one sees red flags such as the Chair has mentioned, our capacity to act is very limited.  We have seen this in respect of other investigations we were required to carry out and which we could not.  I do not know enough yet because I have to ask direct questions but I am not happy.  The Deputy is right about the sector.  We need to move towards legislation so that we can be less toothless.  "Toothless" is not an unfair term to use.  The committee will have heard the frustration of other CEOs before me with regard to what we do not have capacity to do.  We are in very close dialogue with our parent Department about our own resources.  Our internal systems are not great for gathering information.  There are things for us to learn from this.  We need to watch that.  I do not want to take up the Deputy's time but, overall, we are not happy.  We want to see improvement.  We need a strengthened legislative basis.</p></speech>

Has there been a cultural change, even with regard to the definition of employment?  There has been some very precarious employment.  In parts of the sector, there are much poorer levels of secure employment than in even the preschool sector.  Some of it is deplorable.  Is Dr. Wall getting the impression that they are changing, even in defining precarious employment, zero-hour contracts and so on?  Some of it is of a very poor standard.</p></speech>

I take the committee's criticisms but we are being more forensic in how we deal with things.  That has certainly been the case over the past two years.  We are as worried about precarious employment as we understand the committee to be.  We have been very frank that we do not have the data to back this up.  We have engaged with the Irish Universities Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, with a view to agreeing a definition so that we can go out and get very specific answers as to the kind of employment that is out there and from where it is paid.  That is another issue which has arisen.  Is this employment paid through payroll or other means?  It may have to do with a registered student who is at an event while in some cases senior counsel may be involved.  As we said, we are also getting returns about other things as regards overtime allowances and so on.  We are going to get very specific about the questions.  We have not asked them before.  We should have known but did not.  That is what we are trying to do with regard to occasional hours.</p></speech>

As we came to 2018 and 2019, despite significant funding having been allocated to support that objective and to build capacity in the institutions, we were encountering very serious difficulties in delivering on that objective or vision.  Technological University Dublin, TU Dublin, had been established by the amalgamation of three institutions from the beginning of 2019 and a single person chaired the governing body of each institute.  It was our assessment that leadership could be provided by one individual representing the role of the institution to be rather than, as would be the case in other circumstances, existing presidents, who have to be conscious of the interests of their own institutions.  When the Munster technological university consortium ran into difficulties in getting its application over the line, we recommended that it find an individual to discharge the type of role played by the chairs of the governing bodies of the three institutions that were ultimately established as TU Dublin.  Independently of the Department, the two institutions, Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Tralee, appointed Tom Boland to that role.  He worked with the institutions, their staff and student representatives to secure the successful designation of Munster Technological University.  When we turned our attentions to the long-standing issues with the technological university for the south east, we made the same suggestion to the two presidents, who provided us with a list of individuals they believed could fulfil that role.</p><p>In order to support the process, we met with three people and for various reasons, none of those individuals wished to take up the role.  The two institutes then identified Mr. Tom Boland, given his experience and performance in the Munster Technological University, as an appropriate person to discharge that executive leadership role in TUSEI.  To be fair, he is only just one person working with the institutions, their staff, the project team and a large number of working groups to successfully secure the submission of an application for the establishing of a technological university, which I understand will be assessed by the international panel from the beginning of July.  I hope we are on a time path to the establishment of a really important strategic objective in the south east, a technological university that we hope can be transformative in terms of regional development needs.</p></speech>

Is that the case?  Is that position still warranted in the Department's view or for how long does it consider the position of the executive director to be necessary?</p></speech>

There were four individuals that had been identified for us as meeting their requirements.  We were just involved in initial discussions.  If any of those individuals wished to proceed further, we would have got them in touch with the two institutes to work through the formal arrangements in terms of appointment, procurement and whatever else.  That was the Department's role in context.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the role going forward.  That is a role in the context of the transition and developing an application, working with stakeholders to ensure that application is as strong as possible.  It is not an ongoing role.  It is completely distinct from the set of matters around the kind of structure that the new technological universities will need to put in place to meet the very ambitious objectives that the Government will have set for them and which they have set for themselves through their own work and strategies.</p></speech>

It appears DKIT let this sit idle for years and apparently it is now seeking to commercialise it.  There was a standing offer for years that would have yielded a return and provided a public service.  In providing funding to an institute under the authority's remit, does it have any scope at all to suggest any possible actions that might provide a good public service with projects?  Would the authority have an opinion on something that has been allowed to sit idle for years when there were offers that would have brought in some funding?

To contextualise this a bit, the institute acquired the ice rink in an overall package, 80% of which is being used by the student body all the time.  This is 20% of the overall package.  As I understand it - and this is where my limits are - there have been ongoing negotiations.  Ms Nugent may have further information.  Those negotiations reached a certain point with one organisation but it did not succeed and the process has moved to another party.  Overall, we have made suggestions over the years about the ice rink.  In general, 80% of what was bought is being used appropriately.</p> <p>  Dundalk Institute of Technology has an issue in that we would like to see better income from it and we have certainly spoken about that.

We are not talking about visiting lecturers but people who are being exploited.  For example, they do not get holiday entitlements or anything like that.  We are then wondering why standards are slipping and institutions are falling down rankings etc. because there is very little research backing up contact hours and so on and so forth.</p> <p>  How forthcoming are the universities because we had to really drag this out by forensically examining elements?

In my correspondence to the committee I more or less indicate that we were not asking the right questions or perhaps we thought we were asking one question but they were answering another because of a lack of a common definition.  During our meeting with the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association, we agreed to sit down and move through a number of definitions so as to get very specific answers to very specific questions, with a shared agreement on meaning.  To answer the Deputy's question, I have no sense there was any kind of resistance to this.  It is more a language thing and we must ensure we get the questions right.</p> <p>  We want to know about the number of registered students related to occasional hours.  We do not want to see overtime and consultants or procured services as occasional hours.  We want to know what are occasional hours.  It was a matter for us to clarify what we meant.  The committee helped us to clarify our thinking because we were going to respond in a certain way but we stopped because it did not shed light on the matter.  It is an issue for us and the questions we were asking.  We are not getting any sense from those institutions that they are resisting.</p></speech>

I was surprised by the figure.  We are not dealing with a fast-foot outlet or temporary stalls for Christmas.  We are dealing with third level institutions.  If the HEA is going to be given more powers, that is one area that it might get into.  It is something that surprises a lot of people, including students.  Over the years, I have spoken to many people in universities who are employed in jobs that operate on an if-and-when-we-need-you basis.  They do not have any great contracts or security.  The hours are very <i>ad hoc</i>.  They may have limited hours of nine or 11 hours a week.  They are expected to be available if-and-when needed.We have seen the levels of pay enjoyed by senior staff, in relation to University of Limerick, for example, where several people were on over &euro;180,000.  These are lecturers and highly qualified people and it is an area that we have to deal with.  Dr. Wall may say there are issues around funding for the sector.  They have been touched on here today and we understand that but we have to try to make this more secure and more regular for people with more regular hours.  In the county I am from, County Laois, there are people who work in third level institutions.  I was surprised at the hours available to them, the level of pay and the <i>ad hoc </i>nature of the pay.  There did not seem to be any set pay for the hours they work.  I was very surprised that people who are highly qualified, having spent years studying in university and who have high academic achievements, end up employed on a very casual basis.  There are people working in fast-food outlets who have better terms and conditions.  It is an area to which the HEA and the Department need to pay attention.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary, essential expenditure policy and reporting division; Mr. Kevin Meaney, principal officer, the national investment office; Ms Clare Costello, principal officer, the housing Vote; Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer, the transport Vote; and Mr. Jim Deane, principal officer, the health Vote.</p> <p>  Before we begin the discussion, I have a note on privilege for our witnesses.  They have probably heard all this before but I will repeat it.  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, as today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I have a note on privilege for our members.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I now turn to Mr. Ronnie Downes and ask him to give his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is nice to see you and the committee again.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  I am very happy to have this opportunity to discuss with members capital investment and the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, including phase 1 of the national development plan, NDP, review.</p> <p>  I wish to take this opportunity to highlight again the important question of my Department's role in capital investment and the three Vote sections, representatives of which are with me today, namely, colleagues from the health Vote, the housing Vote and the transport Vote sections.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's role in capital expenditure is to set the overall allocations for each of the sectors, to monitor and report on spending against profile, to set the overall guidance on the spending of public funds and to provide technical reviews on the compliance of spending proposals with the requirements of the public spending code.  We are very happy to talk about all those issues and go into whatever details the Chair and committee members may wish to discuss.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does not have a role in the final prioritisation of spending within those individual sectors and the approval of particular projects and programmes within those allocated amounts.  The Department also has a role, alongside the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in chairing and co-ordinating the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board and in meetings of the co-ordination group, which sits just below the delivery board and which is due to meet a little later today.  Together, those bodies help to co-ordinate and oversee the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  Obviously, individual Ministers and Departments are answerable to their respective sectoral Oireachtas committees on the decisions they take and on the delivery of projects and programmes with the allocations they receive.  Officials from the Department who are here today will not be in a position to discuss the rationale for specific decisions taken at sectoral level.  I know members understand that but I am just underlining the point again.</p> <p>  Turning to the role of capital investment under the national development plan, Project Ireland 2040 was launched in February 2018 and sets out a ten-year programme of capital investment, with the overall aim of upgrading Ireland's infrastructure, enhancing our economic capacity and promoting balanced development across the regions of the country.  The national development plan includes &euro;91 billion of Exchequer investment and &euro;25 billion of investment by the commercial semi-State sector.  That gives a total of &euro;116 billion in public investment.  That reaches a target of 4% as a share of GNI*, an overall economic measure, and then maintains that 4% level over the remaining period of the NDP.  In our Department's role in setting overall capital expenditure, we think it is important to give Departments and the sectors some level of certainty or assurance in the overall capital expenditures over a multi-year period.  This allows them in turn to plan strategically the delivery of their key investment projects and plan to meet the national strategic objectives set out in Project Ireland 2040.  For 2021, overall capital allocation stands at almost &euro;10.1 billion.  That is almost &euro;5.5 billion or 119% higher than the amount allocated just a few years ago, in 2017, so capital allocations over that period have more than doubled under the national development plan.  When you take that together with capital carry-over, that is, the amount allocated to Departments that they were not in a position to spend and that was carried over into the following year, in this case from last year into 2021, that is &euro;710 million.</p><p>Taken together, that is a capital investment spending power of &euro;10.8 billion in 2021.  This is the highest level in the history of the State.  Public investment in construction in Ireland has remained among the highest in the EU despite the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is in recognition of the important economic and developmental role of capital investment.  </p><p> The programme for Government brought forward a planned review of the national development plan.  It had been scheduled for the midpoint of 2022 and is now taking place as we speak.  The review commenced in October 2020 and the aim is to set out an updated national development plan for the period 2021 to 2030.  That will provide an opportunity to reassess investment plans, update project costings, and highlight any new issues that need to be taken into account, particularly given the ongoing impacts of and recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> The updated national development plan will be aligned with the national planning framework, which together constitute Project Ireland 2040.  Among the most important aspects underpinning Project Ireland 2040 is ensuring alignment of the spatial and investment plans to ensure that housing, jobs and infrastructure can be delivered in a planned, coherent and strategic way.  By 2040, Ireland&rsquo;s population is expected to increase by an additional 1 million people.  This population growth will require hundreds of thousands of new jobs, new homes, extra cultural and social amenities, enhanced connectivity within our regions and improved environmental sustainability.  The review of the NDP will reinforce the Government's plans to support rural Ireland over the coming years through compact growth in our smaller towns and villages.</p><p> Ensuring integration of climate change imperatives, including adaptation and mitigation, is also central to the development of the plan.  Importantly, the review will also examine the capability in the public sector to ensure major projects are delivered on time, within budget and to the highest national and international standards.</p><p> The NDP review comprises two phases.  The phase 1 report of the NDP review published on 4 April reflected submissions from each Department outlining strategic investment priorities.  It also took account of the public consultation exercise, Review to Renew, along with a broader evidence base for the decisions to be made as part of phase 2 of the review and the continued implementation and delivery of Project Ireland 2040.</p><p> Phase 2 of the NDP review is the phase where we outline and the Government agrees on the capital ceilings for each sector over the coming years over the period of the new NDP.  That is progressing well.  There has been substantial engagement between our Department and each line Department, including at ministerial level, in discussing the new five-year rolling departmental capital allocations and overall ten-year capital ceilings out to 2030.  They will be set out in the revised NDP.  It is due to be published soon and will co-ordinate with other Government policy priorities.  It will set out a vision for public investment in the period 2021 to 2030, including investment priorities, projects and allocations.</p><p> The overarching intention is that public investment will continue to be maintained at the high levels it is at, to be augmented where possible to reflect Government priorities, support the economic recovery and provide confidence, certainty and visibility to sectors about the future pipeline of capital investment.  I am happy to take questions from committee members.  </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Downes for the presentation.</p> <p>  I welcome that we are hoping to use the national development plan as the vehicle by which we trade our economy out of the Covid pandemic and into prosperity in the future.  It is important that the national development plan is done in a balanced way for the regions.  We have now found greater opportunities for remote working and all that goes with that.  We need to have the infrastructure and the facilities in place in order that people can live and work in their own communities and support their local communities.  </p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Downes stated that &euro;10.1 billion is in the pot for this year.  I refer to the capacity to spend this money.  Over the years we have set up considerable regulatory hurdles to be jumped between when a project gets announced and its construction.  Many hoops need to be jumped through and many years pass.  The feedback I am getting from local authorities is that the public spending code is making it inordinately difficult to get work done.  A raft of paperwork and multiple approvals are required.</p> <p>  For instance, with a project for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, six gateways of approval are required before construction.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage requires four gateways of approval.  We have set up a racecourse with many hurdles.  We are creating a considerable amount of paperwork.  It is leading to a scarcity of technical staff and consultants who are now required to get projects going.  I would like to hear Mr. Downes's comments on that.  </p> <p>  I also want to talk about value for money.  Mr. Downes spoke about getting projects done on time, within budget and to the highest international standard, which is the ethos by which the public work contracts were set up.  Information from some Departments shows that the final account for many projects exceeds the tender considerably, including in some cases by double.  There are some reasons for that.  How is value for money monitored and can we see how that is done?</p> <p>  Is Mr. Downes satisfied that the public works contracts in place for capital projects are still fit for purpose, taking into account some of the very controversial projects that have been discussed in the media, some of which have gone to court?  I believe that public works contracts are too adversarial at the moment thereby creating another industry around conciliation and arbitration, tying up public resources and private resources.</p> <p>  I wish to speak about public private partnerships, PPPs.  Based on the review of the national development plan, the Department is happy to say that we are getting value for money.  I have come across cases where we have ceded control of land to PPP companies.  For example, 14 primary care centres were built under PPP.  We now want to do some structural changes on one of them in Tuam, County Galway.  The process has been going on for three years but because we have given away control of the building and the site for 25 years, we need to get permission from the PPP company if we want to make changes to the building.  We also must pay for that to change over the next 25 years.  Therefore, a PPP company is now controlling how we deliver our health services.</p><p>What if there are changes to our health services?  We have allowed ourselves to enter contracts in which we have ceded total control.  I know of a case where the PPP company will not allow the HSE to put a water main through a site and into another site.  It will cost a hell of a lot more money to bring the water main around the road to service the site for a major project.</p><p> We speak about the national development plan of &euro;10.1 billion.  We need to have the services in place.  Irish Water is a key component.  The feedback I get from the industry is that at present, it is an impediment to the construction of the built environment in Ireland on the basis it is not funded properly and it cannot provide the services.  We cannot provide the housing or serviced sites that are required because we do not have waste water or water on these sites.  It is something I see throughout my constituency.  I also see it in other places where, because of limited resources, work in certain areas is being prioritised through, for example, considering centres of population to the detriment of the regions.  I would like the comments of the witnesses on all of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#C00200"><p>I thank Deputy Canney.  He has raised a number of important points.  I will go through them in turn.  Perhaps I will pick up first on the comment on the important role of the national development plan as a motor to drive us out of the Covid situation into economic progress and prosperity.  It is very much our view that the national development plan, if properly calibrated and allocated towards appropriate projects, can serve this purpose.  The Deputy is quite right that balanced growth among our regions is an important priority to which we are paying particular attention as the national development plan and its review move forward.</p> <p>  With regard to the specific questions raised by the Deputy on the capacity to spend and regulatory hurdles, there is many a slip between cup and lip.  When a major project is announced we cannot expect it to arrive weeks or months later.  Sometimes it will take years before the red tape is finally cut on it.  We have improved and strengthened our public spending code.  This is our capital appraisal framework for getting capital projects from conception stage through to contract for procurement and delivery phase.  The capital appraisal framework has been in place for a long number of years.  We have been streamlining and refining it and taking account of best international practice as best we can.  A number of clear gateways are in place.  These are decision points to see where we have got to.  It is not enough to just have a good idea to build a project.  It needs to undergo a lot of rigorous analysis on the various options including cost-benefit analysis of various options and the risks involved and the likely costs.  I would not necessarily call them hurdles.  I would call them stages where projects need to prove their worth before they can move along from conception and idea stage to reality.  This is particularly the case when hundreds of millions or billions of euro of public expenditure are in question.  If it is the case that some horses fall at some of the hurdles along the racecourse, to use the analogy, perhaps it is because they should have fallen.  Perhaps the earlier they fall the better so people can turn their attention to other areas.  In other words, if they do not prove their worth or show they can pass various value for money criteria or be managed within certain risk boundaries, than perhaps they should not proceed.  This is not a sin.  It is a feature of good management.</p> <p>  There are many other issues throughout the system to which our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are paying a lot of attention.  These include reforming and streamlining aspects of the planning framework, which has been the subject of some criticism over the years where delays can arise.  We are working together to streamline the public spending code.  We are making it clear how to move quickly and swiftly.  Many delays can take place, which is relevant to another point the Deputy has raised, because perhaps in the past there has not always been that same rigorous quality of analysis going into those early stages.  International evidence shows the earlier we intervene, and the closer and more rigorous the scrutiny is at the early phases of a contract, the more we set ourselves up for success in future or eliminate those projects that are not likely to be success stories.  This is not a bad thing.</p> <p>  With regard to the role of consultants, it is the case that over time we have been progressively building up our capacity in the Civil Service and public service to conduct capital appraisals and the type of analysis that has been done.  Over time, these skills have been disseminated and normalised throughout the Civil Service and public service.  The need for consultants to come in to do what should be an intrinsic part of capital appraisal is diminishing over time.  There is a valuable role for consultants, including international peers coming in to take a look from time to time and provide objective analysis.  The dependency on consultants to do basic appraisal work is diminishing all the time, however.</p> <p>  With regard to value for money and the role of the contract, it is mainly the responsibility of our colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  A lot of engagement has taken place between experts and practitioners in the construction sector.  The Construction Industry Federation has particular insights into how to make the public works contract a more efficient and attractive proposition for tenderers and contractors in Ireland.  The OGP has been very responsive to this and is working on a suite of amendments, adjustments and refinements to the public works contract.</p> <p>  It is also the case that people are becoming more familiar with the public works contract and how it operates.  Whether it is adversarial by nature or design or whether this is a feature of how some contracts are operated is not something I am in an expert position to comment on.  A lot of work is going on.  The points and perspectives on which the Deputy has reflected regarding the need to keep the public works contract under review and refinement are issues to which colleagues in the OGP are very alive at present.  A lot of work is going on in this regard.</p> <p>  With regard to PPPs, the Deputy gave a couple of interesting examples of primary care centres.  I will make a general point before I move to the specifics.  PPPs are an arrangement between the public and private sectors to procure, contract, deliver and, in some cases, manage and run infrastructure intended for public use.  They have advantages and disadvantages.  They are suitable for some areas and less suitable for others.  One of the advantages of public private partnerships is that when properly contracted and entered into, they can give a degree of certainty on the public side about what the cost will be and the risk can be transferred.  It has to be managed and often it is expertly managed on the private side.  Sometimes the balance can be quite right.  Sometimes we know that projects which have been traditionally entirely publicly procured can run into trouble.  This can expose the State to a lot of costs and danger.  PPPs are a way of managing this.</p> <p>  To come to the specifics, it is a matter for each individual sector to make known its view on the trade-off between entering an arrangement and what we get.  Colleagues in the health sector will probably say primary health care centres are a relative success story in bringing health closer to patients and communities.  The trade-off for this might be that it needs to cede control, management, maintenance and upkeep of the premises to a private entity.</p><p>With regard to some of those specific issues, the way the Deputy presented it, it sounded as if the private operator might have been a little bit too pernickety about how it grants permission for certain necessary and useful works to take place on the lands it is managing.  It is a question the Deputy might pursue further by running it to earth perhaps with colleagues in the HSE estates and the Department of Health, as they would have a more direct knowledge of how that is working.</p><p> We recognise that Irish Water is a key strategic element, not just for its own sake in terms of water provision but as an enabler and a prerequisite, including waste water, for the delivery of housing.  It is a specific part of the equation in terms of addressing the housing challenge.</p></speech>

This is an interesting and fundamental part of the economic conversation that must take place.  I heard some things in the initial statement that I was pleased to hear.  We have a rapidly expanding population and we must plan for that.  It is no good planning for it in five or ten years from now; we need to plan for it now and put in place the necessary measures.  For instance, in the 1980s we struggled to have 1 million people at work in the country.  We can readily get 2 million at work now.  That is of great importance to the economy and our ability to fund the level of services that we need for the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Canney made a number of important interventions.  I do not think we would fare well if an evaluation was done of the effectiveness of our system in terms of procurement and processing various projects from A to Z in the shortest possible time with maximum benefit to the taxpayer.  Some projects have gone on for years and various changes have taken place.  If we keep going on like that in this country, we will go on that way forever.  We will have a lot of things that we should have done that we did not do and we will suffer the consequences.  Mr. Downes made reference to those but I do not think he went as far as I would have gone.  From experience in a Department, if you want to do something, you do it now, not in five years&rsquo; time, because by then you are gone out of there and somebody else will or will not do it and may have a different set of emphases, which will again change the whole plan.  The most essential issues at the present time are, first, housing, as well as health, education and infrastructure.  How effective we are in delivering those for the country will determine the extent of our economic success and our ability to ensure that we can provide jobs for our own people, as and when they require them in the future.  That is going to be hugely important.</p> <p>  I do not think we are doing that at present.  For instance, Deputy Canney referred to Irish Water.  We know that it has a funding shortfall and that needs to be addressed.  On the one hand, we all said in this country that water is free and that it should be free for everybody.  The United Nations said everybody has the right to water.  I am not a brave enough soldier to come out and say that perhaps we should have done it differently.  Perhaps we should, and we will pay a price for that in the future.  If Irish Water is to do the job it is supposed to do, it will need an avenue of funding that does not exist at present.</p> <p>  Regarding housing, I spoke with a very prominent person in this country 20-odd years ago.  I then predicted that the biggest issue to face this country in the future would be housing.  How was I able to make that assessment 20 years ago?  Did I have evidence?  I had.  I was working with the demand on the ground, the number of people that were presenting and who had chosen to stay in the country rather than emigrate.  One of the issues that must be factored in is that emigration is not as attractive as it used to be because we can provide at home jobs that are as valuable, modern and up to date as anywhere on the globe, and because of that there is a greater demand for homes.  We must face that.  There are those who say they do not want any more people coming to this country and that we have enough people here.  They say Ireland is for the Irish and all of that.  I do not accept that.  On the face of the globe, people move in different directions at different times.  We must be open to that.  We can provide for ourselves and them, to the benefit of the economy and all of our people, regardless.  We must do that in a more meaningful way.</p> <p>  Health is an area where the population growth is of critical importance.  I do not think that we ever realised that we would have 2 million people working in this country.  We would not while there was emigration but we must factor in that emigration is no longer as attractive as it was.  I again refer to what Deputy Canney said.  I was on the previous health committee for the past five years.  We had a long debate about the national children's hospital.  If one were to ask any politician or a member of the public what is the problem with the children's hospital, they would say it has gone way over cost.  It has not.  It never went over cost, because there was no costing.  The only costing that ever came was based on the quantity surveyor's report and is the current one of &euro;1.8 billion.  What is being done at present is that it is being used to sabotage the system by groups of people who did not want it there in the first place but wanted it somewhere else.  The reason that it took so long to provide the national children's hospital is because nobody would agree on where it should be located.  That is strange but it is not a conclusion; it is a fact.  That continues to be the case.  I hope we do not go on with the new national maternity hospital to the same extent, length and result, because if we do, it will never happen.  We will be talking about it in the next century.  Modernisation is required in the health services in line with the growing requirements of a much bigger population.  There is a requirement for higher standards and higher outputs.  We must recognise that and keep it in mind.</p> <p>  Infrastructure must grow.  I see Deputy Boyd Barrett smiling.  I do not wish to encourage him and he does not require any encouragement either.  We need to come of age in terms of the delivery of services to the public.  If we do not do that, we are going to be condemned and blamed, rightly so.  We talk to a great extent about working from home and that will be taken up to a certain extent but it is not the answer to any of our problems.  Working through technology hubs does provide an answer because it combines two aspects of what we require.  It brings to the fore the collegiality of the workforce where people like to mingle, mix, talk and socialise in the course of their work.  Digital hubs can definitely do that and workers can produce as effectively as if they were working in the original workplace.</p> <p>  I could go on forever, but you will be glad to know, Madam Chair, I do not intend to.  There are many issues that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Deputy Canney made reference to the various obstacles and the structures that are put in the way.  Perhaps some of those horses should have fallen earlier, but I worry that if we were to adopt that course of action, we would end up going nowhere and we would not do anything.  We could come to a conclusion and justify it on the basis that it might not have been a good thing to do, that perhaps we could not afford it or that we should do something else with the money.</p> <p>  I wish to emphasise that point by way of a concluding example.  In 1986 I happened to be on a parliamentary visit to Germany.  We were in a bad state in this country, employment-wise, at that time.  There was a constituent well placed in the Mercedes corporation in Stuttgart where 20,000 people were employed.</p><p>Having gone through the place, the extent to which the investment in that area had a ripple-like effect throughout the region was obvious to everybody.  That big anchor tenant in the area was of enormous benefit.  We had not experienced that in this country, certainly in the midlands or in our area at that time.  We have had more of them in the meantime.  We need foreign direct investment along with indigenous investment.  We need our infrastructure upgraded and improved.  We need to bring them along together, not deciding that we can do them at some stage in the future, by which time our market will have changed and our indigenous investors will have gone elsewhere.  </p><p> I am looking forward to the debate.  If we want something done in a Department, we need to take the action today because it will surely take three or four years before it will happen.  I only mention this; I do not accept it.  We have come to the stage where it is generally accepted that everybody looks at a particular proposal or plan and says it will take four or five years.  When does it ever start?  We have gone crazy on that kind of thing.  After being irresponsible, we have become so careful about everything that the only way forward is to do nothing.  We cannot go there.  </p></speech>

The Deputy has made it some important and interesting remarks and I will give a brief response.  His final point about the need to do things, including planning, infrastructure and delivery, in alignment rather than in a piecemeal way is very much in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve in the national development plan and by aligning it with the national planning framework to accomplish our objectives.</p> <p>  In his comments about housing, the Deputy said that emigration may not be as attractive or viable an option for young people today as it might have been for previous generations.  I will not go into the sociology of it but what we are trying to accomplish, including in the context of the national development plan and the national planning framework, is to make Ireland as attractive, enjoyable and productive a place to live as it can possibly be and one that bears favourable comparison with any other country around the world.  If that in turn impacts the dynamics of emigration, so be it.  </p> <p>  I take the point about the need to fund Irish Water.  As I mentioned in my response to Deputy Canney, we are examining the provision of resources for Irish Water in the context of the NDP.</p> <p>  The Deputy made the point that there was disagreement about the location of the national children's hospital.  Part of what we are trying to accomplish in the revisions to the public spending code is to provide an informed, objective and analytical professional assessment of the different options that may apply for any project and to make that information available to the decision makers at political level so that informed decisions can be made.</p></speech>

The problem is having so many options and spending so much time talking about the options with no decisions being made.</p></speech>

One needs to be aware of the risk of engaging in a navel-gazing exercise with a never-ending supply of options that can provide food for analysis, discussion and argumentation for many years versus what we are trying to arrive at, which is a professional assessment.  Let us take the example of the development of a sports excellence academy.  Potentially, there are many options, including greenfield sites, the development of existing sites, utilising university or other facilities etc.  The job of economic and evaluation professionals in the Civil Service and public service is to come up with a credible range of options and to provide pros and cons.  In turn this analysis is a tool for decision makers.  It is not an obstacle for decision-making.  It enables, facilitates, streamlines and informs evidence-based policymaking.  That is what we are trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Lest my earlier remarks about horses falling on the racecourse be misunderstood, we are not trying to ensure that every racehorse falls.  To step out of the analogy for a moment, some non-viable projects, which may have seemed good when they were an idea in someone's head then do not survive contact with an options analysis or cost-benefit analysis.  We want to ensure that the decision makers can say at an early stage that it will not cut it and turn their attention to other options which are more viable and more interesting so that in turn the political decision makers can make that decision.<br/><br/>It is not our goal in developing the public spending code to come up with a technocratic formula for deciding on which project should proceed and which should not.  Politicians are elected by the people and there is a certain vision that needs to be brought to bear to decisions above and beyond that informed by technical professional analysis.  The public spending code is not a substitute for decision-making.  It is an aid and a tool for use by decision makers.  <br/><br/>I will ask Ms Costello to deal with the question on Irish Water.  She is the principal officer in charge of the housing Vote, which, <i>inter alia</i>, deals with water issues.</p></speech>

I agree very much with that.  It is something I have been arguing for quite a long time.  Has that lesson been taken on board?  Are there changes to plans for capital investment that would significantly move us on from the Rebuilding Ireland targets?  As a reminder, the initial Rebuilding Ireland targets were for about 133,000 social housing units, of which roughly 90,000 were going to be provided through HAP, RAS or leasing.  A minority would be directly constructed public housing.  If the argument set out in that IGEES report is correct, and I believe it is absolutely correct, will we move on from that and wean ourselves off the RAS and HAP arrangements, which will potentially cost us billions?  While I know Mr. Downes cannot make the policy decision, has anything changed, to his knowledge?  Has anything changed in respect of the actual objective of clearing the social housing waiting lists?  That is what it all comes down to in the end.  We hear figures of this billion and that billion bandied about and various targets but what, as Mr. Downes understands it, is the endgame of all this?  If it was up to me, it would be that we seek to get to a point where people are not waiting for 20, 10 or even five years for social housing but that we had a plan to invest sufficiently in housing stock whereby we do not have any waiting lists at all, or certainly not ones that extend much beyond two or three years.  Has anything changed or are we still essentially working towards a slightly varied version of the Rebuilding Ireland plan?</p> <p>  That is my first question.  Will I do them all in one go? </p></speech>

The report that the Deputy refers to is an IGEES report that was produced by our Department in 2018.  It is important to set a little context around the paper.  It was based on data from 2016 and 2017 when the capital programmes of the local authorities were beginning to start and to ramp up.  Obviously, there had been a significant drop-off in the capital expenditure as a result of the fiscal consolidation in the early part of the last decade.  It was only beginning to start to ramp up as the paper was produced.  At the time the paper was produced, the split between current and capital expenditure on the housing programme was approximately 50:50.  As the Rebuilding Ireland programme was rolled out by the local authorities, the funding has shifted dramatically from current to capital.  For social housing delivery, there is now a split of approximately 30:70 across the delivery of social housing supports, whether current supports, that is, RAS, HAP or rent supplement, or capital expenditure on building and acquisition.  This year, the overall capital budget is about &euro;1.8 billion and the social housing delivery aspect of that is about &euro;1.5 billion.  We are seeing the shift in the split of the expenditure.  The forthcoming Housing for All strategy, which the Department is currently working on will reflect the programme for Government commitments around increasing the social housing stock.  That is something everyone is acutely aware of.  The report was done when there had been a reorientation of expenditure, which enabled the needs of citizens to be met in the short term.  Now there is obviously a consciousness of meeting those needs in the longer term also.</p></speech>

Ms Costello can tell me the numbers, but the original target was for about 87,000 to 90,000 units, which are long-term arrangements in many cases.  Is it Ms Costello's understanding that the trajectory, that is, the plan and the objective, is to get to a point where we are not depending on that mass of current expenditure and we will have sufficient stock of our own to wean ourselves off that?  Is that the plan?  That is connected to the question as to whether the plan is for us to have enough housing stock of our own that we clear the lists.  Is that the plan or are we just shifting the trajectory to a degree?  What is Ms Costello's understanding of where this is heading?</p></speech>

I note that HAP peaked around 2017 or 2018 and the numbers have reduced since then.  There was a peak of approximately 18,000 HAP tenancies being set up in 2018.  That has fallen somewhat.  The output of tenancies set up last year was under 16,000.  Obviously, last year there was also a Covid impact.  The target last year was just over 15,000 and was exceeded slightly because of Covid.  There has been a downward trajectory in the number of HAP tenancies.</p></speech>

I am gathering from that reply that there is not a definite plan as to where this is heading but there is a shift in trajectory.  I am glad of that shift in trajectory but I believe we need a plan that says there is an end point in all of this.</p> <p>   My next question is on a similar theme.  It relates to Covid and is more for the health side.  There has been a lot of talk about the need to build the health capacity.  ICU provision, for example, is a huge issue, where we are well below the European average.  Hearing some things about the Delta variant, this could become a very live issue very soon.  There are many deficiencies, including bed capacity running at much higher levels.  We have less headroom.  In looking at European averages, we should have 80% occupancy to have enough headroom in case of crises and emergencies, whereas we were operating at close to full capacity.  In the aftermath of Covid, what is the plan?  Is there a plan to significantly increase, for example, ICU capacity to something approximating average EU levels?  Is there a plan to get to bed capacity where we will have the 80% occupancy and have the 20% headroom so we will not be in a situation where any emergency or crisis will suddenly push our health system to the limit?  What is the Department working to in that regard?  We have heard of figures in ICU going up to about 280, which is a little above what it was but still far short of what is in Germany or elsewhere.</p><p>Has there been any shift in what the Department is being told by Ministers about what our objectives are to build that capacity?  I heard Dr. Fergal Hickey, a consultant in emergency medicine from Sligo, say he believed there had been no significant shift in accident and emergency investment, for example, despite the lessons of Covid.  What do our guests understand has been the capital investment in capacity building in the health service in the aftermath of Covid to learn the lessons of Covid?</p><p> Is there investment in training, given that capacity is not just physical infrastructure but also trained people?  In fact, it is probably one of the main limitations on our capacity in a number of areas such as mental health, a lack of consultants and allied health professionals and so on.  What is the Department's understanding of the investment levels being increased to develop human capital, the human capacity we need to expand our health services?  Is a change taking place and if so, where is it heading?</p></speech>

Yes, there is a plan to increase health capacity.  The latest budget was difficult and was framed in the context of the Covid-19 response.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, prioritised the provision of additional resources for the health sector, specifically to address issues that had been highlighted in a capacity review conducted in 2017 or 2018, such as the need for investment in bed capacity and in ICU and critical care bed capacity.  I think an addition of the order of &euro;1.2 billion was provided for the health sector in the budget, specifically to enable that capacity uplift to be made.  That was agreed with the Minister for Health and his Department, on top of the additional Covid-specific measures, such as for personal protective equipment, PPE, and so on, and the additional allocation to enable the existing range of healthcare services to continue to be provided.</p> <p>  That, in turn, has worked its way through to the HSE and its service plan.  Of course, there are many moving parts in the health sector, with unexpected changes in directions of travel and challenges facing the Deputy's colleagues in the health sector at the moment, but the resources have been put in place to enable this to be addressed.  We as a Department are in regular contact with our counterparts and colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to assess the degree to which progress is being made-----</p></speech>

There is a common theme to my questions.  I welcome the additional money being invested and so on but what seem to be lacking are clear objectives for where this is heading.  When figures are bandied around and we say an additional &euro;1 billion is being thrown in here, and we say we are spending more than we have ever spent in the history of the State, which is a clich&eacute; at this stage because it is kind of inevitable that we would spend more than we had ever spent in the past, the question is what it will deliver and what the objective is, although perhaps there is none.</p> <p>  Is there an objective to reach, for example, what is considered best practice in terms of bed occupancy and capacity headroom or is it just that figures on additional allocations are being thrown around but we are not quite sure what that will mean for the end result?  Similar questions relate to staffing levels and so on.  Are there clearly specified targets that will increase capacity, where clear deficiencies have been identified, up to levels that will address those deficiencies and allow us to clear the waiting lists - it is back to waiting lists again - because we will have the capacity?  Have the targets and objectives been worked out to that degree?  My suspicion is that they have not and while there is just some additional investment, it is not clear what that additional investment will yield us at the end of the day.</p></speech>

It harks back to when last I was before the committee a number of weeks ago, talking about the public service performance report.  I made the point in that context that we as a Department, and colleagues in other Departments, are putting a stronger focus on specifying the outputs and the impacts that can be reported on and interrogated by the Oireachtas committees and so on.</p> <p>  The Minister was clear that the additional &euro;1.2 billion-odd to be invested in health need to be linked to measurable objectives that went towards addressing the gaps identified in the capacity review a number of years ago; specifically, the beds, the critical care beds and the staffing required to make those beds operational and come into service.  We in the Department have been in dialogue with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to move forward that discussion.</p> <p>  If we have time, I might ask my colleague, Mr. Deane, to comment on this point.  He is in charge of the health Vote in the Department.</p></speech>

To return to what Deputy Durkan said, changing demographics are part of it, as is Sl&aacute;intecare.  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked where we are looking to get to.  Universal healthcare and care in the communities, with the right care in the right place at the right time, are the vision for the health sector.  Digitisation is a key part of that and that agenda is being pushed.  There are also standards and regulatory requirements imposed by HIQA and we have to increase capital spending to meet those standards.  Patient safety is another key concern.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what lessons are being learned from Covid.  The HSE and the Department of Health are examining their plans and priorities as a direct consequence of the pandemic and work in that regard includes service continuity, revised infection guidelines and the emergence of revised healthcare priorities.  This relates to the very point the Deputy made about increasing ICU capacity, oxygen supply, acute and intermediate care beds and enhanced community care, for which significant investment is required.</p> <p>  Part of the NDP review concerns getting all those issues together and seeing how we can deliver better outcomes.  The Department is trying to identify where the spending is going and what exactly the outcome from that will be, and work is ongoing in that regard.  From our Department's perspective in the context of the health Vote, not only are we seeking to ensure that spending remains within budget and that there is sustainability in respect of health expenditure but also - this is the point the Deputy was getting at - we want better healthcare outcomes.  We want defined targets and metrics to measure whether we are making progress in that regard and ensure money is being well spent.</p></speech>

There has been a theme to my questions, namely, that we are a little lacking in clearly specified objectives.  There are trajectories, additional allocations and a general recognition that we might need to move in a particular direction, but there are not clearly specified objectives and there is more work to be done there.  I have not studied the performance service report in detail but for some Departments - I will take the arts sector as an example - it is woefully weak regarding what the objectives of the expenditure are and what the outcomes will be.</p><p> Another issue that has recently become very apparent to me concerns the provision of school buildings.  In my area alone, five or six potential schools have been recognised for patronage.  There has been an acknowledgement that the schools have to be set up but none of them has any clue where its permanent location will be, even though many of them have been around for years.  There seem to be no specifics.  We have general allocations and aspirations, but even if we recognise a particular school, whether a Gaelscoil or an Educate Together, we do not say there is going to be a location and plan, with the investment in place, to ensure there will be a school when the patronage has been set up or shortly thereafter.</p></speech>

I apologise for being a bit late coming to the meeting because of another commitment.  I hope I will not go back over what other members raised but the Chairman might let me know if I do.</p> <p>  Is there any projection at this point as to what capital carry-over for 2021 could be?  If so, based on current trends, which Departments are likely to have the largest capital carry-over?</p></speech>

It is probably too early, at this stage of the year, to give any specifics.  As we are not yet at the summer break, it is early to say whether and to what extent Departments are likely to carry over money to 2022.  Our role as a Department is to do our best to encourage every Department to spend the money allocated.  We allocate the money because we want it to be spent, not to be saved and carried over to a future year.  Mr. Meaney might have some more specifics.</p></speech>

It is probably a bit early, at this stage of the year, to estimate where the capital carry-over might end up.  I might give some high-level figures from the end of May, which are the most up-to-date material we have at this stage, although we will probably have the figures for end-June later this week or early next week.  At the end of May, there had been some underspends in key Departments, including the Departments of Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which probably had the largest overall sums.  In percentage terms, the largest were probably the Departments of Defence and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p> <p>  We consider the underspends to be quite understandable given the lockdown in the construction industry in the opening months of the year.  Most of these Departments are indicating they will be able to catch up with the underspends in the rest of the year.  They have told us that there may be some delays in the signing of contracts but that the funding will be used by the end of the year . We will keep an ongoing, monitoring approach on departmental spend and see later in the year where potential underspends will end up and where the capital carry-over might be.</p></speech>

The phase 1 report on the national development plan states that we need to be cognisant of supply-side capacity constraints and that the public sector has a limited capacity to deliver investment in any given year, regardless of how much funding is made available, which is concerning.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has stated that spending the entire capital allocation of &euro;10.8 billion would be challenging.  The ESRI has noted, "it is evident that the domestic construction sector is unable to meet the scale of production required".  We have an infrastructural deficit that needs to be dealt with and Deputy Boyd Barrett went into detail on that but the capital spend will be very important for growing the economy and dealing with the challenges we face.  Do the witnesses accept the ESRI's view that the private sector alone may be unable to meet the demand?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Meaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#H00900"><p>One of the key tasks in our phase 1 report related to examining the demand side.  We reached out to both the Departments and the sectors to assess the demands over the coming ten years and what they considered to be their key priorities.  We also conducted a public consultation, in which we received more than 570 submissions, and many of the key demands and priorities the public foresee in the next ten years were set out.  In carrying out the phase 1 report, we had also to consider supply-side issues.  We recognise that in the past two or three years, elements of the construction sector indicate some plateauing of employment and perhaps increases in wages and prices, which indicate that there are some supply-side constraints.</p> <p>  On the work of the ESRI, in some ways we fully accept that there is evidence of some constraints.  Nevertheless, with the process of the NDP review, we are trying to give the construction sector greater certainty as to where capital budgets will be over a ten-year period.  One goal we have in the Department is to set that at a sustainable level of total capital funding over a ten-year period, which, we hope, will allow the construction sector to grow and meet the requirements of the public sector.</p> <p>  We also have some ongoing initiatives with the construction sector to examine how the sector can increase supply, such as one relating to communication to foster industry confidence, which is one of the key goals of the NDP.  We are working with the construction sector on the skills pipeline and with our colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on an apprenticeship action plan, which I believe will be finalised this year.  Through our construction sector group, we ourselves are leading a drive for construction sector innovation and digital adoption, and we are leading on a number of initiatives with our construction sector colleagues to examine how innovation, effectiveness and efficiency within sectors can be enhanced.  Plenty of policies to increase supply, therefore, are ongoing.</p></speech>

We have heard for some time that there is an issue with the supply side.  Under the prevailing conditions, the State procures for capital works mainly via private developers.  Senior officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently stated that bid-rigging has enabled companies to extract a higher price for work, given that rival bidders that had agreed to lose would submit inflated bids or not submit a bid at all.  Does the Department accept the view that bid-rigging has led to further price inflation?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it probably would be for that office to comment more accurately than I can at this stage.</p></speech>

Would the officials accept that view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#J00200"><p>Maybe I will go first on this one.  There is a general point there and then there is applying the general point to the specific case of the construction sector.  Generally speaking, it would be well accepted among economists that in a market economy, the private sector could be expected to do a good job of delivering certain services, such as supermarkets and so on.  Then there may be other services the market is not in such a good position to deliver from time to time and the State steps in and provides them.</p> <p>  On the construction sector, we must also bear in mind that when we are talking about the public sector versus the private sector, sometimes the distinction can be a bit more blurry.  It is the case, for example, that when we are going out to tender for the construction of a new housing complex, prison, school or whatever it might be, generally speaking the public sector is reliant on contractors to bid to build those facilities.  There is only so much capacity in the country to deliver that at any one point in time.  A good way of expressing it from a slightly different angle is that there are many ambitions we are doing our best to move forward on and commitments in the programme for Government, such as the area of retrofitting of social housing and public buildings.  There is also what we were talking about earlier, that is, those ambitions and commitments the Government is moving forward on with housing policy and so on.  Professor John FitzGerald and others have made the point that there is a lot of overlap in terms of capacity for achieving all of those objectives at once, particularly if we are going to upskill people to become familiar with retrofitting.  There are things we can do to expand our labour force and the levels of expertise out there to deal with that but inevitably it will involve and draw some people who would perhaps be more traditionally involved in the construction of buildings into the retrofitting side.  That is all a way of saying there are capacity constraints, whether we put it under the label of the public sector driving ahead with a particular policy agenda or the private sector providing it, there is an overlap and when they do meet with respect to those capacity constraints we must try to address that as best we can.</p></speech>

On the capacity constraints, not so long ago we had the OECD before this committee as well as representatives from the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC.  I asked them for their views on the role of State-owned enterprises and correcting market failures and cited the example of housing in the context of an area in which a State-owned enterprise could play a role.  Both organisations spoke quite positively about that point of view on trying to deal with the housing crisis and infrastructure deficit we have.  What are the officials' own views on that?</p></speech>

What we are seeing with housing is there is going to have to be a multifaceted approach to solving the housing crisis.  It is going to require both the public and private sectors working in conjunction in order to build the required houses, which the ESRI paper from last year set at approximately 33,000 per annum over the next decade.  There will, therefore, be requirements for both sectors to work in conjunction with one another.  On the State side that includes the local authorities, the approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the Land Development Agency, LDA, which is being established via a Bill currently going through the Houses.  Members will be aware of the agency and the ambitions for it regarding the provision of housing over the next number of years.  At present eight sites have been allocated to the LDA.  At a ninth site, at Shanganagh, the agency is looking at the provision of almost 600 units in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  There is potential there with the LDA, with the funding it is due to get of &euro;1.25 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to really get involved in the provision of housing from the State's perspective.</p></speech>

To make my point a little clearer, we are seeing concerns there is going to be capital carry-over because the concern is the private sector cannot meet the demand or be able to actually use all that money and build all the different projects.  I could have said that in a much more fluid way but my question was what would be the view on having a State-owned enterprise that would intervene.  Mr. Downes mentioned the capacity issues and that we must train people up with apprenticeships and whatever else in order that they are able to deliver the supply needed to meet the demand.  I wonder what the witnesses' views are on that.  Do they feel a State-owned enterprise for construction would be of benefit?</p></speech>

There is a short-term need at the minute to ramp up construction and infrastructure projects.  We would then need to consider the longer-term requirements of whether the State would need to be involved in such an area.  The private sector is there to supplement and as Mr. Downes and Mr. Meaney have set out, there are a number of initiatives under way with respect to upskilling in the area.  It is in the short term that the State itself will get benefits from that.</p></speech>

As we have an unemployment rate of 16%, we must deal with that as well as trying to meet what we want to spend and the infrastructural deficit and all that.  We should be looking at seeing whether there is some other way where the State intervenes more to try to deal with that variety of issues because we know how important the capital spend will be in dealing with the economy as well.  I think the Chair has been trying to intervene to tell my time is up.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for their presentations and I got a good bit from the questions and answers earlier.  Different Departments will have different levels of experience of dealing with the larger capital projects.  There will also be interdepartmental projects that straddle Departments.  For example, Garda stations for Clonmel and Macroom are projects that straddle the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Justice, as well as involving the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, because of their being PPPs.  I am trying to get an understanding of how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would be assisting or supporting such interdepartmental capital projects and what level of oversight it would be involved in with the likes of that.</p> <p>  We have seen the largest-ever housing budget and big budgets also in transport and in health.</p><p>I am trying to get an understanding of how the needs or priorities are identified.  For example, we saw the recent cyberattack wreaking havoc on many people waiting for medical procedures even though there has been a lot of spending on information technology, IT, equipment.  Is the Department involved in learning the lessons from that cyberattack?  Are there demands coming from other Departments for capital to spend on IT for cyber protection? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.436" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#K00200"><p>The Deputy's first question was about projects that straddle a number of Departments - he gave the example of Garda stations - and what level of oversight the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has.  Generally speaking, those kinds of exercises tend to work relatively seamlessly without any particular need for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have to get involved.  There is plenty of capacity within the justice sector and within the OPW, which has a lot of expertise in dealing with these kinds of works along the lines of the one mentioned by the Deputy.  There are good working relationships with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which gives expert advice on PPPs and different financing models.  There is no particular need for us to be the guiding hand that gets involved with each project even where projects straddle some Departments or agencies.</p> <p>  I will make a point that goes back to a more general issue arising from questions about capabilities and delivery capability within the public service.  One of the bodies of work that has been undertaken as part of the analysis arising from the phase 1 review of the national development plan, NDP, was the commissioning of advisory firm EY to take a look at capabilities within the public service to deliver on public construction.  That report, Supporting Excellence, made a number of recommendations.  It highlighted the fact that many areas within the public service had built up a lot of expertise over the years on how best to manage, procure and ensure good governance of capital projects in bodies like Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, Irish Water and in other sectors.  There are other bodies, possibly smaller agencies, which traditionally would not have had a large capital budget and whose capabilities need to develop over time.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1455" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#K00300"><p>What would be a trigger or threshold to draw the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's attention to a Department or project?  Does Mr. Downes have any examples?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021070100002#K00400"><p>If a project is going wildly over budget, that would come to our notice.  The oversight and monitoring of public expenditure is part of our general role.  When projects are going through the public spending code, for example, we have a role at the very outset in having a critical look at the business case that has been developed.  The project then goes back to its various approval stages.  I am talking about major projects in this case.  Projects over &euro;100 million always automatically have to come to us and to the Government for approval.  Smaller projects below that threshold are, generally, matters for each Department to manage within its own resources and would only really come to our notice if, for some reason, they have gone particularly off the rails or there are some issues that the relevant Department wants to bring to our attention.  That Department might figure there is a requirement for extra resources in a budget or something like that.  Generally speaking, individual projects are matters for Departments to govern.</p> <p>  I was going to make the point that one of the projects under way at the moment, arising from that earlier analysis, is to take a closer look at how bodies and institutions at the centre, such as the OPW, the NDFA, the national investment office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the OGP, co-ordinate their activities to provide a better, more seamless and transparent service to the various other Departments and agencies that may require support.  That project is also looking at how the various levels of expertise that exist within the system can be better disseminated and transmitted throughout the professional cadres within the public service.  </p> <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question about how priorities are identified, this goes to the heart of the exercise we are now involved in as part of phase 2 of the NDP review.  The Department is engaged in strategic dialogue, as we call it, which is a series of bilaterals involving Minister-to-Minister meetings between each of the Ministers in charge and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to talk about what the priorities are within each of the sectors.  Pretty much every Department has its own sectoral priorities, whether these are in the rural space with the Our Rural Future policy document and how we develop rural communities, the arts, which has its own vision, or the Garda and courts reform agenda.  In that overall context, we have learned over time that it is not a set-piece discussion and no one Department will have a set of priorities that are immutable from year to year.  </p> <p>  On the example the Deputy gave of the cyberattack, certainly, we in the Civil Service and public service have learned some lessons from that.  Our colleagues in the Department of Health and in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, have been developing strengths, capacities and different modalities at the centre.  That will, in turn, feed into how Departments prioritise their use of capital within the envelopes they have.  However, it is an ongoing process.  The priorities are a mixture of administrative necessities, emergency responses and, of course, political vision and direction for the future.  All of those go into the mix in coming up with the priorities that find expression in the capital envelopes that will be set out in the NDP and in the capital plans each individual Department and agency will bring forward.  That in turn feeds into the accountability discussion involving Members in the different forums within D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. </p></speech>

Will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform co-ordinate with each of the Departments or will it all just happen in a silo?  Is it a case of the HSE and the Department of Health, having now learnt the lessons, implementing their fixes while other Departments will be moving along separately or will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform co-ordinate that?  I expect there will be a big capital cost across some Departments.</p></speech>

It is certainly the case that when the cyberattack first impacted, it was our colleagues in the health sector, both in the HSE, early on, and in the Department of Health who bore the brunt of that attack.  They had to respond in a very agile manner to deal with it, get the health system back up and running as best they could, replace what needed to be replaced and change and modify systems to promote resilience.  In the first instance, the HSE and the Department of Health came up with a plan for what they were going to do about replacing, for example, laptops and software to overcome the impact of the cyberattack.</p> <p>  In turn, we at the centre are involved, which includes me as one of the areas I have responsibility for is working with my colleague Jim Deane in overseeing health expenditure.  We also have technical experts.  Barry Lowry is the Government Chief Information Officer and his office, the OGCIO, was involved in working with the health sector to come up with some learnings about how systems need to adapt.  In that context, and it is a matter I am sure the OGCIO would be happy to give more information on, we have put in place some adaptations and improvements that will have service-wide impact.  Likewise, our colleagues in the OGP have worked closely with our health sector colleagues to make sure that best practice is observed and the maximum efficiencies are obtained when it comes to replacing laptops.</p><p>The bill is going to be somewhere north of &euro;80 million for 2021 in terms of the direct health sector response to the cyberattack.  The Deputy is right that it is important that lessons need to be propagated throughout the system to build up the resilience that is needed across the system.  We are alive to the importance of that issue.</p></speech>

I come from Kildare and it would be remiss of me not to mention the Defence Forces.  They received little attention in the national development plan, NDP, and Project Ireland 2040.  We need to modernise the Defence Forces to ensure they are equipped to represent us, as they do, on the world stage.  Will that be addressed in the forthcoming plan?</p></speech>

We have engaged in strategic dialogue with our colleagues in the Department of Defence.  We are well aware of the priorities facing that Department and the Defence Forces in terms of modernising equipment, making sure that Defence Forces personnel who are sent overseas have the correct modern equipment in order to do their jobs effectively and efficiently and have the means to safeguard and protect their safety and well-being.  There are also broader, strategic issues about the role of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence in protecting our country.</p> <p>  I will hark back to the question posed by Deputy Aindrias Moynihan about the need for some learnings from the recent cyberattack.  We must ensure that as a country, as a system and as a public administration, we become more resilient.  The Department of Defence will have a role to play in that context.</p></speech>

There is, for example, a need for a second bridge over the Liffey at Newbridge, County Kildare.  Newbridge is one of the largest towns in the county and has a large population.  The lack of a second bridge is holding back sustainable development in the county.  What is the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard?</p></speech>

Once the capital ceilings are set, it becomes a matter for each Department.  I am not sure if this is a local authority issue, even below the departmental level.  It becomes a matter for each of those Departments or local authorities to use the resources they have and to prioritise as best they can.  I will hold my hands up and confess that I have not been made aware of the specifics of a new bridge in Newbridge.</p></speech>

The lack of a second bridge is holding up sustainable development and we need to see movement on that issue.</p> <p>  In the absence of an up-to-date census, how will population figures be obtained and is there a plan to review the plan when the census takes place next year?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Downes could give me some idea on that.</p></speech>

It was always envisaged that it would be subject to a mid-term review in 2022.  As a part of the programme for Government, the review of the NDP was brought forward and that is why we are doing it this year.  We will be publishing it shortly, as soon as it is ready.</p> <p>  We do not want to spend all our time reviewing and re-reviewing something we have already reviewed.  We need to move on to implementation and we are keen to do that.  We are going to set the capital expenditure ceilings for each Department for a five-year period and then set national strategic objectives with resourcing for the ten-year period ahead.  We will then enter the cycle of implementation and oversight.  There is a review in the sense that we will have discussions with each of the Departments every year to see whether they have used their allocations correctly, whether they have used it all and how they might achieve their objectives.  Returning to the discussion I had earlier with Deputy Boyd Barrett, we are interested in developing the performance focus and getting more of a sense of the outcomes and public service impacts of capital expenditure.  There is also an important role for the members of the committee in holding Departments to account for the money they have spent and assessing whether they have achieved their objectives.  There is an ongoing cycle of reporting, oversight and accountability.  Once this NDP review is completed and we have a revised and refreshed NDP in place later this year, it will be a few years before we come back to review and reset it once again.</p></speech>

In the meantime, I will ask a couple of questions.  I will ask a more general question about an issue on which we have touched a little.  The question is perhaps more suitable for the principal officers responsible for particular Votes.  My question relates to the negotiation between capital and current spending and how we place certain projects in certain categories.  How do we decide whether we are going to categorise a particular project or programme as a current or capital spend?  I am asking specifically about the Votes for which the representatives at this meeting are responsible.  In the case of, for example, housing, we have in the past used social housing current expenditure to repay loans for approved housing bodies, AHBs, which will ultimately be a capital asset.  We know that our water system is desperately in need of ongoing maintenance.  How do we play that against larger capital projects in terms of upgrades?</p> <p>  In the case of transport, the Green Party is constantly saying that we do not need pristine, one-off projects.  What we need is a joined-up system of good junctions for walking and protected cycle lanes.  That relates more to ongoing maintenance.  We could point to many areas within the health sector, possibly including all of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  My question for Ms Costello, Ms Callaghan and Mr. Deane is whether they provide advice or guidance in any way to Departments on whether a particular programme should be recorded as current or capital expenditure.  When they do that, is consideration given to the impact that categorisation might have on that project?  The categorisation may be the difference between a one-off capital cost and ongoing engagement through the budget.  Perhaps Ms Costello will answer first.</p></speech>

AHBs get that funding to support their provision of social housing stock.  The ongoing current expenditure associated with AHBs is met from the social housing current expenditure programme, SHCEP.  Considering the split between capital and current expenditure and how much capital an AHB requires upfront is a matter on which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage would work with the AHBs.</p><p>When an AHB approaches the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - the Housing Agency gives advice on this also - it will set out what upfront capital allocation is required under the CALF and it will also negotiate around the ongoing payment and availability aspect, which is met from the SHCEP budget.  Where our role arises is in setting the overall annual current and capital allocations for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Obviously, during the Estimates process, we engage at length with the Department around issues like the SHCEP allocation and ensuring it is adequate to meet its needs.</p></speech>

For the ongoing Estimates process, we would look at the SHCEP budget and at ensuring the negotiation on what is required for that budget for 2022, for example, will result in funding that is adequate to meet the needs of the Department.  However, the specifics on each individual project would be a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

We are trying to come up with an objective, defensible and correct application of public accounting rules.  Capital investment has a particular meaning, that is, investment in the creation of an asset that has a life and will generate returns beyond the one-year period.  That is seen, for instance, in investment in social housing-----</p></speech>

The point I am trying to get at is where the discretion comes into it.  In this country, we have seen the depreciation of certain capital assets through a lack of long-term current funding in terms of maintenance.  Water infrastructure is an example of that.  I am trying to find out where those parameters sit.</p></speech>

We have invested a great deal over the past decade and more in upgrading our transport infrastructure.  To make sure we get continuing value from that, there is an ongoing need for maintenance.  That expenditure, in turn, is treated as part of the overall capital envelope.  My colleague, Ms Callaghan, may want to come in and give her observations in response to the Chairman's query.</p></speech>

On the current side, it is around the public service obligation, PSO, and ensuring there is sufficient current operating expenditure to pay for the cost of running the different public transport services minus the fare revenue that is generated.  The maintenance, protection and renewal of assets is predominantly capital expenditure and we would negotiate with the Department each year on both the PSO current expenditure and the capital protection and renewal spend.</p></speech>

Before I bring in Deputy Durkan, I have one more question for the witnesses.  We hope to be moving into an era where we see performance indicators being used more and a greater focus on equality budgeting and well-being indicators.  What do the witnesses believe the role of performance indicators should be in capital spending?  Is there an issue with Departments setting their own performance indicators?  What kind of oversight do they deem to be necessary in respect of departmental Votes?</p></speech>

As members are aware, we are keen, as a Department, to move the overall discussion and engagement with Departments beyond just the financial envelope and allocation to encompass a greater scope.  For that to be a meaningful discussion, it requires a more mature and systematic understanding of what is being done, including making it clear from the outset of any project what is going to be delivered, what kinds of milestones and targets are in place while the project is being delivered and, importantly, what public service objectives are being accomplished by any particular project, whether on the current or capital side.  We are also strengthening our own infrastructure and internal processes for assessing and appraising projects by reference to the different criteria, including well-being indicators and other factors I mentioned, to ensure the dialogue is meaningful.  The dialogue should not, of course, be confined to a bilateral engagement between us and the individual Departments.  It also needs to encompass accountability before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is part and parcel of our strategy in terms of moving this agenda forward.  Members heard from my colleague, Mr. Deane, about our engagement and dialogue with the health sector on specifying health outcomes and how they can be a greater focus of engagement.</p> <p>  I will pause there and allow my colleagues to come in.  Will Ms Costello comment on the housing side?</p></speech>

My colleague mentioned health.  From my own perspective in respect of the housing Vote, there is a real opportunity for indicators to look at issues that cut across Departments.  Homelessness, for example, is a major issue for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but there are obviously other factors from the health perspective.  If we can start moving the dialogue on and addressing things in a more rounded way, this is an area in which we could really gain benefits as a society in terms of seeing the results of funding.</p></speech>

The Chairman may be aware that the Department of Transport is finalising its future land transport investment programme, which includes various strategies to underpin plans for different cities, such as the greater Dublin area and the Cork metropolitan area, as well as the national roads strategy.  Having key performance indicators in place at the level of those strategic plans, and how they feed into the overall framework and the NDP, is really critical for us and for the sectors over the coming period.  A lot of specialist knowledge resides in the Department in terms of putting those strategies together and working with all the agencies, such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority, on defining the metrics.</p></speech>

What does the Department require to come to that conclusion?</p> <p>  The second question is on the construction sector and the urgency of the house building programme.  I have said many times, we should abolish the phrase "social housing".  It is housing that is in that particular area, as well as the affordable area.  It is about the affordability of people being able to get a house by one means or another.  Why are so many construction firms in this country busily engaged in working outside the European Union in the UK?  Are they saying the system here is too complicated or too inaccessible and time-wasting?  </p></speech>

The Deputy asked how we determine if something is over budget.  He made the point earlier that in a particular project, there had perhaps been a lack of clarity all the way along about what the actual cost was.

For that cost, in turn, we have introduced an external peer review mechanism in order that the factors associated with the cost can be evaluated and there can be an informed judgment about the cost plus risk and the pricing to be associated with that risk.

Deputy Moynihan is unavoidably delayed, but he will join the meeting soon.  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss institutionalisation and the inappropriate use of congregated settings.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to our guests: Professor Roy McConkey, Institute of Nursing and Health Research at the University of Ulster; Ms Lynn Fitzpatrick, St. Mary of the Angels Parents and Relatives Association; Professor Gautam Gulati, consultant forensic and general psychiatrist and adjunct associate clinical professor at the University of Limerick; and Ms Ann Marie Flanagan, disability activist.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex or the complex in the convention centre when the D&aacute;il or Seanad is sitting there.  In this regard, if members are joining this meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus or the convention centre prior to making a contribution to the meeting.  For anyone watching the meeting online, witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, I ask everyone to bear with us if technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence the formal proceedings, I must begin with some formalities regarding matters of privilege.  I advise witnesses that they are directed to give only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings.  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence regarding a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Professor McConkey to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I will focus on people with intellectual disabilities who continue to live in congregated settings, despite the aspirations contained in the HSE report entitled Time to Move on from Congregated Settings.  I will highlight facts and figures for the committee obtained from our analysis of information contained in the National Intellectual Disability Database.  This is managed on behalf of the Department of Health by the Health Research Board, HRB.  It is a unique information resource that few other countries have available.  Along with colleagues from the HRB led by Dr. Sarah Craig, we have been able to document the gap between policy intentions and the reality.  Our findings have been published in international peer-reviewed scientific publications.</p> <p>  In our research, we went back to 2007, when more than 4,000 people with an intellectual disability in Ireland lived in congregated settings, which are those settings with ten or more residents.  We tracked those people from then to 2012, when the HSE&rsquo;s time to move on policy was announced, and on to 2017 to see what changes, if any, had happened over those ten years.  Although there had been a 30% reduction in numbers by 2017, the latest date for which we have information, more than 3,000 people remained in such settings.  However, this reduction was more marked in certain community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas than others, and reductions had begun in some areas even before the time to move on policy was announced.  Some of the reduction was due to deaths, but over these ten years approximately 750 people had been resettled from congregated accommodation.  Therefore, the policy was feasible, albeit only small numbers of people were able to avail of it.  </p> <p>  Here is the rub, though.  Almost the same number of people had been admitted to these settings over those ten years.  Why?  Largely, it was because the policy of no new admissions contained in the policy document had not been followed.  If a crisis arose and no alternative provision was available, then people had to be admitted somewhere and that happened to be into congregated settings.  The fact that people continued to be admitted to these settings prolongs the time that people continue to use congregated settings.</p> <p>  Our analysis went on to identify the people at the greatest risk of living in congregated settings.  They were people aged 55 years and over, those with more severe disabilities and those living in accommodation provided directly by the HSE rather than by voluntary organisations.  We drew four lessons from this analysis.  First, policy implementation occurs unequally, even in a country as small as Ireland.  Who allows this to happen?  Second, certain areas are more receptive to innovation than others.  We need to understand the reasons for this, although I suspect that local leadership is likely to be a leading factor.  Therefore, have we invested in changing the hearts and minds of service providers and professionals who have direct influence over the type of services that we provide?  Third, if the 30% reduction of people living in congregated settings took ten years to achieve, and if the process is not accelerated, then it will be a further 20 years, until 2040, before congregated care in Ireland is confined to history.  Can we afford to wait that long?  Fourth, so-called "bed reduction", or removing people from congregated settings entirely, cannot occur in isolation from creating alternative and better provision.</p> <p>  Other studies we have conducted in Ireland have demonstrated that improvements in people&rsquo;s quality of life come from person-centred and community-based supported accommodation.  This is where future investment needs to be made, if the State is to maximise the value for money it obtains from intellectual disability services.  I hardly need to remind the committee of the similarly entitled report, Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland, that was issued by the Department of Health in 2012.  It was published nearly ten years ago.  Why, then, does it take so long for things to change for people with a disability in Ireland?  Hopefully, that is a question that the committee will ponder.</p></speech>

His 40 years of lived experience in residential care is a crucial consideration for today's discussion, but not for the reasons one might assume, given that Bernard has never lived in an institution or inappropriate setting.  He has lived in St. Mary of the Angels.<br/><br/>Bernard lives a full, valued and meaningful life on a tranquil 30 acre campus in Beaufort not far from our family home in Cahirsiveen.  When we were kids, Bubo, as we have always known him, spent weekends, holidays and special occasions with us.  During the week, he lived among his peers, who at the time were children with severe or profound physical and intellectual disabilities.  My mom recalled the impact on Bubo after he moved to St. Mary of the Angels at five years of age:</p> <blockquote> 	Everything in his world changed for the better.  His epileptic fits began to diminish....  The immense heartbreak I [initially] felt ... was soon replaced with ... gratefulness that my son was in the best place, getting the best chance for a long and healthy life. </blockquote> <p>Bubo and his friends grew up together in an environment that was purposely built for them.  From its founding in 1968, the campus was developed and upgraded with them specifically in mind.  The on-site facilities include a heated hydrotherapy pool, a sensory room with heated water bed, a wheelchair swing, outdoor sensory equipment, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, music therapy, jacuzzi baths, psychology, psychiatry, massage, speech and language therapy, dentistry, GP visits and a day centre for crafts and cookery.  There is also a special school and a chapel that many individuals can walk or cycle to independently.  Recently, the local community raised &euro;500,000, which was used in part to improve walkways and landscaping and to construct new bedrooms and sunrooms.  Today, Bubo is at home on holidays, but if he was in Beaufort, he would probably be at a tea party with friends or spending time in the spectacular grounds.  He might be planting flowers in a sensory box on the patio outside his private en suite bedroom or chilling out in the hydropool.  Maybe he would not be there at all and instead be out on one of his regular day trips to the nearby towns of Killorglin or Killarney, all this with the help of the exceptional front-line staff who know him so well.<br/><br/>This is Bernard's life now, but his future is uncertain due to Government policy.  The 2011 Time to Move on from Congregated Settings report identified St. Mary of the Angels as one of 72 residential settings to close within seven years purely because it was campus-based.  If Bubo could tell us where he wanted to live, we believe he would choose his current place of residence, but this policy mandates that he move out to live in its preferred place of residence, that is, in &quot;ordinary neighbourhoods&quot;, and sets out narrow parameters within which Bubo can make choices.  In this way, the policy denies people such as Bubo rights afforded to them under Article 19 of the UN convention.<br/><br/>The policy also ensures that people such as Bubo will be forced to comply by issuing a further mandate, namely, that there be no new admissions to congregated settings.  With an ageing population, it is inevitable that the number of people living in St. Mary of the Angels will dwindle, making it economically unviable to maintain its facilities.  Ultimately, numbers will fall to an extent that makes it impossible to stay open for the few who remain.  Meanwhile, Bubo's vibrant community will diminish and he will notice a change in his environment.  It will feel lonely and isolated.  His home could become an institution for the first time.<br/><br/>The policy removes Bubo's right to live on a campus and denies this right to all current and future &quot;Bubos&quot; because its implicit aim is to eliminate congregated settings and its explicit aim is that there be &quot;no further need for congregated settings&quot;.  This, too, violates a right under the convention to make choices on an equal basis with others, since campus living is an option open to other cohorts of society such as students, older people and even some people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The policy insists that Bubo will not live in a community until he is in an &quot;ordinary&quot; place being an &quot;ordinary&quot; person, but a community is, by definition, &quot;a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common&quot;.  Bubo lives among people with whom he shares much in common.  The Government should not define &quot;community&quot; for the individual.  Rather, it is the individual who should define the communities in which he or she wishes to participate.  For Bubo, moving to &quot;the community&quot; means losing lifelong friends and having nothing in common with his new neighbours.<br/><br/>Research supporting the ideology that ordinary community living is best for all people with disabilities &quot;no matter how severe or complex&quot; must take into account the unique needs and real lives of the minority - 14% of people with severe intellectual disabilities and 4% with profound intellectual disabilities - for whom a dramatic change of setting and routine could have negative consequences.  The essential facilities they need will not be available to them out there in the community any more than they are available now to the families with disabled children who are crying out for such facilities.<br/><br/>Decongregation has played out internationally with tragic consequences.  To date in Ireland, the only stories getting airtime are the successful ones.  I cannot ask the committee to take my word for it that, so far, this policy has badly failed some vulnerable people, but please consider the fact that, since its launch, 278 people were admitted or readmitted into congregated settings in the period 2012 to 2019.  This happened despite the policy's aim to remove the need for such places.  Where are these people supposed to go when the door to the last &quot;St. Mary of the Angels&quot; has shut for good?<br/><br/>I put it to the committee that St. Mary of the Angels is a community in its own right with a proven track record of success spanning six decades.  It is a residential care model that should be researched and replicated, not broken up and sold to fund community living.  In closing, I ask the committee to support my request that St. Mary of the Angels be immediately exempted from the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings policy, which should never have targeted it in the first place, let alone designated it a pilot and priority site for decongregation.</p></speech>

My evidence will relate to my individual viewpoint as a clinical academic and does not represent the views of the HSE or any other affiliation.<br/><br/>The Irish ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, in 2018 enshrined the rights of people with disabilities in an international convention, providing much-needed momentum to reform of this area.  This is particularly the case for people with psychosocial disabilities and people with intellectual disabilities.  Article 19 recognises the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community with choices equal to others.  The report of the HSE working group on congregated settings in 2011 made a compelling case for urgent action in this respect.<br/><br/>Data from the implementation group recorded a 30% reduction in the number of residents in congregated settings between 2012 and 2017.  However, a report in 2018 by Inclusion Ireland raised concerns about limitations in the scope of policy and rate of progress in deinstitutionalisation.  The report raised the issue of people with disabilities moving between institutions, stating:</p> <blockquote> 	For example ... in 2015, less than 10% moved into their own home.  Almost three quarters of those who moved actually moved to other institutions.  </blockquote> <p>Against this backdrop, I intend to share a specific viewpoint with the committee relating to people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities and the intersection of Articles 13, 28, 11 and 19 of the UNCRPD in respect of a process referred to as trans-institutionalisation.  Trans-institutionalisation refers to a process whereby individuals who community care policies intended to deinstitutionalise in practice ended up in different institutions rather than their own homes.<br/><br/>I will briefly speak about people in prisons, people who are homeless and people who are seeking asylum.  In terms of people in prisons, against a backdrop of the closure of a substantial number of psychiatric beds, a study that evaluated publicly available Irish data from 1986 to 2010 found an inverse relationship between psychiatric admissions and prison committals.</p><p>More specifically, this study found an increase of 91 prison committals for every 100 psychiatric hospital admissions foregone.  There is a lack of up-to-date Irish data in respect of people with psychosocial disabilities in the criminal justice system.  However, the available data suggests that approximately one in three prisoners screen positive for intellectual disabilities, one in two for substance misuse and dependence and that the prevalence of severe mental illness in Irish prisons is four times that of the general population.  This is borne out in clinical practice where it is not unusual to come across individuals with multiple disabilities, including intellectual and psychosocial disabilities, in a prison setting.  It is also possible to trace a link to a paucity of community supports prior to incarceration.  Furthermore, the provision of equivalent care for these individuals as set out in the Nelson Mandela rules is challenging, with systemic and legal barriers to diversion in Ireland.  It is important to ensure that Irish prisons are not, in effect, emerging as congregated settings for people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. <br/><br/>In regard to people who are homeless, a recent study in Dublin funded by the National Disability Authority, NDA, in respect of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities found 145 individuals or families identified as homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This represents one study from one region in Ireland.  An Inclusion Ireland report, using 2016 census statistics, found that people with an intellectual disability represent 1.4% of the total population and 3.1% of the homeless population.  The link with homelessness extends to people with psychosocial disabilities.  A recent study in acute psychiatric inpatient units in one Irish region found that approximately one in three inpatients were homeless or had a history of homelessness.  More than one in six people committed to Irish prisons are homeless at the time of committal and there is a link between disability, incarceration and homelessness.  A 2012 Irish study found a high prevalence of psychosocial disabilities among people in a Dublin hostel for homeless people.  Article 28 of the UNCRPD places a duty on the state to ensure equal access by persons with disabilities to public housing programmes.  We need to ensure that hostels for people who are homeless are not, in effect, emerging as congregated settings for people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. <br/><br/>On people seeking asylum in Ireland, there are more than 7,000 people living in direct provision in Ireland, 30% of whom are children, with an average stay of 24 months.  A study in direct provision centres in Sligo and Leitrim found that asylum seekers were six times more likely than refugees to report symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, depression or anxiety.  A study in a Galway primary care setting found that asylum seekers were five times more likely than Irish citizens to be diagnosed with psychiatric illness.  Little is known about the prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities in the direct provision system.  However, there is international recognition of the additional barriers people with intellectual disabilities face in the asylum process.  Article 11 of the UNCRPD requires the state to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, including situations of armed conflict and humanitarian emergencies.  We need to ensure that direct provision centres do not emerge as congregated settings for people with psychosocial disabilities.  <br/><br/>Further to the McMahon report, the Government White  Paper on ending direct provision is to be welcomed both in reference to housing and community inclusion.  It would be important that people with intellectual and psychosocial disabilities are appropriately supported through this process to avoid a risk of trans-institutionalisation.  Decongregation of people with disabilities from institutions can be positive.  However, it must be accompanied with community supports and inclusion strategies to avoid a risk of trans-institutionalisation.  The right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others and with full inclusion and participation is a basic right.  Realising this in practice is a litmus test of our commitment as a society to the values of the UNCRPD.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I want to dedicate this contribution to Jennifer Hynes who, as some of you will know, is a stalwart, amazing self-advocate who has found herself in a nursing home since 2019, and to the Clare Leader Forum, a pan disabled people's organisation, DPO, which believes in the right to live a life with dignity, privacy, equality, respect and autonomy, driven by the mottos, &quot;rights not charity&quot; and &quot;nothing about us without us&quot;.<br/><br/><font color="#212100">  Article 19 of the UNCRPD, coupled with the commitment of the Oireachtas, are central to realising our human rights.  For so many in society a place to call home is one of the most pertinent issues of our times, but it is impacting disabled people, women, men and children of all ages and impairments, disproportionately.  This is a welcome opportunity to contribute to a narrative of human rights of disabled people with regards to a home, independent living and community participation.  </font><font color="#2F2F2F">We need a paradigm shift in realising disabled people as rights holders.  Prevailing attitudes and practices interfere with disabled people being recognised as needing their own homes to live, participate and work in our communities as per our will and preference</font>equal to others.  <br/><br/><font color="#212100">  Disability injustice</font><font color="#212100">and ableism are among the key drivers for continued investment in practises that sustain the deprivation of liberty, inequity in accessing justice and the lack of supports for independent living.  Homelessness is hidden by policies of institutionalisation in residential centres, nursing homes, hostels and relatives' homes.  Disabled people often have no choice but to live with relatives owing to the lack of independent living supports and housing.  My contribution to the discourse on the right to independent living is to evoke an urgency to act swiftly, intentionally and empathically to redress these inequalities and to meaningfully include us - disabled people - in the solutions.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  Personal assistant services, PAS, and a home are fundamental human rights, as per Article 19.  The exclusion of a significant portion of the population from statistics and policy responses to homelessness, housing needs, unemployment, etc., further normalises the othering and segregation of disabled people.  For example, clumping PAS hours with home help and home care, without a right of the disabled person to a minimum number of hours to support him or her, has similar consequences.  </font>Disabled people become institutionalised in their own home, consequently.  <font color="#212100">Disabled people include people with long-term physical, mental, intellectual and sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers hinder full and effective participation in society equal to others.  Disabled men, women and children have a need for a home that is equal to that of non-disabled people.  Disabled people are not vulnerable by virtue of impairment, but as a consequence of the medical model, oppressive and, at times, harmful systems.  There are overwhelming systemic policies and services that segregate, maintain inequality and fuel ableism as a normative and acceptable response to disabled people.  These need to change.  They limit the meaning of a home, community participation, private and family life.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  The majority of society understands disability through a non-disabled lens, which </font>reduces the rights of <font color="#2F2F2F">disabled people.  Disabled people are disproportionately impacted by deprivation, including homelessness.  Systemic ableism assigns value to appearance, ability to reproduce, earn, and ascribed behaviours, evaluating a prescribed inability to conform to a constructed idea of normality, intelligence and productivity.</font></p><p>The terms "homelessness" and "a home" when describing disabled people's living situations are not generally ascribed.  It is assumed that disabled people either remain in their family homes with ageing relatives or live in institutions in the form of residential care, nursing homes or hostels.  It is normalised to such a degree that many family members also believe that institutions are where disabled relatives need to live for their own safety.</p><p> The report, Wasted Lives: Time for a better future for younger people in nursing homes, made for difficult reading.  I thank Mr. Peter Tyndall for giving a voice to the 1,300 young people who are in nursing homes for older people through no fault of their own other than having an impairment that requires independent living supports and a lack of recognition of their right to autonomy, privacy and dignity in their own homes.  It was harrowing to read about how there was for too many a lack of informed consent and a belief that it would only be for a short while, turning days and weeks into years.  To learn that four people have died since the publication, 20 more people have entered nursing homes and only 18 people are due to be supported in leaving is devastating for me, the Clare Leader Forum and the movement.</p><p> There remain 3,000 people living in congregated settings, which means ten or more other people living in one space.  Fundamentally, it means that they have no tenancies, no control and no decision over who is recruited to provide them with assistance.  Most people do not decide to be segregated from their communities and families.  The evidence shows that they are at greater risk of having a poor quality of life compared to people living in the community.  They continue to live in unsuitable, outdated accommodation.  Important aspects of everyday life are unavailable in most cases, for example, private homes, access to their own kitchens where they get to cook with assistance or access to laundry facilities.</p><p> We have no statistics on the number of people who are forced to live with elderly parents or relatives due to the lack of vital supports that provide independent living opportunities.  It is assumed that adults with disabilities choose to live at home for life, but many do not.  It keeps people in poverty traps, forcing disabled people to resort to relatives becoming "carers" and themselves becoming passive dependants, oppressed and depressed.</p><p> We must re-examine the &euro;2 billion spent on specialised services through the lens of disabled people's human rights.  We need to question the assumptions that residential care, years in day services with little to no progression, residential respite services, the lack of transport and being segregated from community life for all their lives are what disabled people want and need.  We need to move beyond traditional service-led models that perpetuate paternalism and believe that disabled people are less entitled to independent living, a home and a family life.</p><p> The consequences of systemic and cultural ableism exclude disabled people from mainstream news reports, political debates and conversations about housing and homelessness.  For example, when we hear about homelessness, it does not conjure up images of disabled parents, disabled children or disabled rough sleepers.  The data show us that one in four homeless people on the social housing waiting lists are disabled.</p><p> I wish to share with the committee some examples of disabled people's lives, the first of which is that of a mother with MS whose leg is so heavy that she cannot lift it anymore and whose arms are weak, making it difficult to use her crutches.  She has four children between aged between three years and 12.  She in living in emergency accommodation.  Her children attend school three miles away.  Their living situation is unbearable.  Her pain and fatigue make it more difficult and her stress is exacerbating her impairment.  Her need for a home is urgent.  Her key worker talks about finding a homeless hub, but that is not a home, and it certainly will not meet her physical support needs.</p><p> Another example is that of the parents of three children, one of whom has a physical disability, who are looking for emergency accommodation.  The landlord sold their home.  The father had to reduce his hours and the mother had to give up her job.  Can the committee members imagine their poverty?  Their child's access needs and the lack of accessible housing, or housing at all, keeps them in emergency accommodation.</p><p> Another example is that of the disabled mother in a domestic violence situation, scared for her children and herself.  She cannot leave because she does not have personal assistance hours.  Her abuser is the person assisting them.  Shelters cannot accommodate her access needs or her hoist and do not have the resources to provide personal assistance.  There is no end in sight for her.</p><p> What about the university graduate who qualified with a masters?  She was offered a permanent job but had to refuse it because her personal assistance hours and her supports from the Department of Education were taken away while she was a student.  She moved down home to live with her sister and is sharing a room with her young niece.  As a result, she lives in abject poverty and is forced to live on disability allowance.  She has sunk into depression.  Just to get out of the house, she goes to a day centre.</p><p> Another example is that of the 39-year-old woman who had to leave her home.  She had a physical impairment and a local authority house.  She went to hospital, but it did not have enough personal assistant support hours for her.  In April 2019, she agreed to go into a nursing home temporarily.  She is still waiting there.  Like the other 1,300, she spent the past year and a half locked in a room because of Covid-19.  Now that she is finally out of the room, she patiently repeats the same conversations day in and day out with many of the other residents, who are at the end of their lives with advanced dementia.  Her life is ebbing away.  She is becoming institutionalised and does not believe that she will ever get out.</p><p> Another example is that of the 27-year-old woman who arrived at a homeless clinic mid-pandemic in rural Ireland just a few months ago with her bags in her hands and looking for emergency accommodation.  She was known to them, but she was refused that support and was told to go home to her father.  She could not.  She tried to explain why and was emotional.  As a consequence, her mental health deteriorated.  She ended up being admitted involuntarily by the Garda.  This devastated her and she became hopeless.  Due to the condition of her mental health, which was a consequence of being rejected and not listened to, she was eventually given temporary accommodation.  However, it is temporary and she remains fearful, which is impacting her mental health recovery.</p><p> Another example is that of the 30-year-old woman with an intellectual disability who excitedly moved into what she thought was community living only to find herself living with two other people with whom she had not chosen to live.  She was promised independent living, choice and control in her life, but because that organisation only has funding for one staff member every day, she finds herself walking along the streets and going to events in groups.  That is a form of institutionalisation.  She did not want that and did not know it was what she was accepting.  Due to her having an intellectual disability, she is not allowed to do things independently.  She is depressed and is not being listened to.  Where are her will and preference?</p><p> Disabled people need to be recognised as having social, economic and cultural rights with the necessary infrastructure and supports.  Disabled people need to be heard.  People who are categorised as having complex needs, those with intellectual disabilities, people with significant mental health issues and people with high physical and sensory support needs deserve to be supported to live their chosen lives, not equal to other disabled people, but to other human beings.  As we have stated time and again at this meeting, Article 19 of the convention states that, equal to others, disabled people have the right to live with whom we want and where we want and to have the supports that meet our unique needs.  This article does not select people depending on our impairment or perceived capacity.  It means everybody.</p><p> It has long been accepted in Ireland and internationally, and is now covered by Article 19, that personal assistant support services offer disabled people independent living, yet after 30 years, it accounts for less than 5% of the &euro;2 billion budget.  This matter needs to be examined.  Personal assistant support services are only offered to people with physical and sensory impairments whose functional needs require support.  People who need support in making decisions continue to be victims - that is the word we use - of wardship under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.</p><p>It must be repealed urgently.  We ask the members of the committee to work with their colleagues in the Oireachtas to commence the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 fully and on time, as promised.  These outdated laws and policies feed an ideology that holds that people with significant impairments are subhuman and a drain on finite resources.  These policies and practises maintain structural and systemic institutionalisation of disabled people.</p><p> It is not all about resources.  To make sustainable, meaningful change, the State must support true and meaningful involvement by all those directly impacted.  There are many ways to do this.  People with a disability who are critical thinkers and solution-focused could be sought out.  Capacity could be enhanced for other disabled people, as is necessary.  People with different impairments and cultural backgrounds could be included.  Disabled people should be viewed as having the same value as expensive external consultants.  We are the experts.  We have the solutions.  We can support the State to support us.  I hope fundamental human rights will be the driver for continuing work in this area and that there will be sustained dialogue with and meaningful inclusion of disabled people at all levels in respect of policy, law reform, finance and system change.</p></speech>

The dignity and rights of those individuals affected is at the heart of this subject for me and for this committee.  Our systems still have a kind of paternalistic attitude that views people with intellectual disabilities as requiring care, rather than enabling them to live as independently as possible and appropriate.  Choices in this regard are limited to congregated settings, which we are trying to move away from, or dependency on family care, which presents its own challenges in respect of an ageing population and the disgraceful way in which carers are treated.  We must replace this system with a one-size-fits-all model that focuses on one thing, which is individual rights.</p> <p>  The slow progress made in the HSE's time to move on policy in respect of congregated settings is symptomatic of this perspective.  Since the strategy commenced, of the initial 4,000 people identified, only 661 people have been supported to transition out of congregated settings.  As Professor McConkey said, at this rate it will be another 20 years before decongregation is completed.  We must also be aware that this issue concerns people with intellectual disabilities whose rights to act on their own behalf are legally limited, especially given the delay in the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.</p> <p>  My first questions are directed to Ms Flanagan and Professor McConkey.  Ms Flanagan highlighted the importance of the personal assistance service, which offers disabled people independent living.  I ask her to elaborate on what we must do regarding policy and legislation to ensure that a system based on personal assistance is in place for all disabled people.  Turning to Professor McConkey, I ask him to outline the significance of an individual resource allocation model, in which budgets and supports are assigned to individuals based on need.  I refer to the potential of such a model to enable disabled people to employ personal assistants and to secure the specific support services they need, especially with respect to engagement with the community.  </p> <p>  If there is time then, perhaps at the end, I have a question for Professor Gulati.  He spoke about the disproportionate number of people with intellectual disabilities living in emergency accommodation.  The historical absence of independent, supported living accommodation and, as far as we know, in our new builds as well, is probably the biggest contributor to this.  Will he please comment on whether other systemic barriers or factors contribute to this disproportionate number of people with intellectual disabilities residing in emergency accommodation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.493" nospeaker="true" time="00:00:00" ><p>Deputy Michael Moynihan took the chair</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Marie Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#E00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Ireland is unique compared with most European countries in that we do not have legislation that provides a legal entitlement for disabled people to have services in their own right.  My direct professional experience includes working in the United Kingdom under community care legislation where direct payments were enacted in 1996.  Nothing is perfect, but that approach certainly does provide a right in this regard to disabled people of all impairments.  This is another problem in Ireland.  We silo disabled people based on our impairments.  That then perpetuates the idea that people with intellectual disabilities and other impairments do not have the same drive for independent living as people with other impairments, such as myself.</p> <p>  The situation then becomes based on economic value.  Therefore, someone like me who has personal assistant support can get work and contribute financially.  However, we do not know the overall value in respect of an individual&rsquo;s life or the economy, because we have never organised ourselves in a way that provides independent living supports to disabled people.  Therefore, first, personal assistant support services must be legislated for and provided to all disabled people.  This is another example of the need to reorganise independent living supports.  Ireland, for example, has the third highest rate of unemployment and poverty for people with disabilities in Europe, next to countries in eastern Europe.  That statistic comes from a report carried out by the European Disability Forum last year.  It is a shocking statistic.  One of the wealthiest countries in Europe has one of the highest rates of deprivation and poverty among disabled people.  This is related to how we organise services and supports for disabled people.  </p> <p>  In addition, and this is not a criticism of the sector, but the relationship between the voluntary sector and the State excludes disabled people.  This goes right back to the 1950s and, indeed, to the foundation of the State.  In 1984, approximately 140 organisations were providing services to people with intellectual disabilities.  Therefore, there is no space for disabled people to speak up for ourselves, to represent ourselves and to say that we want the funding to manage our own lives.  Equally, the lack of progress being made in providing autonomous independent support for people with capacity "issues" to represent themselves is also problematic.  Like Deputy Cairns, I also call for the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.  We must legislate for personal assistant supports.  It must also be understood as well that this does not involve just one thing.  We must build supports to ensure individuals can have choice and control in their lives.</p></speech>

We rely a great deal on what is called block funding.  For people in congregated settings, for example, the service provider will get an amount that is then averaged out among 20, 30 or up to 50 people.  Therefore, the averaging out of the funding means that people with high needs are underpaid, while those people with low needs are overpaid.  Many economists will recognise this situation as an inefficient way of doing this.  The solution, therefore, is to try to do an assessment of people's needs to allow for direct resource allocation to meet the particular needs of each person.  Those could be personal care needs, social inclusion needs, etc..</p> <p>  Many jurisdictions have moved to exploring options for individualised funding being made available.  However, many service providers would see this as being a big threat to the maintenance of their existing systems.  Those systems have been set up with the assumption that providers will get a year-on-year increase on whatever amounts they have received historically, which those organisations would argue provides for better planning.  Of course, what is being done in that current model of funding is perpetuating a model of service that we may wish to get away from.</p><p>Some of the innovative providers are starting to explore how they could create services in which individual allocations are all added together to provide the outcome of the moneys that are needed to sustain that service.  There are examples around Ireland where this is happening.</p><p> There is a need to look at value for money in regard to whether we are overpaying for some people who are getting more care than they need, or underpaying for those people who need much greater care.  Mention was made of nursing homes, which is a big problem in the North of Ireland as well.  The danger is that people are placed into nursing home care who could live in a community setting, with support from personal assistants, at a much cheaper cost than what is being paid for nursing home care.  However, it is convenient for the bureaucracy to keep putting people into those sorts of settings rather than having to redesign services that are more responsive to people's needs.  That is the challenge that Ireland needs to take on board, along with other countries as it is not unique to Ireland.</p></speech>

I presume much of that is to do with the fact we do not have enough builds for independent supported living.  Can Professor Gulati give us any insights into what other structural and bureaucratic barriers there are in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Guatam Gulati" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#F00300"><p>That is a very important point.  In my experience, the biggest barrier to getting the right supports is that the disability might not be recognised at all.  I do not think that, sitting here today, we even know the extent of the number of people with disabilities who are present in homeless hostels around the country.  A lot of disability goes unrecognised and, without recognising it, we cannot offer the right supports.</p> <p>  My second viewpoint, again from my clinical experience, is that it is unusual for people with disabilities just to have the one disadvantage, and if they have one disability, it is more than likely they have another disability.  For example, it would not be unusual in my practice to see people with psychosocial and intellectual disabilities who have lived a life of poverty and who may be homeless, and stigma remains a real issue for them even now in 2021.</p></speech>

Each of them brings an expertise on the issues of institutionalisation.  It is an important topic that we are discussing.  Deinstitutionalisation has been on the political agenda for at least three successive Governments, following the HSE&rsquo;s Time to Move On From Congregated Settings report from 2011 and, on the other hand, the fact we have a strong social and historical culture of institutionalisation.</p> <p>  Last week, we met with the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, who was discussing his Wasted Lives report.  One of the most striking conclusions drawn in his report was that even young people in these nursing homes still did not have access to appropriate or satisfactory primary health and social care support.  The fact that disabled people need additional supports is often used as a justification for their accommodation in institutional settings, usually at the cost of their rights, such as the right to privacy and family life.  If their support needs are not being provided for, then it is a lose-lose situation in which their rights are being dismissed and are not being met.</p> <p>  My first question is to Ms Ann Marie Flanagan and I would like to come back in when she has responded because I have two further questions.  How can we have more meaningful engagement with disabled people under Article 4 of the convention, which requires state parties to consult meaningfully with people who carry the voice of direct lived experience?  As a committee, how do we engage less with service providers and more with DPOs?  I am grateful that I have regular contact with the Clare Leader Forum, my local DPO, which flags rights-based issues and keeps me up to speed on the voice of direct lived experience that is so often missing from these discussions at national level.  How do we rectify this and honour the ethos of "nothing about us without us&rdquo;?</p> <p>  Second, and on a related note, Ms Flanagan might talk to us about the importance of disabled people leading the conversation on how the State can ensure it meets its full obligation under Article 19 and the rest of the convention, and the value, ethically, morally and socially, of a genuine inclusion of disabled people in decision-making processes.</p> <p>  As a lead activist in the cause for legislating for PAS and after the motion was passed unanimously in the D&aacute;il, what has the feeling been like in the movement since there has been no progress or movement towards putting such services on a statutory footing?</p></speech>

I will try to remember all of those questions.  The first thing to remember is that, in Ireland, we do not have a funded and recognised statutory engagement process with disabled people.  Again, we need to acknowledge the political and cultural norms that exist and the fact the State goes to very organised service providers.  That is a particular lens and it is there, whether disabled people agree with it.  However, at a minimum, there has to be equal investment in giving voice to disabled people.</p> <p>  I want to take the opportunity to explain the power of DPOs.  At local level, we have the collective of disabled people across impairments, lived experience and understanding of self-worth.  As a consequence of coming together and the peer support that is fundamental, I have watched the empowerment and the voice of individuals.  Until now, the majority of people have been living at home with families, they access day services and they are long-term unemployed.  They would not have seen themselves as equals and, because they were not deeply unhappy, they believed this would be their best lot and they regularly used reductionist language in describing themselves.  What I want to express, and this is important, is that disabled people, because they do not have supports, are dependent on the love and goodwill of brothers, sisters and elderly parents in the main.  They are uncomfortable with challenging that because of the level of gratitude and love they have.  However, so many people have shared with me that they feel guilt, they do not ask for what they want and they fit in with what the family does.  Many people would say that at the age of 25, 30 or 35, they feel like their little nieces and nephews and, as somebody said to me recently, they fit in with what the children do in the family.  That has nothing to do with their impairment.  It is to do with how they are treated and viewed within the family dynamic, because the family dynamic is that they are members of the general population, and the general population still seems to see disabled people in a paternalistic way.</p> <p>  I am in my mid-40s, I have a career, I am a mental health professional, I have PAS and I have a child, yet I experience ableism every day of the week.  For example, I could be at a meeting with other mental health professionals who do not have disabilities.  I might have made a contribution on a recovery solution for people we work with and it would be unheard.  I know myself that, as a consequence of ableism, it is heard differently by somebody else.  I am the lived experience.  I feel it every day.  Another example is around the need to have protection and the right to PAS.</p><p>HSE organisations are running out of money because there is no national legislation that protects the hours and gives a standard of support for disabled people.  Regularly, CHOs make cost-cutting decisions, regardless of risk assessment or impact on disabled people.  The other thing in engaging with HSE organisations regularly, they say they are crisis managing.  It is never about the quality of life.  We now know the personal assistant services has become a form of institutionalising people.  It is called personal assistance because it comes under a budget, but it is home help.  The average time that people get per day is one hour and, therefore, people are not planned for.  </p><p> A HSE representative mentioned an assessment at a recent committee meeting, although I cannot remember its exact name, that is being used for people in nursing homes and other congregated settings.  However, it is a deficit model.  It looks at disability and what people cannot do.  There are no recognised assessments that engage with disabled people and ask them what they want for their lives and offer them all the supports they need.  The State maintains that it should meet the minimum needs of individuals. </p><p> I also wanted to give another example of how funding is spent and the cultural norms around that.  For example, when we look at the employment policy for disabled people, again, much of the funding is about compensating employers.  We are almost selling the idea that employers are doing this disabled person a favour by employing them; that it is almost charity and a social service, rather than employing people.  Rather than providing supports for the individual to do the job equal to others, we are compensating employers through grants.  We are convincing people that they should do the right thing.  Of course, everybody has social responsibilities, but when there is an imbalance between the right of the potential employee and the compensation of prospective employers, this feeds into the idea of inequality and that disabled people are less equal.  There is a need to legislate for personal assistants for everybody.  I have said that previously. </p><p> The Deputy asked about the mood.  I recall in November 2019, the excitement when a unanimous motion passed.  It was 7.30 p.m.  There were many people either in the Gallery or watching from home.  Deputies spoke passionately about disabled people and activists whom they knew at local level and they were supportive of the establishment of a commissioner to look at what is required.  Yet, it is not even in the programme for Government.  It is exhausting for disabled people.  The committee has heard the evidence from everybody time and time again.  We are the poorest and we have the fewest services, yet we do our best to be as vocal as we can to ask for our rights to be protected.  </p><p> Ireland was the last country to ratify the UNCRPD.  I ask on behalf of disabled people to please not implement this in a minimalistic way, but to embrace all the articles in the convention, see us as equal to yourselves as citizens and constituents and support the realisation of our rights.  That can only be done by interrogating the existing way that services are provided and by looking at the individual and seeing their potential, rather than seeing their minimum needs within a traditional medical model approach to providing disability services.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#G00300"><p>I thank Ms Flanagan for her responses and for all the good work she does through the Clare Leader Forum.</p> <p>  My next questions are to Professor McConkey.  Based on his comments on the Time to Move on from Congregated Settings report, the failure to implement a no new admissions policy has meant that there has been an almost one-in-one-out door policy with numbers of admissions, vastly minimising the efficacy of transferring people out of congregated settings.  As he noted, it will take another two decades to eliminate congregated settings if this pace is maintained.  Are we equipped to implement and no new admissions policy?  What would that look like?  The focus has been on transfers out of these settings, but we need to redirect some attention to preventing people from involuntarily becoming accommodated through congregated care.  </p> <p>  Professor Gulati made reference to trans-institutionalisation, which is a valid point.  Ireland has an historic tendency towards this.  How does he envision preventing this, even if some disabled people who, through will and preference, wish to live in a group setting?  How would the associated confines of institutionalisation be separated from, for example, a co-living situation? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Roy McConkey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#G00400"><p>The Deputy raised an important point about how we manage the transfers of people from congregated living, and how we prevent other people going into those settings.  We have a lot of international experience on how to do this, and how it can be done well.  It requires what is called &ldquo;bridging funding&rdquo;.  In addition to maintaining ongoing costs of service provision, additional moneys are needed to develop new styles of services that prevent people from going into such settings.  That money is ultimately recouped, because the investments that exist in the congregated settings will be released through time.  That can then pay back the bridging moneys that were involved in the first place.  Some of that comes from the redeployment of staff.  Additional staff are no longer needed, because current staff can be transferred to these new services.</p> <p> There is also capital realisation.  The National Health Service, NHS, in the United Kingdom has found this to be a lucrative source of funding, because it was able to sell off capital, such as large campus arrangements, which have often been recreated as housing developments in particular areas.  Much money can be released over time. </p> <p>  The key strategy is very much looking at the future needs of people.  Many people want to continue living with families and many families want to continue looking after their relatives.  However, it is well-known that others will want and need alternative care provided for them.  This requires forward planning.  If one starts to do this before a crisis arises, then they can avoid getting into these emergency placements, such as in nursing homes or existing congregated settings.  That planning needs to include opportunities for people to have accommodation in local housing, and the support that they will require.  Some of that can be provided in the person&rsquo;s family home.  There may be options for people to continue living in the family home, with additional support staff and personal assistants coming in to help them.  There are myriad ways of creating new styles of services around individuals that prevent the emergency crisis admissions, as well as finding ways of relocating people out of congregated settings.  International practice tells us how to do it.  Local jurisdictions have to find the resources to make it happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.508" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Guatam Gulati" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  If I understand her correctly, she asked how we prevent trans-institutionalisation.  The most important part in preventing trans-institutionalisation is recognising the presence of a disability.  This is best done at the points of entry into a pathway.  This includes asylum seekers in the reception process, people accessing homelessness services, at the point they enter homelessness services, and, more specifically, in prisons.  Nearly one in three people in Irish prisons screen positive for an intellectual disability.  Diversion programs have been ongoing for more than a decade, but in clinical practice, there is a large number of people with intellectual disabilities.  To impact that, one has to recognise the disability and intervene at the start of the pathway, which is the arrest and custody stage or maybe even the pre-arrest stage.  It is for the garda&iacute; to recognise the presence of disability and perhaps think of a non-criminal justice response.</p><p>That is likely to impact significantly the prevalence of people with intellectual disabilities in the Irish prison system.  We conducted a study in which we brought together the views from multiple other studies of nearly 1,200 people with intellectual disabilities where they encountered police forces around the world.  It made for troubling reading in that people with intellectual disabilities say they feel confused, frightened and perplexed and have great difficulty communicating at the point when they are arrested or are in police custody.  When we repeated the same study looking at the views of nearly 1,000 police officers from multiple countries around the world, all of them said the same thing: they need more training because they need to be able to recognise the disability.  Recognising the disability at the start of a pathway is the way to prevent trans-institutionalisation.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Reading all the witnesses' contributions and listening to this engagement has been worthwhile.  I have seen issues from loads of different angles.  After last week's engagement I felt deflated, having heard about the lengthy timeline for the depopulation of congregated settings.  However, listening to practitioners, people who are directly affected and people such as today's witnesses gives me a little hope and a little knowledge as to how we move on.  Overall, why do the witnesses think we are so slow?  Where have we gone so wrong that so many among our population are seen and not heard, and how can we change that?  The committee is dedicated to implementing the UNCRPD, but how do the witnesses see our role in that regard?  What can we do on the committee to start advocating for what Professor Gulati talked about, which is people going into a prison setting and people potentially being put into an inappropriate congregated setting?  Where can we now go to engage with the Department to ensure there is a triage between being diagnosed or treated and then being pushed into an inappropriate setting?</p> <p>  I was blown away by Ms Fitzpatrick and her beautiful brother.  It was wonderful to hear such a positive story, but how do we provide that choice for everybody?  Bubo is safe and in a community, as she said, and he is happy, but, as Ms Flanagan said, there is a lack of choice and a lack of personal assistants and there is so much work to be done.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  They are to the fore of this.  I thank them all because the discussion has been engaging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#H00300"><p>I thank the Senator for acknowledging my being here for Bernard.  To answer her question as to how we can look after everyone, that is what I advocate for.  I advocate that there should be a full range of choices to suit every individual person.  I am not trying to remove rights from anyone.  I struggle with the fact that when this policy started there were 1,200 or so young people with disabilities in nursing homes who were identified in 2007 and it was said they were "outside the scope".  My brother is so happy where he is yet he was prioritised to be moved out ahead of some people who may want to go.  There should be a full range of options.  I read a thematic study on the UN convention and it said equal basis means the right to accept or reject all kinds of living situations and all kinds of care, including institutional care.  I do not consider that that is what my brother has.  The reality is that the people I am here for today - and I wish there were a way I could bring committee members down to meet them and see for themselves - have nothing in common with the majority of people with disabilities.  Of course, community living is right for the majority of people with disabilities because they have more in common with regular, ordinary - to use the policy terms - communities than they do with the people in St. Mary of the Angels, but the fact is that they exist.  In 2019, 23 people were either admitted or readmitted into congregated settings.  Some 82% of them had high or intensive support needs.  As of January 2020, 1,953 people remained in congregated settings.  That number has since increased because of admissions.  Some 76% of them have a high or intensive level of support needs.  Why are we pushing people out of these situations and into communities when it is well documented - if members listen to the radio, they will hear families say it every day - that they do not have the facilities to help them?</p> <p>  I have given a lot of time listening to everybody.  Two things keep coming up: "nothing about us without us" and paternalism.  I want to talk about how the policy has treated Bubo in this regard.  As for "nothing about us without us", the working group on congregated settings came together in 2007, the policy was published in 2011 and then launched as a strategy in 2012.  My family and Bubo did not know about the policy until September 2016.  We found out about it because my mother received a phone call from one of the managers in Bubo's home out of the clear blue sky that summer telling her that his name was on a list for a state-of-the-art house in Milltown.  We ended up having to try to dig and find out what was going on and to educate ourselves about this policy, which took us time.  "Nothing about us without us"?  Bubo's family and all the families in St. Mary of the Angels did not know about this policy, but that is not the point.  Paternalism has been talked about as well.  Bubo cannot speak for himself, unfortunately.  I wish he could.  I wish he could be here instead of me.  However, there are people in St. Mary of the Angels who can speak for themselves, who have sat in rooms with disability advocates and who have told them they want to stay where they are.  They have said, "I love my home", "This is my home" and "I do not want to move".  What is more paternalistic than a national policy that tells them, "We know what is best for you, and you will be way better off in the community"?  On what planet will Bubo be better off having the same access to services and facilities I have when he needs hydrotherapy and supports that are not available anywhere else?  He needs a team of specialists around the clock.  The people I am talking about have very high care needs.  I just wish there were a way I could get that across.</p> <p>  We need to be clear that there is a difference between a right and an obligation.  I did not see the committee meeting last week but I know that the Ombudsman said we do not know whether people in nursing homes want to be there unless we ask them.  If they want to be there, it is perfectly fine, but why is it not perfectly fine for my brother?</p> <p>  A reference was made to ten people in a single living unit.  There are 63 adults in St. Mary of the Angels.  There are 11 houses and chalets.  There are no more than ten people in any single living unit on that campus of 30 acres.  There is loads of development and loads of people who want to support it.  We have been told we cannot develop on the land because of this policy and that the land cannot be developed because everyone has to move out.  I feel there is a target on the back of St. Mary of the Angels because the policy says that to fund decongregation, these assets need to be sold off; by the way, these assets were donated to people like my brother by a local Kerry family and built from the ground up by the people of Kerry, so nobody has a right to sell them.  I am sorry.  I do not mean to be so heated, but it has been very difficult for me to sit here and listen to some of what has been said today.  How can someone claim to be an advocate and to care about social justice and then be okay with people being forced - evicted - cruelly from their homes?  I have the evidence of what has happened internationally, in Australia and America, when this same line of thought was followed.  I can send that evidence on to the committee after the meeting.  The data is there.  To correct another figure from earlier, 942 people had been moved out at the start of 2020, not 600 or whatever Deputy Cairns said.  That is not the figure.  A total of 278 have been readmitted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Marie Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#J00100"><p>I completely understand where Ms Fitzpatrick is coming from.  What is worrying is when these policy decisions were made and the hospitals were closed down, we were promised community mental health care and that buildings would be sought and there would be investment in supporting people, but that did not happen.  Through no fault of their own, people with mental health difficulties are on the streets and in our prisons.  They become the target and they are seen as the dangerous people.  There seen as people without self-worth.  The State must do better.</p> <p>  Ms Fitzpatrick is absolutely right.  It is frightening for many family members.  Where is the evidence that when we move people out of congregated settings that they will be treated equal to others?  The Disability Act 2005 has never been commenced which is a disgrace on the part of successive Governments.  The first line of the programme for Government uses health language to describe us rather than human rights language.  </p> <p>  I cannot disagree with Ms Fitzpatrick in wanting to love and to ensure that her brother has everything he deserves.  However, I do not agree that congregated settings should continue.  The State has an opportunity now, especially through this committee.  I listen as much as I can to the witnesses who have appeared publicly.  Those who appeared last week were enlightening when they challenged things like the 18 people.  No more than Ms Fitzpatrick, I was moved last week.</p> <p>  The way numbers are thrown around with mention of millions of euro and statistics is dehumanising in terms of how we are spoken about.  I completely empathise with Ms Fitzpatrick.  She did listen because we were all being asked questions.  Some of the solutions lie with getting the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act resourced and commenced immediately.  In the case of Ms Fitzpatrick's brother, he should be asked with the people around him who support him.  Ireland has been forced to move policies arising from international obligations and not because it chose to.  That is an important one.  </p> <p>  In this instance we are discussing disabled people.  It could be people in direct provision tomorrow.  It was the mother and baby homes a while ago.  When we are discussing groups of people, we need to stand back and look at all of them and the systems that are causing them.  It is easy now to have a focused conversation on disabled people, but actually we are the result of postcolonialism and of neoliberal policies under the capitalist idea of investing in someone if we believe that person can return the money to us.  However, they have not given us an example.  </p> <p>  I wish to share my own direct lived experience.  I was 38 when I had my precious son.  I waited for him.  I am an earner and I own my own home.  However, on the day Robert was born on 21 July 2011, the HSE and my service provider took nearly half my hours from me even though I had written to tell them I was having Robert.  They wrote and they said they did not have enough money to provide the minimum support needed so they were removing all what they call social hours to 200 disabled people in County Clare.  I spent my maternity leave campaigning publicly for myself and the other 199 people to ensure that they could have their hours.  Because I am articulate, because I was able to self-advocate and because my child would have been at risk, which was not fair, I got a reprieve.  However, I do not have a right to my services.</p> <p>  Ms Fitzpatrick is upset.  When I go back there, that upsets me.  I was so traumatised.  For three years I was looking back to see if there was a HSE person are or someone with the service providers.  Is that sociable hours?  Should Ann Marie be out with her baby?  Should she be at the park?  Should she be having coffee?  That is the damage this does to disabled people when we do not have our rights affirmed.</p></speech>

I commend her on the work she does.  Can we not just open our minds a bit to see that the disability umbrella is enormous and that my brother and people like him in St. Mary of the Angels are in the tiny minority?  In trying to look after what is right for the majority, is there not a danger that we are imposing something on the minority that is not right for them?</p> <p>  I know Ms Flanagan said she disagrees about having congregated settings which is fair enough; it is her opinion.  I would not be here today if so many disability advocates did not share that exact view.  However, I did my best.  I spent many hours writing that speech to try to paint a picture without pictures of what Bernard's life is like and what that place is like.  Can she honestly tell me that it is an institution or that it is inappropriate?  Does it sound inappropriate?  People with fragile health are thriving and happy there and are not relying on medication or anything.  I know somebody there who tried community living several times but it did not work for them.  Their life was saved by coming to St. Mary of the Angels.  These things can also be true.</p> <p>  I am not trying to take anything away from the majority of people with disabilities, but it appears that they are trying to take something away from us.  It is not because I am afraid of communities or all these things that have been said about me.  It is not because we are all institutionalised and do not know any better.  I know what is in the community.  I know what is in his community.  I plead with committee members to come to St. Mary of the Angels and see it with their own eyes and meet the people.  They are all behind me today.  We cannot see their families, but they are watching and counting on me in this very difficult battle for us.</p> <p>  Ms Flanagan mentioned how exhausting it is.  I can tell the committee how exhausting it has been for my family and all the families trying to fight this policy on our own.  To me it clearly violates many aspects of the UN convention, which is the topic of this meeting.  I plead with everyone to step back and try to take another look.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#J00300"><p>I thank all the witnesses.  We have had an engaging meeting with many different viewpoints put forward.  It has certainly given me considerable food for thought.  I particularly commend Ms Fitzpatrick.  She has given a very good account of representing her brother and other people like him.  She has made us think that congregated settings may not all be bad.  They need to be assessed individually.  It comes down to choice and what is best for the individual.  Different home circumstances suit different people.  That needs to be taken into account.  All individuals need to be treated with respect and given that choice.  That is what is most important.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which is important.  We had an engagement on it two weeks ago and we have been told that it will be implemented next year.  Let us hope that timeframe is kept to represent those who have difficulty communicating.  </p> <p>  Many families in my constituency have come to me.  They want their relatives to live independently in the community and have applied for social housing because they are not in a position to buy something for themselves.  They end up being accepted onto the social housing list but may be left there for up to 13 years.  When I contacted the local authority to ask why this is happening, I was told it was not getting the commitment from the HSE to provide the supports the person needs to live independently.  It cannot commit to providing the housing.  It reiterated that it had the budget to provide the housing and will do so but it needs the commitment from the HSE.  The last thing it wants, which has happened in a number of areas, is to provide the physical housing and for it to remain empty for three years because the supports have not been given to the people who need them.</p><p>That is extremely important.  Disabled people are also being forced to live with ageing parents who are not capable of caring for them, and should not have to do so.  Disabled people want their independence and dignity and to live supported within their communities, but they are not being given the opportunity to do that.  Time and again, when parents pass away the disabled person is put into a form of residential care that is not of their choice.  That is heartbreaking because parents will have spent years worrying about what would happen to their disabled son or daughter when they passed.</p><p> Last week, we had an engagement on young people in nursing homes.  The evidence shows that many of them were told that their placements were a temporary measure until proper housing could be sourced for them, but they had ended up spending years in institutions not of their choice.  Some were forced into nursing homes and told the supports were not available to allow them to live in their own homes.  That is sad.  The bottom line is choice and making the right choice for the individual concerned.  I have been also approached by people regarding family members who have been placed in a congregated setting and are very happy there, as well as having their needs met.  The UNCRPD is about recognising people's right to choice and supporting them in that choice.  </p><p> The argument I hear constantly from the HSE is that it does not have the funding to provide the supports to allow people to live independently.  Professor McConkey mentioned that it costs more to house people in a residential setting or nursing home.  I have asked often if that cost analysis has been done but I have never been given a direct answer.  I would be interested in getting a comparison on costs in that regard.</p></speech>

The first point was that housing and support need to be co-ordinated.  The lack of co-ordination has been one of the biggest flaws in the British system, with which I am most familiar.  In the North, it has also caused a lot of difficulty for us in trying to create alternative living arrangements for people.  The Departments began liaising when the importance of co-operation was pointed out to them.  One of the purposes of this joint committee is, I would think, to hold two Departments to account on this particular issue.  I understand the committee operates cross-departmentally and it has the right to do that.</p> <p>  The second point related to families seeking assurances in regard to where the future lies, which brings me back to the point I made earlier that people not wait for a crisis to occur to ensure that the services are starting to think about the longer-term arrangements for their relative.  Families can be reluctant to do that because it involves parents facing their own mortality.  Professional staff are also wary of doing it because they think that creates an obligation on them to fulfil those plans.  The family will not necessarily want the plans to be enacted straight away, but they will want some sense of the direction of travel they are going in.  That provides an opportunity for people to be creative in the solutions and steps that might be taken along the way, some of which can be low-cost steps.  </p> <p>  Deputy Tully spoke about cost effectiveness.  We need to be more open in service provider land and spell out the spend of costs for individuals in, for example, nursing home care and look at how that could be translated into personalised support hours that spend would provide for an individual.  In more general terms, I would caution that international experience shows there are risks in perpetuating congregated care, notwithstanding that are some good examples such as those outlined by Ms Fitzpatrick.  History teaches us that in congregated settings there are three risks.  First, there is a greater of abuse of people who live in congregated settings.  Second, there is a greater risk of them getting infections and, therefore, having physical illnesses as well as emotional problems and, third, which we have documented for Ireland, people in congregated settings die at an earlier age than people living in other settings such as with family carers.  Some of that might be due to the risk of infection.  In the United Kingdom, the number of Covid deaths in congregated living arrangements has been much higher than it has been in other arrangements.  </p> <p>  In terms of policymaking, we cannot ignore the risks of perpetuating a policy as well as denying people their opportunities for rights moving forward.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.519" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Marie Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070100002#K00500"><p>Most of the points raised have been covered, but I want to add that for the past 20 years we have had the national disability strategy and we are supposed to have cross-departmental co-operation.  That might happen at a higher level.  People are burnt out from the number of committees discussing the lives of disabled people.  Most of them are not disabled people and their families and that is problematic.  The block funding of organisations is causing the HSE to be strapped for cash.</p> <p>  There was reference to the disability database last week as well, as if it were going to give us the answers to the needs of disabled people.  When individuals and family members are asked if they want options that are all within the segregated institutionalisation approach, be that day services or residential care, people might think that is what their relative needs but because there are those of us who are able to articulate for ourselves that is a whole different arena even though that, too, is difficult.  For people who need support to communicate and to envisage their best life offering them all forms of institutional segregated care is not offering them options.  Who in Ireland has ever turned to a 23-year-old man with an intellectual disability and asked him if he would like an independent living support package or what are his dreams and ambitions?  We use reductionist language by being realistic, and by smirking almost at the idea that somebody wants to get married, to have his or her own home and children.  We look at risk and at minimising the choice of the person.  We opt to provide disabled people with a particular type of support with the intention of looking at independent living in the future.  The first option is to put them into residential care.  We are now changing the language and using words such as "community".  I am worried about the language that is being used around community settings.  If a person is living in a situation with two, five or more people that he or she has not signed a tenancy with, that person is not in control of paying the bills, his or her supports or recruiting who helps him or her.  </p> <p>  I recently spoke with a person who works as a support worker in a disability organisation that supports people with intellectual disabilities in community homes.  Support workers are moving from house to house on a shift basis.  Let us think of the psychology for the workers.  They do two to three shifts per week in one home and they then move to do the same in another home.  They are working with people with severe intellectual disabilities and behavioural problems who are non-verbal.  Their needs as employees have to be met as well.  We are not building the supports around the individual in respect of his or her will and preference and what he or she likes to do and needs.  We are educating unqualified people to manage medication so that if an individual's behaviour goes beyond what is appropriate and safe for the staff, he or she can be sedated.  Where are the human rights with regard to disabled people in that respect?  I agree that there is plenty of international evidence that certain approaches in congregated settings lead to abuse.</p><p>Even in Ireland, in the 1990s we raised the issue of protection in legislation that restricted the rights of disabled people to have intimacy.  We know this came from worried families whose relatives were being sexually abused in congregated settings.  Let us protect them.  I do not know how prevalent it is now but we know that young girls have been forced to control their reproductive rights in case they get pregnant if they are abused.  This is the depth of the risk of abuse that is happening when we do not look at the human being and see they have feelings equal to the rest of us.  This is the part that has led to the level of institutionalisation and the normalising of it.</p><p> I am not in any way referring to the wonderful experience Ms Fitzpatrick's brother and others are happening.  I am speaking about the majority of people who have been institutionalised for years, whether it is disabled people or others.  We dehumanise them.  We separate them.  We need to look at the consequences for the general population.  One thing is to make sure proper services are provided for disabled people.  I also want Margaret, John and Frank who have an intellectual disability to be able to go into a shop and be spoken to.  I want them to be able to go to Citizens Information Centres and get information.</p><p> I work with many families.  A 23-year-old son in a family might have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He might be three years into a degree but has had to take a break.  Because of societal ableism and the idea that people with mental health issue or disabilities are "less than", many family members think such people have to be cared for for the rest of their lives and will never have a quality of life whereby they can function and be supported.  The starting point with a son or daughter with mental health issues is to ask what they can do to care for them.  We know this manifests in control and almost doing too much for the person.  I work to support families to help them understand this stigma and understand they have to stand back and support their relative to have their rights and supports separate to family members.</p><p> The other point disabled people make the whole time is, dare I say it, that care is weaponised again them.  Family members who want to have their needs and rights protected often use this against disabled people to keep them within the family and cared for.  When we use language such as "caring for" people straight away we think that mother, father, brother or sister must know what they are talking about.  No one ever goes to that family to ask how to help all of them to have autonomy and equality to the degree it is possible for them.</p><p> I spent a few days with relatives with whom I have a very loving relationship.  My 23-year-old cousin has a significant intellectual disability.  He communicates differently.  He does not use words.  He is non-verbal.  My goodness is he well able to communicate what his needs are.  He has a significant intellectual disability.  What was really fascinating in the beautiful relationship I have with his parents is during our conversations it never dawned on them that he should have his own personal supports.  They never thought they could go on holiday together when he would have someone to help him, rather than the idea of always going into residential respite.  Of course he will go for that because it is the option available but we do not look at families and see how they can be together and how a person with significant impairment, including intellectual disability, can have support in his or her own right.  That person can be treated equally to his or her brothers and sisters.</p></speech>

I am the same as everyone here.  The collective Irish psyche is damaged from years of institutional abuse.  It is horrific.  As I said at the beginning, my brother has never lived in an institution.  It is very wrong that this is happening to his home and community and to the model of care that is so appropriate for some who do need care.  Like it or not, they cannot feed themselves or do anything for themselves.  This is the reality.  There has also been desperate abuse.  We all heard about the Grace case.  When we first found out about the policy I asked what would those families do who for one reason or another could not keep their children at home when all of the congregated settings were closed.  I asked where would those children go.  The answer was into the foster system.  If everybody is comfortable with that great but I am definitely not.</p> <p>  Abuse can happen anywhere.  If people go to the St. Mary of the Angels website and look at the international page they can see the litany of failures in the group home community living model in the United States and Australia and what happened to people when they were moved out.  I commend Ms Flanagan.  She is an amazing advocate for the majority of people with disabilities.  Sometimes I feel like this policy thinks people like my brother will go extinct.  They will not.  There is no proper advocacy in Ireland for people such as my brother.  We are trying.  I am not an activist.  I am doing my best to fight for these people because nobody else who should be, and who is funded by the State to do so, appears to be doing so.  I really hope the committee takes stock of what I have said.  I plead with it to do so.</p> <p>  With regard to support, the people in St. Mary of the Angels are supported to enjoy the community.  They are always out and about.  A few months ago, my father and I presented to the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte, and representatives of the HSE.  I thought it was so funny afterwards when my mother told me that while my father and I were totally stressed trying to present at yet another meeting, Bernard was in Muckross House and Gardens having tea and cake.  I am delighted he was.  I am delighted Bernard does not know, and I hope to God he does not know, that this is going on, that people have decided he is not living in the right kind of community and has no business being there and that he would be better away from all of the essential services he has had for 40 years, as if that has actually cost lives.  Professor McConkey said there is evidence that people do not live as long.  I read in the HSE progress report on the time to move on policy that people in congregated settings live equally as long as their counterparts in the community.</p></speech>

It is not just about housing.  It is not enough just to provide housing.  For real meaningful inclusion there needs to be support with employment, location, and physical and mental healthcare.  The Deputy also spoke about the right to choice.  It is important to echo what Ms Fitzpatrick also said.  Something I come across weekly is someone with a disability leaving prison.  Everyone, including the people themselves, do their best to psych up to this important point in their lives when they leave prison.  Two or three weeks later, they have returned to prison.  When we ask what happened we find that in reality their choices are restricted.  They say their choice was to sleep outside where it is really cold or to break a window and come back to prison where at least they get a roof over their heads and three meals.  In reality the choices are restricted.  This is all I have to say.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Tully for chairing the earlier part of the meeting.  I really appreciate it.  I thank the witnesses who came before us for an extremely thought-provoking discussion.  We have listened to the language of decongregation and institutionalisation.  We have also listened very carefully to Lynn Fitzpatrick's very personal testimony.  At every stage in our history if we had had that type of challenge to our thinking, and to the policies being prescribed over the years, we may have been in a better place with regard to providing for people with disabilities.  Everybody has a different story to tell.  This is clear from the evidence we have heard today.  The great phrase of throwing the baby out with the bath water has to be thought of at all times in how we try to influence policy as a committee.  We have heard very powerful personal testimony and it took fierce courage to put it out there in the public domain with regard to Ms Fitzpatrick's brother and family.</p><p>I know there is excellent care in St. Mary of the Angels.  I do not live too far from it and it is well-renowned throughout the area.  We must challenge what has happened in institutions and to try to find what is right.  We are charged with overseeing the implementation of the UNCRPD and to try to make sure that disabilities are to the fore.  It is safe to say that the members of this committee, in the nine or ten months of its existence, have left their political colours outside and worked together to try to ensure we are doing the right thing for people with disabilities. </p><p> Today's discussion has been extremely thought-provoking and we will be reflecting carefully on it.  I thank everyone involved, including the advocates, those who have given personal testimonies and the professors, for their honesty and forthrightness in putting information before us.  We have no doubt but that we will be coming back to them for further information.  I encourage them to keep up the good work they are doing in each of their spheres.  We look forward to working with them.  I also thank the committee members and our team for today's meeting.</p></speech>

This follows on from engagement with the representatives of the Ballymurphy families.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister.</p> <p>  Although the Minister is well acquainted with it, I must read a note about privilege.  The evidence of witnesses physically present from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings that a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given.  They should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I look forward to the questions and comments of members in a few minutes' time.  I wish to make a brief opening statement to set a context around our discussion and then I will take questions.  Thank you for the invitation to meet with the committee today, a Chathaoirligh.</p> <p>  I was honoured to meet with the Ballymurphy families on several occasions in recent years, as the Government worked with them to support their long campaign for truth and justice.  The coroner's verdict last month was a moment of complete vindication for their loved ones and a testament to their own determination and unyielding pursuit of justice.  When I met them in their own area, it was a very emotional meeting, so I can understand the outpouring of relief and emotion of so many of the families when the verdict was delivered.  It was important that the significance of the verdict was marked by statements in the D&aacute;il, and I was pleased to learn that the committee met with the families at the end of May.</p> <p>  When dealing with the legacy of the Troubles, it is unfortunately all too rare that we see such moments of progress.  It was, therefore, very heartening to hear John Teggart say when he met with the committee that he was "overjoyed at the verdict" of the inquest.  It is not language we hear often from representatives of victims or victims' groups in Northern Ireland.  As John said, "every victim should have a right to pursue justice", and that is a view the Government has consistently taken.  I know many members of this committee take the same view.</p> <p>  Every family bereaved as a result of the Troubles should have access to effective investigation and to a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Government is committed to helping all of those who seek truth and justice on behalf of loved ones lost during the Troubles, to find it.</p> <p>  The Stormont House Agreement was reached between the two Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland, with the exception of the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP,  in 2014 after a long and intense period of negotiation.  It set out a path forward &ndash; a balanced framework that encompassed the core principles of truth, justice and reconciliation.  Recent reports of plans by the UK Government to introduce a statute of limitations have caused significant upset, shock and concern among many families, including the Ballymurphy families.</p><p> We know the Stormont House Agreement is not perfect.  I am not sure that there can be a perfect solution to such a complicated sensitive and historical problem but it gives us a framework and an agreed path forward.  Where are there are concerns about any aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, they need to be addressed as part of a collective process, one that has at its heart the voices of those most impacted by the process.  When I discussed the matter with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, last week during the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, I made this position clear to him while also making clear, as we have always done, that the Government is ready to discuss any concerns on the Stormont House Agreement and will try to find workable solutions.</p><p> The views of victims and survivors must be central to any new discussions.  It is also essential that a comprehensive framework to address legacy complies fully with the European Convention on Human Rights.  Both Governments agreed at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week that there is a need for a process of intensive engagement with the Northern Ireland parties and others, especially victims' groups, on legacy issues.  I look forward to this engagement beginning immediately.  The first meeting will take place after this meeting.  Representatives from various parties and the two Governments will meet to start that process.  It will move at a later stage to party leader discussions with the UK Secretary of State and me.  All parties have been asked to nominate representatives to take part in these initial discussions.  The talks will have the objective to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in the UK and Ireland by the end of this autumn, but there will be no predetermined outcomes to this process.  It is important to emphasise that point.</p><p> It is vital that we make progress.  It is vital for victims, families and society as a whole as we seek to build deeper reconciliation, trust and lasting peace.  I know of the frustrations that many families of victims have expressed to me on the lack of progress in this area in recent years despite the coming into being of the Stormont House Agreement in 2014.  There will be no approach to addressing the painful legacy of our past that is without complexity or difficulty or that does not bring with it additional challenges.  We know that we may not find complete consensus across the spectrum of parties, stakeholders and victims' representatives.  Yet, we have an obligation to try.  It is crucial to have a collective approach that works in both jurisdictions and that is in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.  We have that in the Stormont House Agreement.  We need to have such a collective approach to its implementation or to any changes we may agree to make together.</p><p> The Ballymurphy inquest showed that breakthroughs are still possible and that important truths are still recoverable.  Important outcomes for families are still achievable, even 50 years later.  We need a system in place that maximises the chances of those things for all families and that supports true reconciliation in Northern Ireland.  However, it needs to be a workable and deliverable process and it needs collective backing from the two Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland for that.  That is what we are seeking to achieve in these current discussions.  No one is going into this process naively.  There is certainly scepticism among parties in Northern Ireland on whether we will be able to find agreement.  From the perspective of the Government we are going into the process with an open mind.  We are going into the process with a clear view on the need to agree outcomes that can maximise the opportunity for establishing the truth and achieving justice for families when and where there are files of evidence to be able to do that in court.  I encourage all parties to be active, to be part of this process and to try to find a way forward with us that ultimately can allow us to progress an approach on legacy.</p><p> The starting point of this discussion is the Stormont House Agreement.  We believe the Stormont House Agreement is still the best way to do this, but of course we are not the only voice in this discussion by a long shot.  We know the British Government wants to pursue a different approach.  We have to listen with an open mind but ensure no impression is given that there is a pre-determined outcome to these discussions.  Instead, we will approach the discussions with an open mind, but we expect the British Government to do so too and to take on board the concerns, anxieties, ambitions and frustrations of so many victims and their families and so many politicians who have been working on their behalf for many years and, in some cases, for decades.</p><p> That is where matters stand.  I look forward to the questions and comments from committee members on the approach we are taking.</p></speech>

Senator Currie is here but I cannot see everyone.  My apologies for that.  I am not sure whether Senator McGahon is there.  If he is not, there is no problem.  Each party will have 15 minutes to ask questions and hear the answers.</p> <p>  I wish to congratulate the shared island unit, Government representatives and civil servants involved in getting the Narrow Water bridge project to the stage it is now at.  The project is really important and is a sign of peace and reconciliation.  The funding to ensure that this important project materialises will greatly benefit peace and progress North and South, especially in my constituency of Louth and in County Down.  It will be most beneficial.  It is a sign of the good things that can happen if we can reach appropriate and proper accommodation on the island, North and South.  I call Senator Currie.</p></speech>

It is really good to have him before the committee today.  The timing of this is good.  Obviously, there has been some movement following the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week.  Yesterday, there was an update on the multiparty talks.</p> <p>  The Minister is right about scepticism.  We are embarking on a process of engagement.  We had engagement before that resulted in the Stormont House Agreement.  The principles of the Stormont House Agreement, as well as the framework, really matter.  This meeting has followed from the Ballymurphy inquest results and findings.  It is important that we reflect on what they communicated to us and what we felt when they spoke to us.  It remains clear to me that we need effective investigations but we also need a process of justice.  In terms of the engagement we have had, we need access to truth and justice.  We have been dealing in a vacuum by not having a framework to deal with legacy.  It is good that the engagement is taking place but my question is about who will be doing the listening.  We have been consistently clear about what matters and the fact that this issue has to be dealt with and cannot be swept under the carpet.</p><p>Does the Minister think there is an appetite for listening on all sides?</p><p> I will highlight some of the things that were said by the Ballymurphy families when they spoke to us.  They told us they were the lucky ones because they actually had an inquest.  They told us people cannot move on without accountability and justice.  They spoke about the importance of inquests that comply with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  They said a precedent had been set that families are no longer outside the legal system, looking in, looking for accountability and access to justice.  They were given that opportunity.  There is much emotion behind this.  I am trying to convey that things have moved on in terms of the engagement that is under way but we cannot forget the trauma behind all of this and the injustice that has been felt because of the lies that were told.  The British Government is not an impartial observer, it is an actor.  That came across at the time of the findings.</p><p> The Minister is saying he will go into this process with an open mind.  I feel that the Irish Government has always been true to the principles of the Stormont House Agreement and the rule of law, and recognises the importance of reconciliation and human rights compliance.  Does the Minister believe that everybody will be listening to each other and not coming in with preconceived ideas of what truth and justice are?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021070100002#C00200"><p>The Senator has outlined many of the concerns I have.  It will not surprise people that she and I have a very similar view on this issue.  I will comment on a number of matters.  There was a fear among many people that the British Government could act unilaterally to pass legislation in Westminster.  We know there is a lot of pressure in Westminster to do that, to be honest, in the context of commitments that have previously been made to veterans' associations and so on.  There was a real fear among victims, representative groups and political parties that the British Government may decide to legislate and introduce what many would regard as an amnesty or statute of limitations.  Even though nothing has been formally published in that regard, many of the debates in Westminster leave us in no doubt that there is pressure on the British Government in that area.</p> <p>  I have been speaking to the Secretary of State, as you would expect, on this issue.  The relationship is good on this issue.  I have made it clear that the position of the Irish Government is that we support the Stormont House Agreement, which we think is, on balance, the best way forward.  As people know, the Stormont House Agreement effectively sets up four structures.  It establishes a historical investigations unit to take forward investigations that are outstanding and uses the court system to do that.  It sets up an independent commission for information recovery where people can come and tell their stories outside of a court setting in an attempt to establish the truth.  The agreement establishes an oral history archive which offers an opportunity to share experiences and narratives relating to the Troubles in terms of trying to create a context around what happened, how and why, even though it is extraordinarily painful.  Many people have very different versions of that history, including some people in this meeting.  The agreement also focuses on an implementation and reconciliation group to oversee the process and report on the themes, drawing from the work of other bodies and so on.  That is a structured approach that deals with truth recovery, the pursuit of justice in court and tries to build a historical context that can take account of the very different perspectives on history and, of course, a structured focus on ensuring that leads to a process of reconciliation.  That is quite a compelling series of structures.  It is far from perfect but, as I said, there is no perfect structure.  We know that from studying other peace processes around the world, the aftermath of conflict and so on.</p> <p>  What I think the British Government has a concern about is the capacity to bring cases to court when crimes may have been committed a long time ago.  There are other issues around the debates that have been taking place in Westminster about people who served in Northern Ireland and so on.  We have made it clear that we believe the pursuit of justice is the right of families of victims.  We also believe in compliance with Article 2.  That article requires independent, effective investigations capable of leading to identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible.  That is the relevant language.  If we are all serious about trying to take forward a process that can work for families, we must take into account the fact that the British Government believes that there are other ways of delivering on commitments on legacy.  The Irish Government is somewhat sceptical of that but we recognise that if the British Government has a different perspective, we have to listen to it and then involve all political parties and other stakeholders, particularly families and victim groups, in that discussion.  We are committed to doing that.</p> <p>  The alternative to having that discussion is stagnation, which is, effectively, what we have had.  Some people will say that the Stormont House Agreement is not working because nothing is happening.  I do not accept that description.  The agreement is not working because the people who committed to introducing legislation and funding consistent with the agreement have not done it.  Of course it is not going to work if legislation to set up the structures and institutions is not passed.  Nevertheless, we are and have been in a period of stagnation, lack of progress and endless consultation, if you like, around these issues without getting to the nub of what families want from the process, which is truth, in some cases.  Some families do not want to pursue court cases while others do.  This is about trying to accommodate the search for truth and justice, and the contribution that search can make to a process of reconciliation which we all know will take a long time but is something we need to be pursuing.</p> <p>  That is our approach.  We also have legal considerations in the context of the Irish Constitution.  The British Government does not have a written constitution to abide by; we do.  There are certain things that may be complicating factors in terms of legal advice from the Attorney General that we will need to study.  There is also the Article 2 compliance issue.  Those are, in some ways, pressures around the parameters within which we can negotiate and discuss these issues.  The most important element here is that we cannot progress legacy on a unilateral basis.  This cannot be resolved in Westminster or Dublin.  It would be fantastic if it could be resolved in Belfast or anywhere else in Northern Ireland on its own, but it probably cannot be.  This is going to involve both Governments trusting each other, working together, having an open mind in terms of finding a way forward and having no preconceived outcomes with a view to then going through a kind of sham process that ticks boxes in terms of consultation.</p><p>To be fair, I do not believe we are in that space.  My conversations with the Secretary of State on this have been blunt and, at times, difficult, but we have now agreed on a way forward based on being inclusive and on trying to find a way forward.  The starting point is the Stormont House Agreement because that is the last agreed position.  If we are to move away from elements of that agreement, there must be good reason for doing so.  However, it has to be victim centred.  That is how we are approaching these talks.  I appeal to the parties to help us on that, and not to see this in any way as a party political issue.  Hopefully, we will be able to find some consensus on the key pillars that are needed to move this forward.</p><p> We would happily move forward on the basis of the Stormont House Agreement, but that is not the space we are in at present.  We have to listen, discuss and see if we can find consensus as a basis for a way forward.  We owe that to the thousands of families concerned.  I say that as somebody who comes from Cork.  I know I am on a video call here with people who have experienced, in a very personal way, the trauma and violence of the Troubles, so my job is to try to be a facilitator and actor in this who can help shape a way forward that everybody can buy into and, most importantly, that can be implemented quickly.  One of the lessons from the Stormont House Agreement is that if one agrees something in 2014 and one still has not implemented it in 2021, it is no wonder that victims' groups become sceptical, frustrated and angry.  In some cases, they are traumatised again when they read in the newspaper that we are moving away from that commitment again.</p><p> That is where we are.  As I said, I strongly encourage parties to work with us to try to find a way forward for the sake of the victims in particular.</p></speech>

John Finucane will come in directly after me.  As the MP for Belfast West, I thank the Minister.  I know he has been meeting with the families.  I was at the meeting he had with the families in Ballymurphy and when he walked the sites where some of the loved ones were killed.  It was a very emotional day, and the Minister mentioned that.  Every time the families have a meeting with anyone and tell their stories, it is obviously very emotional for them.  We owe it to them to do whatever we can to make sure they get what they need.  It took 50 years for the families to get to the truth.  It was a momentous day when Mrs. Justice Keegan made her verdict known.  I met the families directly after it and I could see in their faces a sense of relief that they had achieved the truth.  Within hours, however, there was sadness for them because of the actions of the British Government and how it handled the matter.  What it did was quite poor on its part.  The families were very disappointed with that.</p> <p>  I have spoken to the families since then.  One of their biggest concerns, if not the biggest, is that the Stormont House Agreement will not be implemented.  A number of weeks ago, when Mrs. Justice Keegan gave her verdict, there was a sense of pride among the families, but that could be dashed.  We must do whatever we can, including the Irish Government, to make sure the Stormont House Agreement is implemented in its entirety.  We all must work towards that.  My question for the Minister and others is: how do we ensure that the families are not disappointed again by the actions or lack of actions of others?</p> <p>  Eleven months after the Ballymurphy massacre, the Springhill-Westrock massacre occurred.  I have met those families as well recently.  I put a proposal to the committee that the members go to Ballymurphy to meet with the families again, and also meet with the Springhill massacre families.  As the MP for west Belfast, I am putting that proposal to the Minister as well.  I hope he can come up and meet the Ballymurphy families again and, when doing that, I hope he will also meet with the families of the victims of the Springhill-Westrock massacre in the heart of my constituency.  That is an offer for the Minister and I hope he will agree to take it up.  I believe it would be very important to both the Ballymurphy families and the Springhill-Westrock families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finucane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021070100002#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for attending the meeting.  I echo the comments of my colleague, Paul Maskey.  It is important to note what the Minister described as rare moments of progress in the legacy context.  It is my strongly held personal view that it simply would not be possible without the strong support and involvement of the Irish Government throughout the process and in the journey undertaken by the families.</p> <p>  I have been contacted within the past week.  My constituency of Belfast North probably has the unenviable title of being the most impacted, geographically, by the Troubles.  Among the many families who have contacted me in the past week are the families who have recently achieved a new inquest.  They are known as the New Lodge Six.  Six people in the New Lodge area were murdered in 1973.  Like so many families, those families have been on a generational campaign for truth and justice since that time.  It is important that we recognise not just that it is important to them to tell their stories but also the importance, and to be fair to the Minister he touched on this, of the need to have official recognition and vindication of the campaign they have been on.  We saw a stark example of that with the Ballymurphy families and the findings of the inquest.</p> <p>  It is also important that the families have the ability and the option to benefit from the criminal justice system or any judicial process which is naturally open to them as a result of information coming to light.  The focus of my questions arises from the joint communique from the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week.  There is a process of consultation, which begins today, and my party is engaging in that.  However, there is a concern that this is going to be an example of yet another political agreement, this time in the legacy context and being like the Stormont House Agreement, that is not going to be implemented.  There is a real concern, certainly among my constituents, that what we are seeing is a cynical attempt by the British Government to evade its legacy responsibilities.</p> <p>  I have three questions for the Minister.  First, if he can answer, why does he feel the British Government pulled back from what it had signposted it was intending to do in July, namely, to introduce legislation?  My second question follows up on comments the Minister made to RT&Eacute; this day last week and, with respect, what he said again today.  It is a contradictory position whereby the Irish Government will say there is a commitment to the Stormont House Agreement and to no amnesty, yet it is approaching this period of consultation with an open mind and with no red lines, saying that it is an evolution of the Stormont House Agreement and that it is a starting point but will not necessarily be an end point.  That causes huge concern for constituents in north Belfast and for those I speak to in the wider victim sector.  My last point, which I am keen that the Minister address if he has time, is that the issue of reconciliation is very important for this society.  For me, legacy is arguably the single biggest barrier to reconciliation.  If we see a political agreement not being implemented, how does the Minister see that impacting on being serious, as a society, in dealing with reconciliation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021070100002#D00500"><p>First, I would be very happy to meet the Ballymurphy families again.  In fact, I enjoy that interaction.  I recall the last time we met.</p><p>There was such a sense of injustice and frustration among them in the context of their pursuit of justice.  If we met again now, we could talk in a very different context.  That is something I would really like to do.  If there are others who Mr. Maskey believes it would be helpful for me to meet and hear their stories in the context of the legacy work we are trying to do, I would be very happy to do so, whether that is the Springhill group or any others.  I am not a Minister who hides himself away.  I am happy to meet and hear people's stories.  In fact, I would very much welcome that.</p><p> Mr. Finucane made some comments and asked three questions.  Why do I feel the British Government pulled back?  I would like to think we had some part to play and also that the British Government weighed up the consequences of legislating in a way that may have resulted in a political outcome in Westminster but could have caused huge tensions in Northern Ireland.  I hope it reflected on why it should not legislate unilaterally to get something done and out of the way before the summer break in a way that would have very negative and significant fallout in Northern Ireland among political parties and victims' groups in particular.  To be honest, that just was not part of the deal.  The point of the Stormont House Agreement and the public consultation process around taking the legacy forward was about listening.  It was also about trying to accommodate people's different perspectives to find consensus and trying to move forward on the basis of that consensus, while legislating unilaterally under pressure from people who are focused, perhaps, on the politics of veterans as opposed to the politics of Northern Ireland.  It would have been very problematic.</p><p> I was very blunt and direct, both privately and publicly, about my concerns on that issue.  To his credit, Brandon Lewis listened to that and we are now pursuing a different path.  This does not mean that the outcome will be the same, however.  I want to emphasise that point.  Just because we have agreed to a consultation does not mean we have agreed to the approach it seems the British Government would like to take.  We have not agreed, and I have been very clear about that.  We believe there needs to be a route to legal justice in terms of people taking cases to court when there is still a chance and a desire to do so.  Others do not necessarily agree with that opinion and this is what we must now discuss.</p><p> I will take Mr. Finucane's other two questions around the commitment of the Irish Government.  He asked whether we are for the Stormont House Agreement.  If we take that approach, this process will go nowhere.  At the moment, the British Government's position is that it is not going to implement the Stormont House Agreement because it believes that there is another approach it should take.  If we simply take a stubborn position that we believe the Stormont House Agreement is the only way forward and say "That was agreed and you must implement it", then I believe this process will stagnate and families will have to continue to wait.  We have agreed to a process.  This has resulted in the avoidance of unilateral action and the introduction of legislation at Westminster, which is a good outcome.</p><p> I have made it very clear that our approach to this process of discussion and dialogue is that we believe the Stormont House Agreement can work.  We would like to have it implemented.  If Mr. Finucane believes changes should be made to the agreement, then he has an opportunity to explain why and see if he can build consensus around that.  That is what is driving this.  The Irish Government has not looked for this process.  We have been asked if we will be part of it and I believe that it is the best way of trying to find a way forward on legacy issues.  Otherwise, if everybody just holds their position and nothing happens, we will be here this time next year having the same conversation.</p><p> Am I committed to the Stormont House Agreement?  Yes, I am.  Would I like it to be implemented?  Yes, I would like it to have been implemented years ago in terms of the structures being set up and funded.  Do I recognise that at the moment there is a lack of commitment to the Stormont House Agreement and that, as a result, it is unlikely to progress?  Yes.  That is the reality.  We have to meet, therefore, to try to find a way forward.  That is what I meant when I said that this is a discussion on an evolution of the Stormont House Agreement.  We are happy with the agreement.  We believe it is about as balanced as we can be.  Others are not.  They are an important part of the picture and they happen to be members of a Government that needs to legislate in order to move the legacy process forward.</p><p> As I said, we will approach these discussions with an open mind but also with a pretty strong view as to what the outcome should look like.  We have quite a lot of conviction in that regard.  I hope the conversations we have had with different political parties on this call will have reinforced that with our teams.</p><p> We can focus here on trying to isolate and call people out for not following through on political commitments that were made in the past, which I have done.  I do it in the context of the protocol and I have done it with regard to Brexit, the New Decade, New Approach agreement and so on.  My job, however, is to try to find a way forward with everyone present in respect of the most sensitive issue in politics on this island, which is how we deal with the legacy of the past and how we can move forward on a journey of reconciliation.  That is where we are.</p><p> To reassure the committee, when I talk about an evolution of Stormont House, I am not talking about an amnesty or doing away with an opportunity for families to pursue justice.  As I was speaking about Article 2 compliance earlier, one of our team handed me a note in which it is correctly stated that in developing jurisprudence, the European Court of Human Rights is tending, very clearly, against amnesties.  We also see the same in UN policy in terms of post-conflict peace processes and so on.  In general, the recommendation is to move away from amnesties to try to ensure that truth and justice are part of reconciliation and recovery.  That is the perspective we come from as well.</p><p> As already stated, if I wanted to make this political, I could do so.  I could be critical and I could grandstand.  We have decided not to do that.  We have decided to engage with all the parties, let all of those involved have their say and then try to find a way forward based on the closest outcome to consensus that we can create.  I suspect those discussions will be difficult-----</p></speech>

Senator McGreehan is in the Leinster House complex and will also be contributing.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's continued engagement with this committee and his remarks this morning.  In the engagement we had with the Ballymurphy families, there was such a palpable sense of relief when the coroner's verdict was announced and the outcome of that inquest showed very clearly that ten entirely innocent people were shot dead in that massacre.  These issues need to be addressed with the utmost urgency and I fully appreciate that it is not straightforward, unfortunately.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that every family must have access to truth and justice.  So many families across this island have been denied truth and justice.  I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that a number of legacy issues, including in the context of atrocities committed in my constituency and elsewhere, we raised during his recent bilateral meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson.</p><p>I also welcome the Minister's confirmation that these issues were also discussed at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  Importantly, the Minister stated that victims and survivors are central to all these discussions and that intense engagement is needed if we are to achieve true reconciliation.</p><p> The Minister will have heard me on many occasions, including at committee meetings, on Question Time and during debates in the D&aacute;il, talking about some of the atrocities that impacted on my immediate home area almost half a century ago.  I am referring to the bombing in Belturbet in December 1972 and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in May 1974.  Unfortunately, no one was brought to justice for any of those heinous crimes.  As the Minister knows, on three occasions, in 2008, 2011 and 2016, the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas unanimously passed well-crafted motions.  They were crafted responsibly.  We called on the British Government to give access to all papers and files pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to an independent eminent international legal person.  Over the course of the last D&aacute;il a support group was formed in the Oireachtas for the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The group included the former Deputy, Maureen O'Sullivan, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe and me.  We have had considerable contact with the Department and appreciate the access we have had in the context of those atrocities.  The Department kept us updated on what was not happening in respect of the unanimous requests from the Oireachtas.  Will the Minister provide an update on the position?  Have the British indicated in any way that they will respond to the motions that were passed unanimously by our sovereign Parliament?  We know of the Glenanne gang.  There is plenty of evidence from state papers in Britain relating to these atrocities.  Recently, I put on the record of the D&aacute;il information that had come to me from the University of Nottingham regarding collusion in Northern Ireland in respect of the bombing at Belturbet in December 1972.  There is irrefutable evidence.</p><p> We all know about the age cohort of many siblings and parents of people who were victims of those atrocities.  They are concerned that everyone is getting older.  The truth has not been established.  I have campaigned with many of the families in my constituency to try to get the truth and to get their voices listened to.  The Minister rightly stated that families cannot continue to wait.  Unfortunately, they have waited for decades and there is no sign of the truth.  The British Government, if it is serious about having the Border instalment of the Stormont House Agreement, could show good intent by giving some indication on the request of our Parliament for access to all the papers pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to be given to an independent international legal person.  The Minister might provide an update on that.</p><p> There is one other matter.  In recent days, members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly had an engagement with the British ambassador.  One of the points that I and others raised relates to the need to try to keep families updated on what is happening or not happening.  In many instances, families, survivors and people who have lost loved ones were not contacted enough by statutory agencies or Departments.  If this process is to be intensified and if we are to make much-needed progress, then the families have to be continually updated on what efforts the Government, Departments and statutory agencies are making to try to get the truth and to try to get justice for these families.  The issue needs to be treated with the utmost urgency.</p></speech>

We are talking about legacy issues.  The term "legacy" is a simple description for intergenerational trauma and heartbreak.  It is a simple term for what is complex and devastating trauma.  What can the Government, on behalf of the country, do to encourage both communities to work together to solve the legacy issues?  How can we avoid sidelining justice in any way whatsoever while bringing in both communities or those on both sides?  How can we work to encourage the British Government to stand up to its agreements?  Legacy issues are equal on both sides.  I do not imagine any of us will move on until the questions Deputy Brendan Smith has highlighted are addressed.  Is there a role for the shared island unit in bringing people together to work on a conversation to get to the next point?</p></speech>

I am keen to address them.  The first issue was in respect to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Seamus Ludlow.  As people know, last month marked the 47th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, in which 33 were killed and hundreds seriously injured.  These attacks saw the largest loss of life of any day of the Troubles, as everyone knows.  The Government reaffirmed its commitment in the programme for Government to seek access for an independent international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow and related cases in line with the three all-party D&aacute;il motions to which Deputy Brendan Smith referred.  The Government has a long-standing request made to the British Government in this respect.  The absence of response is of concern and has been the topic of discussion on several occasions between me and various counterparts in the British Government in recent years.</p> <p>  At the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week, I raised the concerns and requests of repeated Oireachtas motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and related cases, including that of Seamus Ludlow, and the absence of a response from the British Government.  The Secretary of State agreed to come back to us with a formal response to the case.  We will continue to wait to see what happens there.</p> <p>  For what it is worth, our officials have regular contact with the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and will continue to do so.  We know the families were encouraged by Jon Boutcher's team looking at their case.  The families want that route to be pursued further.</p> <p>  The Belturbet bombing was raised by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Heather Humphreys, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference last week.  At the meeting the Minister for Justice raised the need for progress on the bombings and asked the UK Government to secure movement on these cases.  Again, the Secretary of State agreed to come back to the Government on this issue.</p> <p>  I wish to reassure committee members that we raise these cases all the time in formal formats like the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and, separately and privately, when we are discussing other issues.  We will keep raising these issues because they are very much part of the broader legacy cases.  We will raise the Finucane case as well and I imagine committee members will be interested in that and in the need to get clarity from the British Government on a full investigation.</p> <p>  The point made by Deputy Brendan Smith was that if the British Government is serious about trying to find a way forward on legacy issues and building trust and faith on both sides of the Border in that process, then there are things it can do in respect of individual cases.</p><p>The Irish Government also needs to be convincing in how it is co-operating with investigations, inquests and cases relating to many families, predominantly within the unionist community, whether those relate to Kingsmill or anywhere else for that matter.  We need to look at ourselves in the mirror as well as ask the hard questions and make sure we are contributing to establishing the truth and achieving justice.  We need to ask if the Irish Government can do more.  From my perspective as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I want to facilitate processes that can establish the truth for everybody.  We know there are accusations that are still current.  The Irish Government has contributed to hiding information that may be there and is not being provided to inquests and so on.  I would like to hear from anyone who has any evidence to suggest that the Irish Government is withholding information on any case.  I will act on any such information.  I have given that assurance to families linked to Kingsmill and others.  We need to continue to be convincing and reassuring in that space.  We also need to be demanding of the British Government in terms of it playing its part for many of the other atrocities that it can help to contribute to establishing the truth of.</p><p> Senator McGreehan asked how we can encourage the UK Government to be a partner in this.  We are now buying into this process.  There are many reasons to be sceptical and to believe that we are not going to make the progress we would like to.  However, we all have an obligation to try to be as positive as possible and buy into this process to see can we find a way forward that can be accepted by the two Governments, the parties and the vast majority of victims' families.  That is ultimately what this process is about.  If we cannot do that, the outcome will not be good.  It will, in fact, be worse because we would be back to square one.  In that scenario, we make the case for the Stormont House Agreement, it does not get implemented because others do not agree, and families are asked to wait until some political or legal mechanism can allow cases to be taken forward individually on the basis of inquests, an investigation by the PSNI, or whatever.  We have an obligation to be more proactive and to try to find a way forward that both the British and Irish Governments can legislate for and that the parties in Northern Ireland can buy into.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Farry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021070100002#G00200"><p>I beg the indulgence of the Chairman because I want to refer to what was agreed yesterday between the UK Government and the European Commission around a number of flexibilities relating to the protocol.  I thank the Minister for his good offices.  I am sure the Irish Government had something to do with the progress that has been made on those issues over the past number of weeks and months.  I stress that there will be other areas in which we will need to see more progress and flexibility.  This is certainly a glass-half-full moment but we are not quite there just yet.<br/><br/>On the issue of legacy, I will start with the Ballymurphy issue, the reason we are meeting.  What is the Minister's opinion on the genuine options that will be available next in terms of the campaign for justice for the families?  I appreciate that this falls into the jurisdiction of the UK but I note, for example, that we have not heard much from the UK Ministry of Defence so far, under whose jurisdiction the soldiers in question fell.  We have also not heard much about the prospect of further criminal investigations into what happened.  I bear in mind the wider statements the families have made about their concern and reticence over any potential move away from the Stormont House Agreement.<br/><br/>What is happening now in terms of dialogue and consultation?  My party is wary of this process, primarily because there is very little trust of the <i>modus operandi</i>of the UK Government.  There are questions as to whether things are being done for the right reason of finding agreement or whether they are being done to suit a particular agenda and bolting on whatever else needs to be done.  There is nervousness about what we are getting ourselves into in this process.  Are we, in effect, going to act as people who, shall we say, polish the bad look, to a certain extent, of flawed proposals which are then imposed over the heads of the Northern Ireland political parties?  Is this a situation whereby for this process to go ahead, there is an expectation that if we are to have an open mind on how to do this, any package will essentially have to be agreed either formally or by informal consensus across both Governments and a critical mass of the Northern Irish political parties, in the same way as was the case for the Stormont House Agreement?  Before we go on that journey, we need a sense of reassurance that we are not going to end up inadvertently giving legitimacy to a process that is fundamentally flawed in a range of ways and is then imposed over our heads by the UK Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.552" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021070100002#G00300"><p>I understand Dr. Farry's concerns.  Many of us know there is a lot of pressure in the British political system at Westminster to ensure that people who served in Northern Ireland do not end up being pulled through a court system.  We need to make sure that what is motivating this process is not pressure coming from a different place, if you like, and is rather a pressure on us all to do what is right for Northern Ireland.  I promise that is my motivation.  There is no way that the Irish Government is in this process to legitimise unilateral action that is somehow explained on the basis of the British Government saying we have gone through a consultation process, cannot get agreement on Northern Ireland because it is so divided and Westminster just needs to legislate and move this process forward.  That narrative could develop.  The narrative has almost taken hold that there is no point in even going through another process of consultation and legislation should be drafted anyway to follow through on commitments that were made in an election manifesto or whatever.  That cannot be the motivation here.  That is why we have said to the British Government that we will work with it in trying to convene a genuine process of consultation to listen to parties and victims groups.  We will listen if the British Government outlines that it has a different perspective and believes it can add to the legacy process by making amendments or changes to the Stormont House Agreement, or making new proposals.  Let us hear them, discuss them, dissect them and test them in terms of the purpose of what we are trying to achieve, which is truth, justice and reconciliation.  That is how we are approaching this process.  I hope that it will not result in a clash, a stand-off and a failure to progress because, to be honest, we have had enough of that.  Victims families deserve better than that.  We are approaching this on the basis of partnership with the British Government.  We are approaching it on the basis of reaching out, working with parties and victims groups to try to find a way forward that is acceptable to the British Government, although it may have to compromise, and the Irish Government.</p><p>It may have to compromise but it could accept that we could accept.  From our perspective, certainly at the outset of this, it is very important that there is a justice element to any outcome.  It is very hard to see how an Irish Government could support an outcome that does not give families the right to pursue justice in the courts if they want to, and certainly if there is a case file that makes that credible.</p><p> On a personal basis, hopefully Dr. Farry knows my form well enough at this stage.  I am not shy of having an argument even if it is with the British Government.  I want close and good relationships with the British Government but that does not mean that we simply accept its perspective and move forward on that basis.  We have a different perspective on this issue on the outset of these discussions but we are willing to participate in an effort to try to find a compromise position, if necessary, that can move us forward.  I believe only so much compromise is possible, however, from the principles of Stormont House and obviously the structures that were committed to on that basis.</p><p> I thank Dr. Farry for his recognition of the protocol.  Sometimes when I read the British media, it is almost as if it does not want to report on good news when it comes to the protocol or the European Union.  That is why I spoke to the BBC this morning.  Yesterday was a very important day for Northern Ireland.  It was the first time that both sides agreed to quite a significant package of flexibilities on the basis of taking a pragmatic approach towards problems that have surfaced because of the protocol.  The problems are ultimately because of Brexit but they have surfaced because of the implementation of the protocol, which is trying to manage the disruption of Brexit.</p><p> The grace period for prepared meats has been extended to the end of September on the ask of the British Government, which received a positive response.  That is a much better outcome than taking unilateral action and triggering an illegal response leading to a further breakdown of trust and so on.</p><p> The EU wanted to go beyond that, however.  It said it had been working on a whole range of other things and wanted to reassure people in Northern Ireland that the supply of medicines was not going to be a problem from Great Britain, for instance, generic medicines coming into Northern Ireland through the NHS system dealing with certifications systems that would otherwise be a problem.  The EU is actually willing to change European law to make sure Northern Ireland does not have concerns and anxiety around access to medicines.  That is appropriate, particularly in the context of the pandemic.</p><p> It has also done niche things like making sure guide dogs can travel between GB and Northern Ireland.  It sounds like a small thing but I recall Mr. Michael Gove MP raising this issue with me last January because it is highly emotive.  Likewise, with regard to the tagging of animals, the EU is effectively facilitating animals being taken to shows in Scotland and coming back into Northern Ireland and so on.  Rather than having to have an identification and tagging system every time the animal moves, a system is now in place that recognises and can allow the free movement of animals.  These are practical, sensible issues that are being resolved.</p><p> Ultimately, the EU said that it is up for a serious discussion around a common approach towards veterinary standards.  As I previously said to Dr. Farry, if we could get a sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, agreement between both sides in terms of a common approach towards standards, we could dramatically reduce the numbers of checks on imports in Larne and Belfast by up to 80% in terms of animal products.  Surely that is something worth pursuing.</p><p> Unfortunately, some of the commentary on that from the British side has not been overly positive.  It comes back to what is almost a conspiracy theory that the EU wants to control the UK.  It does not.  It simply wants to try to maintain a positive, sensitive relationship that removes unnecessary barriers to trade and takes a common approach towards high standards in food safety.  Hopefully, therefore, we will be able to make some progress on some of those issues.</p><p> As I said, any time Dr. Farry wants to get an Irish Government or European Commission perspective, he should feel free to pick up the telephone at any stage.  We are trying to find ways forward on some of these delicate questions in order that we can get through the summer and out the other side with a protocol that becomes less controversial and is seen as a technical trading arrangement as opposed to a political totem, which is what some people see it as.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for his attendance and participation.  I pay tribute to the way he has managed the process to date and the fact that he has given recognition to the victims and taken their concerns on board.  That has been a good response and victims have recognised that right across the board.  Even the Minister's answers have indicated that he understands, probably better than some, the issues that are actually being raised by the families and victims who want to get them resolved.  The Ballymurphy case is very typical but unfortunately it is not the only case right across the North.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Minister has read it but I will recommend Anne Cadwallader's book, <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>, which highlights the amount of cases of victims right across the North, where the very clear indication is of collusion between state forces, loyalists and others within the agencies that are involved.<br/><br/>There are 120 victims right across what is termed the &quot;murder triangle&quot;.  I live in that area.  My field runs down to what was the centre of Bond's plantation or the Argory.  Certainly, around this part of the country, the fears that were in people over those years are still there because they have not seen any resolution of the issue.  It would be beneficial if at some stage the Minister was able to visit and bring together a number of those families to let them speak for themselves on the issue.  Some of them already have.  I believe it is very important at present that they do not feel left out, however.  That figure of 120 is quite a sizeable number of people within that murder triangle, which takes in Glengannon, Portadown, Armagh and around that particular area.<br/><br/>Even when we look at the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there was a link into that murder triangle for those who carried out that bombing.  Sometimes it comes across that the Glenanne gang was the only group that was actually carrying out a lot of these murders.  I think that is a mistake.  We might look at the number of victims across the area, certainly even along the lines of the Devlins and the different families and local people who were involved.  Patricia Devlin highlighted the circumstances around that recently and it is very important.<br/><br/>When we are dealing with this in the Stormont House Agreement, it is important that we keep to the core principles.  There were concerns from the families, after the meeting between the British and Irish Cabinets, that a change was happening and that Stormont House was being set aside.  They need reassurance that we are starting a new discussion.  The new discussion can be dangerous, however.  It appears to families that the British Government is just delaying and procrastinating to try to drag out the whole process but giving no commitment to actually delivering on it.<br/><br/>It would be very important to remember, as Senator Currie said, that the British Government is not neutral in this.  Its representatives are actors and are part and parcel of it, for instance, its agents and soldiers.  The state itself was actually part and parcel of removing people.  The Pat Finucane case is probably one of the best examples but many others in different areas have a similar line.  I do not believe the British Government should be let off the hook in that regard or portray itself as neutral within it.  Unfortunately, we have seen so many broken promises from the British Government, including the Good Friday Agreement, which has not been fully implemented.</p><p>They seem to make agreements, break them and then just move on to the next stage.  I will say fair play that Ireland is trying to confront them.  I am of the view that we must move to a situation where we need to get answers to the question: "Are you going to live up to the commitment made or are you not?"  We need to get that.</p><p> I welcome the point made by the Minister regarding the Irish Government.  There  was some concern still that the Irish Government was in possession of papers on the Glenanne gang, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and cross-Border raids that happened, and that there would still be some documentation there.  It would be good if it was possible to move along from this stand-off.  I accept the point the Minister has made that he has stood up to the British Government.  That is good and welcome.  The stand-off sometimes has to happen in order to move things along and get truth and justice for the victims.  I thank the Minister very much for everything so far.  When we go back into the discussion on the Stormont House Agreement, however, it has to be to protect the agreement and not to weaken it, and not to take away the role of victims or the concept of justice for the victims.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Molloy on the need for a victim-centred approach.  This is what we must manage to achieve.  I used the word "we" in that regard.  While I was not the Minister at the time the Stormont House Agreement was agreed, I can remember what happened well.  The idea was that we would try to have structures agreed that would allow families to fit into different elements of that structure depending on their stories, what they were looking for, and what they wanted, whether this was establishing the truth, pursuing a case for investigation or being part of an oral history.</p> <p>  If a new approach is being proposed by the British Government, I point out, first, that this has not been published yet, even though many of us have a pretty good idea what is in it, and, then, that the onus is on the people who are proposing a new approach to explain why and to make a convincing case in order that consensus can be built.  Many times, privately and publicly, I have said that I do not see the case for a statute of limitations, which many will regard as a simple amnesty, adding to the challenge of legacy and reconciliation in a positive way.  This is why I have not been supportive of that.  In many ways, introducing an amnesty or statute of limitations will be seen by many victims as a hugely disappointing and traumatic ending to a very long wait for justice where the hope of taking a case successfully had been there and would be removed.</p> <p>  I have spoken to many of the victims' families.  They are very realistic about what is possible and what is not it with regard to having a successful case in court.  That is different from actually legislating to prevent them having the opportunity at all, which is what a statute of limitations would do.  Many of the victims' families will accept that their cases will be unlikely to be able to contribute to a case file that can successfully result in a prosecution.  There may well be some cases that can do that, which is very important, but in many cases, it may not be possible.  We have to have other mechanisms that can allow for evidence to be built up, for the truth to be told and for families to be given as much of that truth as is possible to put together often decades after the events took place.</p> <p>  I take the point about the 120 victims referred to by Mr. Molloy in the part of Northern Ireland he comes from.  Mr. Molloy makes the point, as I have also, that many victims and victims' groups, including the Ballymurphy families, have expressed real concern at a move away from the Stormont House Agreement structures and process.  They felt that was a credible way to pursue cases.  A question was asked as to whether the UK Government is just delaying.  No, I do not think it is.  To be fair to the British Government, it wants to move this issue on.  The problem is that how we do so matters.  One does not move on legacy by unilaterally passing legislation in a way that has not achieved consensus as being the best way forward.  If this is tried then one damages rather than builds relationships in the context of true reconciliation.  Whenever there have been suggestions about a different tiering of blame or prosecution, depending on who the people were who broke the law and were involved in violence, it has created extraordinary division, and understandably so.  In my view, this is why a court process and an investigation process where evidence is put together and cases are made for and against is still a very important part of the legacy process for many families.</p> <p>  I shall turn now to the question on whether the Irish Government is in possession of papers relating to the Glenanne gang.  I have a note on Glenanne gang and the wider question.  The announcement by the PSNI on 30 November 2019 that former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher would lead an independent police team to conduct an analytical report on collusion into the Glenanne gang series of cases was very welcome.  During the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, I raised the issue and underlined the importance of this process being supported in bringing the team's work to a successful conclusion.  The Government is supportive of facilitating this investigation, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland.  Mr. Boutcher is in a position to seek the co-operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the framework of the mutual legal assistance that underpins the excellent co-operation that exists between the Garda and the PSNI more broadly.  It is welcome also that Mr. Boutcher has already met with many of the victims' families and that he has confirmed he will conduct his work in ongoing liaison with them.  It is hoped that the report being conducted by Mr. Boutcher will contribute to the long process of justice, truth and acknowledgement of what happened in many of these awful cases where collusion was undoubtedly a feature.</p><p>We have a process there that I think people have increasing faith in, which is good.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh referred to the European Convention on Human Rights.  We raise cases relating to the convention all the time through the Council of Europe, with the Committee of Ministers that meets there, and at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.  That is where I suspect any approach on legacy in the future may be tested to ensure it is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  That is where I think the right to the pursuit of justice for victims and their families would be a pretty important consideration.  I cannot give a definitive view in advance, but, from our experience, we understand the bar would be quite high to justify introducing a broad amnesty for an entire period of Northern Ireland's history that was very brutal and violent and in circumstances where so many families have been attempting to pursue a course of justice and truth recovery for a long time.  Let us wait and see where that goes.</p></speech>

That is the first thing.  I am also happy to make sure that I am fair to everyone and, in that context, I want to make sure that Chris, who made two efforts, has a third opportunity.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for comprehensive briefing he has given us, particularly on the issues relating to Ballymurphy, the negotiations and the progress he believes, and I believe, both Governments will hopefully make to resolve this and ensure that the families get the justice they are entitled to and deserve.  If it is a new process and a different way of looking at a solution to the same problem, then the core point must be clarity for the families and the justice they are entitled to get.  That is a good agenda, and the only one worth pursuing.</p> <p>  I respect and acknowledge the fact that the victims on all sides and their families and the people who survived are entitled to the same truth and justice.  In the context of others and the counties in which they live, I live in county Louth where there are still families waiting for the truth and for justice regarding Jean McConville.  Jean was abducted in the most cruel and barbaric way and lay buried in an unmarked grave for decades.  There is also the murder of Tom Oliver.  These are matters that to deep to the heart of things, just like the murders in Ballymurphy.  They relate to people who lost their lives.  It should never have happened.  We are entitled to ensure that the families get justice and they get at the truth.  Whatever process by which we can make that happen, we should continue to pursue.</p> <p>  We have done the rounds of all the parties so I am happy to start again.  There are 25 minutes remaining.  We can split the time five minutes for Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Alliance and so on.</p></speech>

We saw the fruits of his labour in recent days.  When we come through the process, we will hopefully be able to say the same thing.  We are all familiar with the expression "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed".  The lesson here is that nothing is implemented until everything is implemented.  It is really important that we get this right.  So much good faith depends on this.  As the Minister said, whatever the family or experience and whatever the atrocity or the trauma, there has to be a way that people can engage in trust in the framework set out along the principles with which we are all familiar, truth, justice and reconciliation.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  I was aware that the Minister and the Government had raised our own case in the context of discussions last week.  That is something that we are keeping a close eye on as a family.  To broaden it out, the uniform approach of this committee is something that is not party political is the fact that we need to have mechanisms in place that deliver for everybody and provides that opportunity of access for all families, to use the Minister's words, regardless of perpetrators because that is very important.  The fact that families have had to wait five decades in some cases is the context in which we meet today, because a group of families did have a rare moment of progress after five decades.  A process lasting five decades is not what grandchildren or, in some cases, great grandchildren should have had to embark upon.  People should be free to get on and live their lives without having to engage in legacy processes.  The Minister is right, however, in that we are where we are.  In the process we now enter into, I trust the Government knows where victims, families and campaign groups stand.  It is important that we come out of this quickly and enter a period of implementation.  Our party looks forward to engaging on that in the period before a line is drawn in the autumn.</p></speech>

I referred to the need to ensure that families of victims and surviving victims are updated and that constant contact is made with them on behalf of the State.  The Minister referred to the ongoing contact that his Department has with representatives of the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I am strongly of the opinion that there may be families out there that are not represented by any advocacy group.  If the Department or some statutory agency could ensure that such families are updated as much as is possible and that they at least be let know what efforts are being made at State level to try and make some progress at getting truth in the many atrocities that have been carried out.</p></speech>

It is important that we always bear in mind that the victims are at the heart of this process.  It is their needs that we are trying to address alongside facilitating the wider reconciliation and healing of our society.</p></speech>

Senator Currie said that so much good faith depends on this.  That is a point which really hits home with me.  It does depend on this.  We have had so many difficult debates in the context of the politics of Northern Ireland in recent years.</p><p>There was the lead-up to the New Decade, New Approach agreement, Brexit and the protocol and a series of other political issues, be they in respect of language, culture or legislation.  It has been a difficult and disruptive period and now, arguably, we are moving into an even more sensitive space.  It is almost as if the challenges are never-ending for the political leadership in Northern Ireland and for the two Governments to work on with it.  I just appeal to people to try to approach this, yes, with very firm views, as have been expressed today, but also to try to use language that is not as confrontational, perhaps, as it otherwise might be, in an effort to try to find a way forward.  The approach the Irish Government is taking, which I hope I have outlined reasonably clearly, will be firm, but we will also try to approach this with a real effort to try to achieve consensus as much as possible.</p><p> On Mr. Finucane's comments, we have raised his family's case and will continue to raise it.  He does not need me to remind him that the work in this regard is very much unfinished.  I used the term "investigation" earlier.  Of course, what we are seeking is a full public inquiry.  I say that in case anything was read into my comments.  Mr. Finucane said that it is important that victims know where the Irish Government stands.  I have been consistent on that and I will continue to be.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Brendan Smith's comments and the timeframe for the talks, clearly, there is a great deal of pressure in the British system to legislate in this space from a time perspective.  That is no harm, because there must be urgency anyway for families if we can find a way forward.  What we are not going to do is what sometimes happens in Northern Ireland, where there are months that turn into years of negotiation and discussion, with stand-offs, party-political positioning and so forth.  We must do this differently if we can and find a way forward in the next few months in order that we can facilitate legislation in the autumn.  That is the aim.  He referred to families who may not feel that they are plugged into or represented by official representative groups.  If there is a database of families who are not getting updates, we would be interested to get that.  We will make sure to reach out to them.  That goes for anybody on this call, incidentally.  If participants feel that people are isolated and have not been part of broader representative groups, political parties or whatever, we will try to address that deficit if it exists.</p><p> On Dr. Farry's comments, how can one be against a process that takes account of human rights, the rule of law, justice and reconciliation?  I hope that is what we are all about here.  However, I can understand why it is not as straightforward as that, but they are four very important pillars.  Perhaps a fifth to add to that is legal obligations.  We have constitutional obligations and we have to be compliant with Article 2.  That comes under the rule of law.  Ultimately, we can take a legalistic approach here or we can try to do what is right for families and reconciliation.  Hopefully, we can do both in our efforts to find a way forward.</p><p> I will make a final point.  The scepticism about this process is very evident.  Parties have been quite honest with us about that.  However, let us not discount the possibility of surprising ourselves and perhaps providing some positive momentum and good news for families, against the odds.  If we do, it will be against the odds, given the expectations going into these talks.  Certainly, the Irish Government is going to take this seriously and try to make something positive come out of this process.  I encourage others to try to be the same.  Let us try to avoid the usual arguments and stand-offs.  Of course, we rely on others to do the same.  We will see where it goes.  If it comes to nothing, the fall-back position is quite straightforward.  It is the Stormont House Agreement.  However, I would be doubtful about whether that gets delivered, given the view that is quite strongly held now that there is a need for some change to that approach.  That is why I believe these discussions are important and will, from my perspective, remain very much focused on prioritising the welfare of families and the road to reconciliation, which is a difficult and painful one.  That is the only motivation for me.  There are no other considerations, be that in the Oireachtas, Westminster or anywhere else.</p><p> I thank members for the opportunity to talk with them.  I always learn something when we have these sessions.  We can refer back to the committee if there are any further questions which we can respond to in writing.  The committee can feel free to reach out and we will respond as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Stanton.  Before we hear from the witnesses we have to attend to some committee business.  I remind members that they must be in the Leinster House campus, or in the convention centre in Dublin, to attend the meeting.  If any member attempts to participate from outside of Leinster House, I will ask them to leave the meeting.  I remind witnesses that because they are giving evidence from outside of Leinster House, they may not have the same privilege as if they were in Leinster House.  They may think it is appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  They are again reminded that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, or damage the good name of any person.

Focus Ireland has been a leading national NGO working with homeless families for more than 30 years, and, in the course of our work supporting those experiencing homelessness, we regularly work with households from the Traveller community, who are disproportionately represented in homeless services.</p> <p>  While homelessness is an incredibly difficult experience for anyone, there is no doubt that being from the Traveller community makes the experience of homelessness more challenging again.  Focus Ireland caseworkers report that there is greater complexity of need when a household is from the Traveller community, reflecting the broad and multilayered pattern of social exclusion in society.  There is a sizable gap between Travellers' housing and cultural needs and the availability of appropriate accommodation for this group, and this gap has been there for many years.  While many of the problems we see through our front-line casework are also experienced by households not from the Traveller community, the multiple layers of marginalisation Traveller households face place them at particular risk, first, of an experience of homelessness; and second, difficulties accessing homeless services and later exiting homelessness.</p> <p>  In particular, we highlight a number of issues to committee members, the first of which is the absence of data specifically recording the housing challenges facing Traveller households.  Traveller organisations have, over the years, called for an ethnic identifier to be used, which would allow us to better understand the causes of homelessness for Traveller households, as well as their experience within homeless services.  We know that Traveller households are over-represented in homelessness but we do not know, month to month, how many people recorded as homeless in the monthly figures published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are from the Traveller community.  We also, currently, have no means of measuring the extent of hidden homelessness in Ireland, including the number of people couch-surfing, in overcrowded accommodation, or experiencing housing scarcity of one form or another.  The Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2020, published by the Housing Agency, shows that 1,104 Travellers on the housing list registered a specific accommodation need, but we do not know how many Travellers on the general social housing list did not register a specific accommodation need, or how many people have a housing need but are not currently on the housing list.  The expert review group report on Traveller accommodation, published in July 2019, included a call for a nationwide survey of the housing needs of the Traveller population to fully understand mobility patterns, family formation, existing accommodation tenure and conditions, and future accommodation preferences.  We hope that this research will be undertaken urgently.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to problems with the private rental sector as the primary exit mechanism from homelessness for this group.  The vast majority of exits from homelessness currently are into the private rental sector, rather than to local authority or approved housing body, AHB, social housing.  Figures relating to quarter 1 of 2021 show that 82% of exits from homelessness were via the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  While HAP has prevented many people entering homelessness, as well as allowing thousands of households to exit emergency accommodation into the private rental sector, these tenancies are not a substitute for permanent, stable social housing.  It is particularly challenging for marginalised households with complex needs to find and maintain HAP tenancies in the absence of supports and interventions.  It is also a challenge to find rental units suitable for single adults or larger households, with many of these households becoming trapped in emergency accommodation for long periods as a result.  The private rental sector can be a hostile place for marginalised groups, or households with high needs, who are competing with the general population for limited rental stock, facing potential evictions, rising rents, and discrimination.  A report from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, published in 2018, found Travellers to be 22 times more likely than any other group to be discriminated against in the private rental sector.  If a HAP tenancy cannot be sourced, Traveller households can become trapped in emergency accommodation or left with no option but to return to overcrowded, substandard accommodation with family or in unserviced and sometimes uninhabitable sites.</p> <p>  The third issue is the need to match social housing stock to family size.  Acquisitions and leasing of existing units for social housing tend to be two- or three-bed units, as far more of this unit type are currently available on the property market.  Local authorities report that accommodation for single adults and larger families is more difficult to source in existing stock; it is therefore hugely important that new build social housing matches the needs of those on the housing list.</p> <p>  Data from census 2016 show that Traveller households tend to be bigger than the general population, with more than one in four Irish Traveller households having six or more persons compared with less than one in 20 households in the State overall.  One of the main pathways into homelessness reported to Focus Ireland is overcrowding in accommodation or an untenable situation where a household was living in an unserviced site and cannot remain there on health and safety grounds.  This is reflected in available data, which show that Traveller households are much more likely to experience overcrowding.  Nearly 39% of Traveller households had more persons than rooms compared with less than 6% of all households in the general population.  The under-provision of Traveller-specific accommodation exacerbates such situations, as does the continuing prevalence of unaffordable rents and the lack of available or appropriate social housing.  While Traveller-specific accommodation must be progressed urgently by local authorities, Focus Ireland also believes that new build general social housing should be provided to match the family size of those larger households on the housing list.</p> <p>  The fourth issue is the framing of legislation and policy to facilitate cultural identity.  The legislative framework for access to housing and homelessness is based on a geographic link to a particular local authority.  Eligibility for social housing is based on a connection to the local authority area and each local authority holds a distinct housing list.  Once a person is added to a housing list with a particular local authority, it can be difficult to transfer to another.  If a household becomes homeless and has an urgent accommodation need in a local authority area where a local connection cannot be demonstrated, the household may be refused emergency accommodation.  If a household needs to move area for any reason, it may struggle to transfer to another local authority housing list and it risks losing its place on the original housing list.  The fact that homelessness and housing is devolved to local authorities can lead to gaps and blockages in accessing services, differing income limits in different local authority areas, differing HAP rates and other problems.  This is an experience common to all households facing homelessness, but the effect can produce particular hardships for the Traveller community, due to the distinct cultural identity and nomadic tradition of this community.  A rights-based approach would allow for greater flexibility on geographic placement and transfers between housing lists.</p> <p>  The fifth and final issue is the need for additional supports to assist Traveller households to find appropriate accommodation.  In the experience of Focus Ireland caseworkers, Traveller households presenting as homeless tend to have more complex needs, more complicated cases, and a higher support need when in emergency accommodation.  The lower school completion rate among Traveller households means that literacy can be an issue, affecting people's ability to engage with the complicated nature of applying for social housing or sourcing a HAP tenancy.  This can be hugely distressing and frustrating for people attempting to navigate a bureaucratic system such as the housing list and homeless accommodation.  Additional time and support are needed to ensure that those barriers are overcome; however, such support is often not available.</p><p>Again, this reflects the ongoing structural disadvantages which the Traveller community face and which need to be proactively addressed.  Consideration should be given to greater supports in the form of additional case management at local authority level aimed at helping Traveller households to access their rights and, ultimately, to find homes.</p><p> Focus Ireland believes that housing and homeless policy must take account of the particular demographics and characteristics of vulnerable and minority groups, including the Traveller community.  Our housing system must be designed to allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate and respect the rights and requirements of minority groups and their distinct identities.  Laws, policies, circulars, rules and schemes can be indirectly discriminatory if they fail to consider and properly address the disparate impacts which a particular law or requirement has on a minority group.  All public sector agencies are required under the public sector duty to consider the human rights and equality impacts on statutorily protected groups, which includes the Traveller community.  In the area of housing and homelessness, Focus Ireland would welcome greater engagement from statutory agencies and public bodies with the public sector duty.  We would also welcome a rights-based and culturally-sensitive approach to the assessment and allocation of housing and housing supports for Traveller households.</p><p> We very much welcome the committee&rsquo;s invitation to meet today and are happy to take any questions the members may have.</p></speech>

As mentioned by Rosemary Hennigan, the Housing Agency publishes the summary of social housing assessments annually.  In 2020, there were just over 1,000 households with unmet Traveller-specific accommodation requirements.  In addition, there are more Traveller families on the general social housing lists that are not specifically identified.</p> <p>  In regard to the matter of homelessness, as the committee is aware and has been highlighted, there is a significantly higher rate of homelessness among Travellers compared to the settled population.  Data provided by Dublin City Council to the Traveller expert group shows there were 504 homeless Travellers in temporary accommodation in Dublin in October 2018.  That figure included 100 families with children.  This represented approximately 9% of the total number of homeless families in Dublin at that date, even though Travellers make up less than 1% of the population nationally.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency has undertaken quite an amount of research in regard to Traveller accommodation issues and we typically would do at least one piece of research each year in that area.  Some of the research work has included the experience of Travellers in the private rental sector, a review of the funding for Traveller-specific accommodation, the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programme in 2017 and why Travellers leave Traveller-specific accommodation.  We, and Roslyn Molloy specifically, provided support to the Traveller expert group and that report was issued in 2019.</p> <p>  We provide technical expertise and support to Traveller accommodation projects.  Some of the projects we have been involved in include a current project in Monaghan and we supported Kerry County Council and Cork City Council in respect of some of their Traveller-specific projects.  We have also worked with the Traveller-led housing association, CENA.  We are currently supporting the role of the project development officer with CENA for a three-year period.  Basically, we employ someone who we assign to support its work.</p> <p>  I will now move to a couple of the points in our statement that are for particular consideration.  First, we suggest that the recommendations in the 2019 Traveller accommodation expert group report are progressed and we welcome the establishment by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, of a programme board last year to implement those recommendation positions.  Second, we welcome the announcement by the Minister of State that a revision is to be made to the social housing assessments to collect more accurate data and to include an ethnic identifier as part of that, as recommended by the expert group.  We fully support its introduction.  Third, updated guidelines on the planning, design, management and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation would aid the work of local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We believe these guidelines should be issued as soon as possible.  Fourth, we believe the approved housing bodies have a key role to play in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation and we would welcome further investigation of what supports could be provided to ensure greater involvement of the sector in this area.  A great deal of current social housing delivery is coming through the approved housing bodies and we would like to see more of that being provided for the Traveller community.</p> <p>  The overall aim for our society is the availability of homes for all.  To achieve this goal, all sections of society must be included.  The Housing Agency made a submission to this committee in February 2021 on key issues affecting the Traveller community and that outlines in more detail some of the points raised in our statement.  We are happy to discuss these points and provide more information to the committee, as it sees fit.</p></speech>

I want to open the conversation to committee members.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#B00700"><p>There are two issues that arise in the context of housing.  One concerns those who want specific Traveller accommodation and, then, there are many people who want accommodation and will take whatever is going.  What we obviously do not know is how many would opt for specific accommodation, if it was available, and how many would opt for standard housing.  Would Mr. O'Connor accept that the number of people in homelessness from the Traveller community is a fair indication of the crisis in regard to Travellers getting accommodation, whether it is HAP accommodation, local authority accommodation, Traveller-specific accommodation or other accommodation?  Would he accept that is a fair measure of the challenge?</p> <p>  I understand that 50% of the people who are homeless in Galway city, not the county, are from the Travelling community.  It certainly would be my personal experience, from dealing with them every week in the most pitiful of situations, that this is true.  These are people who cannot get HAP properties because of prejudice and there is also the big issue of the top-ups.  If people are on basic social welfare, the HAP limits are totally ridiculous in the context of rents in Galway city.  Even if people could get properties there, the rent is so outrageous that they cannot afford the top-up.</p><p>That means HAP accommodation is a much more expensive proposition than, for example, local authority housing or voluntary association housing.  Would the witnesses agree that what we are seeing in the official figures is just the tip of the iceberg?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.590" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#C00200"><p>That is absolutely right, unfortunately.  That is why we have been trying to emphasise the importance of the data, so we can fully understand it.  It is definitely the tip of the iceberg.  Emergency accommodation should be a last safety net for somebody who finds himself or herself temporarily without a home for some reason, but at present it has become something of a default for this community.  That is based, in part, on the failures of the HAP and the inaccessibility of the private rental sector, all of which illustrates the multifaceted nature of discrimination in Ireland against the Traveller community.  We see it when it gets to the crisis point when there is nowhere else to go so people apply for emergency accommodation.  That is why there is such an over-representation.  Housing is the crisis point for this, but it is a much broader social problem that requires very serious attention.</p> <p>  It would be very good to know whether people would opt for Traveller-specific accommodation because, with regard to that provision, we need to know what we should be providing or what other demographics apply in terms of going to this community and providing for it better.  At present, we are not doing that.  We are hoping they will be able to slip into the existing structures for HAP and, as the Deputy said, there are major problems with the HAP scheme currently in the context of the rates and the top-ups which are payable alongside the differential rent.  All of that is resulting in the individual stories that we hear all the time on the front line from people in completely unacceptable circumstances.  The recent report from the Ombudsman for Children demonstrated some of that.  Unfortunately, that is an extreme case but it is also not uncommon, as I am sure the committee is aware.  It is an absolute crisis.  Does Mr. Allen wish to add to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#C00300"><p>In one sense, all forms of homelessness are the tip of the iceberg and an expression of the wider problem, so it is absolutely true that this is the case in respect of Travellers.  When there is a housing crisis there are going to be some people who end up experiencing it most.  They tend to be the people who were already more marginalised and where there are systemic problems relating to them, whether it be the Traveller population or people with other challenges in their lives.  It is important to understand that they are not homeless because of those circumstances.  The homelessness happens because of the way we have failed in our housing system, and those people happen to experience the problem because of the issues they face.</p> <p>  It is important to point out that Focus Ireland, in terms of its services, is working mainly with Traveller families who have opted into mainstream housing.  We do not have services that work in Traveller-specific accommodation.  We do not explore the question of whether they are opting for mainstream housing because that is all that is available or because that is what they prefer.  We take people where they are.  Finding ways to explore more deeply what people's choices would be if they genuinely had choices would be a crucial part of dealing with the overall housing challenges that face the Traveller community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#C00400"><p> I do not wish to hog the meeting, but I have a supplementary question.  The people who contact me who are in very bad housing situations are not all Travellers, but a disproportionate number in Galway city are.  If they are homeless and one asked them what their hierarchy of choices is, they would ask for a home.  It is very simple.  They would say: "Get me a home.  Do not procrastinate.  Do not do any more studies or any more thinking.  Get me a home."  It is the majority situation.  It shows how far behind we are that the question of choice is not even arising for them, because they will tell me to stop faffing about in the vast majority of cases.  Some people are quite specific about what they are seeking.  Some are specific that they want conventional housing, some want housing in Traveller-specific accommodation and some want halting site accommodation.  I get all three, but it is fair to say that a large number who come to me, particularly the people who end up in homelessness, want a home, and they want it fast.</p> <p>  An issue that arises in the modern way we do our business is that we are very logical, but at times logic can give very strange answers.  One of the problems I come across all the time is that Travellers, with just cause, will tell me that if they are offered a house in a certain area, there would be problems if they were moved to that area because they are either being taken away from where the family is or they are being put in with families with whom there have been issues in the past and there has been conflict and so forth.  We are creating conflict because we just do it.  A family is number one, ten, 12, 13, 14, 15 or further down the list.  We say to them that they are next on the list and that is where they have to go, but we never take into account the human aspects of putting somebody in the wrong place and creating problems and tensions into the future that could be avoidable because of the close familial relationships that many Traveller families have.  I get this all the time when Travellers come to me.  The system does not seem to be able to deal with this in an official way.  Some of the officials do their best and the social officers are trying very hard, but there has been no official recognition that it is not just a question of pulling people from the list, saying, "that is the next three-bedroom house and that is where it is", and totally ignoring societal reasons when making that decision.  I am interested to hear comments from the witnesses on that issue as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.593" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#C00500"><p>In general, that applies across all housing allocation.  There is an official indifference to, sometimes at a political level, or serious dismissal of the fact that people like to live in particular communities and that their connections to those communities are very important to them in terms of childcare or other forms of care or social connection.  Those are often not treated in the system with the seriousness they require.  The Deputy is correct that this general problem is much more extreme in respect of Travellers.  Certainly I have come across cases where particular Traveller families have identified certain areas which they could not go into because of other conflicts and issues to do with the past.  On one level, these need to be dealt with and should not be accepted as normal in our society but, at the same time, in terms of housing allocation they have to be respected and understood.  In fact, where the allocation is offered by the local authority, it seems almost deliberately to have gone against what the Traveller family has indicated is impossible for them.  Then the family is told that they have turned down a reasonable offer of housing accommodation.  At best, there seems to be an indifference to that and, sometimes, in some local authorities one comes across cases where the decisions that are made seem to be almost perverse.  That creates an atmosphere.</p> <p>  There does not appear to be a system at legislative level, regulatory level or practice level of making that a mainstream part of how we respond to housing need.  I would welcome if that could be highlighted.  I realise it is hard to understand, when there is not enough housing, that the location of the housing is also important.  One ends up almost with a beggars cannot be choosers situation, but the argument we make is that housing is a right.  It is not a matter of beggars cannot be choosers.  It is a right.  How do we organise our society whereby we can fulfil that right?  The name of Mr. O'Connor's agency is the Housing Agency, but he always reminds us that it is the housing communities agency.  It is a reminder that one cannot solve the housing crisis unless one understands and respects the communities people want and need to live in.  The Deputy has raised a very important point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#C00600"><p>I will respond quickly on a few points.  One is the homelessness issue.  As the Deputy said, the level of homelessness among Travellers is excessively high, and there are serious problems as a result.  On the issue of the request for Traveller-specific accommodation or general accommodation, I will ask my colleague, Ms Molloy, to respond.</p><p>The allocation of housing varies from local authority to local authority and often from official to official.  A significant number of local authority officials are aware of what constitutes an appropriate allocation in terms of where people can live and where there are difficulties.  The majority of officials do their best.  I agree with the Deputy that there are issues with the allocation of housing and ensuring a location is appropriate for a household.  Does Ms Molloy want to come in on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roslyn Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#D00200"><p>The Deputy's first point on the type of accommodation, in terms of whether it is Traveller-specific or general standard accommodation, was answered by Ms Hennigan.  People will want a roof over their heads, but one of the issues that has been very clear from the reports and review of the expert group is the lack of evidence and the differing parties, whether it is social workers in local authorities versus Travellers and local authority workers.  People have different ideas on Travellers' preferences.</p> <p>  There is progress and the administrative datasets that are collecting this information will provide the means to identify those families that identify as Travellers and have a preference for Traveller-specific accommodation as well as those who may have a preference for standard social housing.  They can list their preferences.  The expert group felt some of the submissions pointed to the fact that in areas where there may be a view that there is no chance of accessing Traveller-specific accommodation, therefore, Travellers will opt to put down as their number one preference standard social housing. </p> <p>  That potentially blurs what people are looking for.  We need to clarify that and make application forms much clearer so that local authorities have a standardised way of collecting that information.  That would be a big step forward in understanding what needs to be planned into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#D00300"><p>A lot was covered in the replies to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, such as application forms for the Traveller community and how specific they should be.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions as to how they can be made clearer?  What would a local authority require?  Is legislative change needed to instruct authorities to do that specific work?  At the end of the day, if a Traveller family has stated they want Traveller-specific accommodation in their area but a council does not build it, that does not resolve the issue.  That is probably the problem.</p> <p>  The Ombudsman's report on Spring Lane stated on the one hand that the local authority said it offered Travellers accommodation and they had refused, while, on the other, the Ombudsman said there were no accurate housing records for the families concerned.  No one could say that the Traveller families refused accommodation.  The records were not clear or handled properly.  That is a specific issue that I would like to get a grasp of.  Mr. O'Connor, Ms Hennigan or Ms Molloy can advise the committee regarding local authorities.</p> <p>  Focus Ireland deals specifically with Housing First.  Does it have records on how many people from the Traveller community, including individuals, males, females and families, it is dealing with in Housing First?  For how long are key workers linked in with Housing First tenants in the process?  I have experience of one particular person and I want clarification on how long a key worker links in with people engaged with Housing First, in particular in respect of the Travelling community.  How does Focus Ireland link in with other ethnic groups?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.598" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#D00400"><p>I will address the point on Housing First.  Focus Ireland has run Housing First for over ten years and for a large period of that time we have done so on our own or with the Peter McVerry Trust in Dublin.  It went out for a competitive tender a couple of years ago and the Peter McVerry Trust is providing the service in Dublin.  I cannot speak directly to how that is operating in Dublin now.  We ran Housing First services in many other parts of the country.</p> <p>  It is worth saying that Housing First, as it currently operates, is only directed at single people and not families with children.  That is an issue that we have raised.  We have identified effective practices in Housing First for people with complex support needs, but there are families and young people who often have complex support needs and whose housing situation would benefit from Housing First.  However, the service does not apply to those groups at the moment.</p> <p>  The Housing First support system involves supporting tenants for as long as they continue to need it, which is presumed to be more or less indefinitely.  That should apply to members of the Traveller community, as well as anyone from any where in the country or anyone of any nationality.  The Housing First support continues for as long as a person requires it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.599" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#D00500"><p>I wish to make a further comment on Housing First for clarity.  It is aimed at individuals with complex needs.  It is not necessarily for all individuals who are in temporary homeless accommodation.</p> <p>  On the application form for social housing, no specific additional legislation is required.  It is covered by way of regulation.  We now have just one application form nationally.  There is a desire and requirement for that for so that things do not vary from place to place throughout the country.  We chair the housing assessment group and work with local authorities and the Department on modifications to the form.  In terms of the Traveller community, the Minister has agreed to add an additional identifier.  More information on what is required on the application form to be able to offer support to Travellers has been outlined.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's first question, the form can be changed relatively easily.  The main thing is to have consistency across the country and not make the application from overly complex in terms of what information is needed.  Does Ms Molloy want to add anything?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.600" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roslyn Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#E00100"><p>I will add to the point I made earlier about application forms.  Ethnic identifier is one element.  A second, and it is a recommendation in the expert report, is that being able to express first, second and third preferences on accommodation type would, potentially, improve accommodation options.  As Mr. O'Connor mentioned, an oversight group is looking at this but there was also a call for monitoring of the data, particularly on Travellers.  As this new information starts to be collected, we will be able to work out what the barriers are, and the progress being made, on social housing waiting lists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#E00200"><p>To answer Deputy Collins and Senator Moynihan on the question of allocations in social housing and the social housing list, and what we said about geographic movement and all of that, the idea of a social housing passport has been mooted for quite a long time.  This might better reflect the reality of people's lives.  People do not organise their lives around being in a particular local authority area and not moving into another, even though somebody might be there who is part of their support network.  A social housing passport might better reflect the reality of how people are living, especially because of the current housing scarcity where someone might need to move around and couch-surf between different family members or whatever else.  It has been suggested as part of the programme for Government.  As far as I am aware, it has not been progressed to date but it would be positive to look at it again, progress it, ask what the realities of it are and how it can be accomplished and see whether it would benefit, for example, the Traveller community.  Again, I do not think a social housing passport would need legislative change but it is part of the programme for Government so it would be interesting to see if it might be progressed.</p></speech>

We have seen submissions and heard during previous meetings about trespass legislation and how nomadism has been criminalised in Ireland.  Travellers can no longer travel because it is against the law.  Apart from repealing that legislation, what else do the Focus Ireland or the Housing Agency representatives believe could be put in place as a solution as soon as possible?  What would that be?</p> <p>  We have discussed housing, social housing and areas that are relevant to the general population.  The Traveller community is obviously part of the general population in Ireland.  However, so much has been taken away from that community.  Some people choose to live in a trailer or caravan because that is their way of life.  I have family members who live in trailers and would not live anywhere else.  To have the opportunity to do that is part of our culture and way of life.  We are always talking about houses and so on but what about lending schemes for caravans?  Many Travellers would live in a warm, clean mobile home that was appropriate and had services to go with it.  Is that a possible option for Travellers in the context of trespass legislation?  When we talk about accommodation we are always talking about social housing but many Travellers would choose clean, appropriate, warm mobiles homes and trailers.</p></speech>

The issue of transient halting sites was in the 1998 housing legislation but has not been taken up or progressed.  In its submission to the committee, the Housing Agency mentioned looking at good practice and design guidelines for good quality Traveller-specific accommodation, including halting sites.  That is something that could help and improve accommodation options for Travellers and support approved housing bodies and local authorities that are working to develop more of this.  That is something we see as potentially helping in that area.  The Chair mentioned the caravan loan scheme.  A pilot scheme is being rolled out in four local authority areas.  The caravan loan scheme was reviewed by the Housing Agency a few years ago.  We made recommendations on the value of having such a scheme and its benefit to the Traveller community.</p></speech>

Cork City Council got a lot of criticism in the recent report but it completed one development in recent years at Hollyhill.  It is probably due to the commitment of council staff involved in the design of that Traveller-specific accommodation that it is a combination of houses, bays and day accommodation.  It gives many options for Traveller accommodation and flexibility for the future.  Where there are individuals in local authorities, or others, who are committed to designing good quality accommodation, it works.  We had a very negative example from Cork city but Hollyhill is a very positive one.  The individuals in the council who worked on that were committed to designing a high-quality development.</p></speech>

That would give us an opportunity to review the legislative framework we have at the moment and the ways in which it could do a much better job of acknowledging, protecting and nurturing Traveller culture.  There are opportunities to do that because at the moment the framework can be quite blind and a bit of a one-size-fits-all approach.  When we look at the social housing lists, there is an opportunity, as I said, to have a larger unit size but also, within that, to have an element of choice about what those units might be.  As the Chair said, it does not all have to be housing by any manner or means.  The Housing Agency has addressed that somewhat.  The right to housing gives us an opportunity to have a discussion on what that might look like.  Housing does not have to mean a house in the traditional sense.  It can definitely be an opportunity to have that conversation.</p></speech>

It is important to hear their views.  I was absent for some of the previous committee meetings because we have been passing the Land Development Agency, LDA, Bill.  There were votes at Report and Final Stages on that, which were completed last night.  My question focuses on that because the Bill and the unlocking of the public land bank for the delivery of houses provides a very unique opportunity to ensure that Traveller-specific accommodation is included in all the developments the LDA will progress.  Has there been any discussion between the Housing Finance Agency or approved housing bodies and the LDA, specifically on the issue of Traveller accommodation?</p><p>I think the Minister last night brought forward amendments to ensure that Traveller accommodation would be included in the provision of housing on these lands.  That is really welcome but, like lots of things about the LDA, it now leaves legislation and gets into implementation.  That is where I am worried the intention does not transfer into delivery.  That is a general question.  Has there been any discussion with the LDA or ambitions in order to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation through the public land banks that are opened up?</p><p> On a broader point, it is really interesting that the debate on the right to housing came before the housing committee.  I think there was unanimous support for it.  There is full support within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for a constitutional amendment on the right to housing.  I think the Minister has support now as well with the housing commission.  It is a matter of allowing the commission to come up with the wording of the amendment because we have to be very careful not to allow red herrings to defeat what is a very positive proposal.  We have seen in other referendums that red herrings often can do that.  Let us be honest, you could have people with very racist intentions towards Travellers using the idea of illegal Traveller encampments as a way to fight a horrible battle in a referendum to try to defeat the right to housing.  We have to be very careful in bringing forward the proposal that we ensure that those red herrings are eliminated, that racists do not get the opportunity to discuss their views in public and that the right to housing is incorporated into the Constitution.  That is a broader point on the right to housing.  We still have a long way to go to have a civic society campaign on that, and I think we can all work together on it.  My question is about the LDA and Traveller-specific accommodation.</p></speech>

I wish to declare that I am on the board of the Land Development Agency.  The issues Deputy McAuliffe raises probably have not been a major part of the discussion in the Land Development Agency, but in both the agency and in all developments we need to look at being inclusive of Traveller accommodation.  There has been a tendency to be too segregated in the provision of Traveller accommodation.  Both local authorities and the LDA need to look at every development from the point of view of whether we can include Traveller accommodation and not have it segregated.  From my experience of Traveller accommodation, it has been too segregated, too isolated and not engaged, although, again, there have been some very positive examples of it being done well.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the time.  The proposals that came forward last night were really significant because in Dublin and Cork they allow for 100% affordable and social housing on public land.  That means that all the traditional biases, which are unjustified, surrounding the provision of Traveller accommodation within an overall development, how it might impact open market sale and so on are now off the table.  The LDA is a unique opportunity for us to address the issue of provision, and it is public provision.  That should be the overall goal.  I am conscious Mr. O'Connor is a member of the board.  That is why I raised this issue.  The LDA is an opportunity for us to address the wider housing issue but specifically the Traveller accommodation issue.</p></speech>

That is very positive.  The debate about integration is also very positive.  I have just one small word of warning, which is that the integration of Traveller-specific accommodation is not achieved simply by putting it adjacent to the social housing estate, which is the view that was taken in far too many towns.  That is problematic as well.  The integration needs to be with the wider community.  The more prosperous owner-occupier parts of town are where the real integration comes in.  It should be remembered as well that the building of communities is not just about delivering the homes or integration of the physical housing; an additional element is needed.  One of the things we have failed to do is understand the role of community development workers and people working in the social care environment in building up communities.  The work Focus Ireland has done with Sligo County Council in the Cranmore estate is a real example of interaction, community development and workers on the ground turning a community which was seen as problematic into a place where people want to live.  We often neglect that rule for human beings and community development: the workers and skills that go into making communities will work better than just building the housing and then walking away.</p></speech>

As well as developing group housing schemes and acquiring homes, it has developed its own model of needs assessment, strategic accommodation planning, home design and feasibility studies.  It is working with eight local authorities and two large AHBs on that.  It believes in the importance of building community and is working on the sustainability and future-proofing of Traveller accommodation within the wider community.</p></speech>

Cena is a housing agency led by Travellers, for Travellers.  It is important we hear from Cena at a later date.  Today is about holding other services to account.  I thank Ms Molloy for raising that with us.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a question of Focus Ireland.  We all know that Travellers are 22 times more likely to be discriminated against when looking for accommodation in the private sector.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions as to how we could tackle the discrimination and racism Travellers face when looking for private accommodation?  I see many a Traveller homeless today, living in hotels and so on and being evicted from those hotels.  A lot of the time people have issues when homeless.  What I mean by that is that homelessness has an impact on their mental health, well-being, etc.  As a community development worker, I have even seen Travellers refused homelessness services many a time.  Mr. Allen rightly said community development workers play an important part in trying to support families and individuals to get the likes of HAP, to get onto various lists and so on.  How can we tackle discrimination within this sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.614" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#F00800"><p>It is a huge problem.  One of the basic problems is that the private rental sector has become so dominant in our response to homelessness, that there are weaknesses within that sector in general and that it is particularly difficult for marginalised groups because there are not enough ways in which we can protect against discrimination.  There is the formal equality protection under the legislation, which I am sure you are aware of, Chairman.  Discrimination on the ground of being in receipt of the housing assistance payment has been introduced as well, so you can bring a discrimination case on that ground.  We have recently been working with and supporting people who have experienced this and we have been trying to bring them through the process.</p><p>The reality is that, as the Chair says, when a person is experiencing the crisis of homelessness he or she is not always able to also concentrate on a process of vindicating his or her rights.  One thing we could explore is not having the onus be on the person who has been subject to the discrimination to take that case.  Thus we would, to some degree, have our enforcement and accountability agencies, namely, the IHREC or the Ombudsman, taking a more proactive approach in taking on those investigations themselves and not needing to have a plaintiff or an applicant who will come forward and go through that process, because it can be very time-consuming.  It can be very emotionally involved for a person to have to present that evidence as well.  If we place that on a person who themselves is actively living in homelessness, it is unrealistic to expect them to actually vindicate those rights.  We should therefore explore whether we can enable our authorities, which are at a bit of a distance from it, to take that on themselves instead.  That is one thing I recommend.</p><p> On their support needs in emergency accommodation, we could do more in respect of case management by allowing for, say, lower case ratios, whereby a support case worker would be working with a lower number of families or households to be able to give them that support and spend more time with those who maybe have higher needs.  That is another thing I recommend we explore.</p></speech>

They do a lot of work directly with landlords and support tenants in properties.  That works well, where there is more engagement with landlords and they know the tenant is going to be properly supported.  I agree with Ms Hennigan that more support makes a big difference.</p></speech>

At the time, in 2018, it was 100 families.  That has now fallen back to 80 families.  From the reports Focus Ireland has been publishing, there has been a fall back in family homelessness.  It is a positive that within the Traveller community, family homelessness has also fallen back in the Dublin area.  One reason given, when I was speaking to somebody in the Traveller accommodation area, was that the case study approach was being taken in 2019 with families who were from a Traveller background to try to work with them on their accommodation needs.</p></speech>

I say that because of the evidence of homelessness I have been seeing.  This includes families but especially young Travellers, men and women, along with two or three kids.  Homelessness within the Traveller community is more evident to me over the past two years, as is hidden homelessness within the community.  It would be interesting to get more details around those figures showing a decline in the Dublin area.  Obviously, outside Dublin, homelessness is an issue for Travellers in the likes of counties Donegal and Sligo.  There is overcrowding on halting sites, people sleeping on couches and sharing homes and so on.  I would appreciate it if we could get some more information on that.</p></speech>

Some people criticise the figures and say they do not reflect reality and so on.  They reflect very clearly a very specific form of reality.  We have some reservations about the way we count families who are in own-door accommodation and the changes made there.  We have some of the best measurements and regular measurements of that form of homelessness of any country in the world.  What we do not have is any sort of measure of the less official forms of homelessness which are covered under the European typology of homelessness and housing exclusion, ETHOS, definition of homelessness, namely, the sofa-surfing the Chair referred to or the people who are doubling up, that is, two families living in one housing unit and so on.  They are captured to some extent by the work the Housing Agency does on the waiting lists but there are recognised limitations to that.  In understanding homelessness more deeply and how we need to solve it and its relation to the housing crisis, we must broaden our definitions and understanding of homelessness but to do that in a way that does not dismiss the quality of the data we already have and the progress we are making on that narrower form of homelessness.  I am aware that is quite a complex sort of thing to say but we must avoid throwing out the measurements we have because they do not fully count everything we might wish to.  It is about recognising the achievements we have made while recognising the very considerable distances we must go to solve the problem overall.</p></speech>

There are many homeless families in a hotel on the Kylemore Road who are from many different ethnic minority groups etc.  Technically, because they are not on the streets, they are not homeless.  If the number has gone down to 80 families on Dublin's streets, I can understand that.  Mr. Allen is right that we must look at the different definitions of homelessness and that should be clear to people and to wider society as well.  Thanks for reminding us of that.  Do any other members wish to come in?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in.  A lot of stuff has already been covered but we have had previous witnesses before the committee who have called for the establishment of a national body to deal purely with Traveller accommodation.  We have seen councils not drawing down funds and so on.  Is that something the organisations would support?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.624" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#G01000"><p>We have had some interesting conversations with Traveller organisations, and Pavee Point in particular, about the work they are doing in this area.  There is a real challenge here, in that Travellers have been recognised as an ethnic group and many Travellers have specific housing requirements in terms of Traveller-specific accommodation and broader needs and therefore, a need for a specialist group that can recognise that.  On the other hand, there is the need to integrate it into the main housing system, both in the way local authorities are and the way mainstream homeless organisations need to be more reflective of Traveller needs.  I do not think anybody is in favour of a new homeless organisation that specialises in homeless Travellers.  There is a real challenge there of both integrating and having specialist skills.  While I can see the need for the specialist organisation, to deliver it without actually marginalising the issue such that the mainstream no longer feels it has to be dealt with will be a really tricky question.</p><p>I do not have a direct answer to it but we need to be careful of going down that route without thinking of a need to integrate, while recognising that the demand for specialised housing organisation for Travellers does not come out of nowhere.  It comes out of generations of frustration and it needs to be taken seriously but also in the broader context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.626" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#H00200"><p>A lot of the issues are in respect of the levels of resistance to Traveller accommodation right throughout the country.  A lot of it may come back to the planning systems.  I will bring Ms Molloy back in on this because the expert group has a lot to say around possible changes in the planning system and a better focus and alignment in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-01a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Roslyn Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021070100002#H00300"><p>There is the planning and then there is the national body question. Were a national body to be building and developing Traveller-specific accommodation, there is a concern, as Mr. Allen has said, that we would almost be another step removed.  This was one of the findings.  One of the report's recommendations is to establish a national authority and to extend the remit of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  At the moment it is an advisory body and a lot of the work that we have done in the Housing Agency has come through from that advisory body as recommendations to the Minister to carry out research in particular areas.  It was the view that there needed to be greater monitoring.  The review commissioned by the Housing Agency on the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, pointed out the need to look at who was following up when the Traveller accommodation programmes in local authorities were not achieving and meeting their targets.  Who is taking on the oversight to do this?  The review found there needed to be independent monitoring of all of that aspect.  This is one of the recommendations that has gone to the programme implementation board.  When it comes to some of the information, we can definitely see why that would be the case.  A body that is building and developing Traveller-specific accommodation might be a moving away.  As Mr. O'Connor said, there was an issue with the planning whereby things were not aligned.  The Traveller accommodation programmes are not aligned with the local development plans, for example.  They should all be running on the same cycle. Similarly, rather than taking Travellers and creating yet another distance, their housing needs should be aligned and matched with all of the other processes and administrative procedures and be structured within local and regional development and the regional assemblies.  That was another area of planning that was suggested to be looked at.</p></speech>

Obviously there is a Housing First policy, whether that is with the Peter McVerry Trust or with Focus Ireland.  Specifically on the key worker and the relationship with the Housing First client, who is it that makes the decision when there is no longer a need for a key worker to work with the person?  Is that decision made by the key worker or are the two people brought into Housing First, Focus Ireland, or the Peter McVerry Trust for an analysis of where the person is and if he or she can move on?  This is probably a little bit off the question that we are dealing with here.  This is about contact with the individual Traveller.</p></speech>

In good practice that decision would be made by the funder, which would be the local authority and the health board, and by the direct provider, which would be an organisation like ourselves, or the Peter McVerry Trust or Simon.  It is also an absolute principle of Housing First that it would be done along with the individual person.  While I have not come across it that often, most commonly we get a sense that local authorities and health boards would say that people are being supported for longer than they actually need and that we should back off and let the person have his or her  independence.  It is hard to say without specifics.  In another case, withdrawal of support might be to do with health and safety issues or other forms of risk which can arise and have arisen.  If it is just withdrawing the support because the person has met the settlement indicators, this must be done in collaboration with the tenant.</p></speech>
