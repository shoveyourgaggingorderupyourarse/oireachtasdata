He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p><p>We have received apologies from Deputies Deering and Kelly.  Are the minutes of 28 March agreed and can they be published? Agreed.  Nothing specific arises that will not come up in the course of our discussions on our work programme.</p><p> The first items of correspondence are Nos. 2081A and 2085A, which comprise the opening statement from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, and a briefing note from Ms Catherine Smith, corporate secretariat, for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.</p><p> The next items are from Accounting Officers or Ministers following on from previous meetings of this committee.  We held over No. 2073B from Dr. Deirdre Keyes, chief executive of Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, at our meeting last week.  The documentation is dated 21 March and provides a response to information requested by the committee, including notes on independent valuations, meetings of the board held in hotels, leasing of property by the ETB which it previously owned, and details of a rent-free period for the Bray civic centre.  Dr. Keyes also refers to a review of all of the ETB's leases and the difficulties it has faced so far in collating that documentation.  We noted and published the item the previous day and agreed that we might hold it over to allow people to consider it further.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B00900"><p>We will discuss it the next day, and it is up to us to decide whether we have further questions to ask.  We have noted and published it, but we need to discuss it.  We will make a point of discussing it and make sure, when the documentation is going out, that members are aware that it will be up for discussion the next day.</p><p>The next item is No. 2078B from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, dated 29 March, providing a breakdown of outstanding lottery grant cases for the year ending 2018, as requested by the committee.  Ms Browne states that the correct terminology is &quot;outstanding files&quot; as opposed to outstanding cases.  We are being corrected on our terminology.  There were 174 files outstanding at the end of 2018.  We will note and publish that.  When the Office of the Chief State Solicitor appeared before the committee we asked a question about the number of files it had on voluntary organisations which had made applications for national lottery funds, and were all experiencing some delay.  Ms Browne has outlined the details on that.  There are quite a few still outstanding.  Some of the cases have been dealt with from the Chief State Solicitor's point of view, but third-party solicitors have not yet provided confirmation.  The documentation is there.</p><p>The next item is No. 2080B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing information requested by the committee concerning Courts Service statistics.  It appears that neither the Department nor the Courts Service are able to provide the number of non-legally aided persons appearing before the courts.  We will note and publish this.  We had been given details on legal aid cases and we had asked if, as the total number of cases is known, whether we could work out how many non-legally aided cases there were.  The Department has said that it cannot do that.  The letter says:</p><blockquote>Legal Aid certs granted can refer to a single offence or a category of offences.  A defendant appearing before the courts could be granted a number of Legal Aid Certs for offences in the one case or could have a number of Legal Aid Certs referring to different cases before the courts.</blockquote> <p>That is not corrected.  The letter goes on to say:</p><blockquote>As indicated previously, legal aid is granted by the courts in the majority of indictable offences dealt with in the Circuit, Central and Special Criminal Courts.  The Courts Service advises that this would refer to at least 95% of these cases.</blockquote> <p>In the District Court it advises that approximately 70% of defendants get free legal aid and says that the main reason for that is that cases dealt with there include minor road traffic offences such as speeding, tax certificates or national car test, NCT, certificates not being displayed.  That is as much information as the Department has.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next category is category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  There are three items, being Nos. 1872C, 1876C and 1886C, which we will discuss in private session.  They relate to the University of Limerick.  We will have a short private session before we sit in public session with our witnesses.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2072C from an individual, dated 25 March.  The individual raises a number of matters around the governance of KWETB and its failure to respond to questions raised.  The correspondence also raises questions about evidence given by witnesses from KWETB to this committee.  Do members want to discuss this?  We could get the permission of the person who wrote to us to forward the correspondence to the Department where the matters relating to the KWETB are being examined and seek to have a response put before the committee.  I propose writing to the chair of KWETB for a collated response to the specific matters in the evidence referred to by the correspondent.  Do members want to do that or will we hold it over for consideration with other KWETB correspondence?</p></speech>

Some of the legitimate points raised are issues for the board of KWETB.  Some of them refer to failure at the Department of Education and Skills.  Did we forward something to that Department on foot of the KWETB problems?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B01500"><p>We have not done that recently.  We had done it previously.  Do the Deputies suggest that we go through the points and divide them into matters relevant to the Department and those relevant to the internal workings of KWETB?  We will not follow up at this stage.  It is highly complicated and many issues will arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B01600"><p>We cannot do the work of the board.  That is not our function.  We have to separate these things out.  Perhaps we could go back to the individual and point out the things that are properly within the remit of the board and then strip out the other things.  We might then be able to see the wood for the trees.</p></speech>

I do not know whether this person is writing to us in desperation.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that we cannot do the work of the board-----</p></speech>

I have had a look at it.  Some items refer to the audit committee and other items ask why board meetings were not held to discuss particular matters before the KWETB's appearance here.  That is a matter for the board, not for this committee.  I will put on the record that we invite Accounting Officers or chairpersons of boards here every week.  It is not a requirement for those organisations that they have a board meeting before they appear here to instruct or suggest to the Accounting Officer or the chairman of the board how he or she should conduct himself or herself before this committee.  We would not be happy if that was the case, because it could be interpreted in all sorts of ways.  I do not necessarily agree that there should have been a board meeting specifically to discuss appearances before this committee.  The Accounting Officer is paid to report here and not to discuss his or her evidence with the board.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have any observations?</p></speech>

Challenges arose from the 2015 audit of KWETB and they have created considerable difficulties for the current chief executive and the board, as well as the Department.  There are questions about the adequacies of the governance systems and the points being raised here speak to the difficulties and challenges.  There are lessons to be learned but the question is what those lessons are.</p></speech>

It is serious when somebody has taken the trouble to write to us.  I do not wish to give the impression that we do not want to deal with it.  That is not correct at all.  We have given it a lot of time and we will give it more time.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said there were issues arising that gave cause for concern to his office, to the Department and to us.  The response has been a discussion, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and a direction with conditions and a time limit.

I will not get into any of the specifics because people will understand what we are discussing.  The person who has written to us questions why legal advice was withheld from the board, why two audit committee chairs have departed since September 2018, who the parties were to leases on which KWETB entered into agreements, the schedule of meetings between the board and the Department, whether complaints were being dealt with appropriately within the KWETB, if there were appropriate safeguards against abuse of the appointments system in the KWETB, and inaccurate or misleading statements at the recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which the KWETB attended.  There are also concerns because the clock is running down, with the board's term of office is due to end with the local elections very shortly.  Out of all those, only one is specifically directed to the Committee of Public Accounts.  All the others are very much internal matters and relate to how the board operates.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills had a watching brief after the 2012 report.  What emerged was a quite dysfunctional board and there is now a Garda inquiry into it.  A full independent report has been done so it is not a minor deal.  If the Department is going to have a watching brief or if it has issued a circular, we have to be sure it takes it seriously.</p></speech>

The State Claims Agency came before the committee and indicated that it had taken over dealing with all the section 38 organisations.  It received approximately &euro;4 billion in State funding for its activities and it is welcome that this has all been centralised under the State Claims Agency.  Local authorities were also here and I asked them if they had discussions about doing the same for local authorities, which also get approximately &euro;4 billion.  There are a lot of claims but there is no visibility or transparency as to how they were being dealt with, while there is at least some of that with the State Claims Agency.</p><p>Arising from that, Ms Dorothea Dowling, whose name is on the public record, wrote to the committee to compliment us, inquire about the matter and explain that she had been on the case and that it was due to be heard by the High Court.  We both have independently expressed a keen interest in the issue.  When we receive the ruling, we will consider it as part of our next interim report when we are dealing with the State Claims Agency, although I think we have to finalise our work in that regard.</p></speech>

The individual has provided a correction.  The briefing last week stated the individual was not granted a place on the roster and has taken an appeal to the High Court, but the correspondence states this is not correct.  The individual has stated the Department had made a number of complaints about him to the Information Commissioner in the High Court but that he was appealing it.  He stated that taking the High Court judgment to the Court of Appeal has caused him great personal cost.  I am happy to put the correction on the record, although I do not believe that it changes our decision that the selection process for the election roster is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.

We did not have the impression the latter set of employees was being addressed.  We need an update.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is accounts and statements received since the last meeting, and four slides will be shown on the screen.  The first concerns Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which has a clear audit opinion.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland has a clear audit opinion but the issue of superannuation entitlements is mentioned, as it is in accounts throughout the health sector.  The Law Reform Commission 2017 has a clear audit opinion.  Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, has a clear audit opinion and recognises a deferred pension funding asset.  Will Mr. McCarthy explain that?</p></speech>

The OSI is in a trading position, that is, it is selling product.  It recognises a deferred pension funding asset, where if its trading does not generate enough resources to pay pensions, the State will meet the liability in future.</p></speech>

Our target is for the end of this month.  I reiterate what the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment stated because the people did not fully grasp it . There was a debate in the D&aacute;il last week with the Minister on the issue, where he stated the Department was dealing with one tender and that he would bring a proposal to the Government in the near future.  That was picked up by the public and many people interpreted it as suggesting there would be a decision on the contracts.  The Secretary General, however, made it clear at the committee last week that the only proposal that would be made to the Government in the near future would be to appoint Brendan McCourt, or not, as the preferred bidder.  When the preferred bidder status is given, the Government remains under no contractual obligation.  It is not a contract for rural broadband.  It gives the Government certainty in order that it can then negotiate its infrastructural agreements with Eir and other bodies.  It now has some certainty to finalise the detailed costs.</p> <p>  When that is all put together, after whatever period of time, the Government can consider signing a contract, or otherwise.  There have been cases in the past where preferred bidders have been approved by the Cabinet, circumstances change, and ultimately the contract is never signed at a loss and cost to the preferred bidder because there are no contractual obligations.  The proposal to the Government is not to sign the national broadband plan contract but rather only to appoint the preferred bidder.  While it is a significant step along the way, it is not the entire process.  I am sure people understood that from the debate that emanated from the D&aacute;il last week, but the debate on the issue at the committee's meeting was more specific.  I am putting it on the record because the Deputy has raised the issue, and it might clarify the matter for the public.  Our target is the end of this month, which is only a few weeks away. </p></speech>

The latter is a non-sitting week.  We could meet then if we have prepared a draft report and members want to come to Dublin to discuss it.  However, members might not want to travel during a non-sitting week.  I am not recommending that, I am just making the point.  We will come back to that matter.</p> <p>  On 9 May, we will deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on overtime is relevant to that.  On 16 May we will resume dealing with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's financial statements.  We expect to have considered the PwC report in advance of that meeting.  We will meet the Courts Service on 23 May and on 30 May we will meet with representatives of the Department of Finance to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on EU transactions.  We will meet with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 13 June.  These are provisional arrangements.  The following week, the annual report of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will be published.  That will deal with an awful lot of issues on behalf of the State.  The HSE financial statements should be available in advance of 26 June.  We will try to deal with those before we go break for the summer.  After that, we have a scheduled meeting with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  We want to do that before the break as well.  That body's annual report will be out around the end of June.  It is just as well to have sight of its annual report before meeting with its representatives.  I thought we might have done it earlier, but the annual report will be out at the end of June.  The Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will be at that meeting.</p> <p>  These are provisional items.  We can come back and address others.  That is an approximate programme which is subject to change.

We are joined by Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, deputy secretary general; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Michael Kirrane, assistant secretary; Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Mr. Mark Wilson, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Clifford, principal officer; and by Ms Anne Marie Treacy, assistant principal from the Department of Justice and Equality, and Mr. John Burke, principal officer from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones should be switched off or switched to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent mode can interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions under Standing Orders to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will first hear an opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#H00500"><p>Vote 24 for the Department of Justice and Equality provides funding for a broad range of services and activities undertaken directly by the Department of Justice and Equality or funded by the Department through the provision of grants.  This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Reception and Integration Agency, the State pathology service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram which I have attached to this opening statement.</p> <p>  The policy and oversight remit of the Department has changed somewhat since the beginning of 2017.  This is reflected in the appropriation account.  Responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  In accordance with standard Government accounting procedures, the voted expenditure related to the authority for all of 2017 is reflected in the appropriation account of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Votes of the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.</p> <p>  The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;423 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes.  I have indicated those in the figure that is now on the screen.  The programmes are organised in line with statements of strategic objectives.  Note 3 of the appropriation account provides a breakdown of the programme spending under subheads that indicate the instruments used by the Department to achieve those objectives.  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote totalled just over &euro;66 million in 2017.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  The net expenditure on the Vote was approximately &euro;22 million less than was provided for in the 2017 Estimate.</p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with EU and national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Department in 2017.  Further detail in this regard is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#H00700"><p>The Department's Vote is one of six Votes which currently makes up the justice Vote group.  The justice and equality Vote, which we are examining today, accounts for 18% of gross expenditure in the overall Vote group; the Garda Vote accounts for 64% of gross expenditure; prisons and courts are 13% and 5% of gross expenditure, respectively, with the remaining Votes for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission accounting for less than 1%.  However, our focus today is on Vote 24, the justice and equality Vote.</p> <p>  The Department's Vote covers a wide remit, encompassing both the administrative divisions of the Department and a broad range of offices and agencies across the justice sector.  In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads reflected across five expenditure programmes which are set out in the briefing material and which support the Department&rsquo;s overall vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  The remit of the Department is broad and diverse and includes subheads relating to commissions and special inquiries, civil and criminal legal aid, immigration and asylum accommodation, the Probation Service, equality, integration and disability, and a range of other services, including offices and agencies such as the Data Protection Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, forensic science and State pathology laboratories, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and so forth.</p> <p>  As there is no specific chapter relating to the justice and equality Vote in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017, I propose to focus briefly on a few areas within the Vote where there has been developments in the last couple of years.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that the Department is undergoing a major transformation programme at present.</p><p>This arises from the Government's acceptance of the final report of the effectiveness and renewal group, ERG, in June 2018, following significant political and public debate.  This programme aims to develop a future operating model that embraces the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, which enhances organisational agility and responsiveness and places the Department of Justice and Equality at the forefront of developments in the Irish Civil Service.</p><p> I am pleased to say that significant progress is being made.  The Department has now been realigned under two executive pillars each headed up by a deputy secretary, with Ms Oonagh Buckley heading up the civil justice and equality pillar and Ms Oonagh McPhillips, who is with me today, heading up the criminal justice pillar.  The two executive pillars will be supported by a central corporate pillar.  A new corporate governance structure reflecting this realignment came into operation from January 2019.  The second phase involves the Department designing and implementing a new operating model and organisational structure in the two executive pillars based on five core functions, namely, policy, operations, transparency, governance and legislation.  </p><p> The transformation programme is being overseen by a programme board chaired by myself and including the Secretary General to the Government, the Secretary General of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Vote assistant secretary for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will ensure that the programme is conducted in accordance with good governance principles, that it is delivered on time, within budget and that the design solutions are appropriate.  In addition, the ERG continues to provide its input and produces quarterly progress reports, which are published on the Department website.  </p><p> The Department has completed the high-level design of the new operating model and structure and has now moved to detailed design.  The programme is due for completion by early October this year.  Funding for this programme has been provided in the justice and equality Vote in 2019.   </p><p> There is also a very significant policing reform programme ongoing in relation to the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Department is facilitating and supporting this programme including the provision of funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist with certain work under the programme.   </p><p> I would also like to mention the Data Protection Commission, DPC, which has received significant additional funding in recent years to build the organisation's capacity and capability in preparation for the DPC's enhanced regulatory powers and more prominent international role under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  These increased resources have facilitated the recruitment of additional staff, including legal, technical, audit and investigations specialists, as well as policy and administrative staff.  The budget allocation of the organisation increased from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;7.2 million in 2017 and has increased further to &euro;15.2 million in 2019.  This resource level will enable the DPC to continue to build the organisation's knowledge and capability in the performance of its expanded statutory role as an EU-wide regulator and lead supervisory authority for the large multinational technology companies, many of which have their European headquarters in Ireland.  </p><p> Committee members will be well aware of the pressures in our accommodation system for asylum seekers.  The Department is currently managing a total of 6,497 international protection applicants, including 5,980 residing in our accommodation centres with a further 517 applicants in emergency hotel accommodation.  At the end of 2016, the Department was accommodating 4,425.  However, by the end of 2017, the number had risen to 5,096 persons, an increase of 15%, and, at the end of 2018, there were 6,106 persons in accommodation.  The increasing numbers to be accommodated is a significant part of the challenge facing the asylum system.  A process to support residents moving into mainstream housing is being finalised through the establishment of a dedicated unit working with centre managers, NGOs, and local authorities.  </p><p> Another expanding area in the Department is the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, which has grown considerably in scale and scope since it was established in 2005.  INIS now comprises approximately one third of all staff in the Department of Justice and Equality, processing over 250,000 applications a year.  The role of INIS has expanded over recent years to include areas such as border management at Dublin Airport, immigration registrations in the Dublin metropolitan area and the newly-established Irish passenger information unit.  INIS has put a service improvement plan in place for the period 2018 to 2020 which, while ambitious in scope, is also realistic.  The actions can be delivered within the timeframes set out and a strong programme board has been established to make sure that is the case.  Some early reforms have included the introduction of plain language in all INIS application forms, the launch of INIS Online, a new customer portal that will allow all applications and payments to be submitted online by the end of March 2020, and the establishment of a change management unit within INIS to drive innovation and best practice in project and change management.  </p><p> It is clear to all of us working in the Department that the demands we face in the immigration area are likely to continue to grow over the coming years.  Meeting those demands requires that we seek to deliver our services in different ways, and to increase our efficiency, while also improving customer experiences.  These objectives are entirely compatible with the overall departmental transformation programme.  </p><p> The year under examination, 2017, was of course an important year in the development of a strategic approach to equality.  Four major equality strategies were launched that year: the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the national disability inclusion strategy and the migrant integration strategy.  These represent a whole-of-Government approach to addressing the needs of diverse groups and to ensuring their equal participation in Irish society.  Each strategy was developed and is being implemented with the involvement of the groups that each is designed to serve.  This was also the year in which the Irish State formally recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.  This landmark recognition is a key step forward in fostering a society which respects and celebrates diverse identities.  In that context, my Department is currently developing a national LGBTI strategy, which will be published later this year.  </p><p> I note that Brexit has been a significant area of work since the UK referendum and this remains the case.  The Department of Justice and Equality shares this agenda with all other Departments and is working within the highly co-ordinated whole-of-Government structures led by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that members have.</p></speech>

I also thank the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for his briefing documents because they are very helpful.  I also offer congratulations to the Department on a clear audit except in relation to procurement, which I will come to.</p> <p>  My attention was caught by the list of positive strategies that Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned and the news that the Department is about to establish another one for gay, lesbian and transexual people.  There are four major equality strategies and they are wonderful on paper.  How are those implemented in different Departments and in budgetary considerations?  Are there practical measures for the proofing of decisions taken by Government?</p></speech>

I agree that it is important.</p> <p>  There is a very strong follow-up process for the strategies I mentioned.  The purpose of the strategies is to drive a whole-of-Government approach to create a situation wherein there are a large number of actions under each of these strategies.</p></speech>

Regular progress reports are compiled.</p></speech>

Each of the actions is itself related to the equality objective.  There is a whole set of actions under the Traveller strategy for each Department.  Our role and the role of the Minister of State is to make sure that each of those bodies is doing what it should.  That is built into their work programmes, strategy statements and so on.  In that sense, it is equality proofed.</p></speech>

It is internal within the Department, which is going through a transformation which I will not have time to go into today, and it is perhaps for the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to address anyway.  There were serious problems with the Department and that is why it is going through a transformation and why we have had many reports such as the Toland report.  I will leave that aside.  The Magdalen scheme is being administered under the Department.  What has been learned with regard to administering the scheme effectively for people who are very vulnerable?  What appeal process is there so that they do not resort to us in desperation, telling us that they have not been answered?  That is not entirely fair to Mr. O'Driscoll because I have not given him all the details, but that is what I have been told.</p></speech>

I respect the confidentiality of the Deputy's communications, but if there is a case that she wants to draw our attention to, I would be happy to look at it.  With regard to the applications that have been received, nine have been paid and two offers are outstanding.  Ten have been deemed not eligible.  There has been back-and-forth with the applicants to deem some to be eligible and others not.  In other cases, additional information is required and that is covered by the data-sharing agreement.  We hope with that in place that we can move quickly to payments.</p></speech>

I am looking at a different part of Mr. O'Driscoll's report, on the cost of tribunals, which he has kindly outlined to us.  We are now at almost &euro;70 million for the Morris tribunal.  There is a long list of them.  In that context, we are talking about a tiny amount of money.  I will not dwell on it but I would like a note from Mr. O'Driscoll on how long the process takes from when somebody applies.  What appeal has been put in place?  Is it external to the Department?  What external people are on it?  We have been through it with Caranua and I would not like people to go through what the applicants to Caranua went through.  We should learn.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll referred to asylum figures in his statement and gave us the up-to-date figure.  Does that include the relocation and resettlement applicants?  Mr. O'Driscoll has given a total figure of 5,980, with 517 in emergency hotel accommodation.  That is a figure of 6,497.</p></speech>

There are 729 children who have status and should not be in direct provision.  Let us return to chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which deals with procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.

It was a question of getting value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was highlighting that it was not going to procurement for private providers but that the Department was going through a process of inviting expressions of interest and so on before negotiating an agreement.  He pointed out clearly in that chapter that the conditions or criteria necessary for the negotiated procedure were not in place.  However, the Department proceeded with the negotiated procedure in any event and took issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General at the time.  I believe those recommendations were made in 2015.  What has changed since then?  Has the Department changed its negotiated procedure?</p></speech>

Correct me if I am wrong but there is a process for State-owned centres, where that is contracted.  It is done by procurement and companies or people are brought in to run the services.  Then there is direct provision which is not done by procurement and the Department enters into a negotiated agreement.  That issue was raised back in 2015.

This is an important point.  We are now rolling it out throughout the country.  Obviously, it is a process of change from the old system.</p> <p>  On value for money, we are now in a position to start comparing the results of tendering with those from the original approach of negotiation.  I do not want to draw a firm conclusion on this yet, but a preliminary conclusion is that there is not a huge saving.  It is difficult to judge because we are constantly raising the standards that we require.  The standards under the new tender system are higher than they would have been under the old negotiated system.</p></speech>

I was not in the Department then, but in fairness to it, when one looks at this objectively, the Department was trying to cope with those increased numbers.  It was certainly conscious of the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusions and did move and has moved to a tender basis now.  In that tender basis, it has also moved to the requirement for higher standards within the centres.</p></speech>

These are mainly things related to forensic science, in fact, and ICT, which is a normal issue with those kinds of contracts.  Two were specialist but they were very small and only amounted to &euro;74,000 so they are not a significant factor here.  The main other element was 22 contract extensions.  That amounted to &euro;4.3 million.  My understanding is that these arose for a variety of reasons.  One was legal delays in respect of putting contracts in place.  Another was delays in putting in place the Government cloud arrangement in particular and some delays in putting in place Office of Government Procurement, OGP, frameworks.  As the OGP frameworks have rolled out, most Departments are gradually converting to their use but there was some delay in the roll-out.  The progress in 2018 is significantly due to the availability of contracts under the OGP framework.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions specific to the Vote we are considering this morning so I will be going a little bit off the reservation after my initial questions.  Like Deputy Connolly, I congratulate the Department on a clear audit opinion and offer continued good wishes to the new team at its helm.  I said in private session that I did not have a question relevant to the immigration side but I do have one.  I am totally in favour of us playing our global part in terms of the acceptance and welcome of refugees.  They are very welcome.  In terms of their placement, I am conscious that there has been procurement of locations in Moville, County Donegal and in Roosky, County Roscommon, to prepare for this.  It seems logical that larger towns and cities might be better placed to seamlessly integrate and welcome different nationalities.  Is demographic analysis done to inform decisions to place a large number of refugees in a small location like Roosky or a relatively small location like Moville, as opposed to the likes of Letterkenny, Roscommon, Sligo, Athlone or Dublin?  Again I emphasise that they are very welcome.</p></speech>

The tenders we are doing at the moment, as I said earlier, are done on a regional basis.  We run a tender for a segment of the country, for example for two or three counties.  We then have to see who comes forward in those counties with an offer.</p></speech>

That methodology is flawed and probably feeds what can sometimes be accused of being racism, although I do not believe it to be racism, where smaller locations are anticipating that a former hotel or other large building might contribute to their recovery in terms of tourism in the future.  We need to prioritise where the people we are welcoming are going, for them to have the maximum ease while at the same time not upsetting the demographic balance of a particular small location.</p><p>I know the witnesses do not have an answer today but perhaps they could take it on board.</p><p> I want to divert to other matters.  I know the clerk will be concerned about this but it is in the interests of using our time most efficiently.  Neither the witnesses nor the committee is in a position to have the delegation before us as regularly as all of us might like.  I will put some points on record with respect to the Irish Prison Service.  Following our meeting on 17 January, I was accused on the public airwaves by the Prison Officers Association, POA, of seeking to shut down the mess committees.  I am also informed that briefings are being held by the POA in prisons throughout the country, with members being told not to communicate with Deputies and that I in particular was seeking to shut down mess committees.  It is totally incorrect to say there was any move to shut down facilities available to hard-working prison officers for hot meals and I would be to the fore in opposing same.  That is not to confuse my wish for the appropriate procedures to be in place.  I thought it peculiar that the Prison Officers Association would take to the national airwaves or provide a briefing in this way when in the same meeting I was highlighting issues of critical importance, such as sexual harassment, career blocking and illegal surveillance of that association's members.  Nevertheless, it is what the association chose to do.  I am on the side of the ordinary prison officer but, in line with our constitutional responsibility in here, I am also on the side of appropriate procedures and protection for staff and so on.</p><p> As a result of the meeting of 17 January relating to the prison service and subsequent research, I am concerned there may be a parallel investigative, judicial and enforcement system in operation across and within individual prisons when it comes to alleged wrongdoing by prison staff.  Therefore I have a number of questions for the Secretary General, although I fully appreciate that he does not have the Irish Prison Service team with him today.  I accept fully that he may not be in a position to answer questions and if he is not, we can move on and perhaps he can revert to us, preferably in writing.  When will the report of the preliminary investigation carried out by the Inspector of Prisons arising from section 31(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 be published?</p></speech>

The Minister is required to lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas and publish it.  It will follow very quickly from that.

It will be some time between now and October then.  From the committee's perspective, the sooner the better in that regard.  In Mr. O'Driscoll's response to issues raised at our meeting of 17 January, he confirmed with regard to surveillance the use of firms for approximately &euro;18,000 in one case and &euro;10,500 in another.  He went on to state "It is not possible from the information available to determine if these payments relate to the surveillance of prison staff."  He further states that he had sent the invoices to the Inspector of Prisons, and I presume that is to assist with her investigation.  Why would he not have asked the surveillance companies in question to inform the answer to us and why would he not have contacted the head of operations of the Irish Prison Service, who is the line authority for the approval of such expenditure?</p></speech>

The Inspector of Prisons was asked by the Minister to undertake the process of writing a report and it is now under consideration by the Attorney General and Department staff.  It will go to the Minister shortly and that process must play out.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is saying these matters may have direct relevance to her report so he cannot answer.  Okay.  At a previous meeting, between the Department's last appearance before the committee, I alluded to the fact that documentation arrived anonymously to me at Leinster House some weeks ago.  I said I would seek legal advice on same and I have.  The contents of this documentation are a matter of major concern for me.  I do not want the clerk to panic at this stage and nobody is going to be named here.  I do want to make a point, however, and I have taken legal advice on what I am about to say.</p> <p>  These appear to be a list of profiles of people who may have been and may still be serving prison officers or contractors.  It includes what I would describe as personal detailed information and allegations of wrongdoing.  The documentation gives detailed accounts of movements of a person or persons in areas outside a prison environment with dates, times, addresses and vehicle registration numbers.  The providence of this information, according to these documents, if genuine, would implicate the operational support group of the Prison Service in surveillance and intelligence gathering outside the prison environment.  As a result of the nature and content of these documents, which are here, I will today forward a copy to each of the Garda Commissioner and the Data Protection Commissioner as the relevant authorities.  Naturally, this is a matter of major concern to me, as I assume it is to the Secretary General.</p> <p>  The Chairman should stop me whenever my time is up as I want to come in for a second round.  Is the Department or the Irish Prison Service, to the witness's knowledge, aware of an instance of a Prison Service employee with responsibility for stores in any of our prisons whom it is alleged has sold prison stores items on the Internet?  Can he confirm whether this person was simply allowed to resign as opposed to being subjected to the appropriate Garda investigation, prosecution, penalties and loss recovery to the State?  If the Department is not aware of such an instance, will Mr. O'Driscoll make all the necessary inquiries?</p></speech>

All of these issues have financial implications for the State.  That is why I am using this opportunity to put them on record.  I would be grateful if the Garda took an interest in the transcript of today's meeting.  I would say the same of the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is why I am asking whether the Department will make the necessary inquiries.  I do not want to take an adversarial position with the Secretary General on this matter, but prudence demands that these matters be examined.  They are reasonable questions.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is free to do what he chooses, but I know what I will do as Chairman.</p> <p>  We will move on.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has had to leave for a moment.

There are 5,980 people in accommodation centres and 517 in hotels, totalling 6,497.  I believe Mr. O'Driscoll stated that these figures had probably increased.  The growth figures outlined in his opening statement are significant.  He stated that Ireland had committed to receiving 4,000 persons under the refugee protection programme.  How many are anticipated in 2019?</p></speech>

In principle, it is possible that all of them could arrive in 2019.  Realistically, some of them will spill into 2020.</p></speech>

In that context, has the Department identified through its engagements properties that would allow it to take that amount of people this year?</p></speech>

We are under pressure on all fronts.  The refugee programme may pose less of a problem in the sense that we can at least anticipate who is arriving and when.  It is done through refugee programmes with a variety of UN and other bodies.  We will know that, for example, 40 people are arriving and what their family configurations are.  We can ensure that appropriate housing is available.  That is quite different from the asylum seeker situation where someone just turns up at Dublin Airport or the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, office on Burgh Quay.  We have no forewarning, but the person has to be housed that night.  They are different challenges.  I am not saying that the refugee programme is easy to manage, as it is not, but it does not pose the same challenges in terms of immediacy of response that the asylum seeker situation does.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Driscoll spoke about the communication process with local authorities and working with them.  He also mentioned the pressures in the Department's accommodation system, which was putting it mildly.  In terms of the challenges that the Department experiences from place to place, does it work with local authorities regarding expressions of interest from properties, their suitability and the potential sensitivities in order to avoid the types of incident that have occurred previously?</p></speech>

We have heard in the case of these sections of the community - I only say sections because it is not reflective of all of the community - things being cited such as medical, education and childcare issues as reasons for non-suitability.  Let us say there is engagement with the CEO in Roscommon, the director of housing in that area or the local government management association nationwide and that they say yes, that they do fit into the suitability criteria and that the Department is able to come out, front and centre, before the protests happen in the first instance.  I am interested in hearing about that matter.</p></speech>

We see the challenge the Department is facing.  Mr. Wilson said using hotel accommodation was a short-term solution.  That was in September and already the numbers are growing.  Owing to the challenges being faced by the Department, my fear is that it will become a long-term solution.  From January to March, the cost was &euro;3.4 million.  As the Secretary General rightly said, there is a housing crisis.  In identifying suitable accommodation will the hotel aspect become like the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme when suddenly the cost will spiral out of control?  We have the perfect storm with the housing crisis being compounded by the challenges facing the Department in identifying suitable properties such that hotels are becoming a solution when people present.  Only God knows to what the cost could rise by the end of the year.  In meeting the challenges encountered by the Department on a daily basis I am afraid that using hotel accommodation has become an option.  Is my assessment correct?  What is the Department's long-term strategy to nip the problem in the bud to prevent using hotel accommodation from becoming a crutch in the way the HAP scheme has in dealing with the housing crisis?</p></speech>

We do not want to provide emergency accommodation in hotels.  We do not want to be involved in that business.  It is not what we want to do.  I hope the regional tender processes in seeking accommodation solutions will result in increased capacity to deal with the increased numbers we are facing.</p> <p>  In answering Deputy Connolly I did say - I also made the point in my opening remarks - that we had to be open to considering other solutions which would be completely different.  They include engagement with NGOs, housing associations and so on on what accommodation they might be able to offer.</p> <p>  We have another problem.  The number in hotel accommodation is over 500, while the number with status in our system is over 700.  Based on simple mathematics, if we were able to move more people with status into normal housing, we would not be involved in the hotel business.</p></speech>

I am going to drill down into the detail that.  This revolves around what we interpret in terms of whether people should be able to have washing and cooking facilities or the security of a front door in their own area as opposed to a central area.  We raised these issues during previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will raise it again.  I come from Meath.  The matter has been covered extensively by local media there and so forth.  When the centre opened, what was the initial estimate regarding the length of time it would remain in operation?  What lease was agreed with Mr. McCluskey?  What is the policy for it as a centre in terms of the model of long-term accommodation?</p></speech>

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the cost to the State of hiring that facility up to December 2016 was &euro;101 million to the State.  One provider has received &euro;101 million in State funding for one centre housing 600 people.  I think I am within my rights to ask about that particular centre.  That is my view.  Perhaps the Chairman will indicate whether it is fair to do pursue this matter?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the facilities at Mosney.  I am completely new to this so I am casting a fresh eye on it.  I only joined the Department six months ago.  I visited Mosney.  The facilities there for families are not the kind of facilities that we would want people living in long-term.  I will come back to that point.</p></speech>

I am saying that previously when we discussed the matter here that was not done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#Q01800"><p>Significant refurbishment was done and the facilities were very good, it seemed to me, especially around education and health, the fact that people have individual doors and can do their own cooking.  We have moved to a situation whereby already more than 50% of people in accommodation centres can do their own cooking.  We are trying to move to a point where everyone will be in that position.  This has, rightly, been a sensitive issue.  People want to have that independence of action.</p> <p>  I am keen to make one point though.  What is acceptable for accommodation for someone for a short time is different to what is acceptable for someone for accommodation for a long period.  Numerous issues intersect here.  One relates to standards in the facilities.  As has already been pointed out, they are being substantially enhanced.  Under the new tender arrangements, the standards are higher again.  All involve cooking facilities and so on.</p> <p>  The second point relates to the question the speed with which applications are processed.  We go through the International Protection Office, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and so on.  We are also trying to address that.  In other words, we are trying to get faster movement through the system so that people do not end up staying in the facilities for a long time.  There has been significant improvement in this in recent years, but there is a great deal more to be done.  We want to get to a point where people spend a relatively short time &ndash; I am referring to periods of months rather than years &ndash; in these facilities while they are waiting for a first decision and perhaps appeal to the tribunal.  The next step beyond that is where people choose to take judicial review.  That is more difficult to predict.  We certainly want a situation whereby people are not in these facilities long-term.  I am simply making the point that a facility that one would consider acceptable for a short-term period is different from a facility that we would want people to be in long term.</p></speech>

As stated, I accept that there had been refurbishment at the facility.  It was fair to make the point that this took place after significant media coverage in respect of the conditions there.  I accept what has been done but I have raised the point previously at this committee that there had been what would be considered subhuman conditions there.  The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, had previously raised the question of the points system that exists for the purchase of food for families and babies and the cost of baby food as well as what families need to raise children.  That had been previously raised by the Ombudsman.  That is not a political charge; it was raised by the Ombudsman.  I take the view these are fair points to make given the amount of money being spent by the State in the hiring of this centre.</p> <p>  A total of 729-----</p></speech>

Mosney is unusual in that it is both an accommodation centre for asylum seekers &ndash; what is known as a direct provision centre &ndash; and also an emergency reception and orientation centre, EROC, a place where we put refugees for the initial period of adjustment.  When they arrive first, they go to a centre and then they move on within a period of months to permanent housing.  Mosney has both.  Maybe that is what the note is referring to.</p></speech>

From my understanding of the figures presented to the committee by the Department, not one of the centres meets this criterion.  In fact, some centres are operating at 100% capacity.  The lowest capacity I could find is in the HSE southern area at 94%.</p></speech>

It must be remembered that capacity is one matter in terms of number of beds.  It is not that simple, however, because families arrive with particular configurations and have to be accommodated.  Getting to 100% capacity is quite difficult in a centre.  As we expand the number of centres under the tender, hopefully, we can reduce this pressure somewhat.  That it is the objective of the exercise.</p></speech>

The target is to be operating at 90% capacity but it is currently at 97%.  Will the new centres that will be brought on-stream bring down this figure or will it remain in excess of 90%?</p></speech>

I return to my earlier point, however.  We have to respond to the number of people who turn up and claim asylum.  We do not have an accurate way of predicting this.  The flows tend to change over time.  The objective is to get down to a position where we have spare capacity.  That is what one needs to cope with unpredictable demand.</p></speech>

We use it for management purposes.  We track it, which is sensible for the reasons suggested by the Deputy.  At the same time, we have to balance that against the fact that we have to respond to what comes in on a tender.  We try to balance these two factors as best we can.  Regarding the long-term housing of those who achieve status, an allocation system which reflects population densities and so forth is being developed with the CCMA.</p> <p>  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the long-term housing of people is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.

It is my understanding that the first step in that process is to actually forward the complaint to the agency or private company which is running the centre?  Will the Department accept that this is not an ideal process because many people would be reluctant to forward any complaints about a centre to the people actually running it?</p></speech>

It is open to the resident to go directly to the Ombudsman should they so wish.  The Ombudsman visits most centres and did so in 2018.  He found that most of the issues being brought to his attention were able to be resolved locally with the local manager at the point in time when he visited the centre.  As to whether there is a culture whereby it is difficult for residents to complain, it was referred to in the last Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  However, it was qualified by stating there was no evidence available to him to confirm that concern.</p></speech>

In other words, 14% of the population of children living in direct provision centres would have had referrals to the Child and Family Agency, which was significantly higher than the percentage for those not within direct provision centres.

We reviewed our child protection policy after the Children First Act 2015.  The managers of a centre have become the mandated persons for the purposes of making referrals to the Child and Family Agency.  We have provided training to those managers and a practice document in support of that.  Effectively, the centre manager, as the mandated person, makes the referral to the Child and Family Agency.</p></speech>

With regard to the types of referrals and whether they would reach the threshold for an initial assessment to be done, in direct provision centres the figure stands at 85% and outside direct provision centres it stands at 50%.  In my opinion, from reading the information we have, there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  What steps are being taken to try to address this?</p></speech>

Many of them have come through quite traumatic experiences and we are very conscious of that.  This would obviously apply to the children as much as to the adults, and they may have experienced any number of challenges in their young lives.  For that reason, we have a specific child protection policy for accommodation centres.  Child safeguarding statements are published, and so on, and accommodation centres which have children provide a whole series of facilities for them.  Of course, there is direct engagement with the HSE and Tusla around children's services.  The higher level of referrals is something we should be very concerned about but it may also reflect, to some extent, proactivity in dealing with the challenges that we know people in our centres have, which is very important.  This applies to adults but it particularly applies, in the context of the Deputy's question, to children.</p></speech>

It is because I had to leave the room to attend another meeting.</p> <p>  I want to refer to page 3 of the opening statement in regard to data protection.  Many multinational companies have their European headquarters in Ireland and they are particularly in the area where data and data protection is a very prominent issue.  We are essentially the European regulator, not just the Irish regulator.  Is there work going on in regard to scoping out that obligation, given it is a big obligation?  Are there any indicative costs associated with that?</p></speech>

The Office of the Data Protection Commission became the Data Protection Commission, DPC, under the new Act, and there is a subtle difference.  In the transition from one to the other, detailed work was done on what were the responsibilities that would fall on the Data Protection Commission in Ireland in the context of the new GDPR.  That was done and there was very rapid expansion in funding for the DPC which, as I indicated in my opening statement, went from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;19.5 million in 2019.  One would be hard put to find any other agency that has had a scale of increase in funding of that sort.  That has mainly been around providing additional people with specific skills for the DPC because of the role the Deputy has just mentioned.</p> <p>  We are very conscious, first, that the DPC has a role in regard to advising all companies and proactively dealing with complaints and so on, and it received some 4,000 complaints in 2018, if I remember correctly.  In regard to activities in Ireland, these are the normal DPC functions that one would expect.  However, we are also very conscious, obviously, and the DPC is very conscious, of its responsibilities in the context of these companies being headquartered here.  The Deputy was right to say the DPC has to take a lead role in the EU and is seen as the lead in the EU in that data protection regulation role.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the communications committee was told it would not be able to release a report into the public services card until it got the go-ahead from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is the lead Department in that regard.

However, that does not specifically relate to the fixed charge notice issue which was simply overtaken by events and it was decided, therefore, not to proceed with that particular issue.  However, we have provided the additional resources to allow it to undertake the investigations which it must.  I do not wish to hog the time, but it may be relevant to state that, of course, the commission now comes under the reform of policing proposed in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and there will, therefore, be further developments on that front.</p></speech>

I do not wish to repeat myself, but prisons is a separate Vote.  I am the Accounting Officer for it.  There is a separate Vote for the Garda and for which the Garda Commissioner is Accounting Officer.  Some of the issues raised by the Deputy would be more appropriately raised when discussing the Garda Vote with the Commissioner or in the context of the prisons Vote.   On many of these issues, I am happy to take questions regarding other Votes but I will have to reply in writing to those questions.</p></speech>

On page 16, it is noted that the estimate for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was &euro;7.5 million but the outturn was &euro;6.1 million.  That primarily relates to payroll expenditure.  What is the reason for that underspend?</p></speech>

We made provision for the full planned expansion within the year but, obviously, recruitment takes time, particularly in the case of the highly skilled staff required by the commissioner.  Quite simply, the recruitment did not reach the level envisaged when the Vote was formed.  As I stated, there has been a very significant increase in the staffing level of that office.  There was a 33% increase in staffing in 2016, 57% in 2017 and 47% in 2018.  It is an unparalleled increase in staffing numbers and it is not particularly surprising that the process took a little longer than was envisaged when we were preparing the estimate.</p></speech>

On whether there is sufficient capacity, one very important area that is an expanding responsibility of the Probation Service is the management of community service.  There is a process of recruiting community service supervisors.  Community service is expanding and, as I understand it, is proving to be extremely effective.  However, it has not expanded at the anticipated rate.  I expect it to expand further as various issues are ironed out and I will not be surprised if the Probation Service needs additional staff in that respect.  I hope that the director of the Probation Service does not take that as an absolute commitment from his Accounting Officer.  I am just pointing it out to the committee as an area where we are expanding and the Probation Service is doing this job.</p></speech>

I do not have the specific figures in front of me but I understand that there is a panel in place.  I take the Deputy's broader point and agree with her 100%.  This is exactly the direction of travel we want to take.  If one looks at the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is highly relevant.  It takes a much more holistic view of policing and managing vulnerable people who become involved in crime and so on.  The direction of travel is to divert people, in particular young people, away from prison and so on and into these more social work type services where they can hopefully be helped to develop a fulfilling life away from crime.</p></speech>

I will start with direct provision and asylum seekers, albeit a lot of the questions have been asked already.  There are just some issues I wanted to have clarified.  There are a lot of myths around asylum seekers as I am sure the witnesses are aware.  What exactly is direct provision in the sense of what it entitles a person to?  What is directly provided for and what is the weekly subsistence rate a person in a direct provision centre gets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#U01700"><p>The most important point to make about direct provision is that approximately 75% of people who seek asylum end up in direct provision.  It is possible for people to turn it down.  It is an offer, not a requirement.  Approximately 25% of people choose not to take up the offer and they live with family, friends or whatever it is.  The figures on that have varied over the years as I understand it.  In fact, the figures for people who chose not to go into direct provision were significantly higher some years ago and have been lower in other years.  That is a very important point about direct provision.  In that sense, it is voluntary.  It is voluntary, recognising, however, that people very often turn up with nothing.  They have to take what they can get in that context, I suppose.  The rate of payment is handled by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It has been increased from &euro;21.60 per adult to &euro;38.80 per adult per week and from &euro;15.60 per child to &euro;29.80 per child.  This is in the context of the direct provision arrangement, which provides for housing, full board, basic medical requirements and so on.  Every asylum seeker in direct provision has a medical card, which is also covered in the normal way.  Of course, they also have access to education facilities.  The payment has to be understood in that context.  It is from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

There are individual freedoms a person does not have because he or she is in a centre.  We have the figures on how long people are in these centres and I will get to those in a second.  Obviously, there is a direct correlation between the asylum process and the length of time it takes to process claims and how long people stay in the system.  The Department is responsible for the asylum applications process.  What work has been done recently or what changes have been made in recent years to speed up the asylum process and ensure applications can be processed more quickly so that people are less dependent on direct provision, one way or another?  If asylum is granted, the person is a refugee who can work and enjoy those freedoms they do not have in direct provision centres.  What changes have been made in recent years to speed up the process and what is the average wait time for someone who applies to have an adjudication on his or her application?</p></speech>

Mr. Kirrane will outline some of that in a moment.  I would like to pick up on one of the Deputy's points.  It is important to say that people in the accommodation centres have full rights.  They are not confined there.  They are not detained there.  They come and go and everything else.  Of course we assume everybody would prefer to move onto normal housing.</p></speech>

When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and RIA were before the committee two years ago - Mr. O'Driscoll's predecessor was here - I put it on the record that what Mr. O'Driscoll has described has not been my experience across the board.  I have had experience of having to visit reception centres in the past.  Things have changed, thankfully.  They are private entities which are run privately.  Some of them have different rules.  When I was a member of Waterford City and County Council a number of years ago, I was invited by the residents to visit one of these centres.  When I turned up, I was refused entry.  I was asked to seek an appointment.  When I sought an appointment, it was refused to me by management.</p></speech>

A number of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, were invited in to assist and support people who were living in these centres.  As Mr. O'Driscoll has spoken about rights, I should mention that people have a right to vote in local elections.  I was refused permission to canvass even though everyone has a right to canvass Mr. O'Driscoll or anybody else in this room or elsewhere.  The people living in this centre were not allowed to be canvassed.  On the basis of being refused permission to canvass, I subsequently wrote to the residents.  The letters I sent to each of them were posted directly to the reception centre.  Those letters were opened and put in the bin by the manager of the centre.  To me, that does not suggest that their rights are the same as those of anybody else.  Although things have changed since then, I do not believe the individual freedoms associated with living in one's own home, whether it is through social housing or private housing, are afforded to people who live in reception centres.  I do not accept that all the freedoms enjoyed by Mr. O'Driscoll and me are being enjoyed at this point in time by people in direct provision centres.  Notwithstanding the change that has allowed some people to work, there are still some people who are not allowed to work.  People cannot work up to nine months.  Mr. O'Driscoll has to accept that there are freedoms which are denied.  I am not saying that things have not changed.  I accept fully that they have.  I am conscious of the positive changes that have happened.  I still hold the view that the rights enjoyed by these people are not the same as the rights that Mr. O'Driscoll or I might enjoy.</p></speech>

I was speaking in the present tense.  We are very conscious that in the past, a number of Deputies raised the issue of being able to canvass people, meet residents and so on.  I think a lot of progress has been made on that.  If there are any issues that arise from time to time, I ask people to notify us in order that we can sort them out.  People make mistakes.  My understanding now is that people have the right to canvass.  In fairness, I have been in a few centres.  In one centre I visited, I could not see that there should be any problem in canvassers accessing the place in a perfectly normal way.  In another centre, it was more difficult to say exactly which space was the private communal space, to which one would not realistically expect canvassers to have access, and which space was the public space.  Distinguishing those things is not always absolutely crystal clear.  As I have said, people can make mistakes.</p> <p>  I will explain what I think about all of those things and why I reacted to what the Deputy said.  I was not reacting to the Deputy's comment, in particular.  From time to time, there is public comment which grossly exaggerates the constraints under which people operate.  I accept that they are operating under constraints.  The Deputy is quite right to say they do not have the right to work for the first nine months.  That is a right enjoyed by the Deputy and me.  That is absolutely true.  In many cases, these people are coming from difficult circumstances and are probably finding it difficult to navigate our services as they access them for the first time.  We try to assist them in that.  They have rights in that space which we try to vindicate.  The broader point I wanted to make was a simple one.  I want to make it clear that people have freedoms here and that some of the commentary out there is a bit unfair.</p></speech>

It is a fair point for Mr. O'Driscoll to make as Accounting Officer.  I have no difficulty with that.  I agree that positive changes have been made.  I have seen them on the ground in my constituency of Waterford.  I fully accept that.  I think we have a long way to go as well.  I ask Mr. Kirrane to come back in on the changes that have been made with the asylum process and the application process.</p></speech>

There was an initial period in which a transitional arrangement under the Act required a lot of cases to come back under that Act.  That created some problems initially.  Approximately 3,500 cases had to be dealt with before new cases could start to be dealt with under the Act.  That created a difficulty which has not substantially been dealt with.  The average processing time moved out as a result and is approximately 19.7 months at present.</p></speech>

To put that into perspective, we have received precisely that number of new applications since 1 January.  We are catching up rapidly.  We have expanded the staff in this area to deal with the caseload.  There are approximately 144 staff in the International Protection Office, along with 70 legal panel members who hear cases.

I was here years ago, when the numbers were much higher, and the same thing was said verbatim.  We were told that the numbers were dropping and the service was getting there.  We have been here before.  Five years ago, I heard Ministers saying verbatim what Mr. Kirrane has just said.  I would like the committee to be given a longer-term perspective that is not confined to where we are today.  We would like to see how it has moved.

Approximately 10.5% of people in reception centres have been there for between four and seven years.  This is quite a high figure.  If it is the case that the asylum processes are getting faster - if applications are being processed more quickly - why is it the case that one in ten people is waiting for so long?  Does the 10.5% figure relate to individuals or families?  Regardless of whether it is individuals or families, one in ten-----</p></speech>

I understand that in some cases, there may be judicial reviews or there may be other issues.  Are the cases of long-term residents of direct provision centres the subject of ongoing examination to see what can be done and what the position is with such cases?  Is an assessment made of whether we are waiting for information from them, or they need to take the next step?  What interventions are made by the Department or by RIA to look at helping and assisting the applications to be processed more quickly in order that people do not end up waiting for between four and seven years, or longer?</p></speech>

We are hitting difficulties in finding ways to move them into normal housing but we are trying to engage with NGOs and local authorities in that respect.

It is absolutely not where we want to be but in an emergency situation we are not going to leave people homeless so we have to put them somewhere.

We are doing tenders throughout the country at the present time.  We are doing it on a regional basis to provide new accommodation centres for the level of demand we are experiencing but, as we discussed earlier in regard to the asylum side as distinct from the refugee side, we find it very difficult to predict the number of people who will turn up and seek accommodation.  People turn up at Dublin Airport, Burgh Quay or elsewhere and we have to accommodate them that night.  It is not something we can plan for.  It is quite different in the refugee programme, where we have a sense of who is coming-----</p></speech>

My next question might amuse him, but I am looking at page 16 of the accounts.  It refers to a figure of &euro;433,000 for the Irish Film Classification Office.  What relevance does it now have?  We can turn on our television and social media devices.  Does the office have any relevance in modern society?  It probably did years ago when the only time one could see a film was when one went to the cinema, but has life passed the organisation by?  There is another organisation mentioned, the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Does it do much or what does it do?  I see that it did not spend its money because there was a reduction in screen hire costs during the year under review.  There was an underspend of &euro;190,000 under the heading of screen rental.  Does it have to rent screens to watch films?  How many years is it in existence?</p></speech>

As the back of it there are about three pages listing different organisations, some of which are statutory, while some are regulatory, appellant bodies and non-statutory.  Can Mr. O'Driscoll give us a summary note on each of them?  Some of them crop up in different schedules.  Is there a formal service level agreement, as I call it, in place for each of the organisations to which the Department grants money?  Presumably, there is.</p></speech>

I want him to get the figure from the HSE and give me a comparison between the two where somebody participating in the fair deal scheme goes into a nursing home.  The person's nursing home accommodation, food and light bills are paid.  He or she would not necessarily have the same transport or education requirements.  People in a nursing home do not automatically receive a medical card as it is deemed that they are generally being taken care of.  They are allowed to keep 15% of their social welfare payment as spending money, or approximately &euro;30.  It appears that there is inequality, given that all living costs are covered in the centres, compared with how we treat elderly persons in nursing homes.

We have international obligations to asylum seekers.  We have had the Mahon report, an Ombudsman's report and so on; therefore, the changes have been wrought from the system.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll's openness and honesty and the straightness of all of his companions.  It is very helpful.  I would not like to send a message that the system is overwhelmed.  I looked back at the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter and noted that in 2015 there were 4,696 people in the system.  Today there are 6,106.  I do not believe these are overwhelming figures.  One has to take out the 700-plus people with status.  Really there has not been a massive jump.  What has happened is that there is a housing crisis and alternatives were never considered.  Repeatedly, before this committee, in terms of achieving value for money, alternatives were never considered.  To touch on what the Chairman said, there is a belief those concerned are lucky to get what they get.  I appreciate the witnesses' openness and honesty and I am returning it.  I would not like the aforesaid message to be sent.</p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions.  Mr. Justice Murray produced a report at some stage.  I remember reading it and did not bring it with me.  There were references in it to serious issues related to a directive and data privacy.  What happened as a result of it?  The EU directive was no longer valid and had been withdrawn.  If the witnesses do not know the answer, I do not mind.  I remember reading the report and being shocked at the findings of Mr. Justice Murray.  Legislation was to be enacted, but I do not believe it ever was.</p> <p>  The more specific question is about the integration fund, which is a very positive fund.  When I read the annual report or one of the reports, I note that it is stated there is &euro;50 million in the fund.  I refer to the asylum, migration and integration fund which is mentioned on page 22.  There are credits, which is extraordinary.  There is an estimated provision of &euro;1.5 million and the outturn was lower.  These are just the specifics.  Am I wrong that the moneys are coming from a fund of &euro;50 million over a period to help in achieving integration?</p></speech>

Of the &euro;52 million, &euro;30 million is received by way of a grant per person resettled or relocated.  Regarding the discussion we had on relocation and resettlement in connection with the IRPP, the refugee programme, the money kicks into that process.  Some &euro;22.6 million is committed to various activities set out in our national programme for the AMIF which is agreed with the European Commission.

When people come into our offices &ndash; this is a general rather than a parochial point &ndash; we note that there is a delay.

An example is where somebody from India is recruited by a recruitment firm and told that her husband or partner can join her.  What is the backlog?  Why the delay?

At the meeting on 17 January, a number of instances of sexual harassment that have occurred was raised.  The letter from the Department of 7 February, following the meeting, stated that nine instances emerged between a one, a three and a five, according to the way they were presented.  Can the Department or the Irish Prison Service, IPS, advise if every instance, either intra-staff or those highlighted through a P19, the form which is used to register a complaint against a prisoner and lodged by a prison nurse, prison nurse officer or agency nurse working within a prison, has been acted upon with an appropriate investigation and follow-up?  I am anticipating the answer I will get but if the answer is "No", would the Department be prepared, in the interests of women working within the Prison Service and female contractors, to consider carrying out a confidential survey among female staff to inquire into these matters?</p></speech>

I am geared up to deal with the justice and equality Vote and not the prisons Vote, but if the Deputy sends us, or gives us, his list of questions, we will endeavour to answer them as best we can.  I propose to do so in writing with the advice of the Prison Service.</p> <p>  On the last occasion we were before the committee on the prisons Vote, the Deputy raised a large number of significant allegations.  We provided to the committee very detailed responses to those.</p></speech>

Are the Department or Irish Prison Service management in Longford aware of allegations that PMDS exists in name only within prisons, with scoring being picked at random and often subjectively determined by the relevant governor, rather than informed by the proper processes laid down when it was introduced and with ongoing monitoring by assistant chiefs and chiefs with regular reports, as Mr. O'Driscoll has outlined the process?</p><p>I ask that the Department make the necessary inquiries into that.</p><p> I made a few comments to clarify my position on the mess committees, as opposed to the POA's view of my position, at the beginning of the meeting.  In the Secretary General's response of 7 February you said that voluntary mess committees "operate as independent ... entities from the Irish Prison Service".  I note from an email I have seen that the director general of the committee communicated to all governors on 28 January and used the same sentence.  How this can be?  We established that there was a lengthy industrial relations process that led to their establishment and that staff costs and the prison gratuity were covered by central funds or the Prison Service itself.  If they are independent, as the Irish Prison Service and the Secretary General asserted, and not under the control of the Irish Prison Service, would this not constitute a breach of rules 30 and 31 of the Prison Rules of 2007 regarding the employment of prisoners?</p></speech>

It is also alleged to me that in excess of &euro;2 million has been spent on mess facilities over the past number of years from the capital budget of the Prison Service directly.  The IPS has contracted a private company, Cater Care of Limerick, to audit the mess facilities for environmental health purposes.  The audit reports are made to the Irish Prison Service and HSE environmental health officers also carry out inspections of the mess facilities and report to the Irish Prison Service.  The governor of each prison is an <i>ex officio</i>member of each mess committee.  How, therefore, can we consider them to be independent?</p></speech>

I will get to the content of the other meeting in a moment or two.  The question on the mess committee stands and I hope Mr. O'Driscoll will get back to us on it.</p> <p>  The email that I referred to, which was sent to governors on 28 January, stated that mess committee staff were advised to engage professional financial advice regarding the tax status of committees and the financial books that were to be kept.  On the question of independence, it seems to be a Pontius Pilate move in that we seem to be taking control of an awful lot of things in terms of expenditure, light, heat and various other things.  I am totally for the appropriate availability of food, meals and everything in the Prison Service but governors are on the committee so I do not see the level of independence or any separation.  The line suggests the Prison Service is oblivious to tax status and the financial books.</p> <p>  In Mr. O'Driscoll's response to me, which he said was very detailed, he sent a list of balances when we had asked for audited accounts.  He pointed out that the balances may not all be profit but he did not answer the question of who audits or when it is audited and we are still oblivious to that.  He did, however, send us the procedure but nobody doubts that procedures are in place for how cash could be managed.  I respectfully suggest that it is the Department which has not tested some of the issues I brought up at the last meeting.  The Department has taken people's word for things but that may not be enough.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to note that as well.</p> <p>  The email goes on to ask governors if they are aware of any misuse of Prison Service materials.  We would love to think everybody was above reproach but these questions are arising.  I am not saying governors are involved but they could be and we do not know.  If there are practices that are wrong, what do we expect governors to say other than that there is nothing to see here?  Would the Department consider asking the Comptroller and Auditor General, or an appropriate arms-length body such as the Department's own internal audit unit, which the procedure states can do spot checks, to carry out a forensic audit of all mess committees going back to their establishment, including interviews with all relevant personnel?  I would prefer the Comptroller and Auditor General to do it.  Mr. O'Driscoll said he is not answering and I understand why but I ask him to take it on board.</p> <p>  Is the Department or is the Irish Prison Service aware of an alleged amount, in the region of &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, being taken from the tuck shop or tuck shop account in a Dublin prison to fund a trip for a group to a sporting-related event in the United States between 2010 and 2013?  It is a serious allegation which has come up umpteen times.  Given the existence of such allegations, would the Department ask the Comptroller and Auditor General or another appropriate arms-length body to carry out a forensic audit of all tuck shops over the past ten years, including holding interviews with all relevant personnel?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned vehicles.</p></speech>

I mentioned vehicles at the last meeting, and in his reply on 7 February, Mr. O'Driscoll indicated that all vehicles are accounted for and that all assets have been verified by local management as being on-site.  What if certain members of local management endorsed the absence, loan or alternative use of prison assets?  We are taking people at their word.  That is fine.  Please God, all of these people are people of the highest integrity.  However, ringing someone to ask whether he or she was speeding on a road and accepting his or her answer does not amount to an investigation.  It seems to me that there is a crisis of confidence among hard-working prison staff at all levels about being able to call out wrongdoing in the culture that currently exists.  What are we doing about it?  Why, if there is a robust system in place, are people coming forward in other ways to other people in various forums, including to Members of the Oireachtas and members of various committees, this one included?  Is all the information coming up in research vexatious, fantasies concocted by disgruntled staff with an axe to grind, or are some or all of these matters true?  Are we prepared to check?  Surely prudence demands that all matters are independently investigated.</p> <p>  I put it to Mr. O'Driscoll that, contrary to his claims against me, he has not tested the information I have put to him but, rather, has simply asked a question and accepted an answer, assuming therefore that an answer to my question was correct instead of carrying out an independent investigation in the interests of the taxpayer and of the health and safety and well-being and a healthy working environment and culture for prison staff?  Is the Department of Justice and Equality open to the recommendation I am making now, that is, the establishment of a GSOC-style inspectorate, separate from the Irish Prison Service headquarters in Longford, with statutory powers to provide prison staff with the support and protection they require, and the confidence to which they are entitled?  They should be above reproach and unable to be infected by any culture that may exist among a small number of staff at various levels.  The Department is only aware of information provided by headquarters in Longford, and is dependent on that information.  It appears from my research that the Longford headquarters is only aware of and only as good as the information provided to it by individual prisons.  It seems that some or all individual prisons operate as islands on a number of issues.  My research has led me to question the existence of a parallel investigative judicial and enforcement system across our prison services.  I hope those questions will be noted and answered.</p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Chairman could provide for me, in writing, the Standing Order which allows for the validity or worth of my utterances to be adjudicated upon by other members of the committee.  I look forward to receiving that, and information on the Act that determines that.  I have been very careful.  I have taken legal advice and chosen my words very carefully today.  I have not identified anyone and I have focused on processes and procedures that are absolutely relevant to the expenditure of the State and Department of Justice and Equality.  I question the Chairman's competence to tell the Secretary General that he does not have to answer my questions and can, in effect, disregard the questions that I, in trying to use my time efficiently, have put to him.  I accepted this morning, in advance of this meeting, that he could answer the questions after this meeting in consultation with the experts involved in the Prison Service.  I would appreciate a written response to that from the Chairman, and I thank him for staying on.  We are missing votes as a result, but I believe these matters are of the utmost importance, and prudence demands they require investigation and actual testing, rather than the sort of testing we have seen in the past.</p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses for coming here today, and continue to extend to the Secretary General every good wish in his new role.  I hope he will understand my questioning in the spirit in which it was intended.  I am only interested in protecting the taxpayers and ordinary prison officers in their place of work.</p></speech>

The Deputy has made it very clear that he had questions to put, and that he had made his own investigations and inquiries.  No member of the committee is aware of any of the documentation or research the Deputy has carried out.  I accept his statement that it is his own research.  At committee meetings every week, we agree a set of minutes and we also agree a list of items on which the committee will follow up.  We follow up on those items as a committee rather than having 13 individuals going in 13 different directions.  We operate as a committee rather than as unconnected people.  Everything we do is done by committee.  Anything done otherwise is not the action of this committee.  The questions that have been raised today do not have to be answered until such time as the committee agrees to put those questions to witnesses.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  They were here to listen and note what was said, but the committee has not requested that they respond to any of those matters.  The committee may choose to send the transcript of this meeting and endorse all of the questions that have been put, but that will be considered and decided upon by the committee.

T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;iste go bhfuil gceisteanna a thog&aacute;il tar &eacute;is mo r&aacute;iteas.</p> <p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to be here.  Thank you, Chairman, for your invitation to the meeting this morning to talk about the peace process in Colombia.  In October 2015 I was appointed by the High Representative, Vice President Federica Mogherini, as the EU special envoy for the peace process in Colombia.  My role was to accompany the concluding stages of the peace negotiations between the Government of Colombia and FARC, which were then taking place in Havana, Cuba, and thereafter to accompany the implementation of the peace agreement on behalf of the European Union.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, a peace agreement was concluded in August 2016 to end the 52 year long FARC conflict in which almost 250,000 people had been killed, 40,000 were still missing and 6 million people had been displaced from their homes.  The agreement was defeated in a national plebiscite on 2 October 2016 by a very small margin, 49.8% voted "Yes" and 50.2% voted "No".  It was then renegotiated and approved by the country's Parliament in December 2016, and all of that was subsequently upheld by the constitutional court following a number of court challenges.  Implementation of the agreement commenced on 1 January 2017.</p> <p>  The agreement, which took four years to negotiate, is very comprehensive.  It has more than 300 pages and is divided into six chapters which correspond to the six-point agenda of the peace talks themselves.  Chapter 6 concerns implementation and sets out the joint Government of Colombia-FARC bodies which were to be established and details the accompanying roles which were allocated to the international community.  The European Union was asked to assist with rural development, the re-incorporation of former combatants and support for a special investigations unit in the prosecutor&rsquo;s office.  Chapter 6 is being substantially implemented and, significantly, President Duque, following his inauguration last August, has appointed the relevant Ministers to the implementation bodies.</p> <p>  Chapter 3 deals with the end of conflict, including the laying down of arms by FARC and the re-incorporation of its members.  A tripartite mechanism headed by the UN and including the Colombian defence forces and FARC oversaw the disarmament process which was completed by mid-July 2017.  FARC reconstituted itself as a political party in September 2017 and contested its first elections in 2018.  The process of re-incorporation of former combatants is continuing, although progress has been slow.</p> <p>  Chapter 2 addresses political participation.  FARC was allocated five seats in both the Senate and the Congress for two electoral terms.  Two of the FARC Senators were unable, however, to take their seats but the other representatives are now playing an active role in both Houses.  A provision to provide 16 additional seats for areas of the country which had been badly affected by the conflict could not however be implemented because it marginally failed to secure the required parliamentary majority for its legislation.</p> <p>  Chapter 5 concerns victims and provides for a system of reparation and for the transitional justice system which is aimed at truth, reconciliation and accountability.  The transitional justice institutions, that is, the truth commission, the missing persons unit, the special jurisdiction for peace known as the JEP and the victims unit have been established and are functioning.  The JEP has begun hearings relating to kidnappings by FARC and large numbers of former state actors have also submitted to it, but the JEP itself has been subject to political criticism and the international community, including the European Union, has expressed strong support for its work and for its independence.</p> <p>  Chapter 4 deals with the illegal drugs trade.  At the centre of the agreement is a commitment to voluntary crop substitution.  So far, approximately 70,000 coca growers have signed up for the substitution programme but implementation has been slow for several reasons, including intimidation and attacks on social and local leaders who are promoting the programme.  Meanwhile, the size of the coca crop has grown.  Some estimates suggest that it is now three times as big as it was at the beginning of the decade.</p> <p>  Chapter 1 concerns integrated rural development.  This chapter has a 15-year time horizon for implementation.  The previous Santos Government had commenced a process of local development planning based on wide local consultation.  It is known as the PDETs.  It is hoped that the new Duque Government will take this process forward in the new national development plan.  The main purpose of the EU trust fund for Colombia is to support rural development, which will require significant resources and land reform.  As part of the EU's commitment to support the provision of infrastructure and marginalised areas of the country, the European Investment Bank has indicated its willingness to make up to &euro;400 million available in loan financing.</p> <p>  As we know from our own experience on this island, the implementation of a peace agreement can be even more difficult than its negotiation in the first place.  The Colombian peace process has faced several setbacks and continues to face challenges at many levels, but it is succeeding and it is being implemented.  There had been fears that the election of President Ivan Duque, the candidate of former President Uribe's Centro Democratico, which had led the opposition to the peace agreement in the plebiscite, would put the process at risk but President Duque has committed to implementing the agreement, albeit with some announced changes.  Since his election I have met with him on several occasions and both I and the EU delegation in Bogota have a good working relationship with his Government.</p> <p>  The main challenges to the peace process now are, first, no peace agreement has yet been made with the ELN.  Former President Santos had commenced peace talks with it in Quito and those were later moved to Havana.  The ELN declared a ceasefire in September 2017 to coincide with the visit of Pope Francis but it did not continue it after January 2018.  The ELN talks were somewhat on hold through the elections in 2018 and in the early months of the Duque Presidency, but they have now been ended following a large ELN bomb at a police academy in Bogota in January this year which killed 60 people.</p> <p>  Second, although the FARC conflict is over, violence continues in the territories.  Since the beginning of 2017 more than 300 social leaders and human rights defenders have been killed by armed gangs, many of them associated with the drugs trade and the illegal economies.</p> <p>  Third, the deteriorating situation in Venezuela presents a further risk to peace in Colombia.  So far, 1.5 million Venezuelans have moved across the border into Colombia.  Colombia has a 2,000 km border with Venezuela and is therefore very exposed to the humanitarian crisis in that country and to any instability which might arise from Venezuela.  To all of that must be added the pressures of inequality, social and regional, possible tensions from eradication of the coca crop and a more polarised political environment which can lead to possible social unrest.  The necessity therefore to consolidate and build on the progress made in the peace process is even greater.</p> <p>  The UN Security Council receives a report every three months from its mission in Colombia.  The international community is united in support of the Colombian peace process.  The European Union has increased its financial commitment and repeated its political support.  The Irish Government has been a strong and consistent supporter of the peace process and that support has been given added impetus recently through the opening for the first time of an Irish embassy in Bogota under the leadership of Ambassador Alison Milton and Colombia has opened an embassy in Dublin under Ambassador Patricia Cortes.</p> <p>  I thank the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their continued support for my work, including the secondment of an Irish diplomat to the EU delegation in Bogota to work with me and also for being among the very first EU member states to join the EU trust fund.</p><p>For my part, I have recently been appointed EU Special Representative for Human Rights.  Mindful, however, of the need to maintain continued support for the Colombian peace process, especially at this time, the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has asked me also to continue my work on the Colombian peace process until she can replace me in that role.  I will therefore travel to Bogota again next week to co-chair the human rights dialogue between the EU and Colombia and to provide an update on the EU&rsquo;s continuing support.  This is a complex process, and this short presentation can scarcely capture all aspects of it in detail.  I look forward, therefore, to responding to members&rsquo; questions.</p></speech>

I see he will be able to continue his work on the Colombian aspect, which of course ties in with his new human rights role.  We know that human rights are a major issue in Colombia.  I was reminded that in 2012 a number of us Deputies and Senators signed a letter expressing our support for the peace process and a commitment to dialogue and compromise as being vital to ensure lasting peace while also acknowledging Cuba&rsquo;s role in the matter.</p> <p>  I recently read a report from Justice for Colombia.  It made the point that its worst fears about the new Government have not been realised.  Nevertheless, President Duque is going ahead with these six objections.  He says that this is constitutional and that it will not threaten the peace process.  I would like to hear Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s view on this and the general feeling about these objections.  While they might be constitutional, are they in fact undermining the peace process?  There are concerns about the attempts to change the remit of the JEP, taking out investigation and prosecution of members of the security forces and their holding to account for the war crimes and the human rights violations.  There is a danger that this might not balance with the needs of the victims.  Again, are the international community and the EU being strong enough in supporting what was agreed in that peace process?  There is also the issue of new magistrates and that a process is now in place which could leave them more open to political influence.  I looked through the summary of the final agreement.  Obviously, land is central to the conflict, as I think it was in the first place.  We know what the Government is trying to do about land reform with these 16 special regions, but I do not think much progress is being made on that.  Is it a question of finance or political will that it is not coming about?</p> <p>  The situation regarding coca and crop substitution is very disturbing.  It is not being promoted and encouraged as it should be.  I have probably missed something, but what seems to be missing from all this is the attractiveness of Colombia to multinationals because of its resources.  While these multinationals are coming in, we know there will be displacement, we know that villages are being wiped out and we know that their civil society leaders, their local leaders, the indigenous tribes, are being displaced and that their lives are really under threat.  Is this featuring at all in the negotiations that are ongoing?  I refer to the area of rural reform.</p> <p>  My last point &ndash; I may come back in later &ndash; concerns political participation.  It was very disturbing to read that two members of the FARC who had seats in Parliament &ndash; Jes&uacute;s Santrich, who I think is still in prison, and Mr. M&aacute;rquez &ndash; are unable to take their seats.  Why is more not being done about this to ensure that what was agreed has been followed through on?  We know from the Good Friday Agreement that a sustaining, lasting peace with justice is very difficult.  As Mr. Gilmore said, it is one thing to sign the agreement; it is another thing to look at its implementation.  Many mistakes were made with the Good Friday Agreement, particularly regarding legacy, and we are seeing this now because it was not really addressed.  We see it with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and we saw it with Bloody Sunday.  We could give a list of examples of issues remaining because legacy matters were not addressed.  I would like to hear Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s views on this also.</p></speech>

There is, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan said, an overlap in this regard.  As it happens, the human rights dialogue with Colombia is due around now.  We will have that formula on Monday morning.  The consultations with civil society are taking place today and tomorrow and we will have a report on that on Monday morning when I am there.  The new Government has committed to implementing the agreement and, as the Deputy said, Justice for Colombia has commented on that, which is very positive.  I travelled with President Duque on his invitation to one of the FARC reintegration or reincorporation areas, met with former combatants and saw President Duque address them and commit to implementing the terms of the agreement.  Regarding the six objections to which the Deputy referred, there is a law required to underpin the work of the transitional justice system of the JEP, the special jurisdiction that has been established.  This required the signature of the President, and he sent it back to the Congress with six proposed changes.  That is being considered by the Congress at present.  The Congress referred it to the constitutional court, which has sent it back to the Congress, saying the Congress must complete its work on it, and it has been given a deadline for that work.  That consideration is under way and, as in any parliamentary process, there is a lot of vigorous debate about the merits of the proposed changes, so we will have to see how that goes.  The President has said he will accept what the Congress decides, so it is now a matter for the Congress to address that.</p> <p>  The second issue relating to the JEP is whether or not it applies to former state actors.  A campaign is under way to have a separate process for state actors.  This issue is also being considered by the constitutional court and a decision is to be made.  In the meantime, as I said in my earlier statement, a very large number of former army officers and former police officers, something like 2,500 former members of the security services, have already submitted to the JEP, which is a very encouraging sign.</p> <p>  Land issues will take time, and there are issues relating to resources.  As I said, there is a 15-year time horizon for dealing with rural development.  It is not progressing very quickly, I must say, but it is an area where the European Union has been asked to provide accompaniment.</p> <p>  Regarding the coca situation, 70,000 have offered for voluntary substitution.  The Government says it is committed to paying the compensation to be paid to them, which is good.  The extent to which the voluntary crop substitution programme will progress after that remains to be seen.  I will make a general point, however.  The coca problem and the cocaine trade, in my view, cannot be solved purely at the supply end, and it is unreasonable and unrealistic of countries outside of Colombia to think it can be.  It must also be addressed from the demand side.  In the recent security discussions, the security dialogue between the EU and Colombia, we have discussed this issue and are doing some initial work on co-operation with Colombia as to how the demand side might also contribute to dealing with the coca situation.</p><p>On the issue of multinationals, the human rights challenges on the ground and the displacement of people in the various territories has more to do with the illegal economy than it has to do with the legal economy.  It has to do with the drugs trade and the battle that is going on for control of that trade, and also with illegal mining.  They are the biggest contributors to that.</p><p> I referred to two Senators not taking their seats.  Senator Jesus Santrich is in custody following an extradition request from the United States for an alleged offence that was committed.  It is alleged it was committed after the peace agreement started to be implemented.  The question as to whether that was the case or not is also being addressed by the JEP.  I understand that a decision on the case is due in the near future.  Ivan Marquez left Bogota and decided not to take up his seat in the Congress.</p><p> In response to the point about legacy issues, I think the Colombian peace agreement is better on legacy issues and on the needs of victims than the Good Friday Agreement.  Victims were made part of the negotiation process.  Representatives of victims were brought to the table and there is an entire chapter of the Colombian agreement on victims.  The Colombian agreement attempted to deal with the issue of victims in the main agreement and to deal with it upfront.  To some extent, in the case of the Northern Ireland agreement it was something left to be dealt with afterwards.  It remains to be seen how this will work out in practice but certainly from what I have seen of both agreements I think the Colombian approach was better.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his new role.  We wish him well in his work.  I have a couple of follow-up questions from what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked.  What is the position of the present Government and Mr. Duque regarding Venezuela?  Do they support the incumbent President Maduro or the aspirant President, Juan Guaido, and how does that impact the ongoing peace process?</p> <p>  I noted the reference in Mr. Gilmore's statement to the fact that production of the coca crop is now at an all-time high.  I think he referred to a ten-year high despite the fact that the peace process is now under way.  That is a major impediment.  Is the peace process failing?  Is it fair to say that the peace process is not dealing with the issue?  I accept what Mr. Gilmore has just said about the demand side.</p> <p>  Learning from our own peace process, namely, the Good Friday Agreement, and also the peace process in South Africa, there has been some debate in this country following on from the success of the truth and reconciliation commission in South Africa, is a similar process part of the peace process in Colombia?  I would welcome a comment from Mr. Gilmore in that regard.</p> <p>  We are all struck by the scale of the process and the considerable undertaking involved.  The population in Colombia has grown by almost 8 million people in a ten-year period.  It is a big country and a big economy.  I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Gilmore is in and out of the country and he is working with the Government.  In his view, how strong, open and transparent is the current democratic system in Colombia in terms of dealing with the scale of the problem?</p></speech>

The Venezuelan situation has a big impact on Colombia at a number of levels.  The first is the significant numbers of migrants from Venezuela into Colombia.  It is estimated that some 3 million Venezuelans have left Venezuela and approximately half of those have gone into Colombia.  To put that in perspective, that is more than the total number of migrants who came into Europe at the height of what was referred to us the migration crisis for Europe.</p> <p>  The humanitarian situation in Venezuela is of concern.  There are shortages of food and medicines and there are energy problems.  That has an impact on Colombia because of the extent of its border with its neighbour.  The situation in Venezuela is now a major priority for the Colombian Government.</p> <p>  I do not agree that the peace process is failing.  The peace process is succeeding.  I accept there are problems with it.  There are problems with the implementation of any peace agreement.  It is more than 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement here and there are still implementation problems.</p> <p>  There was some speculation at the time of the peace agreement that the increase in the coca crop was related to an expectation that there would be compensation as part of the peace agreement.  I do not think that explains the extent of the growth of the coca crop.  What explains the growth of the coca crop is largely increased demand and that increased demand is largely coming from North America and from Europe, but also there is increased demand now in South America, including in Colombia itself.</p> <p>  The truth and reconciliation provisions both in relation to the peace agreements in Northern Ireland and South Africa are very strong.  A truth commission was established so that people who committed crimes and atrocities during the conflict would go there and tell the truth, and in particular give information to families about what happened to their family members.  Many people are still missing and people want to know the truth about what happened at different points.  That approach is working.</p> <p>  There is also the jurisdiction for peace.  The fundamental idea behind it is that under the jurisdiction for peace if somebody who has committed a crime during the conflict goes before the jurisdiction for peace and tells the truth, he or she can be sentenced to deprivation of liberty but not in a conventional prison, it is more in a community setting.  The sentences can be quite long, for example eight years or up to 12 years in some instances.  If they do not go before the jurisdiction for peace they are then liable to be prosecuted in the normal way by the judicial system and incur the prison sentences that are associated with that.</p> <p>  In response to how strong and transparent Colombian democracy is, one of the things that we need to remember about Colombia is that it is one of the oldest democracies in the world.  We are celebrating our 100th anniversary of independence and the establishment of the State.  They are celebrating 200 years of almost continuous democracy since 1819.  There was a four-year interruption in the mid 1950s but democracy was restored.  They are very proud of their democracy.  The system is based on a government, an executive president, Congress and the separation of powers.  They take great pride in it and it is a strong democracy.</p></speech>

I thank him for the worthwhile and valuable presentation.  It is good to hear the update and presented in such a concise manner.  I congratulate him also on his recent appointment, which I was delighted to see, and on the most important work he has done within Colombia on the peace process on behalf of the EU.  We are all conscious that this is a highly complex process given the scale of the country and the scale of the issues faced.  I was struck by the numbers he quoted to us in terms of 250,000 people killed, and 6 million people displaced.  In that context we can clearly only touch on aspects but it is very useful to get an update.</p><p>Will Mr. Gilmore develop the topic of the discussion thus far in respect of the challenges to the peace process?  Will he speak a little more about some of those challenges?  He mentioned the situation in Venezuela, which is clearly having a very destabilising effect.  I spoke recently to friends who have just come back from Colombia and who said the situation in Venezuela is very visibly impacting the economy and society in Colombia.  Clearly, the numbers of refugees coming into Colombia from Venezuela is a huge issue.  How does Mr. Gilmore see this working out?  There does not seem to be any sign of improvement there.  That is my first point.</p><p> My second point relates to the issues Deputies Niall Collins and Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan touched on, that is, the growth in the coca crop.  The first thing I had wondered when reading about this is where the proceeds are going.  This was always an issue when it came to support of the FARC but, presumably, the proceeds are now going into organised crime more specifically and less into paramilitary activity.  Perhaps Mr. Gilmore could develop this point.  I am interested to hear his comments about demand.  I absolutely agree with him that this issue cannot be tackled within the borders of Colombia alone.  That is true of all issues surrounding drugs.  How does one go about tackling demand?  Clearly, there have been huge changes in drugs policy in North America, particularly in respect of cannabis.  Is something similar required on coca and cocaine?  Is that where we might see some resolution of this issue?  Allied to that, Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s presentation referred very strongly to the work of the EU and of the UN, but where is the US in all this not only as the biggest market for illegal coca, the product of the trade, but also as a huge player in the region?  What impact does Trump and Trump&rsquo;s policy have on the peace process?  Can Mr. Gilmore say anything about this?  He mentioned another challenge being the lack of a ceasefire from the ELN and the recent dreadful bomb in January of this year.  Is there any hope for progress on this?</p><p> I refer to the more general context and the political buy-in for the peace process.  Clearly, as Mr. Gilmore said, there is a more polarised political environment, which itself presents a challenge.  Where is the big political sticking point in Colombia?  Again, this is hard to see from the outside.  Is it because, as Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan said, the treatment of victims has been a strength of the process?  From reading about the process, I understand there are very robust institutions that are built into the agreement.  What is the big political objection?  I know that Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan has highlighted some of the issues that have been raised, but given that the EU and the UN have been so strongly adhering to the process, and given the amount of buy-in there has been from the outside, what is the sticking point internally and how is it best addressed?</p><p> I imagine it is hard for Mr. Gilmore to see beyond what he has been doing in Colombia, but can he say what the priorities of his new role are?  This is perhaps a little beyond our scope today but, as a foreign affairs committee, we will presumably be looking forward to engaging with Mr. Gilmore in his new EU role.  Can he say at this point what he sees as the key priorities in such a difficult political environment within the EU currently?</p></speech>

I do not have a role in respect of Venezuela but I can say to the Senator that the European Union has established an international contact group with a number of Latin American countries which is working to try to achieve a political solution to the situation in Venezuela.</p> <p>  The difficulties are in the detail.  The JEP, the transitional justice system, is working and is independent.  Its independence has been challenged politically.  There has been a lot of political comment about the JEP, but I have met the president of the JEP, Patricia Linares, a number of times.  She has done a fantastic job and her people are doing a fantastic job, but they are being subjected to a lot of political criticism.  This is part of the political narrative in the country, but they are continuing to work.  There are difficulties.  Senator Bacik asked where the sticking points are.  The implementation of the agreement requires a lot of resources, so one issue is resources.  The land reform will require restitution or reparation for victims, which requires a lot of resourcing.  I refer to the institutions, the operation of the JEP and the transitional justice system.  The JEP has 800 staff.  It requires a lot of resources and is now seeking to operate regionally, so there are big resourcing issues.</p> <p>  Senator Bacik also asked me about my new role.  I would be happy to talk with the committee at some stage again about this.  I am very honoured to have been appointed as the Special Representative for Human Rights.  It is a very challenging time for human rights internationally.  Civil society space is being shrunk in many countries and there is a rise in authoritarianism.  There have been many attempts even to redefine the concept of human rights on the part of some in the international community and, unfortunately, a withdrawal by some from human rights institutions.  I am quite happy to come back to the committee at some stage if it wishes and talk about this.  My role is in human rights in the external  and foreign policy of the European Union.  I do not have a role in respect of human rights internally in the Union.  Obviously, however, I must be mindful of the human rights situation internally in the promotion of the human rights values and policy of the European Union in its external action and foreign policy work.</p></speech>

My question is about his experience of civil society within Colombia, particularly the civil society of the indigenous communities.  Does he have much engagement with them?  It was good to hear what he said about learning from the Colombian peace agreement in terms of legacy matters and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Mr. Gilmore mentioned illegal mining, but we know there is legal mining going on and that it is creating problems not only because of displacement, but also particularly regarding workers&rsquo; rights, wages and conditions, etc.  I think there is a fear that this is getting lost because the big picture is the peace agreement, yet this is going on within Colombia at the same time.  We have only recently got our own business and human rights policy here, with a committee set up under a chairperson.</p><p>It is something that I had been pursuing for a while and looking at trade agreements.  There is an example in more recent ones about binding conditions for workers.  Would that come into Mr. Gilmore's new role?  I know there is the possibility of a binding treaty that the UN is working on.  We talk about human rights, but within that there also have to be workers&rsquo; rights.  It is part of the human rights picture.  I do not know that it should be separate.</p><p> My last question is about extradition.  Mr. Santrich is in jail a year in April.  I understand also that he is blind.  I was reading a speech that President Duque made about extradition, and it certainly was alarming in terms of a request for extradition being received and us not really going into the details of it.  There is the possibility of abuse within that system.</p></speech>

As part of my visits to Colombia, I regularly meet civil society organisations, including indigenous people, Afro-Colombians, trade unions, churches, and broad spectrum human rights bodies.  I do that as part of my work on Colombia.  Specifically relating to the human rights dialogue next week, my colleagues in the European Union delegation and from the External Action Service will be conducting consultations today and tomorrow with civil society organisations in advance of the human rights dialogue on Monday.  On Monday morning, before the commencement of the formal human rights dialogue, I will meet the representatives of civil society organisations to hear directly from them the issues they wish the dialogue to address.  The dialogue will address issues such as the Deputy raised, including the human rights and labour rights provisions in the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia.  That would be very much on our agenda.  That is part of the overlap.</p> <p>  On the issue of the extradition of Mr. Santrich, that issue is being considered by the JEP.  While there are a number of issues being considered, the central issue, as I understand it, that is being considered is about when the alleged offence was committed, and they are addressing that at the moment.  I do not want to comment on the case because it is before what is essentially a court and we have to respect the independence of it.  There were concerns, however, about the conditions in which Mr. Santrich was being held and he went on hunger strike for a time.  I visited him in detention during that hunger strike period and talked to him.  I am very pleased that he subsequently ended the hunger strike, not because of my discussion with him, because I know others had discussions with him as well, but I think this has enabled the JEP to consider his case.  My understanding is that a decision on it is imminent.  It is like any court in that we must wait for its judgment.  Obviously we will see then what happens after that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gilmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019040400002#F00400"><p>There are two levels to the issue of FARC&rsquo;s involvement in the drugs trade.  First, part of the agreement was that there would be a commitment by FARC to discontinue its involvement in the drugs trade, and second, it said that it would co-operate with the Government in bringing an end to the illegal drugs trade.  Separately, FARC agreed that, insofar as it had proceeds, an inventory would be done of what assets it had accumulated and that those assets would be used in the reparation of victims.  That would become part of the pool to be used for the reparation of victims.</p> <p>  The proceeds of the illegal drugs trade are going into criminal hands.  The Government of Colombia has a very robust policy to try to end the drugs trade.  The difficulty is with the growing end because it is a case of who is growing the crop.  The people who are growing the crop are in the main small landowners and small farmers for whom this is a profitable crop.  There is a degree of what might be called peer pressure at one level but also raw intimidation from those who are controlling the drugs trade, which makes the shift to substitution very difficult.</p> <p>  One approach that is being advocated is the forced eradication of the crop.  The difficulty with that is that very often it puts the security services of the state into conflict and into very difficult situations with local communities, giving rise to social unrest.  For example, there was an incident in Tumaco on the Pacific coast a little over a year ago where unarmed people who had been protesting were killed.  That is very difficult and it is difficult to see how the drugs problem can be solved solely at the level of those who are growing the crop.</p> <p>  President Santos used to talk about the necessity for a wider international approach.  I believe there is a shared responsibility, certainly in countries, communities and environments where there is a big market for cocaine.  It is something we have to talk about because there is a direct link between the consumption of cocaine and people getting killed in remote areas of Colombia and other countries.  Colombia is one of the biggest producers of cocaine and there is a direct link.  There are people being killed because they are in favour of crop substitution and they are being intimidated.  Many of the social leaders who have been targeted are people who have been trying to give leadership in local community situations where there is very little presence of the state, who have been trying to organise crop substitution, and who have been intimidated or worse.  That is what is happening on the ground, and since the commencement of the implementation of the peace agreement, more than 300 social and local community leaders and human rights defenders have been killed.</p></speech>

I accept it is probably beyond Mr. Gilmore&rsquo;s brief, but does the answer lie in a change in policy, as we have seen in other countries on cannabis?</p></speech>

Certainly it is an issue that the EU has been thinking about, namely, working more closely with Colombia on the drugs issue.  Policy makers need to reflect on the consequences for countries like Colombia, for poor people in difficult circumstances who do not have protection and what the consequences of the consumption of cocaine in well-off parts of the world is resulting in for poor people in the areas where the coca is grown.  We need to be thinking a bit more about it.  It is not enough to say that a solution to the coca problem is to spray the crop or eradicate the crop or whatever, because that is only half the answer.</p></speech>

For example, there can be a greater level of co-operation on the interdiction of drugs, on the transportation of drugs and on their importation.  The work at security level which is under way regarding the various drugs gangs which are importing cocaine into Europe and the United States certainly can be part of the answer.</p> <p>  I know the issue about legalisation of drugs and so on.  That is a big debate and is probably one that needs more attention.  I also think that the individual consumers of cocaine to need think about the consequence of what they are doing and what it is resulting in.   There is a connection.</p></speech>

Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan also referred to it.  There is the damage that has been done to the environment by widespread extraction of natural resources.

Does the environmental damage and the need to protect the environment feature in the public narrative in Colombia at the present time?</p></speech>

There has been a very strong programme.  Part of the peace dividend was very much to be, first of all, around the protection of forests and the protection of the ecosystem.  The intention is that protection work will be part of the re-incorporation effort of former combatants, that they would be working in parks situations.  I have seen the illegal mining.   I have been on rivers where one can see the dredgers.  This is no longer people with shovels and sieves.  One is talking about seriously big industrial-scale dredgers gouging out the sides of rivers, destroying the plant life, destroying the river itself and presenting a really serious environmental problem and a serious security problem.  The European Union is funding a number of projects.  There have been some projects where local people, local communities work as kind of guardians of the river.  From a community point of view they provide some protection for the river, or some effort to protect rivers and the ecosystem.  That is part of the projects that are being supported by the European Union and some member states.  There is quite a lot of this mining.  A lot of this is taking place in parts of the country which are physically remote where there is very little infrastructure and where there is very little presence of the state.</p></speech>

In terms of the Santos Government and the present Government, the responsibility to protect the ecosystem and to make their contribution in the context of climate change is very strong.  There are a number of programmes which the Government is working on.  I have talked with the Minister for agriculture and the Minister for environment about those programmes.  It is not just one Government.  There has been a continuity of policy in this area.  It is a state that is very conscious of its responsibility to the environment and its global responsibility to participate.  It is also a state that is very conscious of its international responsibilities.  It is very much a multilateral state in its approach to issues like this.  Obviously it needs support and we can we can provide that support.</p></speech>

In the discussions that I have had with the Government at a number of levels there is a very strong commitment to its environmental responsibility.  They talk about it a lot in their discussions with me.  Where that comes home is when one looks at individual projects and the impact they are having.  There are a number of Irish companies that have interests in Colombia.   I have met the larger companies.  That is growing.  The interests of Irish companies and the trade relationship between Ireland and Colombia is growing.  That is reflected in the fact that Ireland has now opened an embassy in Bogota.  It is obviously providing support in the context of the peace process but it is also to develop further the trade and other relationships between Ireland and Colombia.</p></speech>

However, it is heartening to note that the European Union is putting substantial funding into supporting rural development in Colombia.I think &euro;90 million has been committed to the EU Trust Fund and also the European Investment Bank<font color="#2F2F2F"> has a loan facility up to &euro;400 million for financing.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">That is very important as well.  At times we need to note the interest the European Union takes in other countries.  Your appointment by the High Commissioner was clear evidence of the European Union&rsquo;s interest in continuing to support the peace process and see it implemented.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> I want to thank you sincerely for your presentation here this morning and your very comprehensive replies to the issues raised by my colleagues.  We look forward to having you before us in your new role as special representative for human rights.  Thank you very much.</font></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.850" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#C00200"><p>I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Linda Murray, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform and owner of Huckleberry's den and play centre in Navan, and Mr. Gerry Monks, director of JDM Insurance.  Mr. Noel Anderson of the Licensed Vintners Association is in the Gallery.</p> <p>  Since we last presented to the committee in May 2018, the situation for our members had worsened considerably.  In particular, small businesses are now closing on a weekly basis and members right across the spectrum are reporting savage increases in liability insurance renewals.  My colleagues will give members evidence in this respect.  The crisis is spreading to a broader range of SME sectors, as illustrated by our more recent members, including Nursing Homes Ireland, the Irish Travel Agents Association, the Association of Irish Showmen's Guild which represents circuses and fairs around the country, and Retail Excellence.  The crisis is existential in many of those sectors.  Businesses across the leisure, childcare and hospitality areas are threatened and one could add many community, charity, sporting and arts organisations to the list.  There is increasing alarm among members regarding the slow pace of key reforms and it is clear to us that the dead hand of vested interests and a lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt.</p> <p>  My colleagues will gladly share their specific experiences with members but right now I intend to cut to the chase and focus on analysis and solutions.  When we last presented to the committee we submitted ten asks, practical measures that would help reform this dysfunctional area quickly.  We further communicated these asks to the cost of insurance working group, CIWG, and to the Ministers involved.  While we acknowledge the amendment of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which now obliges claimants to inform defendants of a potential claim within one month, progress on other key reforms remains frustratingly slow.  It is illuminating to note in this regard that when a similar crisis arose in 2002, the major reforms were in place within two and a half years.  Following on the publication of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report in April 2002 the two key responses, namely, the establishment of the PIAB and the commencement of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, were implemented by July 2004 and September 2004, respectively.  By contrast, the cost of insurance working group report was published in January 2017 but, over two years later, the key reforms remain uncompleted.  Indeed, of the 68 recommendations made in this committee's report on the rising cost of motor insurance from November 2016, our analysis suggests that only 17 have been actioned.  Of the CIWG recommendations, ongoing delays in the establishment of a long promised Garda insurance fraud unit and the recalibration of the book of quantum are prolonging and amplifying the crisis.</p> <p>  On the CIWG recommendations, I will start with the recommendation to establish a Garda insurance fraud unit.  Insurance fraud is a crime with profound consequences up to and including the loss of livelihood and valuable public facilities.  Additionally, it criminalises the very process of making a personal injury claim, tarnishing all claimants with the same brush and deterring genuine claimants from seeking redress.</p><p>An oft-repeated quote from a member of the public at an alliance meeting last year is as follows.</p><blockquote>If I had a need for big money and I had a choice between robbing a bank and faking an injury, I'd pick the fake injury every day.  More money and no consequences if I'm found out.</blockquote><p>It is absolutely clear from the experience of our members that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not currently equipped to deal with this issue.  A specialised unit to deal with insurance fraud has been a key element of the cost of insurance working group strategy since the start and a key recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission.  We are bewildered by how long it has taken to establish the same unit, with issues such as political support, a year-long Insurance Ireland cost-benefit analysis and sources of funding wheeled out to justify the delays.  It must be established without further delay if the scourge of fraudulent and exaggerated claims is to be meaningfully addressed.  Incidentally, on this point, I welcome the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 yesterday evening that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is investigating some medical practitioners and legal firms in this regard.  However, these are one-off investigations and do not constitute a full strategic response to the issue.<br/><br/>I refer to recalibration of the book of quantum.  As documented in the Personal Injuries Commission reports, the general damages awarded for minor injuries in Ireland bear no relation to those made in other countries, which makes Ireland a very attractive place to sustain a minor injury.  This applies not just to whiplash injuries, as covered in detail in the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, reports, but also to all minor, fully recovered soft tissue injuries.  Additionally, there is no consistency between awards for identical injuries between the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the courts, or from judge to judge, which makes it very attractive in personal injury cases to reject a Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, offer and head for the courts, safe in the knowledge that with the right judge, the rewards from the court or by direct settlement with the insurer may be substantially better.<br/><br/>It is now abundantly clear that the book of quantum and the current process of its drafting are no longer fit for purpose.  However, there has been much debate in recent months about the best approach to address this.  We are fearful that the net result of all this debate will be no action and no change, a situation forced by vested interests making hundreds of millions in income from the <i>status quo</i>.  This will have catastrophic results for our members as they cannot sustain current premium levels, never mind the additional increases in insurance premiums that may arise if quantum for minor injuries is not addressed.  What makes the delay in doing so all the more frustrating is that awards are already capped in this country at the top end of the scale by the Court of Appeal in Nolan <i>v</i>. Wirenski, which has also clarified the principle of proportionality in Shannon <i>v</i>. O'Sullivan.  The framework and principles for a recalibration are, therefore, already in place.  We ask that the book of quantum is calibrated to reflect international norms and norms already established by the Court of Appeal as a matter of urgency.  On this point, we welcome the passage of Committee Stage of the Judicial Council Bill in the Seanad on Tuesday night.  However, as it has taken more than a year to get to this stage, we fear that without political will, the Bill will die a slow death.<br/><br/>I refer to a schedule of forecast reductions.  If anything, the situation regarding transparency in this systemically important industry has worsened since we last presented to the committee.  As well as the blue book, which gave comprehensive data oversight of the insurance industry, we have learned that the Central Bank has abandoned publication of the comprehensive data on policyholder demographics and cost trends provided by the private motor insurance statistics report.  For example, analysing trends in insurance costs for young drivers is no longer possible.  This approach to the reports, which offered key consumer protection insights, can only be described as data vandalism.  Data from the national claims information database for the years 2009 to 2018 are due from the Central Bank in the second half of this year.  Initially, it is expected that the data regarding motor insurance will be very limited.  However, neither the national claims information database nor the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has any concrete plans to issue any data on liability insurance costs.  Reports on possible plans from both are due by the end of 2019.  In this data vacuum both Ms Murray and Mr. Monks are willing to share definitive data on their sectors.  From a broader perspective, policyholders cannot plan or be protected if there is no data to measure what is happening or what can be expected to happen.  We ask, therefore, that the Department of Finance produce a schedule of forecast reductions for reforms using the 2002 Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, schedule as a model, which I have attached in appendix 3 to my written submission.  It is abundantly clear to us at this stage that lawyers and insurance companies will do anything to stop real reform, working tirelessly to slow reforms and blaming each other to deflect from their own responsibilities.  This is why it is imperative that political will drives this agenda.  Otherwise, we will be here again in a year's time providing a similar update.<br/><br/>This concludes our formal presentation.  As an alliance, we are intensely aware of how urgent this issue is for our members and their employees and volunteers.  We hope the committee can help us in getting meaningful action quickly and we are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Our cost of insurance continues to rise.  ISME's latest cost of insurance survey results for quarter 4 of 2018 are shown in the first appendix to our paper.  The results show that 81% of members report increased public liability insurance.  Recent statements about moderating insurance costs refer to private motor insurance only.  No one has reliable statistics on liability or other commercial insurances as the CSO does not measure them.  The continued rise in insurance costs is the outcome of a failure to make meaningful change in three areas: reducing quantum, to which there is no constitutional impediment; reforming our legal system; and reforming the insurance system itself.  The issue goes far beyond the simple cost of insurance to SMEs, although this issue is already causing many businesses to fail.  The issue of the cost of insurance is now hollowing out Irish society, restricting the conduct of sport, play and charitable activity, attracting criminal activity and encouraging the advancement of manufactured grievances.  It is harming the physical and moral health of citizens.  We are getting to the point where suing someone for the most minor of inconveniences is now socially acceptable across all educational and class strata.</p> <p>  While there has been a large amount of activity by the cost of insurance working group, it has not addressed the core issues, which we address in our presentation.  The cost of insurance working group has committed the cardinal sin of confusing performance, by which we mean doing lots of things, with effectiveness, which is doing the right things.  What we are left with is a veneer of progress and the complete absence of material reform.  What we need is quantum to be reduced; the legal profession to engage honestly with a reform process; moral hazard for plaintiffs in our courts; a perjury statute and an amended Defamation Act; a just, answerable Judiciary committed to continuous professional development; meaningful action on the detection and punishment of fraudulent claims; and transparent, granular data on a well-regulated insurance industry.</p> <p>  While it would be easy in these circumstances to call for the head of the responsible Minister of State, we believe this would achieve nothing other than political theatre.  We need a Cabinet Minister to take over the lead on this issue personally, and the nature of the reforms required suggests that this should be the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We appreciate that the committee has pressing issues such as Brexit and housing to attend to but we have suffered a lost decade on this issue.  People are losing their jobs and businesses now because of legislative inaction.  Members alone are the people who can fix this, and we ask them to do so now.</p> <p>  I am accompanied by our former chair, who will be able to give the committee real-world examples and figures brought to his attention by members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Coghlan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#D00400"><p>As Mr. McDonnell said, I am a former chair of ISME, a position I held in the period from 2015 until 2017.  Knowing what we know, liability insurance began to ramp up from 2014-15, so I had many people approaching me at that time.  I will share with the committee a couple of stories to illustrate this.  The first story is illustrated on page 10 of our written submission and concerns an ISME member in the south west, a medium-sized manufacturer with a substantial multi-risk policy in six figures.  The policy was with what I would call a multinational enterprise, MNE, a broker or an international brokerage firm.  The policy was underwritten, so broker A was underwritten by underwriter B, both of which were multinationals.</p><p>At recent renewal, the member received off the record advice that underwriter B had paid broker A and a number of other major brokers a substantial commission to direct all their clients to underwriter B.  Broker A would shortly advise the ISME member that the only underwriter who would accept his business for 2018 would be underwriter B and a 30% increase would apply.  There would then be only one underwriter bidding for the business at a 30% premium.  However, if the ISME member approached broker C, he could renew the book with underwriter B for the same price as before.  Broker A duly quoted the premium plus 30% a few days later and the ISME member severed his relationship with broker A.  The ISME member will not identify himself or the broker underwriter for fear of commercial retribution.  I do not need to explain the implications of this to anybody here as they should be clear.</p><p> The second story is also in the submission.  An ISME member in the east has tracked a policy for six years with respect to premiums, claims, losses, etc.  The underwriter has made a surplus of &euro;430,000 over these six years before reinsurance costs and overheads.  This surplus of &euro;430,000 represents an effective gross profit of 91%.  The ISME member has had four claims over this six-year period, with a total value of &euro;45,000.  The premium income is &euro;430,000 while the claim total over six years has been &euro;45,000.  I would love to see how the risk was priced over the six years as it effectively amounted to price gouging.  Again, the ISME member will not identify himself for fear of commercial retribution.  When there is only one underwriter bidding for the business, if the bidding party withdraws, the company will be left uninsured.</p><p> All brokers should be obliged to provide a five-year claims history at renewal.  The insurance industry would say this adds to cost and it cannot be done but it is done anyway.  The information must be produced for an actuary to be able to price the risk.  Somebody may say this cannot be produced but it is already produced and there is no cost.  At least with this approach, the client would be in a position to make a business decision by seeing the premiums and claims over a five-year period and deciding if it is an acceptable level of risk and price.</p><p> These are just two stories about members of the organisation but there are many others.  The common thread seems to be that there is only one underwriter bidding for the business.  Is that by accident or design?  I do not know.  </p></speech>

If I may, I invite Ms Linda Murray to tell her story as the matter of insurance for play centres is centre stage right now and it is representative of issues facing a number of other sectors too.  These are areas with a significant public footfall, including pubs, nightclubs and restaurants, as well as other parts of the leisure industry like leisure centres.  As a parent of small children, I know well the value of play centres and the important role they play in society.  I wish to give Ms Murray the opportunity to tell her story of Huckleberry's Den and the picture she is facing now.</p></speech>

This is not something I normally do.  I run Huckleberry's Den in Navan, County Meath, and I also represent 60 businesses which have all come together to form an organisation called Play Activity and Leisure Ireland, PALI.  We had to form that organisation with a common goal to lobby for fair insurance for our members.  We are all in the leisure sector and we include play centres, trampoline parks, pet farms, bowling alleys, karting tracks and basically facilities where families can have fun.  It is something that Ireland definitely does not want to lose.</p> <p>  We cannot get fair insurance and in many cases we cannot get any insurance.  Our premiums have risen by between 379% and more than 500% in the past five years.  My insurance has risen by 1,040% in the past six years.  Incredibly, our premiums far outweigh our claims.  As an organisation, we have paid &euro;5 million over the past five years in premiums.  We have had claims and reserves of just over &euro;1 million.  In the past five years, only &euro;200,000 of that &euro;5 million has been paid in claims in our sector.  This means &euro;4.8 million is sitting there while I cannot get insurance and our group cannot get fair insurance.</p> <p>  When I opened my business six years ago, my premium was &euro;2,500.  Last year, it was &euro;16,500.  I have been told that I cannot get insurance but I have been advised if I were to get it, I should expect to pay &euro;26,000.  That is just a "little" increase of 1,040% since I opened six years ago.  This is my livelihood.</p></speech>

Members may ask why I cannot do it.  I have had two claims in the past five years.  One child banged his head and, as a result, I am being sued because the child now has anxiety and is unable to play with his friends, go to play centres or play in playgrounds.  The reserve on this is &euro;23,000, despite the child not suffering any injury.  This is the only reason I cannot get insurance.</p> <p>  I have the only play centre in Navan and the other play centre closed six weeks ago.  Navan has a population of 40,000 people and there are many children who need to play, especially on rainy days.  Parents need to go somewhere for their kids' parties.  I really do not want to close in 25 days.  My own case is horrific but it is not unusual.  Centres across the length and breadth of the country are being told they are lucky to even get insurance.  After being handed a quote, we are told that even though it was &euro;20,000 last year and &euro;45,000 this year, we are lucky to get that.  We are genuinely told that.</p> <p>  All our centres in the past year have seen increases in premiums of between 100% and 300%.  This affects even centres that may have had no claims.  Deputy McGrath is familiar with one in Cork that paid just under &euro;8,000 for insurance last year, has never had a claim but has been told it is very lucky to get a premium of &euro;18,000 this year.  I challenge the Government to save my livelihood and that of all our members.  Save the livelihoods of our staff and give our kids somewhere to play.  Within the next 12 to 24 months, there may not be any play centres or leisure centres left if insurance is allowed to keep going the way it is.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I am aware of another example in Cork where the quote provided for the next 12 months is &euro;32,000.  It is a play centre with which the witness is probably familiar.  That figure is double last year's premium and more than six times the 2017 premium.  That is the level of growth.  The excess provision in the policy has gone from &euro;1,000 in 2017 to &euro;7,500 for each claim in the current proposed renewal.</p></speech>

Nobody wants that.  A centre should have insurance to cover cases where a real injury occurs and the centre has been negligent, for example.  That is what insurance is for and we all need it in our lives.  Centres are now proposing going without it, however, which is very risky.  We do not want to do that and we want to be able to pay our insurance but we just cannot afford it.</p></speech>

There are no other play centres in the town.</p><p>I prefer to have parties for my children outside the house.  I do not really want people in or to be cleaning up after everyone following a long day.  People who live in apartments need somewhere to go.  On rainy days, children need somewhere to play.  We have had people coming in with their children.  We have a very comfortable breast-feeding environment where women can come with their babies.  We see those women holding fifth or sixth birthday parties for them five or six years later.  This will not be possible anymore.  There is no trick up my sleeve.  I have 25 days left and that will be it.  I have tried everything.  I have worked on nothing but insurance since the beginning of January, or a few months before that.  I cannot get a quote.</p><p> When I outline the figures, such as &euro;5 million in premiums and &euro;1 million in claims, including all the reserves, I wonder why an Irish insurer does not examine this.  Why can we not get insurance on this island?  Why do we even have to go across the water, where we are told we are lucky to get insurance?  Why can we not get it here?  That we cannot beggars belief.  It is trickling into other industries.  When I was bringing my two children to gymnastics a couple of weeks ago, the organiser said to me he will need to get &euro;10 from me for each of them for insurance.  I asked whether it was not included in the membership fee and he said this is the first year in which insurance money has to be collected and that his business is down to its last insurer.  He said the business now has to charge everyone coming in for insurance.  If this is occurring in gymnastics organisations, what about other organisations?  Soccer clubs are ringing me asking whether they can join in with me.  What kind of society are we showing our children if we cannot even send them out to play a bit of hurling or football or do gymnastics without worrying whether the organisers will go out of business because of insurance costs?</p></speech>

I ask either Mr. Boland or Mr. McDonnell to identify what they regard as the core issues.  They outlined them in detail in their submissions.  Regarding the issue of awards, the claims environment and trying to stop and deal with the current trend, the roadmap the Government has laid out comprises the Judicial Council Bill and the new guidelines for personal injuries awards.  Do the delegates have faith that this is the right direction in which to go?  If the Bill becomes law and we get guidelines, will it change the direction in which we are currently going in terms of awards?</p></speech>

As I emphasised in the report, there is fear of alienating the only broker or underwriter now available or of bringing additional claims, reflecting poorly on oneself, personally or from a business point of view.  I can guarantee members that behind the play centres is a queue of sectors that are very close to being in the same circumstances.  I could list festivals, convenience stores, leisure centres, the entire adventure tourism industry, circuses and street artists.  Nightlife in Ireland is being severely affected by this issue.  Charitable groups are also affected.</p> <p>  On the point about the roadmap, it is abundantly clear that there has been enough analysis.  There have been two exceptional reports, namely the cost of insurance working group report and the Personal Injuries Commission report.  Both were kick-started by the report this committee produced at the end of 2016.  That is enough analysis at this stage.  We are well aware of what needs to be done.  The problem we have concerns the pace of the action and the apparent lack of political reform.  When there was a similar crisis in 2002&ndash;2003, there seemed to be political will to get work done.  The establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board involved incredibly complex work but it was done in less than two years.  The Judicial Council Bill was introduced to the Oireachtas in 2017 and it is still slowly working its way through the Seanad, from where it must proceed to the D&aacute;il.  That suggests to us that the political will does not exist to resolve this.  We find this extraordinary in the sense that this issue is solvable and the pathway exists.  The Government and Oireachtas have many issues that are very difficult to resolve, including housing, healthcare, Brexit and all the other issues that are major distractions, but the issue of insurance is solvable.  The pathway exists but the bit that is missing comprises the momentum and political will to get it sorted.</p></speech>

Is the issue being dealt with?

The Deputy is absolutely right to point that out.  We have already seen in the latest update on the report of the cost of insurance working group that there is not going to be a database.  We have said that in view of Mr. Nicholas Kearns' final report, it is absolutely clear that there needs to be a claim-by-claim database.  We have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Darcy, to reconsider the decision because we believe it is wrong.<br/><br/>It is a greater cause of anger if one believes that a claim is fraudulent but the final outcome actually does not matter.  The only difference is that one is getting sued by someone who knows they do not have an injury but one is still going to pay regardless of whether the claim is legitimate.  The reason we have made quantum the number one concern relates to Mr. Kearns' point in his summation.  Like Hansel and Gretel, Mr. Kearns did a fantastic job dropping the breadcrumbs for Members of the Oireachtas to follow in terms of required outcomes.  He stated that the quantum is unjustifiably and inexplicably large and that it is leading to all sorts of other consequences.  It is resulting in higher premiums but it is also attracting criminality.  Mr. Kearns is saying that we do not have any mechanism to deal with this.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is saying that he cannot tell the Garda what to do.  We have suggested this is a particular area of white-collar crime in which there is no enforcement whatsoever, and that the courts do not enforce anything against those concerned.  To an extent, it does not matter whether an organisation such as a play centre operator is getting sued by a fraudulent claimant or a legitimate claimant; since there is &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 of quantum, there will be somebody there.  We have described it as a honey pot that is attracting all these people in.  The level just has to be reduced.<br/><br/>Collectively, Members of the Oireachtas have been informed that there is a problem with capping damages.  The very first recommendation Mr. Kearns made in his Personal Injuries Commission report, which went back to the Department, involved capping damages by means of legislation.  We have shown, in documentation sourced through freedom of information provisions by Mark Tighe in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, that it was immediately nobbled by the lawyers and taken out.  Mr. Kearns very clearly left the same recommendation in.  He has just said he believes the judicial council is the way to go or the way to achieve the same thing.  There is a possibility that a judicial council could sit down and decide to maintain damages at the same level, or 60% or 70% thereof.  That would not be a solution.  In our view, this is a public policy matter, not a matter for court procedure or judges.  Respectfully, we suggest it is the members' job to cap damages.</p></speech>

In a sense, they have nothing to lose at this stage.</p><p>Telling one's story and bringing the humanity of what is involved here to the fore is very important.  Looking back at the work done by the committee on the tracker mortgage scandal, the tide turned when those affected by the tracker mortgage issue came before the committee and told their stories.  They were totally outside their comfort zone, but they bared their souls and told their stories and that is when the tide turned.</p><p> Mr. Boland spoke about the issue of political will.  My observation is that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing his best, but he is a lone voice within Government.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has delegated to him the whole issue of insurance.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, seems to have no interest in the issue.  I never hear the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, even talking about the issue.  When there was a Private Members' motion on the issue in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was the only Government representative for almost the entire debate.  There is only one person in the Government even attempting to do something about this and that is not good enough.  There is a lack of political will.  All I can say to the representatives is that, for whatever period is left in this D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il  will hold the Government's feet to the fire on this issue.  We know what is at stake.</p></speech>

I know that it was difficult for Ms Murray in particular to give her contribution as a person who has invested so much of her life, expertise and resources in a business and is facing that uncertain outcome in 25 days.  Many members are familiar with other play centres that, unfortunately, have closed.  Some in my constituency are facing the same future and uncertainty as Ms Murray.  I ask her to explain to anybody listening why insurance companies will not insure a soft play centre in Ireland.  Is it the case that only one insurance company based in Britain was doing so but is now pulling out of the market?  I ask her to explain why the situation has come to this point.</p></speech>

I have been in the leisure sector for 11 years.  It has never even been brought up.  In the past, one went to one's broker and was told that leisure centres do not get insurance in Ireland, so I have always sourced my insurance across the water.  The insurance company in the UK told me that Ireland is seen as a loss-making nation when it comes to insurance and that the cost of claims is far higher than is the case in the UK.  It stated that it has no interest in insuring play centres in Ireland, particularly those with a claim or two against them.  The premiums of centres without claims against them are increasing by 100% or 200% to cope with any potential claims on the business.  I have noticed what seems to be a cycle, with insurance companies from the UK coming in every three or four years and then leaving.  We have never had a range of insurance companies from which to choose.  The companies see us as loss-making.  However, the figures for our group show that we are not loss-making.  I have been told that the insurance companies are afraid of what could happen, given the type of awards that are made.</p> <p>  When I began looking into this matter a few months ago, I thought the biggest reason for the difficulty sourcing insurance was claims and that our insurance premiums probably matched or came near to the level of claims.  When I discovered that there is a significant disparity between the two, I asked why we cannot get insurance if there is so much money to be made on us as an industry.  I was told it is because of the fear of what can happen as a result of the type of awards that are made.  It is the fear of claims for broken bones, such as a broken arm or finger.  It is not catastrophic injuries, it is the fear of claims for broken bones.  Most of the injuries suffered on our premises are soft tissue injuries such as bruises or a split lip.  Those are the injuries for which &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000 is being awarded; it is not, in many cases, injuries such as a broken arm.  The insurance companies are afraid that eight companies within the group scheme being sued for broken arms could result in &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 of payouts. </p></speech>

Unless there was a surge in claims against the centres, I do not understand why an insurance-----</p></speech>

Half of our centres have no claims.  This is what does not make any sense and why I would challenge an Irish underwriter or insurance company to look at us.  Obviously, in my case, there are exaggerated and fraudulent claims.  One hates to see them coming through the door and there are many sleepless nights over them.  However, as a sector, we do not have a huge number of such claims and there does not seem to have been a significant increase in them, yet our premiums are increasing by 300% and some centres cannot get insurance.  There is no transparency in how this is calculated.  When my insurance premium increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,000, I asked what was the reason for the increase.  The broker told me that was just the way it was.  I had no claims in that year, but my premium increased from &euro;8,000 to &euro;16,500.  When one questions the increase, one is told that there is one underwriter offering insurance and it is the only option.  I took out a personal loan to pay that premium because there is no way that one would have that money lying around.  One pays it over the year and prays that one will not have a claim during that time.  We are all on tenterhooks.</p> <p>  A significant issue is that many of our businesses such as leisure centres are based in units in industrial parks where one must take out a four year and nine month lease.  In God's name, how can one take out a lease for four years and nine months when one does not know what one's insurance premium will be the next year or the year after that?  How can one tell a bank that one can take out a five-year loan to pay for a new set of laser tag equipment such as that we received a couple of weeks ago and be able to  will repay it over a few years when one does not know where one will be with insurance in one year?  One year ago, I did not know I would not get insurance this year.</p></speech>

I do not understand why we cannot shop in the European market or get an insurance company in.  I also do not understand why an Irish insurer will not give us cover.  Three or four big Irish insurers recently posted profits of &euro;200 million.  One can see the profit to be made on our business but we cannot get an insurer.  We need an insurance company to be able to insure us.</p> <p>  We need something to be done about fraudulent or exaggerated claims.  If I walk into a soft play centre with my child and he or she suffers an injury, I should not immediately think, "What could I get for that?"  That is what some people are thinking.  They think they might as well claim and see if they can get something because nothing will happen to them afterwards anyway - they will not be prosecuted if it is found that the claim is fraudulent or exaggerated.  That mentality must be nipped in the bud.  People should know that if it is discovered that the child did not suffer as serious an injury as was claimed for, the parent could face a fine or prosecution.  It is very important to start getting that into people's minds.  Persons who lodge fraudulent claims in the UK may face time in jail.  That happens there but it does not happen here.  I do not think anybody has been prosecuted here for anything to do with public liability.  I do not know all the facts but, as far as I know, nobody has.</p></speech>

We need an insurance company to offer cover.  We need competitiveness rather than a monopoly in order that companies are not faced with having to go without insurance or to self insure, which is what we are currently considering but should not have to.  Self insurance is very risky but, as a group, we are trying to think of ways to stay in business.  We love what we do and being in this business.  We love to see tourists and families coming into our businesses.</p> <p>  Where would we be if there were no bowling alleys or similar facilities down the country?  Yesterday, one of our members featured on the "Today with Sean O'Rourke" programme on RT&Eacute; radio.  The premium for his bowling alley increased from slightly less than &euro;10,000 to &euro;25,000 with no claims in the past year.   There is very little that can go wrong in a bowling alley apart from a ball being dropped on a toe.  A similar bowling alley in the UK would probably have an insurance premium of &pound;2,000 or &pound;3,000.</p> <p>  One of our members provides trains in shopping centres such as Swords Pavilions.</p><p>One can get into a little train with the children and go around.  He does it in the UK and Ireland.  In the UK, he could get all of it insured for &pound;1,500 but his latest insurance quote here is &euro;33,000 for the same industry.  It involves trains going around a shopping centre.</p></speech>

The Alliance for Insurance Reform is made up of a wide range of groups, including owners of soft play areas.  As Ms Murray and Deputy Michael McGrath stated, this issue goes much wider than one sector.  The GAA, other sporting organisations and community groups have spoken to us.  We have heard of festivals that cannot go ahead because of insurance issues.  St. Patrick's Day parades are being put in jeopardy as a result of insurance.  There is a real and sharp impact on businesses and jobs and the resulting issue of employees who have lost their jobs being able to keep a roof over their heads.  In a situation where that type of monopoly exists or the State does not provide insurance to a certain sector, has the alliance engaged with Insurance Ireland and has Insurance Ireland given a legitimate reason for not addressing the matter?  If somebody does not get motor insurance from a company, Insurance Ireland has a scheme whereby somebody who has been refused a quote for motor insurance will be provided with a quote.  That does not mean the quote will be reasonable but at least a quote is offered.  In this case, businesses operating in this State cannot get insurance from companies and their representatives, which are now very profitable.  Has there been any engagement with Insurance Ireland?</p></speech>

Our perspective on this is evolving because we did not start as an alliance that could analyse this crisis in detail.  We started and remained an alliance that represents members regarding the crisis they are experiencing.  We have engaged and developed a much broader perspective in the past while.  I go back to one of the Deputy's original comments on this.  Historically, we have had very high levels of awards and claims in this country.  These are serious issues that have fed into this crisis and need to be addressed.  Arising from our engagement with the insurance industry, we have not received any data that would justify the spike in premiums we have seen in recent years.  I am conscious that this is the finance committee and that we are representing businesses.  While we have data on motor insurance, we do not have any data to explain what is happening.  I will ask Mr. Gerry Monks to give an insight from the perspective of family grocery stores.  From January 2014 to December 2016, we saw a 70% spike in motor insurance premiums.  We did not see a spike in claims or awards that would justify that increase.  There is no clarity in this area.  As Ms Murray stated, insurers are again recording very healthy profits across the sector.  We do not have clarity on this either but our understanding is that management fees transferred back to parent companies remain an issue.  As we do not have a blue book, we cannot prove that.  The extent to which insurance companies reserve for potential losses has increased dramatically in recent years, prompted by the Central Bank.  Again, our understanding is that the companies are over-reserving at this stage, which means these reserves are ploughed back into profitability.   We are faced on one side with an interest group, the lawyers, that has historically done very well out of this sector and, on the other side, insurers, which over any ten-year period always make a profit.  We are the jam in the middle.  We have not got clear answers and we do not have the data to explain the position, which is certainly part of the problem.  I will let Mr. Monks introduce himself.  He has put together some data on another sector to show that this is not a very specific issue for one sector.</p></speech>

I have been looking after retailers - typically shops and convenience stores - across the country for more than 20 years in my 43-year career in insurance.  These are commercial businesses but they are also families.  When I looked at an analysis of the level of increase for the purposes of this exercise, I deliberately wanted to make sure I was not picking out cases with claims so I whittled it down to a certain number.  I came up with a figure of 73% over a five-year period for the average increase applied to these businesses.  Of the 29 selected cases, 15 were claim-free.  I took out extraordinary figures to try to make it read realistically.  Insurance in Ireland is broken.  The very simple fact is we seem to somehow tolerate levels of payment for minor injuries and all other classes of injury that are multiples of those in other countries such as our nearest neighbour.  The UK has a population that is more than ten times the size of our population, yet we pay out approximately four times more than is paid out in the UK.  The figures do not add up and the system does not work.  We do not have the numbers to justify it.  The reserving being placed by insurers has increased in accordance with Central Bank best practice and nobody will argue with that.  Claims do not come and go inside a matter of weeks or months.  They take years.  A claim can be outstanding for four years and in the meantime, the policyholder - the family - will be faced with an increased bill because the outstanding or reserved claim will be treated as a claim paid.  Even if the claim is ultimately not paid and the only costs incurred by the insurer are its investigation costs, the premium increase will have taken place.  It is history now.  The insurers do not have the wherewithal to go back and pay what they owe to Joe Bloggs back from four years ago.  They look at the end of every year and balance out what they need to make sure they do not go into the red because if they do, the Central Bank will close them down.</p></speech>

I hear what Mr. Monks is saying and I agree with him on some of the exaggerated awards that are being paid.  While that issue needs to be addressed, I do not believe the insurance sector will reduce premiums accordingly.  I do not trust the industry in which I believe a cartel is operating.  Ms Murray's example of &euro;5 million in premiums and &euro;1 million in reserves shows that price gouging is taking place.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Boland spoke about the commitment by insurers to reduce prices in parallel with reforms.  FBD told the agricultural sector that prices would fall if it undertook additional safety measures, installed cameras and so forth.  Rather than falling, insurance premiums have increased dramatically resulting in the closure of some rural marts, which constitute the fabric of many rural communities.  Before any further reforms are undertaken at this level, do we need a commitment from insurers, similar to the one given in 2002, that if businesses take certain steps, insurance premiums will reduce by a certain percentage?  This was set out in a table agreed at that point in time.</p> <p>  There has been much talk about fraudulent claims.  The insurance industry told us these claims result in a &euro;50 increase in all motor insurance premiums.  We can imagine that the cost is significant and not just in motor insurance but in other areas of insurance.  Many people do not claim from their insurance even when the claim is legitimate.  I think the model is broken.  If a tree fell on my car - one fell across the road from my house and my car ran into it just a couple of weeks ago - there is no chance that I would claim on my insurance policy because the company would increase my premium by twice the amount that it would cost to fix the car.  Many people who have minor accidents simply do not contact their insurance companies.  The sector is broken because businesses are penalised for claiming and using the insurance they have.</p><p> We have statistics on fraudulent claims for the first time.  Insurance companies now have to report fraudulent claims or suspected fraudulent claims to the Garda.  I found it quite surprising that from 1 October to the end of February, which is five full months, there were only 19 cases of fraudulent claims right across the insurance sector.  That includes public liability insurance, motor insurance and all the rest.  Either the insurance companies are not reporting what they are saying or they are exaggerating the number of fraudulent claims to justify the price gouging that is taking place, or there is something else going on.  That does not take away from the point that there needs to be a Garda insurance fraud unit.  We are very strongly in favour of that.  The committee is united on it.  It should happen without delay.  Is insurance fraud as considerable as the insurance companies are telling us?  If so, why are they reporting only three cases per month across all sectors of insurance?  The claims that are reported are suspected fraudulent claims.  Some of them may not be.</p></speech>

With regard to commitments to reductions from the insurance companies, I agree absolutely.  We have quite a list of reforms that we believe are necessary but we are very conscious of the amount of traffic going through the Oireachtas at the moment.  We want to try to stay very focused.  It is one of the top three items on our list.  There is a considerable amount of work being done on this.  An enormous amount of pain is being caused by insurance premiums.  If we emerged at the end of this crisis with no reductions in insurance premiums to follow, it would have catastrophic consequences.  It is essential at this stage that we obtain clarity from the insurers as to the benefits of all this work.  I am conscious there have been developments since 2002 with regard to competition law and so on, so there may be complications.  That is why we have asked the Department of Finance to address this issue.  We have asked that it do so from a State point of view because the State is inextricably linked to the issue.  Very often, we are legally obliged to have insurance, whether it is motor insurance or, in many cases, public liability insurance.  As it is the State and organs of the State that are obliging us to have insurance, they cannot give the impression they are a third party on this issue.  We are looking for this kind of commitment from the insurers via the State as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On fraudulent claims, I am aware of the data mentioned by the Deputy.  We welcome any clarity or transparency in this whole area.  I am not here to speak on behalf of the insurers but my understanding from some insurance companies is that when they make what they call section 19 complaints on suspected insurance fraud, they are not yet being logged on PULSE.  I have been told that by somebody anonymously.  I cannot verify it one way or the other.  I would be surprised by the low levels of fraud, as reported.  The experience of our members is that fraud is a good deal more prevalent than the statistics indicate.</p></speech>

The information is from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We have got the information from the Garda.  The Minister says that in the period between 1 October 2018 and 28 February 2019, there were 19 incidents of insurance companies reporting insurance claim fraud as per the stated guidelines.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has advised that crime counting rules have not been applied to these data.  I refer to recording the data on PULSE.  However, while they are not accounted for on PULSE, as should be the case so we can have ease of access, they represent the total number of claims reported by the insurance industry.  In my view, that is concerning.  Either they are not taking this seriously enough or there is another reason.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.896" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#J00400"><p>I will deal with that point first.  We have covered it on page 7 of our submission.  There may be reluctance on the part of defendants, by which I mean policyholders, and insurance companies to invoke the fraudulent claim clause under section 26 of the 2004 Act.  There is case law on this.  We have quoted it on page 7.  Mr. Justin Kevin Cross said that because, in his view, the 2004 Act is so pro-defendant, with which we have an issue in the first case, aggravated or exemplary damages is the only real deterrent to an irresponsible or, indeed, over-enthusiastic invocation of such a plea.  In simple English, that means that if a defendant suggests in defending his or her claim that the claimant is making a fraudulent claim and does not succeed with that assertion, not alone will the plaintiff get damages but he or she can also get aggravated or exemplary damages.  That is crimping a lot of activity in the sector.</p> <p>  The Deputy implied that if awards came down, premiums might not.  I will qualify his perspective very slightly for him.  In our view, premiums absolutely will tumble, but in a competitive market only.  We have CSO data on that.  PIAB was established in 2003.  The CSO tells us that, from peak to trough, the cost of motor insurance came down 41% in four years since PIAB's introduction.  One should bear in mind that PIAB was not reducing awards in that period.  It was paying out what the judges were paying out but doing so on the basis of payments of &euro;45 being made to it.  The motor insurance market is a competitive market and one is legally obliged to have insurance.  Some of the problems the Deputy has heard about today concern those with a single underwriter.  To qualify this, if awards are reduced in a robust, competitive market, premiums will fall, but only where there is more than one underwriter.</p></speech>

The Judicial Council Bill is going through the Seanad and Mr. Boland is probably aware the Minister is to introduce an amendment on Report Stage for the book of quantum to be reviewed by the judicial council.  I offer assurance, along with my Seanad colleagues, that we will be seeking to have the legislation passed in the Seanad as quickly as possible.  Once this is done, it will proceed to the D&aacute;il for consideration.</p> <p>  There are a couple of points I need to understand on the Court of Appeal.

It is important to make this point and the Senator is absolutely right to raise it.  What has constantly been the bulk of the issue as we see it is the level of awards made quite regularly over the past while for very minor injuries, or paracetamol injuries as they have been called.  Typically, the type of case that goes to the Court of Appeal involves quite substantial injuries.  I do not think anyone in this room would question the right of someone who has been seriously injured to get sufficient general damages to cover their pain and suffering.  This is not the issue.  The issue is at the bottom end of the scale for minor soft tissue injuries.  It is important to note it is not just with regard to whiplash but extends throughout the scale.  For example, if I bruise my thumb and there is no ligament damage, no breakage, a certain amount of swelling and a full recovery in a short period of time, at present the book of quantum entitles me to up to &euro;21,200 for that injury.  This is what is driving this issue from the insurer's point of view.</p></speech>

It will not happen.  Not alone this, and this is where I would like our former chairman to jump in, the issue of costs is being used to blackmail people into early settlement.

He has worked closely with members.  A short paragraph on page 7 of ISME's submission states its members advise it that one of the most important considerations before a case is defended in court is the name of the trial judge.  It also states that if it is one of a small number of judges with pro-plaintiff renown, businesses will instruct counsel to settle, or counsel will instruct them to settle, irrespective of the merits and strength of the defence.  I had an experience as an operator, again going back to the Circuit Court limit of &euro;60,000, whereby, having won decisively a case in the Circuit Court in which the judge was scathing with respect to the plaintiff in summing up the case and awarding us costs and the case effectively, within a matter of days we received a phone call from the solicitor acting for the plaintiff.  Committee members know what I am going to say.  His words were that he needed to earn his fees out of this so he was going to appeal it to the High Court unless he was paid a certain amount of money.  That cost me my excess.  Why would I not want to go to the High Court to defend a case that I clearly won hands down?  I go back to the paragraph I read from ISME's submission.</p></speech>

In his second and final report, Nicholas Kearns said we were at 4.4 times the nearest jurisdiction, which itself is an international outlier.

Accordingly, we whittled it down to the three that are absolutely essential and the book of quantum is top of that list.  It drives many other aspects of the issue, most of which have been outlined.  It also tends to muddy the water in an area for which very little data are available and it precludes proper analysis.  There is a sense of injustice when a fraudulent or exaggerated claim is made against someone and the book of quantum is the driver of this, so it needs to be resolved.</p></speech>

What has been said brings home to us the fact that we have a complete market failure in insurance.  We have had report after report, including substantial reports on which this committee worked, but it has not improved and we do not have the transparency we need.  I was looking at the eighth progress update and it gave the impression that we are making progress.  I cannot get my head around the CSO figures for motor claims because they do not relate to my what I know, particularly having spoken to many people about their experience in this regard.  Contrary to the research I have done, the figures state that motor insurance has gone down by 23%.  Do the witnesses have confidence that the information gathered by the CSO reflects what is actually happening?</p></speech>

The CSO contacts insurers, who give quotes related to the type of policies the CSO wants to measure.  It is not an ideal approach to putting together data in an area like insurance, which is so fraught with difficulties.  The figures are better that they are for liability, where there are no data at all, but in the area of motor insurance the data being generated are for a specific type of premium.  People, including those to whom the Senator has spoken, may not be in the category picked by the CSO.</p><p>Our experience is that younger drivers, drivers of older cars, and drivers of commercial vehicles are still getting hammered and are not experiencing reductions.  A very specific area, which I suspect is comprised of standard families based somewhere outside Dublin, may find their premiums reducing at the moment but we do not think that is widespread.  </p><p> One must take the good with the bad.  Everyone was quite willing to use the 70% increase as a prompt for action in recent years.  That was entirely valid at the time.  While there is some validity in the figures and in the response to them, we are not at all convinced that the model being used cover all areas. </p></speech>

Mr. Boland has spoken about how data are collected and how it appears from a motor perspective, I will refer to liability data that the CSO may or may not collect.  I may be one of the random companies chosen so I am asked to fill in this form, the CSO annual services inquiry form, 2808B, annually.  I have tried to put this on the agenda before but have failed so far.  The form asks for the company's costs.  One question is what is the firm's insurance cost as a global number.  Say a firm's insurance premium is &euro;10,000, within that there is a premium for motor, for assets, for property, a premium for employer liability, for public liability, consequential loss etc.  The CSO should ask for a breakdown of the insurance figure as otherwise, the question is meaningless.  Liability is the key number, it is the biggest cost in any premium.  In the case of a manufacturing company, employer liability will be the most significant number.  In a business where people are on the premises, public liability is the key number.  If I was to be asked to give a breakdown of my insurance premium, if it was &euro;10,000, I should be asked for my public liability premium.  Then in another part of the form, to get the denominator for measuring the rate for public liability, one divides the premium into the sales figure.  That can be compared internationally to see if Ireland is an outlier: we are.  In the case of employer liability the actuarial formula is arrived at by dividing the premium into wages, which gives the rate.  The CSO is not collecting these data.  Either it does not understand the data or they do not want to collect them for whatever reason, maybe it does not think it is important.  It is vitally important that we have the data.</p> <p>  The Alliance for Insurance Reform has its asks but ISME's approach is different.  It reverts to Senator Kieran O'Donnell's question.  There are three key issues of which the first is quantum.  My colleague, Mr. McDonnell referred to several issues relating to legal reform, including reform of the courts and procedure.  The final area is the need for transparent granular data.  There is no one thing that will solve the problem, but those three things combined, if they are tackled simultaneously, will solve the problem.  That is the answer.</p></speech>

It is about 70% or 80% of the bullet.  I will not refer to any individual business but I ask members to bear in mind that we need to reform how liability is assessed.  Currently, if something occurs on a premises, there is not even consideration of negligence, the insurer effectively will simply ask the business "Did this happen on your premises, yes or no?"  Last week, the papers reported a &euro;30,000 settlement to a child in a city centre cr&egrave;che where one child went into another with a tricycle.  This happened several years ago and &euro;30,000 was awarded where the child is fully recovered and has a 1 mm scar.  Whether we think that is a good idea is a subjective assessment, however we might ask if that happened in a person's kitchen, and one child banged into another and gave a scar, should a payment of &euro;30,000 arise?  If the answer is no, then neither should it arise in a cr&egrave;che or a play facility.  We must get our heads around the fact that simply because something happens on a premises does not mean the owner of the premises is liable for it.  We have a bonkers concept of what constitutes negligence and duty of care.  We have spent a long time arguing that.  Currently anyone who owns or operates a premises who goes before a court, most especially where children are concerned, loses before going in to the courtroom, irrespective of the merits of their case.  That is an area that must be taken on.</p></speech>

Also, where is the Garda insurance fraud unit?  Those are the two key questions.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the committee does not have a direct line to the Law Society so I will concentrate on the insurance industry, into which it does have a direct line.  We are well aware of the profits that have been declared in recent weeks.  Given that it looks as though they were over-reserved in recent times, and that may have had quite an influence on the losses they declared, we suspect they will go into a period of very substantial profitability, as those reserves are released back into the profit and loss accounts.  I would ask them a direct question, namely, what they will do in light of their improving financial situation, to help the policyholders of Ireland?</p></speech>

It returns to Ms Murray's comments and what Ms Dorothea Dowling has been saying about the black hole and the amount of claims versus what is taken in.  She had identified something like &euro;2 billion black hole.  The industry is running rings around this Government and around citizens and they will continue to do that until we force through the situation.  The 25 days mentioned earlier keeps coming to mind.  We need emergency legislation.  We can pass legislation through on many other things, and we had weeks for Brexit legislation.  For me, the job losses and the impact on society and communities and so on, this needs to be treated like emergency legislation.</p></speech>

One does not get told until about 24 to 48 hours before one's premium is due what will be the premium.  They do not even allow someone to try to shop around, even though there is not any shopping around to do.  One is told they cannot look at one's new insurance premium until four weeks before the due date but I have yet to come across anybody who has been told what their premium will be at least a week before.</p> <p>  To take up Mr. McDonnell's point that that would not happen in someone's home, my daughter is four but last year when she was three she was invited to a play date in a house.  We were delighted to go but the day before we went a disclaimer came through on WhatsApp to say that if anything happens in the house the owners will not take responsibility.  I said it was laughable.  That is the society in which we live.</p></speech>

That is absolutely not the case within the insurance industry.  There is no transparency.  If anything, the insurance industry is more systemically important because we cannot function without insurance.  We are legally obliged to have a relationship with the insurance industry yet we cannot get the data.  That case absolutely falls under that heading.</p></speech>

First, have they compared the North and the Republic in this regard?  Are there processes in the North that we might examine in the sense of an all-Ireland approach, which might make it easier?</p> <p>  Second, as somebody who goes occasionally to play centres with children which, as Ms Murray said, are popular now for children's parties, it could it be made clearer to people using them at the beginning in what effectively would be a disclaimer notice to the effect that they are using the premises at their own risk unless something very serious happens.  Leaving aside the question of responsibility, as she and others said, accidents happen.  That is the reason we pay insurance.  However, could clear information be given on behalf of insurance companies, not the business, on how they approach it and that people are there effectively at their own risk unless something very serious happens?</p> <p>  The other aspect, which is often a contributory issue, is a person suffering relatively minor injuries.  There is a series of 24-hour accident centres in the Dublin area, where one can get treatment.  Would it be possible to develop a system where if somebody gets a bad bang, such as a suspected fracture, that could be addressed quite quickly?  That requires disclosure as soon as possible, which is essential, but do the witnesses believe there are ways and means by which we can address that?  At a local level,there are local enterprise offices.  Could a package of information be put together for SMEs but also for the customer because, as a previous speaker said, many people do not make claims because they feel empathy with the business owner and they do not want to make a claim?  However, sometimes, because of a lack of attention at the time, it develops into something bigger and then resentment, expectations and so on set in and it becomes a difficult road.</p></speech>

The three big asks I am taking from the discussion is to get the Garda fraud unit set up as quickly as possible.  Where are they with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, or the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy?  Are they playing pass the parcel with each other?  Is one saying it is not a matter for me, it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and<i>vice versa</i>or is it all a matter for the Garda Commissioner?</p><p>I refer to the book of quantum, which I have discussed previously with Mr. Boland.  It is a statistical, historical database of what has happened and the only way it can change over time is by claims changing.  Legislation cannot change the book of quantum but it can, as he suggests, cap the injury awards or whatever over time.  The book of quantum is historical and statistical and it is compiled from the information available.  Unfortunately, the premiums are as high as they are because the payouts from judges and the insurance system generally have been high.  We need to focus on how we can reduce those claims.  I do not doubt that everybody in their business is doing everything they can to minimise that.</p><p>In the ten or 12 years of her business's existence, has Ms Murray physically changed the design of her premises, taken out certain climbing frames, slides or whatever?  Twenty years ago I was involved with summer camps and people would tell us that we could not have step-ups and so on.  We hear about children not being able to play or run in playgrounds and so on.  I read about a claim yesterday where a table flipped over in the wind and, unfortunately, a three year old broke a nose.  The award was &euro;30,000 even though the nose healed perfectly.  I am sure there was some trauma for the child but I am not sure about an award of &euro;30,000 or where that figure come from.  Does Ms Murray have comparative figures for insurance premiums for similar play centres in the UK, although it has a different claims environment?</p><p>Most people have said the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing his bit but he is a lone voice in that regard.  I met the Connacht publicans yesterday and I am conscious that the LVA is doing significant work and that the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, is helping out as well.  The biggest bone of contention the Connacht publicans had, bar the issue that arose recently in terms of the limits, is the cost of insurance generally, which is destroying their businesses.  They are getting one or two customers a night in some venues but they are still paying large insurance premiums for very little return.</p><p>The FBD representatives are coming in next.  Do the witnesses have any questions they would like members to put to them?  We get many lawyers blaming the insurance industry and the insurance industry blaming the lawyers.  I would like their thoughts on who is more at fault.  I am sure all of them are at fault.  I am throwing out the questions because we do not have much time for engagement.</p><p>The witnesses final big ask was in terms of their schedule about the reductions in the data availability.  Since I joined this committee in 2016, we have been crying out for visibility on claims.  They said the CSO and the Central Bank have more or less thrown out the idea of visibility on that.  They might give their thoughts on that.</p></speech>

I watched Ms Murray's contribution in my office while I was doing other work and it was very sad because she was a person who was full of enthusiasm and had built up a business.</p><p>The emotion struck me.  All we can do is tell people to keep going and not to let others put them down.  It is important to say that because people become frustrated and opt out of business.  It has happened in my own area.  </p><p> Mr. Boland spoke about the slow pace of reform.  When I first came into the D&aacute;il following my election in 2016 I heard the Chairman making a very strong case for businesses in his own constituency in the context of insurance costs having risen by 100%.  Last year RGDATA told us that shop insurance had increased in many cases from &euro;10,000 to &euro;100,000.  Restaurant insurance has gone up by almost 50%.  The Chairman has heard me talk previously about the case of an hotel in my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway that was facing closure but a very innovative family took it over, maintaining the employment of 25 people.  The family looked at the insurance cover which was very low at the time, amounting to &euro;12,500.  A review was conducted four years ago and the family was advised that the proper cover would bring their costs up to around &euro;25,000.  Today, their insurance costs are almost &euro;50,000 per annum.  This really frustrates me because there were only two small claims against the hotel in the period.  One was to the value of &euro;2,500 and the other was &euro;1,500.  I ask the representatives of the insurance business here today to explain to me how that is possible.  In the context of such small claims, there appears to me to be no justification for that level of premium increase.  The Government's competitive watchdog, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, said in 2016 that the biggest issue facing small business was the increase in insurance costs.  Three years later and many businesses are barely holding on.  These insurance costs will crucify more businesses if we do not make progress quickly.  </p><p> Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a number of pertinent questions on the book of quantum.  When the reform of the book of quantum takes place - and the work of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy in this regard must be acknowledged - can the insurance industry representatives assure us that insurance costs will fall?  I will give the witnesses another example of the problems here.  I know of a haulage company that has secured insurance abroad and I wonder if that is totally safe.  One haulier had to take out insurance abroad.  He has 15 trucks and at one point his insurance was costing &euro;70,000.  In one year, it increased to &euro;130,000, even though there were no claims against his business.  His insurance increased by almost 100%.  In terms of the costs of running a small business usually wages, raw materials and energy costs outstrip other costs but now, in many cases, insurance is outstripping even these costs.  That is not sustainable.  </p></speech>

We had lots of different groups in here, including road hauliers, insurance companies and legal professionals when we were preparing our report on insurance costs.  Nobody was to blame, according to those with whom we engaged.</p> <p>  ISME apportions a lot of blame to the Judiciary.  It argues that a substantial minority of our Judiciary is excessively, unfairly and unjustly pro-plaintiff.  ISME was not surprised to see the same High Court justice, who ironically oversees the personal injury list in the High Court, mount a stout defence of the current personal injuries system in the press, suggesting that awards for general damages have fallen in real terms since the 1970s.  ISME suggests that this committee should understand that while it does not expect the law to be on its side, it does expect it to be blind.  ISME members have advised the organisation that one of the most important considerations before they decide to defend a case in court is the name of the trial judge.  If it is one of a small number of judges with a pro-plaintiff reputation, they will instruct their counsel to settle, irrespective of the merits or strengths of their defence.  ISME argues that this is an appalling indictment of our Judiciary and I agree.  The statement from ISME is unbelievable but the representatives here today stand over it.  It is a sad state of affairs, in my view.</p> <p>  We have all come across cases such as those outlined by previous contributors and we understand the issues relating to the book of quantum and so forth.  Mr. Boland said that it was clear to his organisation that the dead hand of vested interests and the lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt.  In that context, he is blaming the political system, as well as the Judiciary and vested interests.  I ask him to outline to us what we, as politicians, can do.  We believe there is very little more than we can do.  We are already exerting pressure wherever we can.  </p></speech>

In response to Senator Paddy Burke, the pace of reform in this area is not fast enough.  I used the example of the last time we had a crisis in this area in 2002 and 2003, when all of the legislation and actions to address it were done and dusted within two and a half years.  We are nowhere near that timeframe this time around.  In very practical terms, what politicians can do to speed things up is get the Judicial Council Bill through the Houses as quickly as possible.  They can also exert political pressure to get the Garda insurance fraud unit up and running and this committee can hold the insurers to account in terms of what they are going to do to make sure that premiums go down.</p> <p>  I would respond to Deputy Eugene Murphy's question on the book of quantum by going back to what the Minister and the insurance industry have said constantly, namely, that claims drive costs.  That is the insurance industry's analysis of this problem so if the book of quantum can be resolved, that sorts the claims issue.  Certainly from our point of view, we would then regard the insurance industry as being under an obligation to respond with reduced insurance costs.  The Deputy's story about the hotel is one which is very familiar.  What happened there is happening all over the country.  In terms of why it happens, we are mystified and it is absolutely a question for the insurers.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Horkan, as I understand it an announcement on the Garda insurance fraud unit is imminent.  We would ask why it has taken so long to get to this point because it is our understanding that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been ready internally for this for quite some time.  We are awaiting a decision on that but there is an opportunity to apply political pressure.  We are told that it is a decision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but surely the Government has a role to play in terms of expressing the desire of the State to have a Garda insurance fraud unit in place.  </p> <p> As the legislation currently stands, the book of quantum can only be revised through the history of awards over the previous two to three years.  However, the Judicial Council Bill will give the power to reduce downwards, regardless of awards history.  That is what we are expecting the Judiciary to do; we need judges to step up to the mark on behalf of society.  In terms of health and safety, I would suggest that this country is the health and safety nation  Our colleagues from Europe and further afield are gobsmacked at the level to which health and safety is acknowledged and enforced in this country.  It is time for the insurers to respect that in terms of the premiums being paid.</p><p>The national claims information database is a partial solution to transparency.  When the first report is released towards the end of this year, I suspect that it will be very unsatisfactory because it will be a first look, it will refer only to motor insurance, and there are no firm plans to examine liability.</p><p> To respond to the question on insurers, I reiterate that FBD and the broader insurance industry should be asked what they will do for policyholders in the light of the improvement in their financial position and the forecast additional improvement.</p><p> Deputy Burton referred to Northern Ireland.  I suspect that the UK, and Northern Ireland in particular, has its own problems in this area.  While the UK is by no means the ideal, as Mr. McDonnell noted, it is regarded by the rest of Europe as an insurance outlier.  I would not, therefore, necessarily consider Northern Ireland to be a role model in this area, not least because there may be complications arising from Brexit.  I would prefer if we got our own house in order at this stage and there is a fairly well-defined roadmap in that regard.  </p><p> On healthcare and early intervention on injuries, much has been done to try to achieve that but the problem is being caused by general damages, which are paid for pain and suffering, rather than special damages, which cover medical care and loss of earnings.  The general damage for the pain and suffering of the original incident is the problem, which is why the solutions we have proposed are in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Linda Murray" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#P00200"><p>To respond to some of Deputy Burton's points, all our businesses, with the exception of perhaps one or two, have a disclaimer for people to sign.  Unfortunately, however, when an accident happens to a minor, disclaimers are not worth the paper on which they are written.  We would welcome a change in the duty of care to the effect that when someone is on the premises of a business whose owner is not negligent, a disclaimer will stand.  Nobody is questioning anything about where negligence has occurred.  It would be ideal if a disclaimer stood for something but, unfortunately, it does not.</p> <p>  On the 24-hour accident care, we would all welcome it but one is afraid of one's life of suggesting paying for that or even giving the child a Smyths voucher if he or she has sustained an injury.  Insurance companies will say it amounts to an admission of liability if there is an offer of something.  Nevertheless, many businesses will offer something such as vouchers where something has happened that is not the business's fault, although one can still end up being sued even after offering something like that.  Being able to pay for medical expenses, as is the case in Scandinavia, would be great.</p> <p>  Senator Horkan spoke about similar premiums in the UK.  I am not sure whether he was present earlier when I mentioned that one of our members paid &pound;1,500 in the UK to have his trains insured there.  To have them insured in Ireland, however, he had to pay &euro;33,000 through the same company in the UK, which illustrates the difference.</p> <p>  On FBD, I challenge it to insure us as a group.  I stated we have &euro;5 million in premiums and &euro;1 million in claims and reserves.  I would love, therefore, if FBD was asked why it will not insure us.</p> <p>  Finally, I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy for his kind words.  I will not give up without a fight.</p></speech>

On what the committee should ask the insurers, we would specifically ask whether solvency requirements are driving higher reserves, profits and premiums.</p> <p>  On Senator Paddy Burke's question, it is not only we who stand over what we stated on page 3 in respect of our legal system.  The dogs in the street, the European Commission, the OECD, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have stated the Legal Service Regulatory Authority is a waste time which has not delivered for consumers.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton asked about the notion of having clinics.  Not only would that not make a difference but I have received reports from industry to suggest that a number of GPs will, in exchange for &euro;150, produce a report to allow the patient to approach PIAB.  Unfortunately, therefore, a number of medical professionals are now part of the problem.</p></speech>

I turn to appendix 4 on page 15 of the ISME document, in case there is any doubt about the rates of accident per 1,000.  In 1997, the rate per 1,000 was 6.63 but that has dropped to 2.58.  There is no causality with anything we are doing wrong in health and safety.  There has been massive improvement.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank Ms Murray, who put a human face on the issues.  The committee cannot be accused of kicking the can down the road.  We have prioritised, debated and written a report on the matter.  None of the guests addressed the question I asked about what they did about continually lobbying the Minister or the Government.  If any change to the situation is to occur, it will be through Government action.  We will keep the Government on notice of the action that is required and contained in our report.  I will not single out the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, but the Government is the driver in this regard and it is required to implement the 60 or 70 recommendations we put before it.  If there was action on those recommendations, the witnesses would not be appearing before the committee.</p> <p>  Hauliers, co-operatives and many other industries in business have appeared before us.  I have met all of them, as well as vintners, throughout the country.  Every one of them is complaining.  I reject some of the commentary that was made on the reduction in motor insurance, for example.  I have yet to meet anyone whose premium has been reduced.  Given what is happening and how the Government functions, it is important that businesses engage directly and robustly with the Government.  Mr. Boland stated politicians are too busy but they are never too busy.  They are paid to be busy.  Being busy is one matter but making that business work for the people we represent is another.  It is not working, however, and we need to cut through the fog and deal directly with the people who obstruct the course of the reform that is needed in the insurance business.  That lies at the feet of the Government.</p> <p>  Mr. Boland referred to the Judiciary and lawyers.  As they have been mentioned, they are quite welcome to attend a future committee meeting in the light of the commentary and make any submission they wish to.  They might wish to appear before us to defend their position or comment on what was said.  Until now, the description of a cartel in operation has been used.  People in the insurance world are hard nosed.  The insurance world encompasses the Judiciary, lawyers and much more.  They are taking advantage of the utter shambles that this has become.  As a result, small businesses throughout the country and individuals such as Ms Murray are being penalised and made to pay more and more, but we do not know for what.</p> <p>  Deputy Eugene Murphy asked businesses not to give up.  I assure all our guests that we will not give up.  Our work will be to ensure that can is kicked no further down the road.  I thank the witnesses once again for their attendance.</p></speech>

We are part of and embedded in the community, with 34 branches in cities and towns throughout the country.  Insuring farms and small businesses is our business.  They are critically important to us and represent 85% of our premium.  It is our job to be there when things go wrong.  We have a proud and long tradition, spanning more than 50 years, of paying claims and of being there when things go wrong.</p> <p>  From 2014 to 2016, FBD Insurance was making a loss.  It is in our customers' interest that we have stabilised and returned to making profit.  In order to stand by our customers and pay our claims, we must be stable and profitable.  We stabilised matters by taking a raft of measures, including charging our customers more.  The cost of insurance is too high.  It is affecting our customers' ability to do business and that affects us.  A great deal has happened in the attempt to address the cost of insurance, but not enough has changed.  With the permission of the committee, I will share FBD Insurance's insights into why this is the case and what must be done.</p> <p>  First, I will summarise what is causing the high cost of insurance.  In essence, Ireland has too many claims and those claims are costing too much.  People are too willing to make a claim and advisers are too willing to encourage them.  Compensation payouts are simply too generous and the cost of getting to a payout decision is too high.  To address the root cost of the high cost of insurance, all roads lead to our legal system.  The legal system dictates the level of award.  It sets the market price that determines the level of our awards, both in and out of court, and the system creates a vicious cycle.  High payouts with no downside encourage claimants and high legal fees encourage certain solicitors and barristers to take and make the case.  The legal system is difficult to reform and resistant to change and practitioners have little to gain and, perhaps, much to lose.</p> <p>  I would go further.  FBD Insurance does not recognise our legal system as the root cause of the problem.  We do not have the capability, or at least we have not demonstrated the capability, to fundamentally reform the system.  Litigation is always expensive.  I will share how costs spiral as a consequence of this system.  Take the example of a soft tissue injury from a low impact collision, meaning there was little or no damage to the car.  The occupant has a sore neck.  Bear in mind that soft tissue injuries comprise approximately 80% of our motor claims.  It is the type of injury that some jurisdictions do not recognise or for which they do not pay or pay very little.  Normally, it will take three years and up to five years from the date of the accident until the case is heard.  The Injuries Board will assess the injury 12 to 18 months after the accident based on a medical report that gives a six month forward prognosis but the majority of claimants will continue to report pain right up their day in court, three to five years after the accident.  The judge will make an award for the same injury based on three to five years of reported pain.  Court awards, determined later than the Injuries Board, are higher and costs are significantly higher.  The key insight is that the level of award is based on the length of time the complainant is complaining of the pain as opposed to the amount of pain the complainant feels.  Compensation is more a function of time than of suffering.  There is a major incentive, therefore, to bring a claim to litigation.</p> <p>  FBD Insurance has previously stated what it believes must be prioritised.  Our key recommendations remain outstanding or are work in progress.  We should lower the level of awards.  Why do we pay four to five times more than what the UK is already trying to reduce?  We must recalibrate claimants' expectations.  The proposed judicial council and its proposed redrafting of the book of quantum can be the vehicle, but awards and soft tissue awards in particular must be significantly and consistently lower.</p> <p>  FBD Insurance also believes that we must cap awards, implement what one might call a front stop on the legal system's generosity.  We need a standardised objective approach to assessing whiplash, a measure of pain that is not linked to the time it takes to settle the claim.  There must be a more efficient process up to and in litigation.  The vast majority of soft tissue injuries should be finalised in the Injuries Board.</p> <p>  Insurance companies must be more transparent and publish premium levels.  They must work harder on fraud.  We need help to be allowed to share data.  Finally, we must establish a dedicated insurance fraud investigation unit with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In a nutshell, we must build momentum and drive home meaningful reform of the legal system.</p> <p>  The chief executive officer of FBD Insurance, Ms Fiona Muldoon, has said that Irish society can have either high injury awards or cheap insurance, but not both.  As legislators, the members of the committee have the sole ability to help deliver what is to the greater benefit for most in our society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1000" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1412" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#R00500"><p>That was a robust presentation outlining the company's presence in the market.  It is welcome that we have at least one indigenous motor insurer.  It is, perhaps, a reflection on the Irish insurance market that we only have one surviving indigenous operator and a number of multinationals.  There are probably much fewer participants in the market now than was the case previously.  Much of that goes back to transparency, and representatives of Insurance Ireland have appeared before the committee, in terms of the databases and the data that exist.</p> <p>  From our point of view it is very difficult to see what is happening.  We see many claims being settled.  Mr. McMahon spoke about fighting fraud.  What percentage of claims FBD Insurance receives in all categories, but particularly motor insurance and public liability, are rejected?  How many are fought and lost?  Obviously, many cases are legitimate.  They are what they are and there is fault.  I do not know if Mr. McMahon saw the earlier session with members of the Alliance for Insurance Reform and ISME.  Various people were here.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform represents restaurants, publicans, small businesses and many people.  I am sure Mr. McMahon has engaged with them.</p> <p>  There was a particular focus this morning on play centres, the play centre industry and the broader play centre activity park and the like.  Our guests at the earlier session stated that their industry has paid money to insurers.  It was not FBD Insurance because they stated that most of their business has to refer to the UK because nobody here will insure them.  They have paid in &euro;5 million.  There are reserves of &euro;800,000 against claims and only &euro;200,000 has been paid out in the last five years.  By any measure, it appears to be a profitable industry.  Why will FBD Insurance not consider that, or will it?  There are play centres, activity centres, places for people to go for birthday parties and places for children's activities closing down in many towns.  One lady is in Navan and has the only one left, but she will have to close after 12 years in business.  She has seen her insurance premiums rocket.  Mr. McMahon might have heard a discussion on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" yesterday morning about play centres.  Other people said their insurance premiums have gone from very small amounts to multiples of those.  In one case it went from &euro;6,000 to over &euro;200,000.  Phenomenal increases were mentioned, and I only heard a small part of the interview.</p> <p>  There is an existential crisis here for many industries.  Representatives of marts appeared before the committee, and I am sure Mr. McMahon is very familiar with marts.  It appears that this is the most health and safety conscious country in the world and certainly in the EU.  If one goes to Brussels, Paris or elsewhere, there are holes in the ground and no fencing around them but if people fall into them it is their own fault.  We seem to have put great emphasis on this.  I am aware of a school that had no claims but its insurance bill increased from &euro;27,000 to &euro;34,000 on the basis that it was in a scheme and the scheme had ended.  It was more or less a case of "You were getting it on the cheap for the last few years and we are going to ramp it up at the end of the term that was agreed".</p><p>We have a problem with insurance.  I do not think the industry is doing enough to fight fraud.  I am not referring to our guests in particular and I would like to hear any figures they have on that issue.</p><p> I also have a question about solvency.  Is fraud leading to higher reserves?  Are higher reserves causing higher premiums, profits and payouts?  What would our guests do if they were on in our position?  It is all very well to state that we want lower premiums, etc., but what three things would our guests would do if they were legislators and what requests would they make?</p></speech>

As a company that is insuring businesses in the community, FBD certainly wants to be there for those businesses.  They are important to us and to our own business.  We want to right that premium.  We need to right that business at a profit and we need to be profitable.  While there are many different adjuncts to what is quite a complex issue, it all boils down to the fact too many people are making claims.  I put claims into two brackets with fraud at one side.  There are people who have genuinely suffered loss and that is what we are in the business for, it is why customers pay the premium, we are there for them and that is what our business is about.  We have a long tradition of being there for our customers.</p> <p>  There is another group of claimants who have suffered very little, if any, loss or injury as a reasonable person would understand those terms.  The problem is that group, which is quite significant, can easily make a claim and receive very high compensation payouts at no risk to them while, at the same time, generating significant fees and incomes for the people bringing those claims on their behalf.</p></speech>

He stated that there is a significant number of them, but is it 10% or 45%?  There are payouts to people who have suffered losses and legitimately claimed for them.  There is a percentage amount for fraud, exaggeration and payouts for people who broke a fingernail or whatever, and then there are real claims.  Has Mr. McMahon a breakdown of what he suspects the figures are?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1004" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jackie McMahon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#S00400"><p>Within that breakdown, there are also questions about how severe were the injuries and loss and what is an appropriate compensation for a case of that severity.  We could argue a subjective point here.  Someone could claim they have pain in their neck because they say they have.  He or she tells a doctor about the pain and that doctor states that this person has pain in his or her neck.  The doctor then provides a medical report which states that the person has pain in his or neck and which is presented during a court case.  We value that, in Ireland, starting at approximately &euro;15,000, with an average of &euro;20,000, compared to the UK where the figures are between &pound;300 and &pound;3,000.  It is a question of the magnitude and severity of the injury and the rewards that are granted.</p> <p>  There are tables of rates for different firms that outline the level of compensation a claimant is likely to get for various types of injuries.  Those are well publicised in many different quarters.  They are well out of step with our international benchmarking and the Personal Injuries Commission has proven that.  We are way out of step with international norms.  The problem is that significant costs are generated because awards are higher.  For every &euro;10,000 we pay in litigation, we pay another &euro;4,000 in legal expenses.  It is higher than what they are getting pre-litigation.</p></speech>

We extended sitting times on a Tuesday night and there were only two votes on 79 amendments.  The legislation passed Committee Stage and only Report and Final Stages remain to be completed.

It typically insures businesses that are adjacent to our farm business, namely, small pubs, restaurants and the like.  We are different from our competitors in that we have 34 branches right across the country.  This means that FBD comprises a number of micro-businesses.  We are a part of the business community and are very aware as to the consequences of small businesses not getting insurance.</p> <p>  FBD has grown its small business book so customers like dealing with us.  We welcome anything that will help the small business seek the right level of cover in the marketplace.  That is an important point.</p></speech>

There would not be as many people applying for compensation if whiplash claims were resulting in awards of &euro;1,500 rather than &euro;15,000 or &euro;25,000.  The point has been made that if one tries to rob a bank and one is caught, one will possibly go to jail and have a criminal record.  What happens to a person who is found to be making a fraudulent claim?  What does FBD do with such claims?  Does it send all of the details to the Garda fraud squad?  Are people who make fraudulent claims essentially told that they have been unlucky and asked to come back again the following week?</p></speech>

Some 80% of the count - or the number of claims we get in - are soft tissue injuries.  Balanced against that are some very serious and horrific injuries that, frankly, is what we are in the business for.  These are extremely expensive and the people are in very difficult situations after them.</p></speech>

If a person is in a car accident more often than not there is more than one side to the accident but usually one side is more at fault than the other.  Nobody is disputing proper claims but what if a certain number of people come along and say "My car got a tip and now I have mental trauma, anxiety and my children are not able to sleep"?  We have had months of this before the committee previously when Insurance Ireland was here telling us this.  What can be done with regard to the motor insurance market?  We could blame whiplash but I would prefer if it was to European norms or less.  With technology, telemetry and so on one could have black boxes in cars, dash cams, web access and information about speed limits and performance going into the cloud.  It is all there.  What efforts does the industry make to monitor the premium holder's behaviour in his or her car so if the driver is on the mobile phone or texting he or she will be caught by a camera in the car?  Has the industry explored any of those options?</p></speech>

When one considers all our claims and expenses over premium, with our overall combined ratio in insurance we make a margin of approximately 10%.  We are a business and we feel this is a modest and fair return for the service we give.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned dash cams.  The current legislation around GDPR does not allow us to use some of the data that dash cams actually track, unless we have the explicit authorisation from the other person who has been recorded on the dash cam footage.  Legislation could help us to improve our ability to get the correct data to allow us to proactively challenge or pay out fairly on claims.</p></speech>

Is any technology in place to look at the behaviour of the person who pays the premium to FBD, for example, a camera within the car monitoring the driver's behaviour, seeing if he or she is texting or taking calls, and keeping track of the speed limit?</p></speech>

In Italy they have moved to a situation where telematics are fitted in all cars and the system there does not allow soft tissue injury claims outside of a certain G force collision of the car.  Fundamentally, we in Ireland are just too generous in our court awards.  It is a very subjective decision to say what is the real cost of the pain and suffering when a person says they have pain and suffering, especially around soft tissue injuries.  I shall colour this with one example from some weeks ago.  Two cars had the wing mirrors on both vehicles damaged.  The wing mirrors hit as the cars went by each other.  The claimant lost no time from work but his overall complaints were alleged anxiety, sleep disturbance and palpitations.  Our cardiologist gave him a clean bill of health.  We ran the case on the basis of minimal impact, no complaints made at the scene and that he continued to work normally since and did not seek any medical attention until six weeks afterwards.  We thought his complaints were unreasonable on the basis on the facts of the accident.  The case ran before the courts.  A psychiatrist was called by the plaintiff who supported his evidence and he was awarded &euro;22,500.</p></speech>

The length of time can determine the costs not the severity of the pain. This is the key insight I can bring.  For example, we had a claimant who suffered neck and upper back injuries.  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, awarded &euro;14,700 at 12 months after the accident based on a medical examination that the plaintiff would recover within 16 months of the accident.  The case went to trial and 4.8 years later - the claimant alleging ongoing complaint - the judge awarded him &euro;33,000, and costs were set at &euro;16,700.</p> <p>  Another case of soft tissue injury to neck and shoulder, for example, was awarded &euro;9,900 by PIAB one year and ten months after the accident.  In his report the claimant's own GP expressed the view that she was 100% recovered six months after the accident.  The case went to court and the judge awarded &euro;33,700.  The claimant was alleging ongoing complaints and stated that she did not agree with her own GP's first report.</p> <p>  A case that was not a soft tissue injury was a claimant who suffered scarring to the lower leg and post-traumatic stress after being bitten by a dog.  PIAB made an award one year and 11 months after the accident for &euro;78,600.  The case went to trial in the High Court two years and eight months after the accident and the claimant was awarded &euro;103,000, and legals costs of &euro;41,000.</p> <p>  We can talk about a lot of aspects on the margins and on the periphery of insurance costs, but a key point and the fundamental issue is that the legal system is too generous.  It is too generous by a factor of five timeS, especially on soft tissue injuries, which is where the real problem is.  It is incentivised because a dragged out, long and slow process generates significant legal costs.  At the end of the day the claimant wins because he or she gets a higher award and the lawyers win because they get significant fees.  Businesses, consumers and those who pay insurance lose.  Ultimately society loses.  Everything else helps with the margins but that is the significant issue that needs to be addressed.  We need to use that to change what is fundamentally a very high claims culture in Ireland.</p></speech>

With many claims that are paid, there is little or no evidence that any injuries were caused or sustained on mart premises but the insurance company has settled.  Mart managers are very unhappy about 80% of those settled claims.  Why are the claims being settled?</p></speech>

In that we want to understand whether the customer is on cover and if liability is an issue.  In other words, we consider whether we are at fault within the claim.  If investigations indicate the customer is on cover and there is liability, we would be in a position of trying to value the scale of the injury.  My core point is that those scales are essentially set as a market rate by the courts.  What we are trying to do that is absolutely in our customers' interests and favour is to pay the claim without having to pay the significant cost to bring it through the legal system, which has a two-fold impact.  The first is that when the length of time the injury is suffered is greatest, the compensation may be significantly higher, and we would also incur costs.  It is absolutely in our interests to settle the claim at a fair price.  It is also in the claimant's interest to settle that in a speedy manner.  If it is in that zone, we will try to settle the matter.  If it is not, we will fight it absolutely.</p></speech>

If the mart is not negligent and there is no evidence to back up the claim, why are the claims being paid in the name of the marts?  Is it not then too easy to then pile on whatever amount is claimed to the premium holder?  It seems to be what is happening.</p></speech>

The difficulty is the Senator's or my interpretation of liability, what constitutes an injury and what the courts will ultimately declare as liability and injury could be worlds apart.  To balance that, we have seen some horrific accidents within marts.  We are working hard with mart owners to address this matter but, fundamentally, as patrons are in gantries with animals, there is much potential for them to be caught in gantries.  We have seen many examples where that is the case.  I certainly would like to leave the Senator in no doubt that we will pay where we think it is right at what we believe to be market rate, although the market rate is way too high.  If we are not happy it is right and we have a strong case, we will absolutely fight that case.  I would not like the Senator to have any doubt about that.  I speak for FBD and we will fight the cases.</p></speech>

It is interesting as I can understand and I feel that on many occasions the payouts are just too high; they are too high.  I am absolutely making that clear from the start and it is driving the cost of insurance.  We could tell the customer that we are paying &euro;25,000 on the basis of an injury and he or she might say "no way, that is ridiculous".  We could then ask them about a hypothetical offer of &euro;25,000 plus 40% of that in costs to run it.  Would they accept that?</p><p>Of course not.

Instead, they were underpricing and not making proper provisions.  We then got to a point where the wheels came off the industry's wagon and rates increased.</p><p>We have been asked to put a direct question to the insurance companies.  They are now beginning to show significant profits, yet their rates are not decreasing in any way.  Their reserves and profits are increasing, but their premiums are not decreasing accordingly.  We are being told anecdotally that they are provisioning to put a reserve bank in place.  The insurance companies blame the legal profession and legal costs.  Solicitors and barristers blame the insurance companies.  The only person who appears to be getting a raw deal is the consumer.  We are here as public representatives.  When the legal profession and insurers appear before us, it is a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>and we never seem to get to what is really happening.

Some &euro;50 million, or &euro;43 million after tax, sounds like a great deal of money.  Our investors are taking a risk because we target low double-digit returns on equity.  The &euro;50 million figure equates to a 15% return.  That was a little above what we targeted in 2018.  We need our profits for the providers of capital, who demand and are entitled to a return on their capital.  They are investors in the company.  For the type of risk they are taking, low double-digit returns are not exorbitant.  It is what the markets expect and it is what we are expected to deliver on their behalf.  It is a highly competitive industry and there is no question of FBD making any kind of supernormal profit.  We are making an adequate return, which we need to pay our future claims, remain financially sound and stable, continue investing in the customer, and give stability to our customers through the cycles.  From FBD's perspective, the profits are not exorbitant.</p></speech>

I will be relatively brief.  I refer to the Judiciary's interpretation of the book of quantum.  The fundamental point is that it cannot be too loose.  If there is still a significant degree of discretion I am not sure we will solve anything.  If the judge merely has to have regard to the new guidelines it is a waste of time.  The application has to be much tighter than that.  We will have to watch that very carefully in the course of the legislation, otherwise we will not make the progress we want.</p><p>On the overall financial performance, I take Mr. McMahon's point that insurance companies have to be profitable.  It is a risk-based business.  I was looking at the annual figures.  Profit before tax of &euro;50 million equates to a 15% return on equities.  The gross written premium is &euro;372 million.  Profit before tax is therefore about 13% of the premium.  Is that typical of what the market would expect FBD Insurance to deliver as a public limited company, PLC?  FBD Insurance has investors.  I am not sure what the profile of its shareholders is.  I assume there are significant institutional shareholders among them.  Is that typical of what would be expected?  If that figure was 20%, 30% or more would the witnesses accept it was too high?  I appreciate that it is not at that level now. </p><p><b>Mr. Jackie McMahon:</b>That is what the investors expect.  That is what we target on their behalf.  They invest on that basis.  I can certainly understand the concern but I would just like to say that as an insurance company and a PLC our accounts are open.  They are published and audited.  We are the only insurance company in Ireland whose accounts are available.  The rest are folded into their parents in the UK or elsewhere.  To give some comfort to members of the committee I note that we are in a very competitive market.  People and investors need a return but we also need to grow our business.  It is basic economics.  If the profits increase excessively, sellers will want to sell more as a result.  This drives prices down and profits return to a normal level.  Those are the forces of the market within which we operate.  Competition is sometimes quite brutal but the free market will ensure that we continue to make a normal profit. </p></speech>

Nothing goes in and out apart from that activity.  Very well.</p> <p>  I refer to farm accidents and the tragedy of farm fatalities.  The number of fatalities was 17 last year, down from 24 in 2017.  That is a very large number of people dying on farms, which is an awful tragedy.  There are many more accidents that do not involve fatalities but do involve serious injuries.  What is the overall picture?  What is the trend concerning farm safety and the number of accidents on Irish farms?  Is the trend going in the right direction?  With all the work that the Health and Safety Authority, insurers like FBD Insurance and farm organisations are doing to raise the profile of farm safety, is progress being made?  Those figures are still worrying.</p></speech>

We go to marts and onto farms to talk about farm safety.  We are hugely supportive of any initiative that will help our customer base and reduce fatalities.  For us, one fatality is too many.</p></speech>

The level of cost is beginning to moderate.  It is still slightly high but it is moderating.  I wish to echo the Mr. Cahalan's points about the accidents themselves.  Some of the cases that cross my desk are absolutely horrific.  So much pain, damage and suffering is inflicted on people.  We are working hard with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and with our people on the ground to give the best advice possible.

Linda Murray, who owns a play centre in Navan, spoke passionately about her difficulties.  It is 25 days away from potential closure.  She cannot get a quote for renewal.  It is symptomatic of wider problems, especially in businesses where there is public footfall.  Where does Mr. McMahon apportion ultimate responsibility?  He says that claims are too high and that judges are too generous.  He has been critical of the role of some in the legal profession.  Where does responsibility lie?  Does all of this come back to claims and rewards, and the lack of follow-through for fraudulent claims?  There seem to be no prosecutions or convictions, so there is no deterrent or consequence if a person takes a bogus claim and it does not work out, since he or she can try again with somebody else.  Where does responsibility lie with regard to the insurance industry and payouts, as FBD Insurance sees it?</p></speech>

I appreciate that the legal system as we currently have it is insulated by layers of legislation.  I also appreciate that it is protected to some extent with the separation of powers.  This is not new.  We have tried to address legal costs outside of insurance and injury.  We have a system that has created a culture that is highly litigious and which is very beneficial for claimants and the people who are making those claims.  That needs to be addressed.  The challenge is how to address it given those layers of legislation and the separation of powers.</p></speech>

It is when we get into soft tissue and the smaller end of injuries that the level of payouts that we are giving and what we say is acceptable compensation for that level of pain is too high.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee but I have a fierce interest in it.  I also have a Bill going through the Seanad that passed Second Stage.  There are questions about it but its purpose is to cap awards in the courts.  I have done a fair bit of research.  I think I might have been speaking with Mr. Cahalan regarding this.  The problem is fourfold.  We all pay insurance levies and up to 7% of a premium is a levy.  That is related to Quinn Insurance and all those insurance companies that failed.  Profits are also part of the problem.  People have spoken about excessive profits.  I am not anti-profit but there is a problem when they are excessive.  Fraudulent and over-exaggerated claims are a problem.  Insurance companies are not doing enough to go after fraudulent claims.  We as legislators have to do something with regard to people who bring fraudulent claims that are thrown out in court.  We should pursue them through the courts for making fraudulent claims.</p> <p>  The issue that is key for me is the awards.  I agree that the rewards are excessive.  They are four and a half times more than in the UK and way out of sync with Europe.  The awards are high across the board, especially for soft tissue injuries.  People have mentioned changing the book of quantum, which has been highlighted here.  It is not a matter of changing the book of quantum but changing what the judge's award.  I will not go on too much about it but I will ask Mr. McMahon two questions.  If his company is defending a claim and judge A or judge B is hearing it, and it knows that judge A will make an excessive award while judge B will give a reasonable award, does it settle before it goes into the courts if it knows that judge A will make an excessive award?  If judge B is taking the case, who will make a reasonable award, does the company let it go through the courts?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

There is variability between different awards and relating to decisions on liability.  Ultimately, it is down to a set of facts on both sides and cases on both sides, and how somebody interprets both cases.  There will always be a level of variability.</p></speech>

The issue is more about the awards judges are making.  Did Mr. McMahon ever feel that we should name the judges who are making excessive awards above the norm for similar injuries?  Should they be called out?  If judges make excessive awards, it impacts on all of us who pay for insurance premiums.</p></speech>

It is very easy to kick the industry.  Given what has happened with PMPA and Quinn Insurance, Ireland has not had a great track record with Irish-owned insurance companies.  We need to be mindful of that.  If FBD were not in the insurance market in Ireland, we would be totally at the mercy of the German, British and French insurance companies.  People might like to bash them, but FBD is an Irish-owned company listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which provides many jobs here.  Many of its competitors are totally Internet based and provide few, if any, jobs in Ireland.  It is good to have an Irish-owned company that has a face.  FBD has an extensive operation in my town, Mullingar, including an extensive call centre.  As members will be aware, many call centres are not based in Ireland, the staff are not Irish and it can be frustrating to try to get one's point across.  That has not been overlooked, certainly in the business community.</p> <p>  Is FBD very vulnerable, as the only real Irish entity in the insurance business?  These larger European conglomerates can squeeze the markets.  There was common abuse with the undercutting of prices to try to squeeze competitors out of the market.  Is FBD still vulnerable to that?  Is much of FBD's book being underwritten by some of these larger insurers?  FBD used to do most of its own underwriting but I do not know if that has changed.  Could it be bullied at the will of some of the bigger British, German or French operators?  I am sure the company faces financial constraints on how it positions its cashflow, etc.  How does it stand in an international market in a free open-trading society like Ireland as part of the EU?  How does that affect FBD as an Irish operator?</p></speech>

We are very proud of being Irish and we have been in business for 50 years.  As we do not have a wealthy parent like our competitors, it is very important for us to get our pricing right.  We cannot go to London, Germany or France to ask for a bailout.  Unfortunately, over the past ten or 15 years new entrants have come into the insurance market and driven prices down.  The Senator knows of the companies whose parent organisations had to put large amounts of money back into their reserves.  Most recently, we had the experience of Setanta and Kudos.</p> <p>  As an Irish indigenous insurer, it is important for us to charge a fair price for our product.  We do not have the comfort of a wealthy parent.  Are we being bullied?  We feel that we are very agile.  We need to be more disruptive because we do not have our competitors' budgets.  As we are led by a very capable CEO, we feel that we are very much up for the fight.  We have a unique distribution model with a branch network that our competitors do not have.  We feel our closeness to our customer base gives us a unique advantage which we need to leverage as best we can.  As Mr. McMahon mentioned, the sector is highly competitive.  Maintaining our pricing discipline is critical because we do not have a wealthy parent to come in and bail us out.</p></speech>

I encourage FBD to keep up the good work.  It is easy to criticise insurers, but if we did not have the Irish-owned FBD, we would be in a very precarious position.</p></speech>

However, it seems from the figures we got this morning that &euro;5 million has been collected in premiums in the past five years, about &euro;200,000 had been paid out and about &euro;800,000 has been placed in reserve against potential future claims.  I am sure they are reasonably prudent returns.  Our earlier witnesses seem to think that &euro;4 million out of the &euro;5 million is leaving the State because no company in the State, including FBD, is willing to take that risk.  While I am not telling FBD what to do, I hope that somebody will be able to facilitate these businesses in the provision of family activities.</p><p>I hope that somebody will be able to facilitate these businesses in the provision of family activities.  They may be obliged to close their doors because, at present, no one is facilitating them.  Mr. McMahon made the point that FBD has 34 offices across the country and is involved with marts, farms and everything else.  I am not telling him what to do.  That is not the committee's role.  However, it is something FBD should consider.  I think I am right in saying that there is only one insurer dealing with the public house and restaurant industries at this stage.  I am not saying that this is an area in which FBD wants to get involved, but I would prefer Ireland to be making the money.</p></speech>

Ultimately, there is a great deal that can be done to improve and lower the cost of insurance, which is the overall aim.  However, the fundamental and key issue is the high level of payout and the high cost of getting to that payout.

I will address both in my opening statement but, first, I will provide a brief overview of some developments in Bank of Ireland since our last meeting in July 2018.</p> <p>  Bank of Ireland is focused on the delivery of the multi-year strategy we announced last year.  This strategy sets out the plan we are following from 2018 to 2021.  It seeks to transform our culture, our systems and our business model, as well as improve customer service and grow sustainable profitability.  In 2018 we delivered new lending of &euro;15.9 billion groupwide, an increase of 13% year on year.  Last year was the first year of net new lending growth in ten years.</p> <p>  A core part of our strategy is to strongly support home building and buying.  In 2018 we increased mortgage lending by 17%.  We are funding the construction of 5,500 residential units across approximately 140 sites nationwide.  We are also the largest provider of new business lending into the economy and support two out of every three foreign direct investment projects coming into Ireland.</p> <p>  In addition to lending, since last June, we have taken several steps to improve the service we deliver to our customers.  With more than 250 branches nationwide, we have the largest network of any Irish bank.  In the second half of last year, we expanded cash services at more than 100 of our locations, opened two new branches and increased the number of front-line staff serving customers directly by more than 200.</p> <p>  We are also focused on reducing our non-performing exposures, NPEs.  At 6.3%, we have the lowest level of NPEs of any bank in Ireland but we must do more.  This is why, last week, we announced a transaction involving a potential securitisation of a portfolio of non-performing buy-to-let mortgage loans.  In common with all banks, our regulators have set out the capital requirements we must adhere to in respect of any NPEs that we hold.  This includes holding up to ten times more capital against certain impaired mortgages compared with others which are current with their repayments.  This represents capital that could otherwise be lent into the economy or invested in improving customer service.</p> <p>  Brexit, is of course, a topic that dominates the landscape in Ireland, the UK and across the EU.  It is also top of mind for many of our customers.  Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s economic pulse, our monthly index which tracks consumer and business sentiment, has reported weakening sentiment over the recent 12 months.</p><p>In March, this was down by 1.4 points to 89.4, a reduction of 7.7. compared with a year ago, with Brexit being the key factor.</p><p> At Bank of Ireland we look at Brexit in two ways.  First, how we can support our customers to navigate Brexit.  Second, how we are prepared as a Bank to deal with the outcome whatever that may be.  Within our customer base we see resilient businesses that are adapting to changing circumstances.  Nonetheless, particular challenges do arise for some customers.  These can include managing foreign exchange risk, investing in their working capital or changing their supply chains, operations or logistics.  In response, Bank of Ireland has launched a &euro;2 billion Brexit fund to support businesses across the island of Ireland.  Notwithstanding present issues, many businesses are also identifying opportunities for investment and growth, domestically and internationally, which we are keen to support. </p><p> Regarding our own business, Bank of Ireland was subject to two European Banking Authority, EBA, stress tests in 2018 - a baseline test and an adverse scenario assuming a severe economic downturn.  We performed considerably better than UK peers.  These tests demonstrated our resilience and showed we have enough capital reserves in the event of a severe financial downturn.</p><p> The committee raised in its letter the individual accountability framework for banking.  I mentioned earlier that transforming Bank of Ireland's culture is an important element of our strategy.  We believe that the individual accountability framework will act as an enabler of cultural change, not just in Bank of Ireland but across the sector.  A good corporate culture makes a tangible and positive difference for our customers, colleagues and sustainable financial performance.  Given this significance, we have made the transformation of our culture a core element of our entire transformation programme, and just as important as the transformation of our technology and how we are structured.  Bank of Ireland has, therefore, welcomed the proposals to increase accountability in the sector in Ireland.  We believe this will help to further drive the ongoing cultural change in banking, and we look forward to engaging proactively with the Central Bank on this matter.</p><p> Banking touches all parts of society.  I look at the work under way on culture and an increasing accountability in our sector as core to Bank of Ireland's task of rebuilding trust with our customers and the wider society that we serve.  I thank members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions now. </p></speech>

I ask Ms McDonagh to address non-performing loans, NPLs, first.  Bank of Ireland has reduced its non-performing exposures to the lowest of any of the banks.  It has been claimed that the bank has done so without selling any family homes.  Will she outline where the bank is at now?  Ms McDonagh said that the bank is now close to the 5% ECB target but we heard from the ECB this week that there is no such thing as a hard and fast target.  What securitisations has the bank entered into over recent years?  Were they synthetic securitisations or more like the Project Glenbeigh securitisation where the borrower has a new credit servicer and deals with a new agent in respect of them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Francesca McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#KK00400"><p>I will take two questions NPE performance and where we are right now and the question on the topic of securitisation.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, we have made very good progress in reducing our NPEs as a percentage of our total book.  We have the lowest NPEs of any bank in Ireland currently of &euro;5 billion, which is 6.3% of our total lending book.  That has been going down consistently through working with our customers to find individual solutions.  We speak to our customers and find forbearance solutions that work for them.  When we speak to a customer who has come to us or we have identified as having financial distress, we find that in nine out of ten of those cases we are able to find a solution and those solutions hold.  That has been a positive improvement.  </p> <p>  Our NPE performance and that reduction is over four times better than the industry average.  We have talked about getting close to 5% by the end of 2019.  The Deputy is correct that we do not have a 5% target.  Some other banks in Europe may have but 5% is a psychological line to cross to get to a more normalised level.  The average NPE of European banks is 3% to 4%.  We are focusing on getting to 5% and then to continue.  To date, we have done that exclusively from working with our customers.  We signalled, in the course of 2018, that we are looking at all options on the table and that we are open to all of the resolution strategies that could exist to reduce that further.  That is primarily because the definitions of what is impaired, a default and the capital that is allocated to those non-performing exposures is changing.  There is more and more financial incentive and reason to reduce NPEs because they are becoming more capital intensive.  Capital is finite and comes at an expense.  We can allocate that capital to supporting growth in our lending book and supporting Irish consumers and businesses.  We can use that capital to invest in our systems, improve customer service, meet regulatory requirements and make returns to our shareholders, which include the taxpayer.  We have trade-offs there.  We find that the amount of capital that is allocated to, for example, a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage is ten times the capital needed to allocate to a performing principal dwelling home, PDH, type mortgage.  That just gives the committee an idea of the quantum.  </p> <p>  Let me outline one of the options.  Last week, we articulated or announced our intention for a securitisation of part of our non-performing buy-to-let mortgage book.  This is a transaction that we intend to do for approximately &euro;375 million, which will create a securitisation of the cash flow from those mortgages.  There will be no transfer of legal title nor will there be any intention of a transfer of servicing of those mortgages.  From a customer perspective, we will continue to engage with the customer and collect the mortgage.  Nothing will change from a customer lens. </p></speech>

The risk is, hypothetically, if everybody defaulted, that the SPV would have a call on the bank.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The risk comes off of our balance sheet from an MPE perspective.  That risk and the capital associated with it would not be directly on the Bank of Ireland's balance sheet.</p></speech>

We have spoken about having all options on the table, and the option to sell mortgage books is still possible.  We are not saying that this is the only option we would take.  Until now we have been totally focused on working with our customers.  This is a securitisation, but all other options are on the table.  This particular group of mortgages is particularly relevant and attractive from a securitisation perspective because they are generating cashflows.  These are re-performing mortgages, but there is cashflow in terms of the repayment of principle and interest every month.  The generation of cashflow makes that pool of assets a good candidate from a securitisation perspective.</p></speech>

We have spoken at previous meetings of this committee of our commitment to fixing this problem and treating it as a priority.  We are in the final stages of doing that.

They are former members of staff of Bank of Ireland, and that description covers a large portion of the group they represented.  We are somewhat restricted in what we can say as the group is subject to ongoing analysis and discussion.  We have thoroughly examined the additional cases.  I welcomed the opportunity to sit down and discuss the nuances yesterday.  They put forward a detailed version of their case and referred to the impact this issue has had on many of those individuals.  I have also met many current members of staff to discuss this issue in the course of the past 12 to 18 months.  I have not yet seen anything to indicate that there is an ongoing entitlement to a tracker mortgage.  These customers were never on a tracker and did not take up the option of a tracker mortgage when the product was available.  I do not want to pre-empt the findings of the analysis.  I have undertaken to take this piece back and to take the further information we have been provided with under the course of the review through a further re-visitation and to keep the Central Bank informed.</p></speech>

This issue will not go away.  Deputy Michael McGrath and others in this committee have raised this issue and have gone into great detail in terms of the documentation available to us.  I refer to verbal commitments, emails received from Bank of Ireland confirming that they would roll on to a tracker mortgage rate of ECB plus 0.75%, and the internal communication, of which we have screenshots, which leaves a very clear impression that there was an entitlement there.  I do not want to go into the details because I know that Bank of Ireland has engaged on this issue.  I hope that engagement is meaningful and will continue, but I have a series of questions I would like to put to the bank which are quite specific to this issue.  I propose to put the questions to the bank through the committee, and perhaps it could respond in detail on each question.  I believe that is a helpful approach, rather than going through it now.  Some of the questions are quite detailed, and the bank may need to look at documentation in order to answer the questions.</p></speech>

It looked at the cost to the bank for transactions and set an appropriate fee for those transactions.  We charge 1 cent for contactless transactions, 10 cent for a Visa debit transaction at point of sale that is not contactless, and 60 cent for a teller transaction in-branch.  We believe that the price for the mix of services we provide for those transactions represents very good value.  On average a current account customer pays around &euro;60 for a year's worth of banking.  On top of that there are various concessions, meaning that around 50% of our personal current account base do not pay those transactional charges at all.</p></speech>

If I go upstairs to the canteen and buy a cup of tea it will cost me 60 cent, but if I use my chip and pin it will cost 70 cent because Bank of Ireland is taking 10 cent every time I carry out such a transaction.  If I have &euro;3,000 in my account I will not be charged at all.  The people who are being charged these transaction fees are those who are less cash-rich and the more vulnerable members of society.  They are being gouged every time they buy a newspaper using their debit card.</p></speech>

The Deputy gave an example of a purchase worth 60 cent, but if it was &euro;60, &euro;70 or &euro;80, or even more, the same transaction charge of 10 cent applies.  We like to look at the total cost of banking.

That package is under review.  I cannot give any information on the review because we must make at a full application to the Central Bank for changes to fees and charges.  As the Deputy may be aware, we recently we launched a new financial well-being initiative and are seeking to simplify what we do and our fees and charges.  I believe the service we brought in a few years ago represents very good value for our customers.  We are now standing back and looking at it in the context of what is currently happening and the day-to-day banking needs of our customers.  The fees and charges are under review and we will be looking at something later in the year in that context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#MM00400"><p>It is definitely good value for Bank of Ireland because it made &euro;431 million on the back of fees and charges last year.  That is a huge amount of money.  It is not just about the differentiation in regard to charges between those who are wealthy enough to have &euro;3,000 in their account and those who are not.  If I open an account in Belfast or London, I will not have to pay such charges.  Regardless of my income, lodging and withdrawing cash in branches will be free, as will making debit card payments in pounds, online transactions, phone transactions, in-shop transactions, withdrawing cash in pounds from cash machines or post offices and withdrawing euros from Bank of Ireland cash machines in Ireland.  In Ireland, we are charged 25 cent for each of those transactions.  A bank that was rescued by the Irish people offers free banking services to people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but if one of its Irish customers buys a Mars bar and uses a PIN, he or she is charged 10 cent.  If one withdraws one's cash from a Bank of Ireland ATM one is charged 25 cent.  That adds up to a nice profit of &euro;431 million for the bank, predominantly, I would argue, on the back of low-income customers.  There is a significant inequality.  How can the witnesses stand over the fact that the bank offers these services free of charge to its customers in Manchester and Liverpool, but customers in Dublin or Donegal are being gouged?</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to poorer or more vulnerable customers.  To be clear, students and older customers are not charged.  The charges also reflect the difference in cost between a contactless transaction and a PIN or chip verification.  It is not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison to compare fees and charges, whether for a transaction or a mortgage, in the Republic of Ireland with those in our UK business.  There are different dynamics, positionings and segments and a quite distinct set of charges and infrastructure associated with payments which mean that it is not a like-for-like comparison.</p> <p>  We generate business income.  The Deputy referred to our business income in 2018.  It resulted from a variety of areas, including corporate banking transactions.  We are the only bank in Ireland that provides assurance.  The sources of the income included our growing insurance business and other aspects of the bank's overall income.  The amount referenced by the Deputy does not solely result from fees and charges on accounts.</p></speech>

Obviously, the danger is that variable rates could go down, however unlikely that may be.  The bank has 47,000 customers on variable interest rates.  What is the bank doing to inform those customers of better offers within the bank and, under the new rules in place since 1 January, better offers in other banks?  Are the witnesses willing to reconsider the bank's position in regard to having a stubbornly high variable interest rate of 4.5% for loans with a loan-to-value ration of more than 80%?  That rate has not changed since 2015.  Is it under review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Francesca McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#MM00700"><p>We are focused on a fixed-rate mortgage strategy and have been so for many years.  Some 90% of our new mortgage business is on fixed-rate loans and we have led the market in that regard.  Fixed rate for first-time buyers and movers has grown to nearly two thirds of the market, up from slightly more than half of the market one year ago.  That is a market trend indicating customers voting with their feet and having a strong preference for the security and clarity provided by a fixed-rate mortgage such that they know how much will come out of their salary each month to pay their mortgage.  We keep our fixed rate under review.  We offer a fixed-rate mortgage at 2.9% for one or two year mortgages, which is very competitive.  We have reduced our fixed-rate mortgage rate over time.  Historically, we have reduced it by one third in the past three years.  We offer a competitive proposition.  We write to our customers annually, as required.  In addition, we have written to our customers on higher variable rates and reminded them of the opportunity to switch to a fixed rate.  That is good business because keeping a customer on a variable rate when he or she can get a better deal involves a risk of attrition and losing that relationship or mortgage which, obviously, would be a negative for the bank.  Some 8,000 existing customers moved from a variable to a lower fixed rate in 2018, while approximately 7,500 customers did so in 2017.  I am keen to continue increasing that number as we engage with our customers to encourage them to avail of what we believe to be our best offer in fixed-rate mortgages.  Standard variable rate is not necessarily the area in which we compete; fixed rate has been our strategy for several years.</p></speech>

I will pick up on mortgage pricing where Deputy Doherty left off.  He referred to the variable rate of up to 4.5%.  The bank indicated in response to a question that 47,387 customer mortgage accounts are on a variable rate.  That is 25% of the bank's total mortgage accounts.  Of those 47,000 accounts, how many are on 4.5%?  I presume some are on 4.2% and others on 3.9%.  What is the breakdown in that regard?</p></speech>

I do not have a breakdown of the number of accounts on each of the various standard variable rates of 3.9%, 4.2% and 4.5%, but I will revert to the committee with that information if that is acceptable.</p></speech>

Ms McDonagh provided statistics regarding the number who have moved to a fixed-rate offering.  Can the bank do more to accelerate that?  It is bordering on criminal for a customer to be paying 4.5% today on their mortgage.  It is significantly out of line with the market, given that Bank of Ireland is offering a fixed rate of 2.9%, Ulster Bank offers a rate as low as 2.3% and Finance Ireland, a new non-bank lender, also comes in cheaper than the Bank of Ireland rates.  To have a quarter of the bank's mortgage accounts on a variable rate does not present a pretty picture.</p></speech>

Many customers will choose to split their mortgage.  They may take out a mortgage that is two thirds fixed, because they want that certainty, and one third variable, because they want the flexibility to make additional payments or they are confident that they can pay it off in a shorter term.  That is customer choice.  Choice comes out of competition and competitive markets result in different choice and differentiation in terms of products.  The 4.5% to which the Deputy refers is only in the 80% to 90% loan to value bracket.  Customers below 50% LTV will be on a 3.9% rate.  As I said, we write to customers.  We go beyond the minimum requirement and go the extra mile to let customers know that they can avail of a very attractive fixed rate.  We have marketing campaigns.  We recently reset our brand in the market and we have some very active campaigning about our lowest ever rate of 2.9%.  With the cash-back, which our customers like, we feel we have been very active, transparent and engaged with our customer base.  Someone who walks into any one of our 250 branches will see marketing materials and campaigns.  As a significant part of colleague growth, we have created new roles are in the front line.  We have put over 200 people in the front line and any of them will be able to talk about our mortgage pricing.  We are being proactive, responsive, transparent and competitive in our fixed rate pricing.  That is the area in which we compete and we certainly encourage any customer on a variable rate, whether they are with Bank of Ireland or a competitor, to have a conversation with us about what we think is a very compelling product.</p></speech>

That is if they have been proactive and have responded to the bank's letters and sent in an up-to-date valuation.  I bet thousands of customers have a low loan to value ration but are still on the interest rate for over 80% LTV.  They have never gone about sending in that up-to-date valuation and have never moved down the loan to value band.  It would be very interesting to see a breakdown of the 47,000 customers.  It would tell us some of the story in that respect.  I appreciate that the bank writes to them and sets out what they need to do.  If any message comes out of today's meeting, although I am not sure it is one Ms McDonagh will want to hear, it is that those customers should certainly contact Bank of Ireland to see if they can get a better rate.  If they want to stay on a variable rate, they can submit an up-to-date valuation and avail of a reduction of up to 6.6%, move to a fixed rate and go on 2.9% or else shop around and switch their mortgage elsewhere to get an ever lower rate.  That is what they should be doing.  I would be very interested if Ms McDonagh would drill down into that data.  There are longstanding Bank of Ireland customers whose mortgages are probably less than 50% of the value of their homes and they are paying 4.5%.  It is just crazy.</p></speech>

What we do is exactly what the Deputy has described in terms of being proactive.  We saw 8,000 customers last year and I imagine that trend will only continue.  It has been increasing because of our proactive engagement approach, switching from higher variable rates to lower fixed rates, so we continue to have that engagement.  I would echo the Deputy's sentiment that they should be contacting us if we have not contacted them already to avail of a better market fixed rate offer.</p></speech>

One thing that has surprised me is the number of people who do not know what interest rate they are paying on their mortgage.  It is the first thing people should check because there are tens of thousands of customers across all the banks who are paying too much.  It is an overall message that we all need to continue to convey.</p></speech>

On that point about many Irish consumers not necessarily knowing what interest rate they are on for a mortgage, that would apply to personal lending as well.  Mr. Kelly touched on the issue of financial well-being.  We have launched a major financial well-being initiative.  We have committed &euro;5 million to an investment over multiple years to improve the financial well-being of consumers in Ireland, not just our customers.  We launched it because despite the relatively high levels of education and GDP <i>per capita </i>growth that have come through since the crisis, the level of financial literacy in Ireland is very low, with 45% of people feeling confident about their interest rate.  Our target is to engage with 200,000 customers or non-customers in Ireland to offer them a financial well-being health check.  That will involve questions about meeting their financial commitments each month, so people can see how they rate or rank versus the rest of the population.  That should open a conversation about helping with their financial well-being.  We have also committed to entering every single primary and secondary school in Ireland as part of our youth financial literacy programme, and we are doing some innovation looking at international best in class practices in our financial well-being lab.  It is not just about sending another letter to a customer on SVR about a fixed rate offer; the broader issue is about making people more aware, from their time in education through all stages in their lives.  This is not just for people who are financially not well off; it is for all customers to look at how healthy their finances are.  We have committed a &euro;5 million investment to that so it is something we take incredibly seriously.</p></speech>

On pricing generally, and I have had this debate with Ms McDonagh before, even Bank of Ireland's fixed rate offer is not risk based.  The bank does not do risk based mortgage pricing.  We were always told that the price of the mortgage was commensurate with the risk yet Bank of Ireland has gone with a flat 2.9% across the board, no matter if I have only a 30% loan to value or I have one that is 90% or 95%.  Why is that?  I thought it was a cornerstone of banking that the price of the product was relative to the risk.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that a lot of people do not know what their interest rate is.  Varying it and having a proliferation of different pricing mechanisms can actually cause complexity, which is not necessarily helpful either.  We have gone for more simplicity in our mortgage offering so the 2.9%, which is the lowest rate we offer, is regardless of LTV.  What we see, particularly because of the growth in first-time buyers in Ireland and because the demand for first-time buyer property is so high, is that this is actually very attractive because for first-time buyers whose LTV would typically be a bit higher, that is actually a more attractive proposition.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland is part of this bank culture board which will be reporting in the next ten or 11 days and we will see what it comes up with.  Bank of Ireland has contributed and has helped to pay for that initiative.  What is Bank of Ireland going to do to put the customer's voice at the centre of its operations?  How can it square that circle whereby what is in the best interests of the consumer is often not in the best interests of the bank, certainly in the short term?</p></speech>

We set our values at the end of 2017 and have gone through a very detailed programme of embedding what those behaviours are and what our culture means.  We want to see it as a differentiator for our customers and our employees but also for our shareholders, because a good culture ultimately results in more sustainable results.</p><p>We define customer focus as increasing the volume of the customer's voice and listening more.  There are many examples of us having listened and we have put more colleagues back onto the front line to serve customers.  We have put cash services back into branches and we have put a welcome adviser in each branch, specifically in response to customer feedback.  We also define customer focus as achieving minimum standards and service levels.  We have improved our journeys and contact centre service levels and there has been an extensive programme of process improvement.  There is more to do but we have raised our minimum standard.  Finally, we define customer focus as offering tangibly different customer propositions such as financial well-being, protection and insurance and fixed-rate mortgage offerings.  I do not see it as being either customer-focused or shareholder-focused as we see a good, engaged satisfied customer as good for business.  Being customer-focused does not mean we will always have the cheapest lending in the market.  We look at an overall proposition and its sustainability and we believe we are offering very good value in our mortgages and personal lending offers, as well as in the broader relationship.  We have more to do to improve customer satisfaction and focus but we have made tangible improvements in front-line branch and contact centre service levels since the last time I appeared before this committee.</p></speech>

Is Ms McDonagh saying the bank is not working to a particular target for this or was it given a target?  Does she expect any further initiatives, apart from working through each individual loan?  Does she expect more securitisations or actual portfolio sales to reduce the figure further?</p></speech>

It is a number which we want to be close to by the end of 2019 but it does not mean we will stop once it has been achieved.  We will continue to try to improve our overall portfolio but it is in order to be capital efficient, rather than just to hit a certain number.  A capital density is associated with NPEs and if we have fewer NPEs it will release more capital to lend, to invest, to meet regulatory requirements or to return to the shareholder.  Beyond securitisation, we are looking at all options to continue to reduce our NPE.</p></speech>

We know that AIB has lost a CEO and a chief financial officer.  What is the labour market like for Bank of Ireland?  Is it dealing with similar retention issues?  Has the entrance into Ireland in a significant way of Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Bank, in the context of Brexit, changed the landscape as regards the competition for talent?

We have over 10,000 employees and there is no opportunity to differentiate financially between a fantastic colleague who goes the extra mile for a customer and a person who does not meet the standard.  There are other ways to differentiate and we do that by recognising, promoting and developing staff but there is no way to vary pay under the current restrictions.  If there is a variable payment there would be a large tax associated with it.  In the Minister's letter there is also a restriction on a total payment of &euro;500,000 for any individual.  When I refer to normalisation of pay, I am thinking of being more aligned with other banks in Ireland.  At the moment the restrictions only apply to Irish banks, including Bank of Ireland, but other banks and financial services companies, along with all other private industry companies, are not restricted in the same way.  We know the historical reasons for this, of which I am mindful, but we are encouraging normalisation at this moment in time.  This is not just about a couple of senior people at the top of the organisation - variable pay can help drive accountability and reward the right behaviours and performance that are customer-focused at all levels of the organisation, including those who work in a branch.  Second, it is very difficult to compete for highly specialised roles and such people can be offered much larger packages by non-Irish banks in Ireland.  We are increasingly competing with "Silicon Docks" for people with very strong IT or transformation skills.  Third, it is making Irish banks unable to compete on a level footing with other banks and other sectors in Ireland.  This is a political matter and a matter for the Government.  We were asked for input into the third-party review and we shared that perspective with it.  We also gave detailed information of where we are seeing salaries and variable pay packages being offered which provide benefits that we are simply not able to provide.  As a result of Brexit, we are seeing it increase quite significantly and it can represent a risk to Irish banks in their ability to retain and develop our talent.</p></speech>

It is taking us longer to recruit and that leaves vacancies open for longer, which can challenge our ability to serve our customers and execute against our strategy.  To embed the culture and values we want, I would really like to be able to vary people's pay based on their performance and on how they drive customer outcomes and give value.  At the moment we incorporate such things into their appraisal and we give an employee a rating every year to differentiate what they do and how they did it, but we cannot vary their reward to reflect that.  As we transform the bank, improve service and embed our culture, normalised pay within European Banking Authority guidelines would enable a better outcome, both for the culture of the bank and for customers.  I know that the issue is divisive and I appreciate that there may be a challenge to that position but it is my view on the normalisation of pay in Ireland.</p></speech>

What is the position of Bank of Ireland on the Bill?  The bank has commented on it publicly but I ask Ms McDonagh to share its views with the committee.

The Bill conflicts directly with the guidelines the European Central Bank has put in place to encourage banks to reduce their NPEs to get towards European norms.  The capital allocated to non-performing exposures is much higher than to performing ones.  I said at the beginning that, for example, we require ten times more capital to be associated with a loan in respect of a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage than for a performing private dwelling house, PDH, or owner-occupied mortgage.  Having inflated NPEs and fewer options to reduce them would result in trapping capital associated with those NPEs.  It is essentially landlocking capital that we need to increase lending into the Irish economy to Irish consumers and businesses, to invest in our systems to improve services, to meet regulatory capital requirements or to provide a return to shareholders, including the Irish taxpayer.  That is the only way we can allocate capital.  I argue as a banker that competition, while it can represent challenges, is ultimately good for the consumer and the sector, whereas the Bill would disincentivise competition in banking.  It would make mortgage lending less attractive and less profitable to new entrants, which would reduce the competition many politicians and stakeholders would like to see within the Irish banking market.  If the ultimate objective is to increase consumer protection, the Bill will not achieve it.  That is not just my perspective.  The committee has heard from the BPFI representing the sector but also from the Central Bank, whose representatives were here.  I do not need to quote what they said on the record but the same CPC protections exist independently of who owns the asset.  The Bill would increase costs for consumers while affording them no additional protection.  In fact, it would reduce the availability of capital in the market.  For those reasons, it does not make sense and would be bad for the Irish consumer, the sector and the economy.</p></speech>

On the desirability of people in Ireland being able to buy homes, in particular younger people on moderate wages, the witnesses are probably aware that the Government has a scheme to give couples with an income of &euro;75,000 or single people with incomes of &euro;50,000 access to State-sponsored funds.  One of the conditions of that funding is that the applicants should have gone to a financial provider on a couple of occasions and been refused loans.  I acknowledge that the bank cannot be absolutely accurate on the following question, because people explore options, go away and come back over a lengthy period.  However, how many people does the Bank of Ireland turn down and can it share with us the reason for doing so?  I take on board what Ms McDonagh said about wanting to be able to lend into the housing market.  As one of the biggest banks in Ireland, how many people inquire about entering a mortgage and what proportion of applicants are turned down?  While in some cases the bank might simply say that a person does not qualify and should come back when he or she has done this, that and the other, can Ms McDonagh share that information with us?</p></speech>

Part of our strategy is to be the leading supporter of home building and home buying in Ireland.  We increased our new mortgage lending during 2018 by 17%, which is &euro;2.3 billion, by engaging constructively with customers to help them get the homes they want.  We do not do that if it does not make sense or is not sustainable for them from a personal debt perspective.  I will ask Mr. O'Beirne to talk a bit more about the help-to-buy scheme.</p></speech>

I will then talk about the help-to-buy scheme, to which I think the Deputy is referring.  On the affordability side, the key for us, as we have seen over the course of mortgage lending in Ireland, is to ensure we provide an affordable and sustainable mortgage.  When people come in, we work through what position they are in.  We work through what income they have, what is sustainable, what expenses do they have and what does that lead to in terms of an affordable mortgage.  Of those who proceed to a full application, we approve nine out of ten mortgage applicants.</p></speech>

There is an element before that where it is a more discursive engagement with people.  Sometimes, we find that people want to buy a home but may not have saved a deposit.  They may need to manage either their incomes or outgoings in a slightly different way.  We call that a "getting mortgage ready" process.  We have other elements outside mortgages to help with that.  We have a mortgage saver product so that as people save towards that deposit, we pay a good rate of interest and a bonus to narrow that journey.  When I look through all the customer research we have, the two things that come back from all customers consistently are whether they will be able to get a mortgage and whether they will be able to manage those mortgage repayments as they come through.</p> <p>  The help-to-buy scheme was launched in October 2016 and it has had a very positive impact on the market.  When one looks at the mix of housing coming through, the number of first-time buyers as a proportion of the mortgage market is starting to increase dramatically and is now just over 50%.  Within that, the proportion of new homes for the help-to-buy scheme, which plays a very viable part, has also started to expand.  It is due for completion later this year and Bank of Ireland would certainly welcome any extension of it.  It is helpful for borrowers to meet that deposit requirement by way of a tax rebate.</p></speech>

A lot of people ask me about the scheme and I try to give them some advice.  One of the urban myths is that if one takes out a PCP, one can forget about being treated favourably, perhaps by Bank of Ireland but pretty much by any other bank.  Someone in their late 20s or their 30s might have a very large car loan or a more modest credit union loan.  A significant car loan of &euro;30,000 does not rate that high and if credit union debts go over &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000-----</p></speech>

They are good for fiction but in practice, we ask about customers' ability to repay all of their debts, including their mortgages.  When we look at things like PCPs, car loans or credit union loans, we look at whether repayments on those debts relative to income are sustainable.  We also need to understand why such loans were taken out.  Certainly they are a factor in the decision but it is not a binary question of customers having borrowed X amount and therefore not being eligible for a mortgage.  We look at these things and try to work with customers, depending on their circumstances.  It is an overused phrase, but we look at these things on a case-by-case basis.  If a customer has debt elsewhere, that is absolutely fine.  People take out loans for many reasons and they use credit unions for many reasons.  We also provide personal loans for a variety of issues and we look at loans in terms of what they mean for customers' ability to repay a mortgage.  Once we are comfortable in terms of their net disposable income, we will look to the macro-prudential lending rules on the loan-to-income ratio.  In principle, there is absolutely no issue with that.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of advertising and competition in the lending market right now.  One of the areas of intense competition is in car finance where there may be very attractive options available.  However, it would be difficult for a couple on a relatively modest income of &euro;75,000 with a car loan of &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 to get a first-time mortgage.</p></speech>

The decision is unique to the specific circumstances.  If a couple with that income profile has a substantial personal loan that is taking a large amount of their net disposable income to the extent that we cannot see a sustainable way for them to be able to repay a mortgage, that would be a factor in our decision.  It depends on income levels and debt amounts.  It is all taken into account but it is critical for us and for the borrower that any new debts being taken on are sustainable in the context of overall financial well-being.</p></speech>

This is an issue that the banks could address collectively.  People in their late 20s who cannot currently afford a mortgage may think that it is okay to take out a car loan but in fact the consequences of that may be that their debt level relative to their income is higher than it should be.  In terms of financial education, people should perhaps opt for a second-hand car and a smaller loan if they are planning to apply for a mortgage at some point in the near future.</p> <p>  I am interested in the refusal rate because my impression is that it is much higher than 10%.  I am not talking specifically about the Bank of Ireland but banks in general.  Bank of Ireland has been involved in the development of the Irish Banking Culture Board.  In terms of people who are interested in getting a loan from Bank of Ireland or from the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme, much more customer information needs to be provided.  People should be given a pathway.  The bank may well have data which show that arranging a loan when one is on a fairly tight income takes between a year and 18 months and that people must plan for it, above and beyond getting a deposit together.  In terms of consumer education, I do not believe that people understand this clearly.  </p></speech>

Mr. Kelly will expand a little on addressing those specific issues, some of which are individual.  We would encourage customers to join one of our financial well-being clinics or to speak one-to-one with our advisers.</p></speech>

We did some research on financial well-being using some international benchmarks.  When people undergo a financial health check and look at their financial circumstances, they come out with a score.  The score puts them into a category.  The categories are struggling, stretched, managing or thriving.  Our research shows that about 40% of the population are in the struggling category.  These are people who struggle day to day, or from pay cheque to pay cheque, to manage their finances.  They do not think about things like savings, the impact of loans on their ability to borrow or planning for the future.  When one moves up the categories into stretched, people have a bit more breathing space.  They are thinking about saving but crucially, are not doing it.  People in the managing category have surplus income on a monthly basis, understand that they need to save, start putting some money away but do not necessarily plan for the future.  We know from other research that only 50% of the Irish population has a pension plan, for example.  People in the thriving category are planning for their future.  They are thinking about their long-term future, rainy day savings and so on.</p> <p>  What we are trying to do is build awareness.  We see this in other aspects of life, where people look at their physical well-being for example.  We believe that financial well-being is a crucial part of one's overall well-being.  What we are trying to do is build awareness.  We launched our health check service and within two weeks, 20,000 people had undergone the check.  People can attend one of our seminars or come into the bank for a needs review with an adviser.  They do not have to be a customer of Bank of Ireland to do this.  They can go online, check it out and get a sense of where they stand.  That is what is really important.  The points the Deputy made about younger people saving for a mortgage and proving their repayment capacity are crucial.  </p> <p>  Another issue that is very interesting and about which there is a lot of debate is the rental market and the cost of rent versus a mortgage.  This raises issues like the amount of disposable income going on rent that could be going into savings.  This is about helping customers to plan and save as they go forward.  In the past few years I have noticed that our clients and customers have become much more serious and resilient in this regard.  They are more aware of the issues and are planning and saving.  The days of going off at the weekend and buying a house are long gone.  People are now really planning out their future and are being very serious about that planning.  There is also an increased awareness among many of our younger customers that it is not a good idea to take on too much debt.  They consider the impact of car loans and other debts.  It is important for people to look at their finances in the round and to plan ahead, whether those plans involve buying a house, going on a holiday or securing their long-term future.  There are tools and services available that can help customers to plan ahead.  This is a really important part of what we are trying to do as an organisation.</p></speech>

Rents are extremely high and these funds are pitching heavily into the buy-to-rent market.  Does the bank have any concerns that the entry of these funds into the buy-to-rent market will significantly reduce the supply of properties for purchase by way of a traditional mortgage?  People who would traditionally have obtained a mortgage are now being outbid by these funds, some of which have very significant resources.  Rent levels, particularly in the greater Dublin area, are very high by international standards.</p><p>What is the bank's take on that from a social as well as an economic perspective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.1292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gavin Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040400002#RR00200"><p>I welcome that some of these landlords, which are buying up some of the schemes, are coming into the market.  We have funded a fund coming in to build a 300 unit apartment block in Dublin.  We must have a thriving, long-term rental sector.  Many of these landlords bring that certainty to tenants and bring a particular quality of management to these blocks.  For us, overall supply is the key.  Supply, and the lack of it, is what is really putting pressure on rent.  We need to get more property built, we need it built for renting and for purchase.  As a bank, we would like everyone to buy a house with a mortgage because that provides us with an opportunity.  However, as we touched on earlier, if someone bought an apartment today in Dublin for &euro;350,000, they could be renting it for over &euro;2,000 monthly.  The mortgage on that same apartment would be about &euro;1,100 or &euro;1,200.  There are costs which are picked up by the landlord, maintenance, etc., but there is around &euro;800 difference which is &euro;800 that could be used to save for a mortgage from us.</p> <p>  For us, the mix is what is important.  Ms McDonagh touched on it earlier.  We are funding the development of 5,500 units during 2018 and that has increased further in the last couple of months.  When we were last before the committee that figure was 3,000.  We are seeing much more development in building.  We need a mix.  Some of those developments will be for buy-to-rent in the market where funds are coming in, other developments will be for purchases for mortgage customers and people to buy a house.  Ultimately, we need to see rents easing off and coming down so that customers can choose to live rental.  We see it in many European cities and we will have to see it coming into Ireland, especially Dublin, with longer-term renters coming in.  In order to do that there must be the right quality there from a landlord's perspective.  There is room in the market for both of these stakeholders.  Ultimately, that must push up those developments and numbers.  Last year, 18,000 units were built in Ireland, which is welcome.  We reckon that will be 22,000 or 23,000 this year and the number will continue to grow over the next two or three years.  We need to see this continue to grow and see those numbers going up because all these pressures are driven by the issue around supply and we must ensure that we manage that in the right way over the next few years.</p></speech>

There are exceptions for customers in different circumstances who could probably afford to go a bit higher but that feels right and hits the right price point.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is lower outside of Dublin.  To earn the sort of income where that is one third of take home pay would suggest that is unaffordable for the average teacher, nurse or many young people who have got their first job.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the larger funds or institutions buying property were pushing out regular individual private home buyers from the market.  There were 57,000 homes purchased in 2018.  We often refer to the number of new build homes, which was 18,000, but in terms of the homes which were purchased, the secondary market was 57,000.  We estimate that around 15% were from the larger big investors to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  On supply and demand, we are seeing the supply come through, even though it is not keeping up with the demand.  The demand for new homes in Ireland is around 35,000 to 40,000 per annum.  The supply has increased from 15,000 in 2017, as Mr. Kelly noted, to 18,000 last year and the market consensus is that this year will be about 23,000 and 27,000 in 2020.  That increased supply has meant that price increases have reduced or softened slightly.  At the beginning of 2018 there was double-digit price increases in the residential property market.  That increase is still positive but is beginning to fall as supply comes on stream.  The macroprudential rules are also having their intended effect of slowing down demand.  The outlook for price this year is an increase of about 4% to 5%.  That has been more subdued than it was previously as supply increases.</p></speech>

Several staff in Bank of Ireland, in my own area and nationally, have approached me over an outstanding difficulty they have with the bank on the settlement of mortgage issues and mortgage price issues.  These are people who took out two-year fixed-rate products in 2005, 2006 and 2007, just before the crash.  I understand that several thousand people are in this category.  I understand that 1,800 cases have been sorted but about 200 cases are outstanding.  As with many cases which arise from the crash, many of these are very difficult for the individuals and families involved.  Does the bank propose to address this?  The 200 people who have not received a settlement do not understand why they have been excluded.  Does the bank propose to review their cases so that they might avail of settlements similar to those of their colleagues?  The delegation spoke of the difficulty of staff retention.  I know the Bank of Ireland fairly well and think that many of its staff are excellent.  It is a long-running sore point that some staff have been included in the settlement while others were not.  What is the explanation?</p></speech>

We are committed to fixing this issue.  As the Deputy noted, of the total number of customers who have been included in redress and compensation, some 1,800 were existing or former employees.  There is a group over which there is a difference of opinion and I will ask Mr. O'Beirne to expand on that.</p></speech>

I met a set of the representatives of the group to which the Deputy referred earlier this week.  I have also met many of the parties individually over the past 12 to 18 months or so.  We are restricted in what we can say here because we are still part of an ongoing analysis and discussion.  However, I went through in depth with the representatives the reasons there is a difference in inclusion or exclusion.</p><p>While we have not seen anything yet that indicates an entitlement to a tracker mortgage, I understand the impact that this has had on people and the way they are framing it right down to the human level in terms of what it means to have seen some colleagues returned to tracker mortgages when they have not been.  We sought to be as expansive as possible.  It is a group of staff who were never on trackers and did not take up the offer of a tracker when it was given, but I do not want to pre-empt anything.  I have given them an undertaking to re-examine the specifics of the issue in light of some of the additional points that they have brought to bear.  I have also given an undertaking to discuss the matter with the Central Bank.</p></speech>

In our earlier discussion on culture, the word "bonus" was not mentioned, but we are aware that a great deal of pressure has been put on the Government to jettison the caps on payments to senior executives.  We understand the arguments that our guests have made about the difficulty in recruiting staff.  In light of Mr. O'Beirne's comments just now, though, one has to smile at that.  The people who are in a middle or lower position in the bank are in a dilemma.  They are not receiving &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 in annual remuneration and, like many others, are still struggling in the aftermath of the crash.</p></speech>

Anyone who rolled in that period would have been offered a tracker.  After trackers were withdrawn - this is effectively at the centre of the tracker piece - the product was no longer available and there was no contractual element.  Typically, customers would have drawn down on a standard variable rate.  Since they never had a tracker, it was difficult to return them to it.  Having met the group and spoken to people individually, however, I understand their view and expectation that there was no difference for them in terms of what they felt they would be returned to.</p></speech>

They are doing what they were intended to do, which is to moderate demand for higher loan-to-value or loan-to-income borrowing, particularly in the Dublin area.  We comply with those regulations.  Perhaps Mr. O'Beirne would like to add to my comments.</p></speech>

They have helped to put a brake on property price inflation.  We certainly seek at all times to ensure that we comply with them.  In many cases they overlap with the bank's own credit and lending policies.  The rules set out that one can only borrow up to three and a half times one's income and 80% of the value of a loan, with a slightly higher allowance for first-time buyers because such borrowers tend to be younger and may have more earning potential over the rest of their careers.  As we come through this year with no changes to the macroprudential rules, we hope to be in a position to maintain the ability to provide that allowance to individuals, where required, throughout the year.</p></speech>

Nobody can predict the future totally.  People can lose jobs and companies can go wallop and so on.  Is what happened more than ten years ago now much less likely to happen based on what people are allowed to borrow relative to their circumstances?</p></speech>

With regard to the bank's approach, many lessons were learned from the crash.  We have tightened our credit policies.  In the Senator's words, we have introduced a lot more stress testing in respect of the durability and sustainability of people's income.  We think ahead with regard to where interest rates might go.  That is one of the reasons why we have been very forthright about seeking to brink more fixed-rate mortgages into play as they provide a bit more certainty in terms of repayment.  At a macro level, Irish banks retain a legacy in terms of the level of capital that must be set aside for mortgage lending.  It is much higher in an Irish context than elsewhere.  Other factors have also come in, such as the macroprudential lending rules.  Over the next ten years, as we get to 2027 or 2028, nearly all of the mortgage lending in the Irish market will be carried out under the macroprudential rules which were introduced a couple of years ago.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of uncertainty as a result of the Brexit situation.  Our focus in this time has been to be there for our customers when they are uncertain but also to be ready, as an organisation and institution, to be resilient in respect of whatever outcome to Brexit comes to pass.  It is not just about macroprudential rules and one specific proof point.  More broadly, it should provide reassurance that our capital resilience and liquidity resilience will be regularly stress-tested from a regulatory perspective.  The EBA conducted stress tests in 2018.  One was a baseline and one was based on the scenario of a very severe macroeconomic situation arising from a severe downturn.  In those stress tests, we demonstrated that we had enough capital reserves to deal with a financial shock.  We actually fared better than some of our UK peers.  That stress-testing has give some reassurance on the broader question of the resilience of Irish banking, whether in respect of lending to mortgage customers or responding to a broader macroeconomic situation.</p></speech>

We certainly do not want to see what happened before happen again.  In her opening statement Ms McDonagh talked about Brexit.  The bank has an economic pulse which comes out every month and has a team of economists within its network looking at Ireland.  It has the largest branch network.  It is all over the country and picks up signals from every part of Ireland, which is no different from how political parties operate.  The bank sees customers.  It sees people under pressure in, I presume, the areas about which we all worry in terms of Brexit - agrifood, tourism and so on.  What are Ms McDonagh's thoughts on where Brexit is heading?  I do not want her to predict what will happen at Westminster, rather I am asking which areas are more vulnerable.  We all have our own opinions on that but what is the bank's perspective?</p></speech>

With regard to our customers, we think about Brexit in two ways.  We need to make sure we are resilient and ready as an institution, but the majority of our energy and day-to-day activity relates to supporting our customers.  We do a monthly economic pulse.  The March results showed that both consumer and business confidence were at a low ebb.  Consumer confidence was at the lowest level we have seen since we started measuring it in the pulse four years ago.  We have seen some rebound in respect of business confidence, but businesses, particularly SMEs, are very concerned by the uncertainty which Brexit represents.  That is manifesting itself in many ways.  Many SMEs are not necessarily cancelling, but deferring investment decisions.  They are not buying extra capacity for their warehouses, employing more people, or replacing machinery because they want to see what Brexit will mean for them.  It depends on the sector and the part of the supply chain in which the business operates.  The sectors most exposed to Brexit, which the Senator mentioned, are those that are highly dependent of imports or exports and which are affected by volatility or lower margins.  Where they are lower down in the supply chain, their ability to respond to that threat is quite limited.</p><p>We are speaking to our customers.  We held over 250 events across the island of Ireland in 2018.  We have a team of sector specialists focused on agrifood, health care, hospitality and those manufacturing firms which may be more exposed because they are located closer to the Border, either in the Republic or in Northern Ireland.</p><p> We have also launched a &euro;2 billion Brexit fund.  This is putting our money where our mouth is in terms of supporting customers at times when developing a contingency plan may require money.  This should enable them to take on sustainable borrowing to support them during uncertain times.  There will also be opportunities.  Brexit may represent opportunities to develop into new and continental markets, moving away from the UK, or in acquiring manufacturing or production capacity in the UK as a hedge.</p><p> We have a &euro;50 million unsecured foreign exchange fund for small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, customers who are exposed to foreign currency exchange to help them reduce that volatility which can eat into their margins.  We continue to have point-in-time commentary.  The Bank of Ireland website has regular videos and information guides for those exporting and importing about what to do.  Being there for our customers, not just in the public sense but for one-to-one conversations, is a priority.  We have the leading market share of SMEs and we are the largest lender to corporate Ireland.  Having our relationship managers and our people in the front line speaking to customers during this uncertain time is a key priority.</p></speech>

Brexit changes every hour.  As I have been in this committee room since 9.30 a.m., I do not know what has happened today and it could have entirely changed by the time I finally get to see daylight.  It is becoming more uncertain by the day, if not the hour.  Are the figures for lending in the first quarter in 2019 a little lower or softer than last year?</p></speech>

Last year was the first year we had a net lending book growth which is positive.  The total strategy from now until 2021 is that two thirds of that growth will come from our Irish business and a third from our UK and international business.  What we are seeing at the moment, however, is more 50-50.  Half the growth we are experiencing comes from our UK and international businesses while the other half comes from retail Ireland such as SMEs, mortgages and consumer lending.</p> <p>  We believe that when there is more clarity on Brexit, whether it is good or bad, there will be more certainty, particularly for Irish SMEs, to activate deferred business decisions.  It does not necessarily impact on mortgage lending.  However, it impacts on consumer confidence.  The supply and demand dynamics are much more prevalent in Irish mortgage growth.  For SMEs, we would see that there is some overhang from the crisis.  They are generally cash generative, meaning they can invest some of their cash reserves.  There has been a reticence among SMEs to take on new borrowing until they have clarity in respect of Brexit.  When clarity, hopefully, does come, that will provide some more direction for SMEs in terms of whether they broaden their manufacturing in Northern Ireland or partner with a supplier in continental Europe.  Some of these decisions are waiting due to Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>  We remain committed to our 20% loan book growth strategy.  It depends on external factors and it is predicated on some type of deal being done on Brexit with a reasonable transition period.</p></speech>

Although the Central Bank has not given Bank of Ireland a target, 5% is a level which the organisation would like to reach.  Once it achieves that, is it willing to tolerate that level or would it like to reduce it further to, say, 1%?  Will it keep disposing of these types of loans or restructuring them?  Ms McDonagh has outlined the reasons the bank does not want NPEs.  Obviously there is a challenge for those affected by this.  Is it her aim to get to 5% or to 1%?  The 6.3% NPE level means the bank&rsquo;s loan book has tied-up capital.  Equally, this involves vulnerable customers who went into a loan with the full expectation that the outcomes would be different than how they ended up.  What is the game plan for the 6.3% level?</p></speech>

We stated that we would seek to get closer to 5% by the end of 2019.  We will look to continue reducing this.</p> <p>  Across Europe, banks on average have a 3% to 3.4 % NPE level.  That would be considered normal but it can vary.  Regulators obviously would encourage banks to minimise as much as possible their NPEs during a benign period of a credit cycle, meaning that as one goes through a cyclical change, one is starting from a lower base.  After reaching 5%, I do not have a hard number that we will pursue.  It goes back to optimisation of our capital.  We will work with customers.  In cases where customers are willing to work with us on a forbearance solution, we will find a solution in nine out of ten cases.  In turn, in nine out of ten of those cases, the forbearance solutions will hold.  That has always been our preferred option.</p> <p>  We will certainly explore other ways to be more optimal in terms of how we manage our capital in that this would be capital which we can lend to more of our customers and improve service.  There is a clear incentive in terms of the intensity of capital attached to those NPEs increasing.  A definition of what is a NPE is also evolving.</p></speech>

We have had several meetings with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the Central Bank and the Irish Banking Culture Board.  In my time on this committee, four of the five banks have changed chief executives.  The cultures are evolving.  Some might say they are doing so slowly, while others would say too quickly.  Clearly, there is a journey for all of the banks to make their cultures more customer-focused.  Bank of Ireland may have had less of a journey than some of the others.  Can Ms McDonagh describe Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s journey?</p></speech>

We have three priorities, one of which is transformation.  People often think transformation means IT because it does in business generally.  It also means culture, however.  We are off to an improved start.  I know that because we ask our people and look at other outcomes related to culture.  We are on the foothills.  While journey is a slightly overused term, there is much further to go than we have come so far.</p> <p>  We articulated our purpose and our four key values.  At the end of 2017, we embarked on significant communications activity to increase awareness and understanding of what those purposes and values are among all of our employees.  Over 6,000 colleagues have attended 50 roadshows across the country.  These were led by managers and leaders who talked about culture and what it means to be customer-focused or accountable.</p><p> We have made changes in our customer focus perspective in terms of how we resource our front line.  We have made improvements in some of our processes, and there is more to do.  We are investing in our technology to be more customer focused in that role.  We have also increased two-way communication so it is not just top down but bottom up and across, with informal communication through split level meetings, greater use of technology and just general openness.  We have improved recognition of our people.  When they exhibit the values that we feel proud of as Bank of Ireland and that a customer would be delighted by, we recognise, encourage and celebrate that.  We are investing in developing the skills of our people whether they are leaders or people managers.  We are embarking on people manager training and investing to help them understand their values and actions.  There is a huge amount of activity.</p><p> I chair a group customer board, on which Mr. Gavin Kelly and Mr. Tony McMahon join me, that looks at specific metrics and how this manifests in how the customer feels.  Do they feel that the effort of dealing with Bank of Ireland is improving and would they recommend the brand?  There are the net promoter scores and we look at verbatims.  I have a live feed of verbatims from customers, good and bad, about how they feel.  We are very responsive and take them very seriously.  We contact many of those customers.  We have a meeting tomorrow and we will call customers who have given us some feedback to understand it better.  We spend a great deal of time on the front line.  I will spend the majority of next week just with front-line colleagues on our customers and clients.</p><p> Is the huge amount of activity working?  We survey our people regularly.  We have seen a significant improvement in staff engagement and cultural embedding since we started to measure this approximately 18 months ago.  It is still not where we want it to be.  There are areas of great progress around understanding of purpose, values and belief.  The behaviours that are expected of people are well understood.  Our colleagues' understanding of their risk responsibilities is very high.  There is also recognition that there are opportunities to improve our technology and processes, and we are working on those.  However, there has been a tangible improvement in what our people are saying about our culture over the past 18 months.  That is great, but I want the customers to feel that through improved customer service.  We are seeing that but the challenge for ourselves in our ambition is that there is more to do.</p></speech>

The individuals who are going to be named and held responsible for various parts of the bank will have staff under them who are either doing the right things or the wrong things and being measured for doing the right things, although historically they were measured and rewarded for doing the wrong things in terms of lending money they should not have been lending.  That was before Ms McDonagh's time, but every bank was guilty of lending out more than it should to people who should never have been given those loans.  How will she implement that or can she describe that process?</p></speech>

We want to engage proactively with our regulator to see how that will be implemented in Ireland.  It does not stop us from increasing accountability.  Accountability is one our core key values so we are doing things in advance of that framework being established by the regulator.  Many of the team have worked or work in the UK, and before I joined Bank of Ireland I was part of the senior manager regime when it was established in 2016 in the UK.  What that meant was that senior leaders would have a very clear statement of responsibilities and what they were accountable for.  There was no nebulous understanding of who was doing what in a bank.  It was very clear that the SMR is where the responsibility would start and finish, and who that responsibility was handed over to was written down.</p></speech>

Over here it is the individual accountability regime, IAR, or senior executive accountability.  It is all the same.  IAR or SMR relates to the same concept of holding individuals to account in banking.  Senior bankers in the UK will have a statement of responsibility.  They will formally delegate it to their team.  That is a formal process and that delegation has to be accepted.  It has to be very considered about people being qualified to accept that delegation.  Then there would be an expectation that, as a SMR, one would demonstrate reasonable steps in the execution of one's responsibility.  Reasonable steps would be the right reporting and the right governance, but also challenging, approving explicitly or not, demonstrating that one has done the checks, challenged oneself and that one has an assurance that what one is responsible for is happening as it should.  That is the regime I operated under before I came to Ireland.  It is a regime under which our senior team in the UK will operate.  It ultimately increases clarity and the accountability of senior bankers.  That is a good thing and absolutely consistent with what we are trying to achieve in our cultural transformation within Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

I have gone through all 39 pages and all the sections in them.  Clearly, the upgrading of the branches to have full cash and so forth is a welcome development.  I have seen the clusters and community hubs in my area, and the ability of people to come in has been a very positive development.  How far has that concept been rolled out?  My branch is in Montrose and it is transformed from what it was.  Most bank branches are very different from what they were five or ten years ago in terms of the interaction of people and using the facility for all kinds of things that would never have been considered previously.  Some people are on a journey with technology but most people are getting there.</p> <p>  With regard to the branch network, Bank of Ireland is not trying to close branches and, in fact, has opened branches recently.  In terms of ATM security, there were nine incidents and at least one involved Bank of Ireland.  There are diggers travelling around the Border digging out ATMs.  Is there a plan to try to ensure this does not happen too often?  These things can happen but I believe there have been nine incidents on either side of the Border in the past year.  It is a challenge.  I am aware of the future of money.  I attended a recent talk in the Central Bank about payments technology.  It is 1 cent for contactless and 10 cent for chip and pin.  There are issues today that probably none of us appreciated previously.  There is the future of the network and the journey we need to bring some people on in terms of technology and being cashless.  We are dragging money out of the Central Bank at the end of every month under Army escort to bring it to post offices and to secure it while people have it under the bed.</p> <p>  What does Ms McDonagh envisage in the banking sector?  Many people have voted with their telephone, online presence and so forth, but some people are very challenged by that and perhaps need some training or help to go on that journey.  Some people do not want to go on that journey, which is presumably their own business.  Where does Ms McDonagh see banking in five years at customer level?</p></speech>

We have seen an explosion in online transactions, such as card transactions, Internet transactions and so forth.  We are now processing 50 million payments per month through out business, which is a significant increase on a number of years ago.  The more online we get, however, the more important we believe the community presence is.  We will invest another &euro;11 million in our network this year and in upgrading branches around the country.  The workbench facility the Senator mentioned in Montrose gets much use.  That has been rolled out to 12 other locations around the country.  We recently opened workbenches in Letterkenny, Tralee and The Quay in Waterford.  This concept is taking off in communities.  Communities love the use of the branch, its layout and so forth.  We certainly see a strong future for that.</p> <p>  With regard to the ATMs, I will not comment on an ongoing security issue.  We had two regrettable incidents in two of our branches in Monaghan and Cavan.  At times like this we must stand up and be counted.  We are very committed to those communities.</p><p>In Ballybay, which I visited a couple of months ago, the ATM was put back in within two months and is fully operational again.  That incident hit the community in Ballybay hard because it happened two weeks before Christmas.  We kept the branch open for nine consecutive days because it was the only branch in the town.</p><p> We are the only bank branch in 64 communities in Ireland.  We take that very seriously.  We are very proud of that.  We are committed to staying in those communities and providing those ATM services.  We work with the relevant authorities, whether it is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the PSNI, to assist when it comes to incidents like that one and we continue to adapt our security measures.  However, what is most important is our commitment to our staff, the safety of our staff and our communities but also to continue to provide that service.  That is very important as we go forward.</p><p> In terms of five years, I wish I had a crystal ball but I still believe that for us to differentiate what we do as a bank in this market, that mix of online and community presence is essential.  We will continue to invest in both our online and mobile channels but, equally, in our branch network.</p></speech>

With regard to restructurings or forbearance measures the bank entered into in respect of mortgages, we can see the table for private dwelling houses, PDHs, for example, and the vast majority of them are term extension or arrears capitalisation.  Currently, the bank has done 2,916 PDH split mortgages.  I ask about the bank's policy down the line when that warehoused debt crystalises.  It is a good solution for many people.  It buys time.  The debt is parked.  The Bank of Ireland, as I understand it, continues to charge some interest on the warehoused element of the debt, unlike most other banks.  The witnesses might clarify what the rate is on that.  What is the bank's policy at the end of the term of the mortgage?  If, say, a family had &euro;100,000 parked, the house could be worth &euro;200,000.  Let us say they retire from work.  They are on fixed incomes or perhaps social welfare pensions and they do not have the &euro;100,000.  My question is, what happens then?  Do the witnesses have a figure for the amount of mortgage debt that has been warehoused by Bank of Ireland using that solution?</p></speech>

That is where some of those would feature.  However, the principle is the same.  For example, in those split mortgages for owner-occupier, on average, about 40% to 50% of the mortgage is on interest only and, on average, about 50% to 60% would be paying down capital and interest.  For the remaining duration of the mortgage, therefore, the first part of it will pay down to zero and then there will be a lump sum left at the end of the period.  It depends on each individual circumstance but we would be looking towards people who have retired who may have lump sums or pensions.  One or other of those dynamics may change over a period of time.  It depends on certain circumstances.

However, notwithstanding that, there will still likely be a residual warehoused element when the mortgage term ends and people are legitimately asking what will happen at that point in time.</p></speech>

Those mortgages would be classified as non-performing from a European Banking Authority, EBA, and a European Central Bank, ECB, guidelines point of view.  Like all of our non-performing mortgage customers, we have more than 200 staff just dealing with mortgage customers in difficulty.  We proactively look to engage on an ongoing basis with those customers to make sure we are looking towards solutions that work for the customer also.</p></speech>

We read from time to time that the banks have used up their exceptions under loan to income and so on and that no more mortgages will be approved outside the macro prudential limits for the remainder of the year.

When they were introduced it was challenging to start to manage that process because for the first time it introduced a checkpoint after a mortgage was approved and before it drew down.  However, as time has gone on we would certainly look to see how we can manage that in as clean a way as possible and as we look into this year, our intent is to make sure that we try to keep available exceptions throughout the full course of the year.</p></speech>

For the industry overall it is around the high 40s and for Bank of Ireland it is in the high 50s.

Ireland has the fourth highest rate in the eurozone.  Sweden has the lowest rate at 4%.  In aggregate terms, Ireland was about 38%.  Non-bank lenders, such as retail credit firms, are not bound by these risk-weighted asset capital requirements.  Are they a major threat to mainstream lenders such as Bank of Ireland?  Finance Ireland has now entered the market with residential mortgages.  It is not bound by those risk-weighted asset capital requirements.  To what extent is that a determinant of mortgage pricing?  We had Mario Draghi before the committee some months ago and he described the Irish market as a quasi-monopoly.  The Department of Finance, however, still seems to be attributing much of the reason for high Irish rates to the capital requirements.</p></speech>

The density of risk-weighting in Ireland, particularly on mortgages, is a multiple of the European average.  We cover that issue in our annual results.  Other research in the market has compared mortgage pricing in Ireland with the European market.  It is difficult to make direct comparison because application fees are common in other markets but we do not have them in Ireland.  The cash-back aspect is also a differentiator.  Mortgage risk-weighted assets in Ireland, which vary from 35% to 40%, are 3.2 times the average in Europe, where it is 11%.  That translates into an Irish bank needing to hold &euro;50 in capital against every &euro;1,000 it lends in mortgages.  The typical European bank needs just &euro;16.</p> <p>  That gives an idea of the comparison and that feeds into the conversation on pricing.  People state the absolute price of a mortgage in Ireland is higher than in Europe.  We would state that is not a fair comparison because of the application fees and cash-back elements and because of the amount of capital banks must hold against risk-weighted assets.  That density is much higher and reflects historic losses experienced in the Irish mortgage market during the depth of the crisis.  It also reflects the time it takes for the legal process in Ireland to work through cases and some other factors.  We welcome the report from the Department of Finance and the comparison is vivid and important.  We will speak to our investors frequently about this issue and it is reflected in pricing.  It is a key driver of our mortgage pricing.  </p></speech>

The extent of the look-back in those risk-weighted assets means there will not be any major change any time soon.  New bank entrants would be bound by these rules but my point is that new non-bank entrants, such as retail credit firms, are not bound by these risk-weighted assets requirements.  Do they offer the potential to shake up the market and, therefore, represent a real threat to Bank of Ireland and the other mainstream banks?  Ms McDonagh and others state the risk-weighted asset requirement is a major factor in mortgage pricing.  If that is the case and if the new entrants are not bound in the same way, they can then come into the Irish market and undercut Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

They certainly will represent increased competition.  Their product offering may be one of pricing or of risk.  There is much competition in the market today and new entrants will increase that competition.  We feel confident about our ability to compete and to continue to compete in the Irish market.  The changes we have made, such as reducing our shorter mortgage pricing and improvements in our services and our processes, are part of our differentiation.

That is particularly the case in a post-Brexit environment with much job creation.</p></speech>

We lend to many people who have just returned, whether new immigrants to Ireland or Irish people returning home.  In recent years 1% to 2% of applications have been from people returning to Ireland or people who may have worked overseas.   We work on a case-by-case basis when underwriting those applications and look at each individual involved.  The types of questions we ask include are applicants in a type of career or work practice that is suitable to the employment environment in Ireland and what is the common salary payable for a job here compared with overseas.  We have paused some of that activity in recent months because we want to make sure we are compliant with all regulations as we look to our obligations in other jurisdictions.  While we are very comfortable with all the lending we have done to date, we do need to look at what is ahead and make sure we are up-to-date with people resident in the UK, for instance, or in other markets.</p></speech>

The Chair is being very generous with time.  I have other questions about the bank's investment in technology and the transformation promised in that area.  It involves a significant investment by the bank.  Will Ms. McDonagh bring us up to date on where Bank of Ireland is in respect of modernising its IT infrastructure?</p></speech>

Upgrading our core banking systems is a big part of that.  We have successfully built the foundations.  We have the functionality for a single customer view where we can see all of our retail Ireland customers across a range of products, as opposed to having individual systems or views by product.</p><p>We now have that functionality.</p><p> We have also tested and loaded live transactions on a pilot basis for personal lending and savings account products.  Our focus this year is on improving and resetting our channel offering.  We have 15 million log-ins a month on our mobile app.  There is an opportunity for it to be better, with improved functionality and user experience, whether on a mobile phone, iPad or desktop and that is our major focus for 2019.</p></speech>

I have read the documentation and will submit questions about it which, I imagine, will be the same questions Deputy Pearse Doherty will have.  When the bank reads the documentation, if it is genuine in its efforts to make the bank customer focused, it will recognise that those customers, some of whom are staff or retired staff, inarguably had a legitimate expectation that they would have rolled onto a tracker mortgage.  The fact that these people were never on a tracker is not directly relevant.  There are thousands of customers who have been deemed impacted in the whole tracker examination and were never on a tracker but had a contractual entitlement to one.  I know that, in accordance with the letter of the mortgage contract, these customers did not have a legal right and that appears to be the case on my reading of it.  It is, however, also undoubtedly the case that there was much communication telling those customers that they would have the option of rolling onto a tracker.  It is not relevant that the tracker product was withdrawn.</p> <p>  We are talking about 200 customers and I really think the smart thing for the bank to do is to come down on the side of those customers.  Those people had a legitimate expectation that they would be in a position to benefit from a tracker and I am not aware of any other major outstanding issues from Bank of Ireland's tracker examination.  We have outstanding issues with other institutions.  I am sure Bank of Ireland has already done this but I suggest it quantifies the extent of this issue and, if it is as insignificant as we think it is, the bank would be better off dealing with it and concluding the matter in that way.</p></speech>

I hope he would reciprocate by noting that we have not been excessively legalistic in any of our responses on tracker issues and we are mindful of balancing legal, contractual obligations and requirements with what we consider to be fair.</p> <p>  We must also apply that fairness in equal measure to staff members as we would a customer.  We should not be providing unfair advantages or disadvantages to our colleagues that we would not provide to a customer in this tracker mortgage examination approach.  We note the Deputy's comments and Mr. O'Beirne might wish to add to my answer.</p></speech>

Typically, we do not use mediation in the way it is formally defined, nor do we pay for it.  It is not something that is part of the success we have had in reducing NPE down to a quarter of the industry average.  We work in many other ways.  They have been successful to date.</p></speech>

The court cases I have witnessed, involving the county registrar or other courts, lead me to believe there is little contact being made during the course of those court cases between the bank, or the account manager of the individual concerned, and the firm of solicitors.  The solicitors tend to pursue the individual doggedly.  It may not be an instruction from the bank.  How much engagement is there by the bank with the firm of solicitors employed in each case?  Are the firms just let loose on the customers?</p></speech>

The legal process is complex and very elongated.  My characterisation of the process from start to end is that the banks endeavour to reach a solution for the customer.  A lot of engagement takes place.  I cannot recall whether the Chairman was in the room when I mentioned we had 164 cases in court proceedings at advanced stages last year that were discontinued.  This is an example of where we reached solutions outside the court process.</p></speech>

I have seen the banks become more aggressive.  I am not singling out Bank of Ireland but speaking in general.  Through the courts, the banks have become more aggressive.  It concerns me because of the number of cases still in the courts.  I urge Bank of Ireland to get a decent handle on each case, or on the firm representing it in each case, to ensure some form of understanding is applied to what is being done in court, particularly where there is a lay litigant or a family trying to retain its home.  It may not always be explained clearly to the firm that the bank is open to discussions or to listening to the customer's case.  The opposite happens in the court scene in that the customer is subject to aggression and asked for the keys.</p><p>The paperwork is not sound in some of these cases.  There is a great deal of angst on the part of customers.  One of the ways to address that is to highlight it here and suggest there is a need for some guidance for those legal firms when they deal with those cases.</p><p> If somebody is invited to consider a case in an independent process, would that normally be carried out in-house?  Is an independent process seen as another arm of the bank investigating the case, or is it truly independent when someone is invited to examine the case?</p></speech>

Their house is on the line and they are offered an independent assessment because there is a dispute, but what they receive is another arm of the bank conducting the independent assessment.  That was my experience in one such case.  Why does the bank do that?  Why not give it to someone truly independent, outside of the bank?  There are not many such cases but where they arise, people expect independence.</p></speech>

We are committed to working with our customers if they are willing to work with us.  Our desire is to keep people in their homes.  We have a track record that is unrivalled in Ireland in respect of working with our customers to improve their situation.  Nine out of the ten times that customers have financial distress in respect of their mortgage, we find a solution that holds.  We have a track record of considerable resources and experience associated with this and we consider all avenues to find a sustainable solution for the customer, as demonstrated by our reduction of approximately 80% of NPL exposures from their peak.  Without knowing the details of those cases, it is difficult to understand the exact context or situation.  We would be happy to examine individual cases.</p></speech>

I return to the independence of the process and to seeking examples to determine what is happening and the processes of the bank.  In one such case, a person involved in the financial services industry discovered that the file that was being considered by the bank in an independent appeal by Grant Thornton was incomplete.  The person had the full file and the pieces that were missing made a difference to the outcome.  The person appealed to the bank for an oral hearing and asked to put the case before the bank.  The request was constructive and professional but the answer was "No".  I acknowledge that is an individual example but it brings us back to the question of how far the bank will go to ensure that any process teases out the issues to the end.  In the examples I am providing, the individuals do not seem to have felt that it had been worked out to the nth degree, where both parties were at least convinced by the process.</p></speech>

It is an important part of the tracker mortgage examination, where customers have up to 12 months to submit an appeal.  Some of our customers have asked for an appeal pack and several have proceeded to lodge appeals, some of which have been upheld.  They have typically been upheld because of personal circumstances.  Due to the independent nature of the panel, I do not get involved in individual cases but I examine the outcomes such as what numbers of cases were processed and upheld and the themes of why they were upheld.  Often, as no two cases are the same, there is some individual information in the case or a personal circumstance that the bank would not have known about.  The appeals process is in place for that very reason, that is, to look at the individual circumstances and try to find a solution.  The solution may not be to the liking of every customer but it is an appropriate and independently led appeals process facilitated by Grant Thornton and chaired by independent members who examine the cases with great rigour.</p></speech>

I fully agree it is important that all the issues raised are dealt with.  We have tried to ensure consideration of aspects of the case that did not specifically relate to tracker mortgages but which were a broader part of the customer's experience with the organisation. We have set up a process to twin-track the appeals panel with the broader complaints in order that all the documentation can be provided back to the appeals panel, which can make a broader decision in the round.</p></speech>

Regrettably, we identified a number of cases that involved a loss of residential homes.

Any customer who lost a personal dwelling home received the same level of compensation as the rest, that is, all the interest was refunded and fair value was attached.  An additional, flat sum of &euro;50,000 was paid as compensation.</p><p>Any difference between the market value on the date of sale and the current market value, given that we have had a recovery in market prices, was also returned to customers.  Depending on whether the customer wanted a new mortgage from us or to purchase a new home, we had to make sure they were provided with a mortgage.  Let us say their individual circumstances were such that they could not afford a home in that way, we looked to make an additional sustainability payment based on the difference between the interest that was contracted to have been paid originally.  We worked that out.</p></speech>

I am looking forward to the questions of committee members arising from the presentation of the Irish Local Development Network.</p> <p>  Before discussing the reports, it would be useful to give a brief overview of the evolution of policy and practice in the area of activation and the direction these reforms have taken.  The period from 2011 to 2019 has seen significant reforms to the Government&rsquo;s approach to supporting people who are unemployed in their return to the labour market.  The changes have included streamlining and reorganisation of the services on offer from the Department through Intreo; the introduction of new services and schemes, including recruitment subsidies such as JobsPlus; work placements under JobBridge; tailored training under MOMENTUM and conversion education under Springboard; an increase in the number of case officers directly employed and indirectly provided via contract; the tailoring of the Department's approach to jobseekers using the model developed by the ESRI; and increasing the number of places on, and adjusting the approach taken within, State employment schemes, such as community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  The Department has also developed an employer engagement strategy and a team to work very closely with employers on initiatives such as JobsPlus and national jobs week, which ran very successfully last week.  I pay tribute to all of the organisers and participants as it really was a success.</p> <p>  In all of these initiatives, we applied the principle of rights and responsibilities to encourage people in receipt of payments for jobseeking to actively engage with all or some of our services.</p><p>All of these changes were developed and implemented as part of the pathways to work strategy based on expert research and advice from bodies such as the OECD, ESRI and NESC.  Of particular relevance is the 2009 OECD report on activation policies in Ireland, the 2010 ESRI report on employment services and the 2011 report from NESC on services and supports for jobseekers.</p><p> The changes were overseen and guided by the Labour Market Council comprised of experts such as Dr. John Martin, former head of employment and social affairs at the OECD, Professor Philip O&rsquo;Connell of UCD, Ms Br&iacute;d O&rsquo;Brien of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, Dr. John Sweeney of National Economic and Social Council, NESC, Dr. Peter Rigney of ICTU, and Mr. Tony Donohoe of IBEC together with senior leaders from a number of large employers</p><p> These changes have not only borne fruit but have been, in the main, warmly welcomed, by the jobseekers we serve.  The evidence for this can be seen in the reductions in unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemployment as we emerged from the recession that lasted from 2009 to 2013.  This labour market recovery differs markedly from that witnessed in Ireland following previous recessions or what was witnessed in other countries affected by that global crisis.  In previous recessions, it took more than six years of sustained economic growth for unemployment to respond and even longer for long-term unemployment to fall.  This time around the experience has been different.</p><p> Although it is difficult to attribute this performance in a quantitative way to specific actions and measures, there is some evidence the committee should consider.  Econometric studies of JobBridge, the back to work education allowance and JobPath, together with a value for money review of JobsPlus, all indicate a positive impact on employment outcomes for participants compared to non-participants.  The recently published ESRI econometric assessment of the streamlined Intreo process commissioned by my Department indicates that the reforms improved exits from the live register.</p><p> Furthermore, external commentary on the economy by the OECD, EU and IMF have singled out our activation reforms as being particularly effective in contributing to reducing unemployment.  Reviews of the Intreo process reforms by the INOU and by the European network of Public Employment Services have also been positive.  Perhaps most important, our customer satisfaction tracking research, commissioned externally and conducted independently, indicates high levels of customer satisfaction with the service and the services offered.</p><p> All of this evidence suggests that we do not need to implement major reforms of our approach to activation.  We now operate in line with best practice internationally.  That is not to say that we cannot do better and, in particular, that there are not changes that we need to make to adjust to our improving economic situation.  It is in this context that the two Indecon reviews on local employment services, LES, and job clubs were published last January will be considered.  Members will agree that the reviews are broadly positive regarding the impacts of the LES and job clubs, recognising the role the LES play in engaging with those furthest from the labour market as well as the useful role of job clubs in working with more job-ready clients.  Nonetheless, the Indecon reviews make several useful recommendations that are being considered by my Department.</p><p> Transitioning to multi-annual contracts from the current annual contracts, as suggested in the reviews, would enable contractors to plan for the medium term while the enhanced use of performance metrics would enable my Department to ensure that the performance of contracted employment services are of benefit to jobseekers and of value to taxpayers.</p><p>  On procurement, the Indecon reviews suggest that open or public competitive procurement be actively considered.  A move to competitive procurement is also consistent with legal advice my Department has received with regard to its obligations under EU procurement legislation.  Accordingly, this is a matter that is currently receiving active consideration.</p><p> In December, I had the privilege of addressing the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, conference where I informed the delegates that the Indecon reports would be published in early 2019.  There were naturally some concerns and nervousness due to delegates not having seen the reviews but we assured them they had nothing to be nervous about and that once the reviews were published, we would meet them and discuss the reports.</p><p> Senior officials from my Department met representatives of the LES and job clubs on 25 January last, shortly after the publication of the reviews.  They were joined by a partner from Indecon responsible for drafting the reviews who presented his findings and took questions.  The LES and job clubs have broadly welcomed the Indecon reviews and I am happy that they are positively engaging with my Department, as they always have.  The continued longevity and success of LES and job clubs cannot be based on standing still or an assumption that contracts will be renewed irrespective of legal requirements or service performance considerations.  From our discussions it is clear that the LES and job clubs understand that they need to adapt to changing circumstances.  It is encouraging to see their openness to change and reform and I am optimistic that we will continue to benefit from their services for years to come.</p><p> An econometric review of the JobPath service by the Department's statistics unit, led by a senior statistician on secondment from the CSO with support and input from the OECD, is nearing completion and I expect that the results will be published next week.</p><p> Some commentators have sought to present the service procured via JobPath as being somehow in competition with that procured via the LES and job clubs.  This simplistic presentation which has been put to me on numerous occasions is also misplaced.  To be clear, it is my view, and that of my Department, including people who were there long before me, that these services complement rather than compete with each other.</p><p> The evidence in Ireland, just as in every other labour market around the world, is that people who are long-term unemployed face significant challenges in securing employment opportunities.  For some long-term unemployed people, the period of unemployment is prolonged; this requires that there is a mix of services and service providers available to them over this period.  That is why we have LES and job clubs, JobPath, State-employment schemes such as community employment and T&uacute;s and a mix of education and training schemes via SOLAS and its contracted service providers.</p><p> Services can at different stages of unemployment offer different opportunities and supports to unemployed jobseekers.  Currently, with approximately 77,000 long-term unemployed people on the live register and a further 45,000 engaged in programmes such as community employment, CE, there is more than enough work for all of our service providers.  There may be a fear that a particular mindset is present but unfortunately there are more than enough unemployed people for all our services to help.  We would not be able to do what we need to support those people without the support of all our services.  </p><p> Looking at the future, the development of our service strategy will be driven by the twin purposes at the core of all public employment services.  First, the activation function of Public Employment Services, PES, is to facilitate the smooth functioning of the labour market by encouraging labour market participation and reducing what economists call "friction" as people enter, leave or move within the workforce.  It does this by trying to ensure that unemployed workers are matched through advice, counselling, work experience and training to job opportunities and to ensure that the job opportunities are in fact notified to, and made available to jobseekers.  Activation also means working with employers to make it easy for them to take on workers and specifically to encourage them to give unemployed workers, whom they might not otherwise consider, the opportunity to prove their worth and continue to work in the organisations where they get work experience.</p><p> The second core purpose of PES is social inclusion.  To ensure that unemployed workers are not disenfranchised by not having the social or family capital or network that gives them access to employment opportunities.  It is not simply enough for the State to passively provide income supports and then leave people to figure out on their own how best to find and sustain employment.  We have a duty to offer supports in the form of advice, work experience opportunities, training and education and occupational activities to all jobseekers.  In doing this, we provide a social capital or a public network to all unemployed workers that can help redress any inequality arising from differences in social and family capital.</p><p> This twin purpose of activation and social inclusion applies regardless of the economic backdrop.  However the challenges faced in delivering on this purpose changes as employment conditions vary.</p><p> We are, at this stage, moving from a position of having an excess supply of labour to one where labour supply is tightening.  This challenges us to create opportunities to bring more people into the labour market and to extend our services to other groups of people whom we could not reach, given constrained resources, during recessionary times.  This includes improving and expanding services for women not currently active in the workplace, but who want to be, and similarly for people with disabilities.  We are also moving from a position where many unemployed people had a strong record of prior employment to one where those people who are now long-term unemployed are increasingly characterised by weak labour market attachment and significant employment barriers.</p><p>This group of people requires more intensive support, delivered via a mixture of services and service providers, as I have outlined.</p><p> The Department is currently reviewing how it will adapt its services to address these challenges.  This is unlikely to require a major overhaul of service provision.  However, it will require a refocusing of effort and it is more than likely to require some redesign of our services to attune them to the needs of people facing significant barriers to taking up employment.  We are in the process of designing the activation and support services for the next generation.  At the moment we are lucky enough for our unemployment numbers to be coming down but these programmes need to be scalable.  If anything happens to employment in this country again, God forbid, we need to be able to scale them up easily.  The changes we have made to the design of the youth employment support scheme, YESS, which helps young people with significant barriers to employment to gain valuable workplace experience, are an example of the redesign of schemes that were working but can have a much more positive impact with a small number of tweaks. </p><p> One thing that I will not do is make the mistake made by previous administrations, with all due respect to them.  In periods of economic growth the State's PES were effectively allowed to wind down and wither through disuse because we did not need them.  This happened without any acknowledgement that we would need to be able to turn on the tap again.  In any future downturn in the economic cycle we do not want to have to rebuild the PES from scratch, as we unfortunately did between 2011 and 2015.  Although we have had major success, there is no doubt that we lost too much time in rebuilding the service.  This led to a situation where we entered the recession with far more people unemployed than would have been the case if the public employment service had been operating effectively for the previous several years. </p><p> A 2009 estimate from the OECD suggested the number on the live register was approximately 100,000 higher than it would have been if the PES were operating to best practice levels in those years.  In refocusing our efforts I will not countenance any reduction in capacity.  Between Intreo, LES and JobPath staff, we have approximately 800 case officers at present.  At a minimum I intend to maintain that capacity to the extent that I can, given available resources.  I also intend to extend the Department&rsquo;s service offerings to help other groups to access employment opportunities; people with disabilities and people, mainly women, who left employment to mind our children.</p><p> I believe that these are objectives on which we can all agree.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views and answering any questions.</p></speech>

I eagerly awaited the opening statement which arrived late this afternoon.  I read it with some interest.  I thank her for coming before the committee, presenting her opening statement and addressing questions.  There is an awful lot of concern out there.  She has engaged positively with the ILDN but there is also a lot of fear.  That fear was echoed by representatives of the ILDN and SIPTU when they came before the committee.  There are concerns about the future for the LES and for job clubs.  The Indecon report shows what a massive success they have been.  Some statistics jump out.  In 2012, we had an unemployment rate of 16%; it dropped to 6.7% before the onset of JobPath.  This clearly shows that the successful schemes that were in place were making a massive impact in addressing the unemployment crisis we had at that point.  The Minister says that JobPath has been the most successful labour activation scheme in the history of the State and cites the drop in unemployment figures.  However, this drop had started and was brought about by the successful schemes that had been in place.</p> <p>  The Indecon report also shows that the LES achieved a 28.8% success rate.  The target was 30%.  My concern is that the Minister and the Department do not account for the fact this figure only records people who take up employment for more than 30 hours a week.  It does not account for the people who are engaged in part-time employment or work for fewer than 30 hours a week.  It does not account for people who have gone into education, upskilling, training or anything like that.  The achievement rate is considerably higher than the 28.8% listed.  We can compare that to the alternative scheme that the Minister cites, namely JobPath.  That scheme's target was 14% and it struggles to achieve that despite the money that has been put into the JobPath programme, Turas Nua and Seetec.  More than &euro;162 million has been spent and just over 11,000 people have entered employment that is sustained for 12 months or more.  </p> <p>  Several concerns were raised in our engagement with the ILDN.  Its representatives acknowledge that some changes are needed.  They will state that openly.  They are not afraid of change or of adapting.  They know they cannot stand still.  One recommendation that jumps out at me from the Indecon report is the move to competitive procurement.  I would like to tease that out with the Minister.  Her written submission states: "A move to competitive procurement is also consistent with legal advice my Department has received with regard to its obligations under EU procurement legislation".  I would like to see the legal advice the Minister has received.  The ILDN gave a number of different examples, though I cannot find them now-----</p></speech>

I quote the presentation made by Mr. Donal Coffey to this committee on behalf of SIPTU:</p><blockquote>A clearer reading of EU guidelines on competition policy and rules pertaining to state aid outlines how member states can work within the EU procurement environment while still protecting services of general interest...  Services of general interest expressly include services provided directly to the person, such as social assistance services, employment and training services, childcare, social housing or long-term care of the elderly and people with disabilities, according to Murphy and Deane.</blockquote> <p>This shows that we do not have to have a procurement process.  The guidelines are there.  I would be interested to see the legal advice the Minister mentioned.  </p><p>Her submission also states &quot;services complement rather than compete with each other&quot; and &quot;there is more than enough work for all our service providers&quot;.  That is interesting.  I have challenged her on this time and time again.  CE schemes throughout the State are struggling.  There is a massive number of vacancies on them.  She will say that this is because there is less unemployment and there are not enough people to fill them.  That is nonsense.  The number of referrals to JobPath continues to increase.  More than 206,000 people have been referred to JobPath.  People are now being referred to JobPath for a third year.  They are essentially doing exactly the same thing time and time again.  The initial referral of &euro;311 is paid not just once or twice but three times.  It is paid for doing exactly the same thing.  There is competition there.  People are being referred to JobPath and that is unfortunately impacting on the other schemes.  </p><p>There are a couple of other interesting lines I would like to touch on.</p><p>As was mentioned, this is unlikely to require a major overhaul of service provision but it will require refocusing on effort.  I ask the Minister to tease that out a bit, because she also said that between Intreo, LES and JobPath staff we have approximately 800 case officers at present.  The contract for JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec concludes this year.  Is the Minister clearly stating there is a role for JobPath into the future?  Will there be a renewed contract with JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec?  The Minister will be aware of a cross-party D&aacute;il motion calling for the ending of referrals to JobPath and solely investing in schemes such as LES, job clubs and the other successful schemes.  Does she believe there is a role for JobPath, Turas Nua and Seetec into the future?</p><p> There is major concern over the type of model with the tweaking the Minister is proposing.  If she puts this out to open procurement, what are her intentions?  The fear is that she is moving from the not-for-profit community model that works to a more privatised model.  The concern in the LES and job clubs is that she is moving to a privatised payment-by-results model and away from the community.  Is that the intention?  The concern is that the payment-by-results model does not work.  The model that works is the not-for-profit LES based in community with the wraparound services that are provided in terms of upskilling, further education and all the other things that are not taken into account when their achievements are considered.  I would appreciate answers to those questions.  I hope I will have another chance because I have many more.</p></speech>

Even if the Minister and her officials were minded over a period of time to go down that route, my advice would be to reflect on it.  The review of the operation of JobPath might inform the Department's approach to that.  Like Deputy Brady and others, I am not convinced of the requirement to go through a public tendering process to obtain these services.  If I cannot get copies of the Minister's legal advice on this, I would like her to elucidate more on the nature of that advice.</p> <p>  Yesterday we had a very interesting debate in the Seanad on a Bill introduced by Senator Higgins.  It is very timely legislation designed to ensure our public procurement system places greater emphasis on social, environmental and labour responsibilities.  It is important to reflect on these issues when tendering, particularly for something as significant as this.  If the Minister decides to tender for these kinds of services, the tenders should be designed very carefully so as not to exclude accidentally or otherwise organisations that are well equipped and well experienced in terms of providing these very important services.  We know that tenders are often designed to obtain the result the system may want.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the timeline envisaged for tendering for activation services of this nature as that would focus our minds on the horizon ahead.</p> <p>  More than adequate information is available from the Indecon report to justify the sustainment of the LES and job club model into the future, particularly when we remember the considerable number of households with no working adult.  It concerns me and I know it concerns the Minister.  It concerns anybody with any interest in the idea and value of work in our society.  It seems very clear that the LES and job club model is best placed to deliver the kinds of customised and tailored services that those who are very distant from the labour market require.</p> <p>  The payment-by-results model, which seems to be entirely driven by the profit motive, is not well positioned to provide the kinds of wraparound and customised services that LES and the job clubs are renowned for providing.  LES and job clubs provide something that money cannot buy - the institutional memory and expertise built up over many years.  The Indecon report shows clearly that the LES operations across the country have very strong relationships with local employers.  Employers interviewed as part of this process demonstrated that their experience with the local employment service and job clubs was very important and very useful in identifying employees for their organisations.  That in itself is a very convincing argument for allowing the LES model to continue.</p> <p>  It is crucial to continue to have a community-based response with all the kinds of things that LES and job clubs do to reach those people who are of concern to me and to the Minister - those who are very distant from the labour market and those who for a variety of socioeconomic reasons often experience intergenerational unemployment.  In our day-to-day work in our communities we come across many people who are victims of those unfortunate circumstances.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to reflect on my comments on public tendering and the legal position.  Even if she and her officials are minded to enter into a public procurement process to obtain labour activation services of this nature, I ask her to wait until she has the JobPath review in her hand because it should inform our approach to future labour activation services.</p></speech>

There have been many reports on what we have done in the past.  We have statistics for the numbers of people unemployed, the percentages who got jobs, the costs associated and so forth.  It is very quantitative, but the quality of jobs and the aspirations of people are rarely mentioned in the reports.  We spend a lot of time just looking at the raw numbers.</p> <p>  I do not pass criticism on what we have done in recent years.</p><p>However, the challenge we are facing for the next few years is a different ballgame.  What we did that worked in the past will not be fit for purpose.  We need more.  The group of people we are examining now are long-term unemployed.  In many cases they come from geographical areas which would be referred to as black spots of high unemployment.  The areas have had that tag for a long time.  Then there is the intergenerational issue in families.  The issue we are looking at is somewhat different.  We are also in a situation where, significantly, employers have positions they are unable to fill.  Our programme for the future must be more than presenting an individual to fill a vacancy because the capacity of the individual to fill that vacancy must be examined.</p><p> My first observation is that whatever new programme emerges must be more holistic and must deal with the challenge of the preparation of the person.  I know many people in their mid-20s who have never worked.  They might not have even done transition year and they are out of school for ten or 12 years.  They are not work ready.  In other words, one could present them with an opportunity but they do not have the experience and they are out of education.  There are many more challenges for such people and the new programme must reflect that.  It must go further than just focus on employment.  I accept that the Minister's responsibility is employment affairs and social protection.  This issue must be addressed in a whole-of-Government way.  That includes education and the role of DEIS schools.  The Minister has a role to play as she refers to it often with regard to school meals and so forth.  It must be well co-ordinated.  We still have a situation where the outcomes for children attending DEIS schools are not equal to those of children attending non-DEIS schools.</p><p> There is an array of challenges and they must be dealt with holistically.  While getting a person a job is one goal, the goals have to be more than that and include the quality of job and the community the person comes from.  This is not just about addressing the needs of an individual.  It is not just the individual but the family the individual belongs to and the communities the individuals comes from.  It is a much more difficult task than what we have faced over the last number of years.</p><p> I have a specific comment on one of the recommendations, which states, "Reflecting the decline in the number of individuals who are experiencing long-term unemployment and given the role of other measures including JobPath in assisting this group, we recommend that Local Employment Services should in the future focus on the most disadvantaged activation and other client groups who are not currently obtaining assistance from other State-delivered/funded programmes."  I would be careful with the last part.  Even if somebody is in a programme at present it might not be the appropriate one.  We must be careful when setting up a new activation to deal with the long-term unemployed.  If somebody is already in a programme, that programme is an opportunity that exists today but it might not be the best fit for the person's needs.  That person should not be automatically excluded.  I give that caution as we design the new programme.</p><p> Those are my opening observations.  I call Senator Higgins.</p></speech>

There is much that is very positive in the Indecon report and there is a detailed breakdown of what we already know from the different testimonies to the committee.  I wish to focus on the benefits of the LES.  I might mention JobPath but I will focus on the schemes we are reviewing.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that yesterday, I brought a public procurement Bill through Second Stage in the Seanad.  It has a long journey ahead.  What started my interest in that area was JobPath being proposed.  I recall being told at the time by somebody from the Department - I was a civil society representative at the time - that we had to do it because of European directives.  I looked at those directives, where they were coming from, how they were changing and saw that there was huge scope within them.  While much of the analysis of the report is strong and robust, what emerged, and it emerged strongly in our hearings earlier this week, was that the recommendation that competitive open procurement should be considered felt like a <i>non sequitur</i>.  The case was not made for it.  In terms of the services of general interest, there is scope for the model of delivery we have at present to continue or to be enhanced.  We do not necessarily need to move to an open procurement model.  It is important that the Minister and the Department allow this model to be developed further.  The ultimate test should be around the outcomes, and they should be monitored, but the competitive process has not always delivered the best outcomes for us.</p><p>Certainly, some of the very blunt measures, such as the 30% target, do not capture some of the positive work that has been done.  We know the LES have hit 28.8%.  They are almost hitting the 30%.  What struck me was that in both job clubs and the local employment services, that was the measure for over 30 hours.  However, a huge number of people were also moving into perhaps less than 30 hours work.  That was an important step for them in terms of their progression and building labour market attachment.  It may have been persons who were also balancing caring and they were considering the 15 hours childcare.  The way we measure it at present does not capture those who may only be working 20 hours or 15 hours, but that is an important step back into the market for them.</p><p>Another matter that strongly emerged from what we heard from the local employment services is the recognition that there are multiple other positive outcomes.  Jobs are one outcome.  I am aware that the Minister understands this issue because we have discussed it in the past.  A return to education is also a positive outcome.  That is not something for JobPath in its contract.  The local employment services have made strong connections with universities and while it might not hit the 30% target that is a very important outcome.  That texture of outcome and the responsiveness that local employment services have shown to a changing landscape are great strengths.  When services are not for profit, they are able to be more responsive than services that have not only the Department to engage with as their client but also shareholders with projected income and returns.  They do not have that flexibility.</p><p>The number of long-term unemployed has decreased, but there are other cohorts.  There are people who may not be on the live register and people who may be parenting alone.  They might have young children but may want to access services on a voluntary basis.  I was struck, for example, that those who would probably be qualified adults in the system had found support from local employment services.  That might be jobless households where somebody might not be on the register but who was able to engage and get supports in that regard.  It is similar for people with disabilities and particular programmes in that respect.  There is huge scope.  Again, it is very important that this wider scope of potential interest in people who may have a slightly longer route to employment and may need particular supports is in a positive frame and not in a punitive or sanction-based frame.  Local employment services can do that.</p><p>I called into the climate change committee meeting just as it went into public session and was voting.  It was an interesting experience.  One of the main issues debated was support in just transition for those in carbon-intensive industries as those change.  People wanted to know that it was not simply going to be a JobPath model but a joined-up model.  Again, the local employment services and the job clubs are exactly the type of measure and space for transitioning.  They have said that they have had the scope in the past and could have it in the future for working with those who are not unemployed yet, who may be in precarious work or who may be in sectors that are down-scaling.  That is a huge potential.  I will not go into all the evidence of how they work.  I am talking about the potential for the future.  As the Chairman said, we face a new set of challenges.  The local employment services and the job clubs are the appropriate tool for the complexity of what we face.  We are in danger of losing some of that if we move to an open competitive model that is frozen in time when we sign up to a five-year contract and have a certain number of people attached.  That flexibility in response could be lost.  I believe we should scale these up.</p><p>My last point is on something that is very good about the model at present.  I worked with Wexford Local Development and young rural unemployed people in the past.  What was wonderful was that we listened collectively to those young people on how they felt the system could work better and what a rural Youth Guarantee might look like.</p><p>There was an openness, a social benefit and a conversation, which is different from feeling like an axe is hanging over one's head due to the number of CVs one has sent.  People were feeding back and the system was responding.  This is basically a paean to local employment services and job clubs, but they are what we need for the future.  I hope that the Minister will tell us how this will translate into a scaling up and that she will address education links specifically.</p></speech>

If I have missed any in my notes, the members might shout.</p> <p>  It is obvious that we all appreciate the services that have been provided by the LES and job clubs to hundreds of thousands of people down the years.  We are appreciative of the services they have helped us to deliver.  We have no intention of downsizing or changing negatively anything that they do.</p> <p>  To synopsise what I am hearing from members, they are happy in the knowledge that this forms part of the service offering that we will need.  We value the experience, expertise and tailoring of services, which Senator Higgins eloquently described.  We want to take advantage of that in future.  The Chairman hit the nail on the head.  When we develop the next generation of services, we must do so cognisant of the fact that the challenges facing some people now were not even around ten or 15 years ago.</p> <p>  There will be an array of services, but they will not be in competition with one another.  We do not sit down and say that JobPath is better than the community employment, CE, scheme.  It is not.  It is just different.  We must model services so that no two organisations, be they contractors for the State, our own people, host companies or so on, are doing the same job.  We must recognise the skills, talents and capabilities of each organisation and send sections of society that are facing different challenges to those organisations that are most receptive to helping them get through them.  That might mean CE during one period in an unemployed person's life before he or she moves to being CV ready.  Someone may move from one service to another over the lifetime of his or her unemployment.  I hope that the lifespan of his or her unemployment gets smaller and smaller.</p> <p>  We are aware of the changing factors and social difficulties that the people of this generation face.  We must tailor and model our services going forward.</p> <p>  Last week, Deputy Brady gave me the opportunity to reiterate the fact that the budgets for our contracted services had not changed.  Our intention is to model the next activation services that the State offers in a tailored way using the people, experience and expertise currently in place.  The LES and our job clubs will form an integral part of that offering.  I am as grateful for them as are most of the members present.  I met them before Christmas and intermittently since January.  I have told them that we could not have done what we did in recent years without them.  By the same token, we could not have done what we did in the past five years without Turas Nua, Seetec, CE, T&uacute;s, RSS or SOLAS in terms of training or the back-to-education grants from the Department of Education and Skills that allowed people to return to full-time third level education.</p> <p>  No two people who are looking for work have the same set of challenges in their lives.  Therefore, the services that we offer on behalf of the State must be wide and varied, and their next generation must be tailored and capable of being scaled up if, God forbids, something happens.</p> <p>  The Chairman is right about this being outside the generational services offering on which we are working.  When I was before the committee last week, I suggested that we consider establishing an interdepartmental body to examine the daily and weekly challenges facing people from zero to 66 years of age and tailor a cross-departmental targeted approach to geographical black spots.  We cannot tailor five services from the perspectives of activation, education and experience and capture all of the challenges of the families in question.  More is needed.  Once that is done, it should be a priority in where we move next.</p></speech>

If I am here for long enough, I would have no problem doing so, but if we get this body of work done in the next couple of months, we need to consider putting a cross-departmental task force together immediately afterwards, or perhaps even in tandem, to examine specific geographical areas.  There could be a proof-of-concept pilot.  If it can get better outcomes for 1,000 people within 12 months, it might be a model with which we can move forward.  I am willing to do that.  The national action plan for inclusion is being launched in May.  If we can work between now and then on developing a pilot, that would be a great time to launch it.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a new range of programmes, but they are not new.  We have a range of services offered by a range of contractors.  Some of them are fabulous but some could be better, given their skill sets and the need to reach people whom we have never reached before.  We need to enhance and empower services.  We are not getting rid of youth employment services, over 55s services, CE, T&uacute;s or RSS, but tweaks can be made to address specific challenges and enhance our offering.  That is what I hope to do with the Department in the coming months.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins discussed how we measured outcomes.  The same metric that is used for her is not used for Senator Nash or Deputy Brady.  The outcome is the provision of a pathway back to work and sustainable, happy and fulfilling lives for those we service.  The Senator is right about there being some people on the live register who need a more holistic wraparound service to help them get from where they are to where we want them to go.  For some, that might take three years.  For others, it might take seven years.  It can only be determined by each person's willingness to work and co-operate with the services, assuming those services are tailored to that person's set of needs.  Measuring outcomes in CE will not be the same as it is in T&uacute;s, JobPath, LES or job clubs.  Outcomes are measured in the fulfilment of the person's needs.  For some, that might just involve learning the capacity to understand that they need to show up at the same place ready for work every day.  A service might need to train someone to develop learning skills, teach people a different language and so on.  Some people will have a specific set of requirements on day 1.  By year 2, they might have a different set of requirements.  Different factors and outcomes for different levels of service are required to get people from where they are, which is long-term unemployment, into long-term, sustainable and supported employment.  That range of services will be designed in the coming months.  We will also tweak existing services to ensure that we fill every gap.</p> <p>  Thankfully, the live register figures are reducing, with numbers on the long-term live register decreasing at an even greater speed.  More importantly, they are doing so faster than in our European counterparts.  Given the current capacity in our system, this allows us to reach people who are intergenerationally unemployed and to address their issues.  It also allows us to reach people who are not on the live register but who want to work and just need access to the range of supports and educational opportunities.  It allows us to stretch our offering to reach a much wider audience.  This is not just about apple pie and love.  We are reaching the stage of not having enough people to fill the job vacancies being created by the economy, so it is in the country's interests to encourage people who are not working but who are not on the live register to participate in the economy.  We must provide whatever services we can to ensure that it is an easy and supported journey for them.</p> <p>  The most serious message that I should get across today is that our services are not in competition with one another.  That one has an outturn rate of 28% versus another's 25% or 9% or CE's 37% does not mean it is a competition.  Each person attending a body for assistance has different needs.  If the metric was the number of people who got a job within one year, some organisations would be excelling and others would not, but that would not take into consideration any of the challenges facing the people we have sent to those organisations.  This is not about competition.  It is about having an array of services that suit individuals' needs at a particular time in their lives.  As long as I can offer a full range of services that complement one another, that provide someone attending an Intreo office a choice depending on his or her social challenges, difficulties or barriers to employment, and that find that person a niche and allow him or her to progress to other services or into work directly, getting that right will be a measure of success.</p><p>I think that will be a measure of success, if we can get that right.  It will not be easy because, as I said, the people who are presenting have a variety of different issues but it is our job to provide services at the best level we can.</p><p> The biggest message I am hearing today is that the committee's concern and nervousness is over public procurement, so I will be very honest and brutal.  EU procurement rules apply to everybody except those services to which they do not apply.  The legislation, as advised to me by both the Chief State Solicitor's Office and Attorney General, is to the effect that, much and all as they and the committee would want it to be otherwise, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, local employment services, LES, and our job clubs do not come under that derogation.  They have to be attributable to the EU procurement laws, as does everybody else in the country.  </p><p> That is not something to be afraid and fearful of.  If that is the only thing the committee is concerned about, even though it is not necessarily a message that we are getting from interactions with people from LES, and job clubs, then it genuinely has nothing to be concerned about.  Our job is to provide for the 77,000 people who are long-term unemployed, the 45,000 people who are on community employment schemes and want to progress into sustainable employment and those hundreds of thousands of other people who are not on the live register but potentially could be in employment if the proper services were available.  There is much work to be done at a tailored and detailed level.  People are facing different challenges today, and will do in the future, so we cannot offer the services that we intend to offer to the far too many people who are unemployed without the procurement of LES and job clubs.  We must ensure that we continue to use their expertise and employment skills in the future.  We must tailor our plans and models.  They will not be the same because some people will be looking for a certain type of service and others will be looking for a different type of service but there will be a place for all our service providers in the future.</p><p> Deputy Brady asked specifically whether I intend to contract JobPath in the future.  What I currently intend to do is to fulfil the contract we have, which runs until 2021, and what we decide for the future is totally dependent on the outcome of deliberations we will have with each other over the coming weeks as to what kinds of services we need to offer.  I ask the committee to ponder the fact that the 48,000 people who got work in the past number of years because of JobPath did so because of that particular model.  I do not know how many of them would have got jobs without that help but I am sure we did not have the capacity to look after those people within the system, through our own offices and those of our service providers, before 2015.  We were incredibly stretched which is why we introduced the new Intreo model and contracting services on a pay-for-performance model because it works as part of a mix of services.  That is international best practice.  That is not the only service, nor will it ever be.  </p><p> There are 48,00 people currently going through JobPath to whom we have a responsibility.  We will fulfil the contract with JobPath before we make decisions, in the next couple of weeks, as to what the next generation of services will look like.</p><p> Senator Nash asked if I could give him a timeline, if we are wedded to tendering, but  and I cannot do that.  We are currently in breach of the EU legislation and have been for the past number of years.  I am not rushing to confirm a tender next Tuesday.  We need to know for what we are tendering.  I cannot do that specifically until we know exactly what kind of services we want, and the range of them.  We will work in co-operation with LES over the next couple of months to find out what extra capacity and skillset they have that we have not heretofore been utilising.  Senator Higgins alluded to some of that.</p><p> We will decide in the next couple of months on the best level of service offerings for training, employment and activation services we need to give to the next generation of unemployed Irish people.  We will then work with the services we have to allow those people consider which ones they want to work with and fulfil.  It will not take years but it will not take weeks away either.  We need to ensure we get it right for the next generation, rather than for the next couple of years, and that the services we offer are based on the experiences we have today.  There is a reduced number of people on the live register but we have extra capacity within the current system to extend the services we currently offer and, indeed, future services we offer to people who heretofore we have not offered services.</p></speech>

There is a case to be made for alternatives but I accept this is the route the Minister is looking at.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was restricted to not-for-profit and other similar services.  Is that a capacity within the tendering process?  I am serious when I say that there are spaces for human services where not-for-profits are better able to be responsive.</p> <p>  I welcome that the Minister has referred to choice being offered to the person who is being assisted.  What weighting would be given to quality if this procurement process is pursued?  Quality of training of staff had a low weighting in the JobPath process.  It is vital that a high weighting is given to quality and different quality measures.  That is different from the paper performance which is about the outcome.</p></speech>

The scaling moved up quickly with JobPath.</p> <p>  There would be space and freedom from the European procurement directives if tendering was not pursued and Intreo's internal capacity was looked at instead.  Is there potential for, or are there plans for, increasing Intreo's staffing levels and perhaps, in some of the ongoing work, increasing the internal and ongoing capacity of the services to support Irish citizens?</p> <p>  We talked about groups of people who are hard to reach, perhaps those who are precluded from payments because of an habitual residency condition.  They may be addressed under a consideration of voluntary access.</p></speech>

There are lessons we can learn from how that tendering process was done before we go out to our own tendering process.</p> <p>  It is all about outcomes and it has to be across every single scheme because, ultimately, the aim is to get somebody into long-term, sustainable, supported employment but it is not a race.  Different services will have different speeds, for want of a better word, depending on the support they are offering, the types of services they are offering and the people they are serving.  It might take one service a year to help somebody get a job and it might take another service three years.  Somebody might need to go from one service to another service for five years in total before they get employment.  It is not about how quickly we get somebody to the outcome.  It is about providing a service that is tailored for that particular person's needs and supporting them through that journey back into full-time, sustainable employment, no matter how long it takes.  That must be the aim and it must be acknowledged that one type of service does not fit everybody's requirements.  That is why we need a broad spectrum of services provided by a range of people.</p> <p>  We will not increase our Intreo offices.  The live register numbers are coming down and the premise from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is that we should be reducing our overall staff count, not increasing it.  We have enough capacity in the system currently and we do not need to employ any more.  Between LES, job clubs, Intreo case officers and the case officers in JobPath, we have just under 800 individual case office managers which is sufficient, on the ratio of 120:1, which is international best practice, to get the best outcomes.</p></speech>

I will follow up on some points made by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins on procurement.  She is correct regarding SICAP tendering.  It was approved by the Attorney General and I am told it was restricted to non-profit companies. The Minister stated there are lessons she may take from the process.  I would like to know what she thinks those lessons are.  The process did achieve what it set out to do.  It was an open tendering process but who could tender was restricted.  The Minister is stating nobody should be afraid of the tendering process.  Nobody is afraid of the process, but the question is on what grounds the tendering process is based.</p> <p>  If it is based on payment by results and open to for-profit companies then that is something of which to be fearful.  These private companies are more concerned about their shareholders and meeting their demands than the individuals they are supposed to be looking after.  There is certainly something to be fearful of regarding the tendering process and how it is going to be put in place.  I am not convinced we are bound to use that process by EU guidelines.  Will the Minister circulate the advice she has been given to the committee?  The information I have completely contradicts the Minister's.  I am not going to get into an argument with the Minister on this and we may have to agree to disagree-----</p></speech>

People who had been engaging with those schemes and were then referred to JobPath ultimately ended up back at their starting point a year later.  They were taken out of training and education schemes that were working and put sitting in front of a computer screen for a year only to then find themselves back in the LES.  We know there are difficulties in CE schemes.  I cited those already in my opening comments, including the number of vacancies.  The Minister stated there are 800 staff attached to all of these services, including JobPath.  She did not go into much detail, however.  She did state that when JobPath was rolled out in 2015 it was not possible to scale up the existing services such as the LES and similar schemes.</p> <p>  Now is the time to start scaling up those schemes because there is a distinct difference in the staff.  I am not going slate any employees in Turas Nua, Seetec or anywhere else.  There are all doing a job.  The level of training of staff in the LES and job clubs is second to none, however.  There is a high turnover of staff in Turas Nua and Seetec and that seriously impacts on delivery for people on those schemes.  There is an opportunity to upscale the LES, jobs clubs and other services now.  We all agree that things have to change and now is the time to start looking at scaling up the 23 LESs and the job clubs.  We all agree those are working.  I am not convinced how beneficial it is for people to engage with Turas Nua and Seetec.  We could argue all afternoon about how successful those initiatives are.  The vast majority of people, however, who have got jobs would have got jobs one way or another.  There are many people who-----</p></speech>

It was an open competition with public tender.  When I mentioned lessons could be learned from it, I meant in the structure of the tender, the lot size and the awarding criteria.  It was an interesting process and we have learned from that.  We will take cognisance of those lessons when we are doing our own tendering process.  The only advice I get as a Cabinet Minister is from the CSSO and the Attorney General.  I am bound by that advice and I have been told there are no derogations regarding public procurement in EU legislation regarding my ambition for publicly tendering for service offerings.  I accept that advice.  As is normal, I will certainly not be issuing copies of advice intended for me and the Cabinet.  I am bound by that advice but I agree with the reasons underpinning it and the model itself.</p> <p>  I state again to Deputy Brady that there is no need to be fearful.  Regarding services we need to offer in future, there are more than enough people for the service offering we have today.  I refer to the 77,000 people long-term unemployed, the 42,000 people on CE schemes and anybody else who wants to work and who is not on the live register.  That is before we even tweak the system.  There are enough people to continue using the contractors we have into the future.  Our ambition is to tailor and tweak the services we are currently offering to suit the requirements and needs of people not being fulfilled in every way they could be today.  We also need to recognise that the challenges unemployed people face in the future will be slightly different.  </p> <p>  For about a year after I became Minister the case was often made to me that the sole reason for the decrease in CE applications was JobPath.  We changed the legislation last June to allow anybody on JobPath to be part of a CE scheme, if that is what the person wanted to do.  We still have, however, a large number of vacancies on our CE schemes despite there being no restrictions preventing anybody on JobPath applying for and participating in a CE scheme.  I can only conclude that the tens of thousands of people I was told were on JobPath who apparently wanted to do CE schemes have either gotten jobs, as part of the roughly 47,000 people now in work again, or are happy to continue with JobPath.  Applications have not been made in the kind of numbers Deputy Brady and his colleagues presented to me previously.  </p> <p>  We do have an issue at the moment with CE placement.  It is not as simple, as Deputy Brady seems to think it is, as having thousands of people on the live register and thousands of vacancies in CE schemes.  We cannot just make people go onto CE schemes.  That is not the way we work.  People have to apply for CE jobs and they can only do that if that is what they want to do.  We are certainly not in the business of making people apply for work experience if that is not what they want to do.  We are in the business of recognising that no one-size service is going to fit everybody's needs.</p><p>Over the coming weeks and months, we will develop and design a range of services that will be sufficient to provide a level of service support, activation, encouragement, mentoring, training and everything else that is required to help people who are out of work in the short, medium or long-term.  This will ensure they have a State service they will fit into nicely and be able to work with at the various stages of unemployment to get them back into long-term, sustainable and supported employment.</p><p> Deputy Brady stated that we had removed people from educational courses and training schemes and placed them on JobPath.  That is categorically not true.  People in training, on an educational scheme or doing a course in college do not appear on the live register.  The only people we send to JobPath are those who have been on the live register and have been under-employed or unemployed for more than 12 months.</p><p> The Deputy commented that we should beef up the numbers being sent to LES and JobPath.  The outcomes, expertise and excellent service we achieve are possible because the ratio of clients to case management teams in the local employment services and job clubs is below the best practice maximum.  According to international best practice, the ratio should be not more than 120 clients to one service case officer.  At the moment, the ratio is probably around 100 in all of our contracted services, including Intreo.  We have the capacity to scale up the number by about 20.  I have no doubt that when we start offering services to people with a disability who are not on the live register and those in jobless households who are registered as qualified adults as opposed to being on the live register, we will have more than enough people to increase the average ratio from 100:1 to 120:1.  If the Deputy is suggesting I should overload the local employment schemes by raising the ratio to 200:1, they would be overwhelmed and unable to offer the level of service they have been able to offer in recent years.  We have a capacity of 800 case managers and we need each and every one of them.  We have no intention of diminishing the services, particularly at a stage in the country's cycle when we are about to try to expand the range of people to whom we offer those services.</p></speech>

I also understand, as will anybody who has sat on the Government benches, that the Attorney General's advice may not be shared.  The Minister hit on a point that is very accurate and true, which does not only apply in the areas in which she is involved but applies everywhere.  The very nature and type of tender that one seeks influences the outcomes.  As she designs the process, I hope the Minister will be in a position to keep the committee informed of her thinking and progress on the matter.  The open tender is not the issue.  It is how the tender is structured that will determine the outcome.  I ask that this committee have some input, oversight and view of that process as it develops.  That would be useful.</p></speech>

I appreciate she may not have started consideration of the tender but there are serious concerns about the matter.  I also questioned the Minister using the payment-by-result model.  On the EU guidelines, I acknowledge the Minister's point that she cannot share the information given by the Attorney General.  The Attorney General gave the go-ahead for the SICAP tenders.  The EU guidelines, which I quoted earlier, provide that services of general interest expressly include services provided directly to the person such as social assistance services, employment and training services.  These services are specifically mentioned in the list of services of general interest.  I firmly believe we can address this without having to place the services out to tender.  I am not going to give up on the matter.</p></speech>

I will answer his specific question on the payment-by-result model.  The model has its own merits but it is only one model.  Based on the range of people we need to serve, we need many models.  I do not know how many times I have to say this before the Deputy will acknowledge our bona fides in what we are trying to do.  I am not trying to send everybody to JobPath.  There are some people the service does not suit.  There are some whom we have not even reached yet and it will not be beneficial to send them to JobPath until we send them to other levels of supports and services.  If the Deputy fears that all services will be disbanded in the morning leaving JobPath as the only remaining service, he has nothing to worry about.  JobPath is a very successful model but it is only one of the models we use.  We have extremely successful other services that we continue to work with, which are full of experience, expertise, advice and empathy.  There are many different models that are working exceptionally well.  We need to tweak some of them for this generation, enhance others and move to multi-annual contracts to ensure people do not worry about whether they will get their money next year or the year after that.  What we are trying to do is improve the range of models and services that we are offering, not undermine, threaten or give anybody the willies.  We are trying to improve the level of services offered by the State, while recognising the complete level of requirement and changing requirements the people we serve have today.  That is all we are trying to do.  There is nothing to be scared of.</p></speech>

We have already made a case in respect of services of general interest.  One of the issues was outcomes, specifically educational outcomes.  The Minister outlined how it may take people five or six years to move through a service.  Let us say there is a two-year or three-year contract.  Is the Minister considering what the outcomes will be?  If somebody moves through a local employment service and then starts a three-year degree, that will not translate into employment within the period of a particular contract.  However, it must be recognised as an outcome.  That is what I was saying about the measurement of outcomes.  There is a long-term goal but, as the Minister has acknowledged, sometimes people are very distant or have an ambition to travel a great distance.</p></speech>

This should be recognised and it would be very useful for the committee to have an input.</p> <p>  Just transition and multi-annual contracts are very important but they must be flexible and able to respond, for example, to the collapse of an industry caused by Brexit, climate change or whatever.  Does the Minister know what I mean?  New contracts will be needed.  There have been sectoral crises and in some areas large numbers of persons may be in danger of becoming unemployed.  I emphasise the point I raised earlier about people who are at risk of becoming unemployed, whether as a result of Brexit or climate change.</p></speech>

We do not currently model the service on outcomes, but I think we should.  When I refer to outcomes, I do not mean that there should be a target of getting jobs for a certain number of people.  I envisage that the wraparound services on offer from our local employment services in the future will be far more holistic about getting people on the road to recovery, as opposed to getting them a job.  Outcomes can and should be measured in a variety of ways.  That is something we can potentially look at in the very near future.  At the moment, we do not really do outcomes with our local employment services or community employment schemes.  We do not intend to put people under pressure by giving them outcome targets.  We want to make sure we can see people moving and progressing through a range of services that are on offer.  Maybe they will move from education into employment, or from upskilling and confidence-building into education.  We want to see a progression over the range of services.  I would be very keen to move to an outcome level without putting any fear factor in that.</p></speech>
