He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.</p><p>We have received apologies from Deputies Deering and Kelly.  Are the minutes of 28 March agreed and can they be published? Agreed.  Nothing specific arises that will not come up in the course of our discussions on our work programme.</p><p> The first items of correspondence are Nos. 2081A and 2085A, which comprise the opening statement from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, and a briefing note from Ms Catherine Smith, corporate secretariat, for today's meeting.  We note and publish that.</p><p> The next items are from Accounting Officers or Ministers following on from previous meetings of this committee.  We held over No. 2073B from Dr. Deirdre Keyes, chief executive of Kildare-Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, at our meeting last week.  The documentation is dated 21 March and provides a response to information requested by the committee, including notes on independent valuations, meetings of the board held in hotels, leasing of property by the ETB which it previously owned, and details of a rent-free period for the Bray civic centre.  Dr. Keyes also refers to a review of all of the ETB's leases and the difficulties it has faced so far in collating that documentation.  We noted and published the item the previous day and agreed that we might hold it over to allow people to consider it further.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B00900"><p>We will discuss it the next day, and it is up to us to decide whether we have further questions to ask.  We have noted and published it, but we need to discuss it.  We will make a point of discussing it and make sure, when the documentation is going out, that members are aware that it will be up for discussion the next day.</p><p>The next item is No. 2078B from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, dated 29 March, providing a breakdown of outstanding lottery grant cases for the year ending 2018, as requested by the committee.  Ms Browne states that the correct terminology is &quot;outstanding files&quot; as opposed to outstanding cases.  We are being corrected on our terminology.  There were 174 files outstanding at the end of 2018.  We will note and publish that.  When the Office of the Chief State Solicitor appeared before the committee we asked a question about the number of files it had on voluntary organisations which had made applications for national lottery funds, and were all experiencing some delay.  Ms Browne has outlined the details on that.  There are quite a few still outstanding.  Some of the cases have been dealt with from the Chief State Solicitor's point of view, but third-party solicitors have not yet provided confirmation.  The documentation is there.</p><p>The next item is No. 2080B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, providing information requested by the committee concerning Courts Service statistics.  It appears that neither the Department nor the Courts Service are able to provide the number of non-legally aided persons appearing before the courts.  We will note and publish this.  We had been given details on legal aid cases and we had asked if, as the total number of cases is known, whether we could work out how many non-legally aided cases there were.  The Department has said that it cannot do that.  The letter says:</p><blockquote>Legal Aid certs granted can refer to a single offence or a category of offences.  A defendant appearing before the courts could be granted a number of Legal Aid Certs for offences in the one case or could have a number of Legal Aid Certs referring to different cases before the courts.</blockquote> <p>That is not corrected.  The letter goes on to say:</p><blockquote>As indicated previously, legal aid is granted by the courts in the majority of indictable offences dealt with in the Circuit, Central and Special Criminal Courts.  The Courts Service advises that this would refer to at least 95% of these cases.</blockquote> <p>In the District Court it advises that approximately 70% of defendants get free legal aid and says that the main reason for that is that cases dealt with there include minor road traffic offences such as speeding, tax certificates or national car test, NCT, certificates not being displayed.  That is as much information as the Department has.  We will note and publish that.</p><p>The next category is category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.  There are three items, being Nos. 1872C, 1876C and 1886C, which we will discuss in private session.  They relate to the University of Limerick.  We will have a short private session before we sit in public session with our witnesses.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 2072C from an individual, dated 25 March.  The individual raises a number of matters around the governance of KWETB and its failure to respond to questions raised.  The correspondence also raises questions about evidence given by witnesses from KWETB to this committee.  Do members want to discuss this?  We could get the permission of the person who wrote to us to forward the correspondence to the Department where the matters relating to the KWETB are being examined and seek to have a response put before the committee.  I propose writing to the chair of KWETB for a collated response to the specific matters in the evidence referred to by the correspondent.  Do members want to do that or will we hold it over for consideration with other KWETB correspondence?</p></speech>

Some of the legitimate points raised are issues for the board of KWETB.  Some of them refer to failure at the Department of Education and Skills.  Did we forward something to that Department on foot of the KWETB problems?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B01500"><p>We have not done that recently.  We had done it previously.  Do the Deputies suggest that we go through the points and divide them into matters relevant to the Department and those relevant to the internal workings of KWETB?  We will not follow up at this stage.  It is highly complicated and many issues will arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#B01600"><p>We cannot do the work of the board.  That is not our function.  We have to separate these things out.  Perhaps we could go back to the individual and point out the things that are properly within the remit of the board and then strip out the other things.  We might then be able to see the wood for the trees.</p></speech>

I do not know whether this person is writing to us in desperation.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy that we cannot do the work of the board-----</p></speech>

I have had a look at it.  Some items refer to the audit committee and other items ask why board meetings were not held to discuss particular matters before the KWETB's appearance here.  That is a matter for the board, not for this committee.  I will put on the record that we invite Accounting Officers or chairpersons of boards here every week.  It is not a requirement for those organisations that they have a board meeting before they appear here to instruct or suggest to the Accounting Officer or the chairman of the board how he or she should conduct himself or herself before this committee.  We would not be happy if that was the case, because it could be interpreted in all sorts of ways.  I do not necessarily agree that there should have been a board meeting specifically to discuss appearances before this committee.  The Accounting Officer is paid to report here and not to discuss his or her evidence with the board.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have any observations?</p></speech>

Challenges arose from the 2015 audit of KWETB and they have created considerable difficulties for the current chief executive and the board, as well as the Department.  There are questions about the adequacies of the governance systems and the points being raised here speak to the difficulties and challenges.  There are lessons to be learned but the question is what those lessons are.</p></speech>

It is serious when somebody has taken the trouble to write to us.  I do not wish to give the impression that we do not want to deal with it.  That is not correct at all.  We have given it a lot of time and we will give it more time.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said there were issues arising that gave cause for concern to his office, to the Department and to us.  The response has been a discussion, the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and a direction with conditions and a time limit.

I will not get into any of the specifics because people will understand what we are discussing.  The person who has written to us questions why legal advice was withheld from the board, why two audit committee chairs have departed since September 2018, who the parties were to leases on which KWETB entered into agreements, the schedule of meetings between the board and the Department, whether complaints were being dealt with appropriately within the KWETB, if there were appropriate safeguards against abuse of the appointments system in the KWETB, and inaccurate or misleading statements at the recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts which the KWETB attended.  There are also concerns because the clock is running down, with the board's term of office is due to end with the local elections very shortly.  Out of all those, only one is specifically directed to the Committee of Public Accounts.  All the others are very much internal matters and relate to how the board operates.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills had a watching brief after the 2012 report.  What emerged was a quite dysfunctional board and there is now a Garda inquiry into it.  A full independent report has been done so it is not a minor deal.  If the Department is going to have a watching brief or if it has issued a circular, we have to be sure it takes it seriously.</p></speech>

The State Claims Agency came before the committee and indicated that it had taken over dealing with all the section 38 organisations.  It received approximately &euro;4 billion in State funding for its activities and it is welcome that this has all been centralised under the State Claims Agency.  Local authorities were also here and I asked them if they had discussions about doing the same for local authorities, which also get approximately &euro;4 billion.  There are a lot of claims but there is no visibility or transparency as to how they were being dealt with, while there is at least some of that with the State Claims Agency.</p><p>Arising from that, Ms Dorothea Dowling, whose name is on the public record, wrote to the committee to compliment us, inquire about the matter and explain that she had been on the case and that it was due to be heard by the High Court.  We both have independently expressed a keen interest in the issue.  When we receive the ruling, we will consider it as part of our next interim report when we are dealing with the State Claims Agency, although I think we have to finalise our work in that regard.</p></speech>

The individual has provided a correction.  The briefing last week stated the individual was not granted a place on the roster and has taken an appeal to the High Court, but the correspondence states this is not correct.  The individual has stated the Department had made a number of complaints about him to the Information Commissioner in the High Court but that he was appealing it.  He stated that taking the High Court judgment to the Court of Appeal has caused him great personal cost.  I am happy to put the correction on the record, although I do not believe that it changes our decision that the selection process for the election roster is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.

We did not have the impression the latter set of employees was being addressed.  We need an update.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is accounts and statements received since the last meeting, and four slides will be shown on the screen.  The first concerns Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which has a clear audit opinion.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland has a clear audit opinion but the issue of superannuation entitlements is mentioned, as it is in accounts throughout the health sector.  The Law Reform Commission 2017 has a clear audit opinion.  Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, has a clear audit opinion and recognises a deferred pension funding asset.  Will Mr. McCarthy explain that?</p></speech>

The OSI is in a trading position, that is, it is selling product.  It recognises a deferred pension funding asset, where if its trading does not generate enough resources to pay pensions, the State will meet the liability in future.</p></speech>

Our target is for the end of this month.  I reiterate what the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment stated because the people did not fully grasp it . There was a debate in the D&aacute;il last week with the Minister on the issue, where he stated the Department was dealing with one tender and that he would bring a proposal to the Government in the near future.  That was picked up by the public and many people interpreted it as suggesting there would be a decision on the contracts.  The Secretary General, however, made it clear at the committee last week that the only proposal that would be made to the Government in the near future would be to appoint Brendan McCourt, or not, as the preferred bidder.  When the preferred bidder status is given, the Government remains under no contractual obligation.  It is not a contract for rural broadband.  It gives the Government certainty in order that it can then negotiate its infrastructural agreements with Eir and other bodies.  It now has some certainty to finalise the detailed costs.</p> <p>  When that is all put together, after whatever period of time, the Government can consider signing a contract, or otherwise.  There have been cases in the past where preferred bidders have been approved by the Cabinet, circumstances change, and ultimately the contract is never signed at a loss and cost to the preferred bidder because there are no contractual obligations.  The proposal to the Government is not to sign the national broadband plan contract but rather only to appoint the preferred bidder.  While it is a significant step along the way, it is not the entire process.  I am sure people understood that from the debate that emanated from the D&aacute;il last week, but the debate on the issue at the committee's meeting was more specific.  I am putting it on the record because the Deputy has raised the issue, and it might clarify the matter for the public.  Our target is the end of this month, which is only a few weeks away. </p></speech>

The latter is a non-sitting week.  We could meet then if we have prepared a draft report and members want to come to Dublin to discuss it.  However, members might not want to travel during a non-sitting week.  I am not recommending that, I am just making the point.  We will come back to that matter.</p> <p>  On 9 May, we will deal with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on overtime is relevant to that.  On 16 May we will resume dealing with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board's financial statements.  We expect to have considered the PwC report in advance of that meeting.  We will meet the Courts Service on 23 May and on 30 May we will meet with representatives of the Department of Finance to deal with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General on EU transactions.  We will meet with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 13 June.  These are provisional arrangements.  The following week, the annual report of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will be published.  That will deal with an awful lot of issues on behalf of the State.  The HSE financial statements should be available in advance of 26 June.  We will try to deal with those before we go break for the summer.  After that, we have a scheduled meeting with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  We want to do that before the break as well.  That body's annual report will be out around the end of June.  It is just as well to have sight of its annual report before meeting with its representatives.  I thought we might have done it earlier, but the annual report will be out at the end of June.  The Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will be at that meeting.</p> <p>  These are provisional items.  We can come back and address others.  That is an approximate programme which is subject to change.

We are joined by Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General; Ms Oonagh McPhillips, deputy secretary general; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, assistant secretary; Mr. Michael Kirrane, assistant secretary; Ms Carol Baxter, assistant secretary; Mr. Mark Wilson, principal officer; and Mr. Seamus Clifford, principal officer; and by Ms Anne Marie Treacy, assistant principal from the Department of Justice and Equality, and Mr. John Burke, principal officer from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones should be switched off or switched to airplane mode because merely putting them on silent mode can interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions under Standing Orders to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will first hear an opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.132" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#H00500"><p>Vote 24 for the Department of Justice and Equality provides funding for a broad range of services and activities undertaken directly by the Department of Justice and Equality or funded by the Department through the provision of grants.  This includes the Irish Probation Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Reception and Integration Agency, the State pathology service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  An overview of the main funded services and agencies is given in a summary diagram which I have attached to this opening statement.</p> <p>  The policy and oversight remit of the Department has changed somewhat since the beginning of 2017.  This is reflected in the appropriation account.  Responsibility for the Charities Regulatory Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  In accordance with standard Government accounting procedures, the voted expenditure related to the authority for all of 2017 is reflected in the appropriation account of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Votes of the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2018.</p> <p>  The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of almost &euro;423 million in the year, spread across five spending programmes.  I have indicated those in the figure that is now on the screen.  The programmes are organised in line with statements of strategic objectives.  Note 3 of the appropriation account provides a breakdown of the programme spending under subheads that indicate the instruments used by the Department to achieve those objectives.  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid of the Vote totalled just over &euro;66 million in 2017.  Almost three quarters of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification and visa issuance.  The net expenditure on the Vote was approximately &euro;22 million less than was provided for in the 2017 Estimate.</p> <p>  In my report on the appropriation account, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with EU and national procurement rules in respect of contracts operated by the Department in 2017.  Further detail in this regard is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#H00700"><p>The Department's Vote is one of six Votes which currently makes up the justice Vote group.  The justice and equality Vote, which we are examining today, accounts for 18% of gross expenditure in the overall Vote group; the Garda Vote accounts for 64% of gross expenditure; prisons and courts are 13% and 5% of gross expenditure, respectively, with the remaining Votes for the Policing Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission accounting for less than 1%.  However, our focus today is on Vote 24, the justice and equality Vote.</p> <p>  The Department's Vote covers a wide remit, encompassing both the administrative divisions of the Department and a broad range of offices and agencies across the justice sector.  In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads reflected across five expenditure programmes which are set out in the briefing material and which support the Department&rsquo;s overall vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  The remit of the Department is broad and diverse and includes subheads relating to commissions and special inquiries, civil and criminal legal aid, immigration and asylum accommodation, the Probation Service, equality, integration and disability, and a range of other services, including offices and agencies such as the Data Protection Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, forensic science and State pathology laboratories, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and so forth.</p> <p>  As there is no specific chapter relating to the justice and equality Vote in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017, I propose to focus briefly on a few areas within the Vote where there has been developments in the last couple of years.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that the Department is undergoing a major transformation programme at present.</p><p>This arises from the Government's acceptance of the final report of the effectiveness and renewal group, ERG, in June 2018, following significant political and public debate.  This programme aims to develop a future operating model that embraces the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, which enhances organisational agility and responsiveness and places the Department of Justice and Equality at the forefront of developments in the Irish Civil Service.</p><p> I am pleased to say that significant progress is being made.  The Department has now been realigned under two executive pillars each headed up by a deputy secretary, with Ms Oonagh Buckley heading up the civil justice and equality pillar and Ms Oonagh McPhillips, who is with me today, heading up the criminal justice pillar.  The two executive pillars will be supported by a central corporate pillar.  A new corporate governance structure reflecting this realignment came into operation from January 2019.  The second phase involves the Department designing and implementing a new operating model and organisational structure in the two executive pillars based on five core functions, namely, policy, operations, transparency, governance and legislation.  </p><p> The transformation programme is being overseen by a programme board chaired by myself and including the Secretary General to the Government, the Secretary General of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Vote assistant secretary for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will ensure that the programme is conducted in accordance with good governance principles, that it is delivered on time, within budget and that the design solutions are appropriate.  In addition, the ERG continues to provide its input and produces quarterly progress reports, which are published on the Department website.  </p><p> The Department has completed the high-level design of the new operating model and structure and has now moved to detailed design.  The programme is due for completion by early October this year.  Funding for this programme has been provided in the justice and equality Vote in 2019.   </p><p> There is also a very significant policing reform programme ongoing in relation to the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  The Department is facilitating and supporting this programme including the provision of funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist with certain work under the programme.   </p><p> I would also like to mention the Data Protection Commission, DPC, which has received significant additional funding in recent years to build the organisation's capacity and capability in preparation for the DPC's enhanced regulatory powers and more prominent international role under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  These increased resources have facilitated the recruitment of additional staff, including legal, technical, audit and investigations specialists, as well as policy and administrative staff.  The budget allocation of the organisation increased from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;7.2 million in 2017 and has increased further to &euro;15.2 million in 2019.  This resource level will enable the DPC to continue to build the organisation's knowledge and capability in the performance of its expanded statutory role as an EU-wide regulator and lead supervisory authority for the large multinational technology companies, many of which have their European headquarters in Ireland.  </p><p> Committee members will be well aware of the pressures in our accommodation system for asylum seekers.  The Department is currently managing a total of 6,497 international protection applicants, including 5,980 residing in our accommodation centres with a further 517 applicants in emergency hotel accommodation.  At the end of 2016, the Department was accommodating 4,425.  However, by the end of 2017, the number had risen to 5,096 persons, an increase of 15%, and, at the end of 2018, there were 6,106 persons in accommodation.  The increasing numbers to be accommodated is a significant part of the challenge facing the asylum system.  A process to support residents moving into mainstream housing is being finalised through the establishment of a dedicated unit working with centre managers, NGOs, and local authorities.  </p><p> Another expanding area in the Department is the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, which has grown considerably in scale and scope since it was established in 2005.  INIS now comprises approximately one third of all staff in the Department of Justice and Equality, processing over 250,000 applications a year.  The role of INIS has expanded over recent years to include areas such as border management at Dublin Airport, immigration registrations in the Dublin metropolitan area and the newly-established Irish passenger information unit.  INIS has put a service improvement plan in place for the period 2018 to 2020 which, while ambitious in scope, is also realistic.  The actions can be delivered within the timeframes set out and a strong programme board has been established to make sure that is the case.  Some early reforms have included the introduction of plain language in all INIS application forms, the launch of INIS Online, a new customer portal that will allow all applications and payments to be submitted online by the end of March 2020, and the establishment of a change management unit within INIS to drive innovation and best practice in project and change management.  </p><p> It is clear to all of us working in the Department that the demands we face in the immigration area are likely to continue to grow over the coming years.  Meeting those demands requires that we seek to deliver our services in different ways, and to increase our efficiency, while also improving customer experiences.  These objectives are entirely compatible with the overall departmental transformation programme.  </p><p> The year under examination, 2017, was of course an important year in the development of a strategic approach to equality.  Four major equality strategies were launched that year: the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the national disability inclusion strategy and the migrant integration strategy.  These represent a whole-of-Government approach to addressing the needs of diverse groups and to ensuring their equal participation in Irish society.  Each strategy was developed and is being implemented with the involvement of the groups that each is designed to serve.  This was also the year in which the Irish State formally recognised Travellers as an ethnic minority.  This landmark recognition is a key step forward in fostering a society which respects and celebrates diverse identities.  In that context, my Department is currently developing a national LGBTI strategy, which will be published later this year.  </p><p> I note that Brexit has been a significant area of work since the UK referendum and this remains the case.  The Department of Justice and Equality shares this agenda with all other Departments and is working within the highly co-ordinated whole-of-Government structures led by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions that members have.</p></speech>

I also thank the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for his briefing documents because they are very helpful.  I also offer congratulations to the Department on a clear audit except in relation to procurement, which I will come to.</p> <p>  My attention was caught by the list of positive strategies that Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned and the news that the Department is about to establish another one for gay, lesbian and transexual people.  There are four major equality strategies and they are wonderful on paper.  How are those implemented in different Departments and in budgetary considerations?  Are there practical measures for the proofing of decisions taken by Government?</p></speech>

I agree that it is important.</p> <p>  There is a very strong follow-up process for the strategies I mentioned.  The purpose of the strategies is to drive a whole-of-Government approach to create a situation wherein there are a large number of actions under each of these strategies.</p></speech>

Regular progress reports are compiled.</p></speech>

Each of the actions is itself related to the equality objective.  There is a whole set of actions under the Traveller strategy for each Department.  Our role and the role of the Minister of State is to make sure that each of those bodies is doing what it should.  That is built into their work programmes, strategy statements and so on.  In that sense, it is equality proofed.</p></speech>

It is internal within the Department, which is going through a transformation which I will not have time to go into today, and it is perhaps for the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality to address anyway.  There were serious problems with the Department and that is why it is going through a transformation and why we have had many reports such as the Toland report.  I will leave that aside.  The Magdalen scheme is being administered under the Department.  What has been learned with regard to administering the scheme effectively for people who are very vulnerable?  What appeal process is there so that they do not resort to us in desperation, telling us that they have not been answered?  That is not entirely fair to Mr. O'Driscoll because I have not given him all the details, but that is what I have been told.</p></speech>

I respect the confidentiality of the Deputy's communications, but if there is a case that she wants to draw our attention to, I would be happy to look at it.  With regard to the applications that have been received, nine have been paid and two offers are outstanding.  Ten have been deemed not eligible.  There has been back-and-forth with the applicants to deem some to be eligible and others not.  In other cases, additional information is required and that is covered by the data-sharing agreement.  We hope with that in place that we can move quickly to payments.</p></speech>

I am looking at a different part of Mr. O'Driscoll's report, on the cost of tribunals, which he has kindly outlined to us.  We are now at almost &euro;70 million for the Morris tribunal.  There is a long list of them.  In that context, we are talking about a tiny amount of money.  I will not dwell on it but I would like a note from Mr. O'Driscoll on how long the process takes from when somebody applies.  What appeal has been put in place?  Is it external to the Department?  What external people are on it?  We have been through it with Caranua and I would not like people to go through what the applicants to Caranua went through.  We should learn.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll referred to asylum figures in his statement and gave us the up-to-date figure.  Does that include the relocation and resettlement applicants?  Mr. O'Driscoll has given a total figure of 5,980, with 517 in emergency hotel accommodation.  That is a figure of 6,497.</p></speech>

There are 729 children who have status and should not be in direct provision.  Let us return to chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which deals with procurement and management of contracts for direct provision.

It was a question of getting value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was highlighting that it was not going to procurement for private providers but that the Department was going through a process of inviting expressions of interest and so on before negotiating an agreement.  He pointed out clearly in that chapter that the conditions or criteria necessary for the negotiated procedure were not in place.  However, the Department proceeded with the negotiated procedure in any event and took issue with the Comptroller and Auditor General at the time.  I believe those recommendations were made in 2015.  What has changed since then?  Has the Department changed its negotiated procedure?</p></speech>

Correct me if I am wrong but there is a process for State-owned centres, where that is contracted.  It is done by procurement and companies or people are brought in to run the services.  Then there is direct provision which is not done by procurement and the Department enters into a negotiated agreement.  That issue was raised back in 2015.

This is an important point.  We are now rolling it out throughout the country.  Obviously, it is a process of change from the old system.</p> <p>  On value for money, we are now in a position to start comparing the results of tendering with those from the original approach of negotiation.  I do not want to draw a firm conclusion on this yet, but a preliminary conclusion is that there is not a huge saving.  It is difficult to judge because we are constantly raising the standards that we require.  The standards under the new tender system are higher than they would have been under the old negotiated system.</p></speech>

I was not in the Department then, but in fairness to it, when one looks at this objectively, the Department was trying to cope with those increased numbers.  It was certainly conscious of the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusions and did move and has moved to a tender basis now.  In that tender basis, it has also moved to the requirement for higher standards within the centres.</p></speech>

These are mainly things related to forensic science, in fact, and ICT, which is a normal issue with those kinds of contracts.  Two were specialist but they were very small and only amounted to &euro;74,000 so they are not a significant factor here.  The main other element was 22 contract extensions.  That amounted to &euro;4.3 million.  My understanding is that these arose for a variety of reasons.  One was legal delays in respect of putting contracts in place.  Another was delays in putting in place the Government cloud arrangement in particular and some delays in putting in place Office of Government Procurement, OGP, frameworks.  As the OGP frameworks have rolled out, most Departments are gradually converting to their use but there was some delay in the roll-out.  The progress in 2018 is significantly due to the availability of contracts under the OGP framework.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions specific to the Vote we are considering this morning so I will be going a little bit off the reservation after my initial questions.  Like Deputy Connolly, I congratulate the Department on a clear audit opinion and offer continued good wishes to the new team at its helm.  I said in private session that I did not have a question relevant to the immigration side but I do have one.  I am totally in favour of us playing our global part in terms of the acceptance and welcome of refugees.  They are very welcome.  In terms of their placement, I am conscious that there has been procurement of locations in Moville, County Donegal and in Roosky, County Roscommon, to prepare for this.  It seems logical that larger towns and cities might be better placed to seamlessly integrate and welcome different nationalities.  Is demographic analysis done to inform decisions to place a large number of refugees in a small location like Roosky or a relatively small location like Moville, as opposed to the likes of Letterkenny, Roscommon, Sligo, Athlone or Dublin?  Again I emphasise that they are very welcome.</p></speech>

The tenders we are doing at the moment, as I said earlier, are done on a regional basis.  We run a tender for a segment of the country, for example for two or three counties.  We then have to see who comes forward in those counties with an offer.</p></speech>

That methodology is flawed and probably feeds what can sometimes be accused of being racism, although I do not believe it to be racism, where smaller locations are anticipating that a former hotel or other large building might contribute to their recovery in terms of tourism in the future.  We need to prioritise where the people we are welcoming are going, for them to have the maximum ease while at the same time not upsetting the demographic balance of a particular small location.</p><p>I know the witnesses do not have an answer today but perhaps they could take it on board.</p><p> I want to divert to other matters.  I know the clerk will be concerned about this but it is in the interests of using our time most efficiently.  Neither the witnesses nor the committee is in a position to have the delegation before us as regularly as all of us might like.  I will put some points on record with respect to the Irish Prison Service.  Following our meeting on 17 January, I was accused on the public airwaves by the Prison Officers Association, POA, of seeking to shut down the mess committees.  I am also informed that briefings are being held by the POA in prisons throughout the country, with members being told not to communicate with Deputies and that I in particular was seeking to shut down mess committees.  It is totally incorrect to say there was any move to shut down facilities available to hard-working prison officers for hot meals and I would be to the fore in opposing same.  That is not to confuse my wish for the appropriate procedures to be in place.  I thought it peculiar that the Prison Officers Association would take to the national airwaves or provide a briefing in this way when in the same meeting I was highlighting issues of critical importance, such as sexual harassment, career blocking and illegal surveillance of that association's members.  Nevertheless, it is what the association chose to do.  I am on the side of the ordinary prison officer but, in line with our constitutional responsibility in here, I am also on the side of appropriate procedures and protection for staff and so on.</p><p> As a result of the meeting of 17 January relating to the prison service and subsequent research, I am concerned there may be a parallel investigative, judicial and enforcement system in operation across and within individual prisons when it comes to alleged wrongdoing by prison staff.  Therefore I have a number of questions for the Secretary General, although I fully appreciate that he does not have the Irish Prison Service team with him today.  I accept fully that he may not be in a position to answer questions and if he is not, we can move on and perhaps he can revert to us, preferably in writing.  When will the report of the preliminary investigation carried out by the Inspector of Prisons arising from section 31(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 be published?</p></speech>

The Minister is required to lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas and publish it.  It will follow very quickly from that.

It will be some time between now and October then.  From the committee's perspective, the sooner the better in that regard.  In Mr. O'Driscoll's response to issues raised at our meeting of 17 January, he confirmed with regard to surveillance the use of firms for approximately &euro;18,000 in one case and &euro;10,500 in another.  He went on to state "It is not possible from the information available to determine if these payments relate to the surveillance of prison staff."  He further states that he had sent the invoices to the Inspector of Prisons, and I presume that is to assist with her investigation.  Why would he not have asked the surveillance companies in question to inform the answer to us and why would he not have contacted the head of operations of the Irish Prison Service, who is the line authority for the approval of such expenditure?</p></speech>

The Inspector of Prisons was asked by the Minister to undertake the process of writing a report and it is now under consideration by the Attorney General and Department staff.  It will go to the Minister shortly and that process must play out.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is saying these matters may have direct relevance to her report so he cannot answer.  Okay.  At a previous meeting, between the Department's last appearance before the committee, I alluded to the fact that documentation arrived anonymously to me at Leinster House some weeks ago.  I said I would seek legal advice on same and I have.  The contents of this documentation are a matter of major concern for me.  I do not want the clerk to panic at this stage and nobody is going to be named here.  I do want to make a point, however, and I have taken legal advice on what I am about to say.</p> <p>  These appear to be a list of profiles of people who may have been and may still be serving prison officers or contractors.  It includes what I would describe as personal detailed information and allegations of wrongdoing.  The documentation gives detailed accounts of movements of a person or persons in areas outside a prison environment with dates, times, addresses and vehicle registration numbers.  The providence of this information, according to these documents, if genuine, would implicate the operational support group of the Prison Service in surveillance and intelligence gathering outside the prison environment.  As a result of the nature and content of these documents, which are here, I will today forward a copy to each of the Garda Commissioner and the Data Protection Commissioner as the relevant authorities.  Naturally, this is a matter of major concern to me, as I assume it is to the Secretary General.</p> <p>  The Chairman should stop me whenever my time is up as I want to come in for a second round.  Is the Department or the Irish Prison Service, to the witness's knowledge, aware of an instance of a Prison Service employee with responsibility for stores in any of our prisons whom it is alleged has sold prison stores items on the Internet?  Can he confirm whether this person was simply allowed to resign as opposed to being subjected to the appropriate Garda investigation, prosecution, penalties and loss recovery to the State?  If the Department is not aware of such an instance, will Mr. O'Driscoll make all the necessary inquiries?</p></speech>

All of these issues have financial implications for the State.  That is why I am using this opportunity to put them on record.  I would be grateful if the Garda took an interest in the transcript of today's meeting.  I would say the same of the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is why I am asking whether the Department will make the necessary inquiries.  I do not want to take an adversarial position with the Secretary General on this matter, but prudence demands that these matters be examined.  They are reasonable questions.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is free to do what he chooses, but I know what I will do as Chairman.</p> <p>  We will move on.  Deputy Catherine Murphy has had to leave for a moment.

There are 5,980 people in accommodation centres and 517 in hotels, totalling 6,497.  I believe Mr. O'Driscoll stated that these figures had probably increased.  The growth figures outlined in his opening statement are significant.  He stated that Ireland had committed to receiving 4,000 persons under the refugee protection programme.  How many are anticipated in 2019?</p></speech>

In principle, it is possible that all of them could arrive in 2019.  Realistically, some of them will spill into 2020.</p></speech>

In that context, has the Department identified through its engagements properties that would allow it to take that amount of people this year?</p></speech>

We are under pressure on all fronts.  The refugee programme may pose less of a problem in the sense that we can at least anticipate who is arriving and when.  It is done through refugee programmes with a variety of UN and other bodies.  We will know that, for example, 40 people are arriving and what their family configurations are.  We can ensure that appropriate housing is available.  That is quite different from the asylum seeker situation where someone just turns up at Dublin Airport or the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, office on Burgh Quay.  We have no forewarning, but the person has to be housed that night.  They are different challenges.  I am not saying that the refugee programme is easy to manage, as it is not, but it does not pose the same challenges in terms of immediacy of response that the asylum seeker situation does.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Driscoll spoke about the communication process with local authorities and working with them.  He also mentioned the pressures in the Department's accommodation system, which was putting it mildly.  In terms of the challenges that the Department experiences from place to place, does it work with local authorities regarding expressions of interest from properties, their suitability and the potential sensitivities in order to avoid the types of incident that have occurred previously?</p></speech>

We have heard in the case of these sections of the community - I only say sections because it is not reflective of all of the community - things being cited such as medical, education and childcare issues as reasons for non-suitability.  Let us say there is engagement with the CEO in Roscommon, the director of housing in that area or the local government management association nationwide and that they say yes, that they do fit into the suitability criteria and that the Department is able to come out, front and centre, before the protests happen in the first instance.  I am interested in hearing about that matter.</p></speech>

We see the challenge the Department is facing.  Mr. Wilson said using hotel accommodation was a short-term solution.  That was in September and already the numbers are growing.  Owing to the challenges being faced by the Department, my fear is that it will become a long-term solution.  From January to March, the cost was &euro;3.4 million.  As the Secretary General rightly said, there is a housing crisis.  In identifying suitable accommodation will the hotel aspect become like the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme when suddenly the cost will spiral out of control?  We have the perfect storm with the housing crisis being compounded by the challenges facing the Department in identifying suitable properties such that hotels are becoming a solution when people present.  Only God knows to what the cost could rise by the end of the year.  In meeting the challenges encountered by the Department on a daily basis I am afraid that using hotel accommodation has become an option.  Is my assessment correct?  What is the Department's long-term strategy to nip the problem in the bud to prevent using hotel accommodation from becoming a crutch in the way the HAP scheme has in dealing with the housing crisis?</p></speech>

We do not want to provide emergency accommodation in hotels.  We do not want to be involved in that business.  It is not what we want to do.  I hope the regional tender processes in seeking accommodation solutions will result in increased capacity to deal with the increased numbers we are facing.</p> <p>  In answering Deputy Connolly I did say - I also made the point in my opening remarks - that we had to be open to considering other solutions which would be completely different.  They include engagement with NGOs, housing associations and so on on what accommodation they might be able to offer.</p> <p>  We have another problem.  The number in hotel accommodation is over 500, while the number with status in our system is over 700.  Based on simple mathematics, if we were able to move more people with status into normal housing, we would not be involved in the hotel business.</p></speech>

I am going to drill down into the detail that.  This revolves around what we interpret in terms of whether people should be able to have washing and cooking facilities or the security of a front door in their own area as opposed to a central area.  We raised these issues during previous meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will raise it again.  I come from Meath.  The matter has been covered extensively by local media there and so forth.  When the centre opened, what was the initial estimate regarding the length of time it would remain in operation?  What lease was agreed with Mr. McCluskey?  What is the policy for it as a centre in terms of the model of long-term accommodation?</p></speech>

According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the cost to the State of hiring that facility up to December 2016 was &euro;101 million to the State.  One provider has received &euro;101 million in State funding for one centre housing 600 people.  I think I am within my rights to ask about that particular centre.  That is my view.  Perhaps the Chairman will indicate whether it is fair to do pursue this matter?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the facilities at Mosney.  I am completely new to this so I am casting a fresh eye on it.  I only joined the Department six months ago.  I visited Mosney.  The facilities there for families are not the kind of facilities that we would want people living in long-term.  I will come back to that point.</p></speech>

I am saying that previously when we discussed the matter here that was not done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#Q01800"><p>Significant refurbishment was done and the facilities were very good, it seemed to me, especially around education and health, the fact that people have individual doors and can do their own cooking.  We have moved to a situation whereby already more than 50% of people in accommodation centres can do their own cooking.  We are trying to move to a point where everyone will be in that position.  This has, rightly, been a sensitive issue.  People want to have that independence of action.</p> <p>  I am keen to make one point though.  What is acceptable for accommodation for someone for a short time is different to what is acceptable for someone for accommodation for a long period.  Numerous issues intersect here.  One relates to standards in the facilities.  As has already been pointed out, they are being substantially enhanced.  Under the new tender arrangements, the standards are higher again.  All involve cooking facilities and so on.</p> <p>  The second point relates to the question the speed with which applications are processed.  We go through the International Protection Office, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and so on.  We are also trying to address that.  In other words, we are trying to get faster movement through the system so that people do not end up staying in the facilities for a long time.  There has been significant improvement in this in recent years, but there is a great deal more to be done.  We want to get to a point where people spend a relatively short time &ndash; I am referring to periods of months rather than years &ndash; in these facilities while they are waiting for a first decision and perhaps appeal to the tribunal.  The next step beyond that is where people choose to take judicial review.  That is more difficult to predict.  We certainly want a situation whereby people are not in these facilities long-term.  I am simply making the point that a facility that one would consider acceptable for a short-term period is different from a facility that we would want people to be in long term.</p></speech>

As stated, I accept that there had been refurbishment at the facility.  It was fair to make the point that this took place after significant media coverage in respect of the conditions there.  I accept what has been done but I have raised the point previously at this committee that there had been what would be considered subhuman conditions there.  The Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, had previously raised the question of the points system that exists for the purchase of food for families and babies and the cost of baby food as well as what families need to raise children.  That had been previously raised by the Ombudsman.  That is not a political charge; it was raised by the Ombudsman.  I take the view these are fair points to make given the amount of money being spent by the State in the hiring of this centre.</p> <p>  A total of 729-----</p></speech>

Mosney is unusual in that it is both an accommodation centre for asylum seekers &ndash; what is known as a direct provision centre &ndash; and also an emergency reception and orientation centre, EROC, a place where we put refugees for the initial period of adjustment.  When they arrive first, they go to a centre and then they move on within a period of months to permanent housing.  Mosney has both.  Maybe that is what the note is referring to.</p></speech>

From my understanding of the figures presented to the committee by the Department, not one of the centres meets this criterion.  In fact, some centres are operating at 100% capacity.  The lowest capacity I could find is in the HSE southern area at 94%.</p></speech>

It must be remembered that capacity is one matter in terms of number of beds.  It is not that simple, however, because families arrive with particular configurations and have to be accommodated.  Getting to 100% capacity is quite difficult in a centre.  As we expand the number of centres under the tender, hopefully, we can reduce this pressure somewhat.  That it is the objective of the exercise.</p></speech>

The target is to be operating at 90% capacity but it is currently at 97%.  Will the new centres that will be brought on-stream bring down this figure or will it remain in excess of 90%?</p></speech>

I return to my earlier point, however.  We have to respond to the number of people who turn up and claim asylum.  We do not have an accurate way of predicting this.  The flows tend to change over time.  The objective is to get down to a position where we have spare capacity.  That is what one needs to cope with unpredictable demand.</p></speech>

We use it for management purposes.  We track it, which is sensible for the reasons suggested by the Deputy.  At the same time, we have to balance that against the fact that we have to respond to what comes in on a tender.  We try to balance these two factors as best we can.  Regarding the long-term housing of those who achieve status, an allocation system which reflects population densities and so forth is being developed with the CCMA.</p> <p>  The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the long-term housing of people is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.

It is my understanding that the first step in that process is to actually forward the complaint to the agency or private company which is running the centre?  Will the Department accept that this is not an ideal process because many people would be reluctant to forward any complaints about a centre to the people actually running it?</p></speech>

It is open to the resident to go directly to the Ombudsman should they so wish.  The Ombudsman visits most centres and did so in 2018.  He found that most of the issues being brought to his attention were able to be resolved locally with the local manager at the point in time when he visited the centre.  As to whether there is a culture whereby it is difficult for residents to complain, it was referred to in the last Ombudsman&rsquo;s report.  However, it was qualified by stating there was no evidence available to him to confirm that concern.</p></speech>

In other words, 14% of the population of children living in direct provision centres would have had referrals to the Child and Family Agency, which was significantly higher than the percentage for those not within direct provision centres.

We reviewed our child protection policy after the Children First Act 2015.  The managers of a centre have become the mandated persons for the purposes of making referrals to the Child and Family Agency.  We have provided training to those managers and a practice document in support of that.  Effectively, the centre manager, as the mandated person, makes the referral to the Child and Family Agency.</p></speech>

With regard to the types of referrals and whether they would reach the threshold for an initial assessment to be done, in direct provision centres the figure stands at 85% and outside direct provision centres it stands at 50%.  In my opinion, from reading the information we have, there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  What steps are being taken to try to address this?</p></speech>

Many of them have come through quite traumatic experiences and we are very conscious of that.  This would obviously apply to the children as much as to the adults, and they may have experienced any number of challenges in their young lives.  For that reason, we have a specific child protection policy for accommodation centres.  Child safeguarding statements are published, and so on, and accommodation centres which have children provide a whole series of facilities for them.  Of course, there is direct engagement with the HSE and Tusla around children's services.  The higher level of referrals is something we should be very concerned about but it may also reflect, to some extent, proactivity in dealing with the challenges that we know people in our centres have, which is very important.  This applies to adults but it particularly applies, in the context of the Deputy's question, to children.</p></speech>

It is because I had to leave the room to attend another meeting.</p> <p>  I want to refer to page 3 of the opening statement in regard to data protection.  Many multinational companies have their European headquarters in Ireland and they are particularly in the area where data and data protection is a very prominent issue.  We are essentially the European regulator, not just the Irish regulator.  Is there work going on in regard to scoping out that obligation, given it is a big obligation?  Are there any indicative costs associated with that?</p></speech>

The Office of the Data Protection Commission became the Data Protection Commission, DPC, under the new Act, and there is a subtle difference.  In the transition from one to the other, detailed work was done on what were the responsibilities that would fall on the Data Protection Commission in Ireland in the context of the new GDPR.  That was done and there was very rapid expansion in funding for the DPC which, as I indicated in my opening statement, went from &euro;1.9 million in 2014 to &euro;19.5 million in 2019.  One would be hard put to find any other agency that has had a scale of increase in funding of that sort.  That has mainly been around providing additional people with specific skills for the DPC because of the role the Deputy has just mentioned.</p> <p>  We are very conscious, first, that the DPC has a role in regard to advising all companies and proactively dealing with complaints and so on, and it received some 4,000 complaints in 2018, if I remember correctly.  In regard to activities in Ireland, these are the normal DPC functions that one would expect.  However, we are also very conscious, obviously, and the DPC is very conscious, of its responsibilities in the context of these companies being headquartered here.  The Deputy was right to say the DPC has to take a lead role in the EU and is seen as the lead in the EU in that data protection regulation role.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the communications committee was told it would not be able to release a report into the public services card until it got the go-ahead from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is the lead Department in that regard.

However, that does not specifically relate to the fixed charge notice issue which was simply overtaken by events and it was decided, therefore, not to proceed with that particular issue.  However, we have provided the additional resources to allow it to undertake the investigations which it must.  I do not wish to hog the time, but it may be relevant to state that, of course, the commission now comes under the reform of policing proposed in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland and there will, therefore, be further developments on that front.</p></speech>

I do not wish to repeat myself, but prisons is a separate Vote.  I am the Accounting Officer for it.  There is a separate Vote for the Garda and for which the Garda Commissioner is Accounting Officer.  Some of the issues raised by the Deputy would be more appropriately raised when discussing the Garda Vote with the Commissioner or in the context of the prisons Vote.   On many of these issues, I am happy to take questions regarding other Votes but I will have to reply in writing to those questions.</p></speech>

On page 16, it is noted that the estimate for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was &euro;7.5 million but the outturn was &euro;6.1 million.  That primarily relates to payroll expenditure.  What is the reason for that underspend?</p></speech>

We made provision for the full planned expansion within the year but, obviously, recruitment takes time, particularly in the case of the highly skilled staff required by the commissioner.  Quite simply, the recruitment did not reach the level envisaged when the Vote was formed.  As I stated, there has been a very significant increase in the staffing level of that office.  There was a 33% increase in staffing in 2016, 57% in 2017 and 47% in 2018.  It is an unparalleled increase in staffing numbers and it is not particularly surprising that the process took a little longer than was envisaged when we were preparing the estimate.</p></speech>

On whether there is sufficient capacity, one very important area that is an expanding responsibility of the Probation Service is the management of community service.  There is a process of recruiting community service supervisors.  Community service is expanding and, as I understand it, is proving to be extremely effective.  However, it has not expanded at the anticipated rate.  I expect it to expand further as various issues are ironed out and I will not be surprised if the Probation Service needs additional staff in that respect.  I hope that the director of the Probation Service does not take that as an absolute commitment from his Accounting Officer.  I am just pointing it out to the committee as an area where we are expanding and the Probation Service is doing this job.</p></speech>

I do not have the specific figures in front of me but I understand that there is a panel in place.  I take the Deputy's broader point and agree with her 100%.  This is exactly the direction of travel we want to take.  If one looks at the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, it is highly relevant.  It takes a much more holistic view of policing and managing vulnerable people who become involved in crime and so on.  The direction of travel is to divert people, in particular young people, away from prison and so on and into these more social work type services where they can hopefully be helped to develop a fulfilling life away from crime.</p></speech>

I will start with direct provision and asylum seekers, albeit a lot of the questions have been asked already.  There are just some issues I wanted to have clarified.  There are a lot of myths around asylum seekers as I am sure the witnesses are aware.  What exactly is direct provision in the sense of what it entitles a person to?  What is directly provided for and what is the weekly subsistence rate a person in a direct provision centre gets?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-04a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019040400002#U01700"><p>The most important point to make about direct provision is that approximately 75% of people who seek asylum end up in direct provision.  It is possible for people to turn it down.  It is an offer, not a requirement.  Approximately 25% of people choose not to take up the offer and they live with family, friends or whatever it is.  The figures on that have varied over the years as I understand it.  In fact, the figures for people who chose not to go into direct provision were significantly higher some years ago and have been lower in other years.  That is a very important point about direct provision.  In that sense, it is voluntary.  It is voluntary, recognising, however, that people very often turn up with nothing.  They have to take what they can get in that context, I suppose.  The rate of payment is handled by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It has been increased from &euro;21.60 per adult to &euro;38.80 per adult per week and from &euro;15.60 per child to &euro;29.80 per child.  This is in the context of the direct provision arrangement, which provides for housing, full board, basic medical requirements and so on.  Every asylum seeker in direct provision has a medical card, which is also covered in the normal way.  Of course, they also have access to education facilities.  The payment has to be understood in that context.  It is from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

There are individual freedoms a person does not have because he or she is in a centre.  We have the figures on how long people are in these centres and I will get to those in a second.  Obviously, there is a direct correlation between the asylum process and the length of time it takes to process claims and how long people stay in the system.  The Department is responsible for the asylum applications process.  What work has been done recently or what changes have been made in recent years to speed up the asylum process and ensure applications can be processed more quickly so that people are less dependent on direct provision, one way or another?  If asylum is granted, the person is a refugee who can work and enjoy those freedoms they do not have in direct provision centres.  What changes have been made in recent years to speed up the process and what is the average wait time for someone who applies to have an adjudication on his or her application?</p></speech>

Mr. Kirrane will outline some of that in a moment.  I would like to pick up on one of the Deputy's points.  It is important to say that people in the accommodation centres have full rights.  They are not confined there.  They are not detained there.  They come and go and everything else.  Of course we assume everybody would prefer to move onto normal housing.</p></speech>

When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality and RIA were before the committee two years ago - Mr. O'Driscoll's predecessor was here - I put it on the record that what Mr. O'Driscoll has described has not been my experience across the board.  I have had experience of having to visit reception centres in the past.  Things have changed, thankfully.  They are private entities which are run privately.  Some of them have different rules.  When I was a member of Waterford City and County Council a number of years ago, I was invited by the residents to visit one of these centres.  When I turned up, I was refused entry.  I was asked to seek an appointment.  When I sought an appointment, it was refused to me by management.</p></speech>

A number of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, were invited in to assist and support people who were living in these centres.  As Mr. O'Driscoll has spoken about rights, I should mention that people have a right to vote in local elections.  I was refused permission to canvass even though everyone has a right to canvass Mr. O'Driscoll or anybody else in this room or elsewhere.  The people living in this centre were not allowed to be canvassed.  On the basis of being refused permission to canvass, I subsequently wrote to the residents.  The letters I sent to each of them were posted directly to the reception centre.  Those letters were opened and put in the bin by the manager of the centre.  To me, that does not suggest that their rights are the same as those of anybody else.  Although things have changed since then, I do not believe the individual freedoms associated with living in one's own home, whether it is through social housing or private housing, are afforded to people who live in reception centres.  I do not accept that all the freedoms enjoyed by Mr. O'Driscoll and me are being enjoyed at this point in time by people in direct provision centres.  Notwithstanding the change that has allowed some people to work, there are still some people who are not allowed to work.  People cannot work up to nine months.  Mr. O'Driscoll has to accept that there are freedoms which are denied.  I am not saying that things have not changed.  I accept fully that they have.  I am conscious of the positive changes that have happened.  I still hold the view that the rights enjoyed by these people are not the same as the rights that Mr. O'Driscoll or I might enjoy.</p></speech>

I was speaking in the present tense.  We are very conscious that in the past, a number of Deputies raised the issue of being able to canvass people, meet residents and so on.  I think a lot of progress has been made on that.  If there are any issues that arise from time to time, I ask people to notify us in order that we can sort them out.  People make mistakes.  My understanding now is that people have the right to canvass.  In fairness, I have been in a few centres.  In one centre I visited, I could not see that there should be any problem in canvassers accessing the place in a perfectly normal way.  In another centre, it was more difficult to say exactly which space was the private communal space, to which one would not realistically expect canvassers to have access, and which space was the public space.  Distinguishing those things is not always absolutely crystal clear.  As I have said, people can make mistakes.</p> <p>  I will explain what I think about all of those things and why I reacted to what the Deputy said.  I was not reacting to the Deputy's comment, in particular.  From time to time, there is public comment which grossly exaggerates the constraints under which people operate.  I accept that they are operating under constraints.  The Deputy is quite right to say they do not have the right to work for the first nine months.  That is a right enjoyed by the Deputy and me.  That is absolutely true.  In many cases, these people are coming from difficult circumstances and are probably finding it difficult to navigate our services as they access them for the first time.  We try to assist them in that.  They have rights in that space which we try to vindicate.  The broader point I wanted to make was a simple one.  I want to make it clear that people have freedoms here and that some of the commentary out there is a bit unfair.</p></speech>

It is a fair point for Mr. O'Driscoll to make as Accounting Officer.  I have no difficulty with that.  I agree that positive changes have been made.  I have seen them on the ground in my constituency of Waterford.  I fully accept that.  I think we have a long way to go as well.  I ask Mr. Kirrane to come back in on the changes that have been made with the asylum process and the application process.</p></speech>

There was an initial period in which a transitional arrangement under the Act required a lot of cases to come back under that Act.  That created some problems initially.  Approximately 3,500 cases had to be dealt with before new cases could start to be dealt with under the Act.  That created a difficulty which has not substantially been dealt with.  The average processing time moved out as a result and is approximately 19.7 months at present.</p></speech>

To put that into perspective, we have received precisely that number of new applications since 1 January.  We are catching up rapidly.  We have expanded the staff in this area to deal with the caseload.  There are approximately 144 staff in the International Protection Office, along with 70 legal panel members who hear cases.

I was here years ago, when the numbers were much higher, and the same thing was said verbatim.  We were told that the numbers were dropping and the service was getting there.  We have been here before.  Five years ago, I heard Ministers saying verbatim what Mr. Kirrane has just said.  I would like the committee to be given a longer-term perspective that is not confined to where we are today.  We would like to see how it has moved.

Approximately 10.5% of people in reception centres have been there for between four and seven years.  This is quite a high figure.  If it is the case that the asylum processes are getting faster - if applications are being processed more quickly - why is it the case that one in ten people is waiting for so long?  Does the 10.5% figure relate to individuals or families?  Regardless of whether it is individuals or families, one in ten-----</p></speech>

I understand that in some cases, there may be judicial reviews or there may be other issues.  Are the cases of long-term residents of direct provision centres the subject of ongoing examination to see what can be done and what the position is with such cases?  Is an assessment made of whether we are waiting for information from them, or they need to take the next step?  What interventions are made by the Department or by RIA to look at helping and assisting the applications to be processed more quickly in order that people do not end up waiting for between four and seven years, or longer?</p></speech>

We are hitting difficulties in finding ways to move them into normal housing but we are trying to engage with NGOs and local authorities in that respect.

It is absolutely not where we want to be but in an emergency situation we are not going to leave people homeless so we have to put them somewhere.

We are doing tenders throughout the country at the present time.  We are doing it on a regional basis to provide new accommodation centres for the level of demand we are experiencing but, as we discussed earlier in regard to the asylum side as distinct from the refugee side, we find it very difficult to predict the number of people who will turn up and seek accommodation.  People turn up at Dublin Airport, Burgh Quay or elsewhere and we have to accommodate them that night.  It is not something we can plan for.  It is quite different in the refugee programme, where we have a sense of who is coming-----</p></speech>

My next question might amuse him, but I am looking at page 16 of the accounts.  It refers to a figure of &euro;433,000 for the Irish Film Classification Office.  What relevance does it now have?  We can turn on our television and social media devices.  Does the office have any relevance in modern society?  It probably did years ago when the only time one could see a film was when one went to the cinema, but has life passed the organisation by?  There is another organisation mentioned, the Classification of Films Appeal Board.  Does it do much or what does it do?  I see that it did not spend its money because there was a reduction in screen hire costs during the year under review.  There was an underspend of &euro;190,000 under the heading of screen rental.  Does it have to rent screens to watch films?  How many years is it in existence?</p></speech>

As the back of it there are about three pages listing different organisations, some of which are statutory, while some are regulatory, appellant bodies and non-statutory.  Can Mr. O'Driscoll give us a summary note on each of them?  Some of them crop up in different schedules.  Is there a formal service level agreement, as I call it, in place for each of the organisations to which the Department grants money?  Presumably, there is.</p></speech>

I want him to get the figure from the HSE and give me a comparison between the two where somebody participating in the fair deal scheme goes into a nursing home.  The person's nursing home accommodation, food and light bills are paid.  He or she would not necessarily have the same transport or education requirements.  People in a nursing home do not automatically receive a medical card as it is deemed that they are generally being taken care of.  They are allowed to keep 15% of their social welfare payment as spending money, or approximately &euro;30.  It appears that there is inequality, given that all living costs are covered in the centres, compared with how we treat elderly persons in nursing homes.

We have international obligations to asylum seekers.  We have had the Mahon report, an Ombudsman's report and so on; therefore, the changes have been wrought from the system.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. O'Driscoll's openness and honesty and the straightness of all of his companions.  It is very helpful.  I would not like to send a message that the system is overwhelmed.  I looked back at the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter and noted that in 2015 there were 4,696 people in the system.  Today there are 6,106.  I do not believe these are overwhelming figures.  One has to take out the 700-plus people with status.  Really there has not been a massive jump.  What has happened is that there is a housing crisis and alternatives were never considered.  Repeatedly, before this committee, in terms of achieving value for money, alternatives were never considered.  To touch on what the Chairman said, there is a belief those concerned are lucky to get what they get.  I appreciate the witnesses' openness and honesty and I am returning it.  I would not like the aforesaid message to be sent.</p> <p>  I have a couple of quick questions.  Mr. Justice Murray produced a report at some stage.  I remember reading it and did not bring it with me.  There were references in it to serious issues related to a directive and data privacy.  What happened as a result of it?  The EU directive was no longer valid and had been withdrawn.  If the witnesses do not know the answer, I do not mind.  I remember reading the report and being shocked at the findings of Mr. Justice Murray.  Legislation was to be enacted, but I do not believe it ever was.</p> <p>  The more specific question is about the integration fund, which is a very positive fund.  When I read the annual report or one of the reports, I note that it is stated there is &euro;50 million in the fund.  I refer to the asylum, migration and integration fund which is mentioned on page 22.  There are credits, which is extraordinary.  There is an estimated provision of &euro;1.5 million and the outturn was lower.  These are just the specifics.  Am I wrong that the moneys are coming from a fund of &euro;50 million over a period to help in achieving integration?</p></speech>

Of the &euro;52 million, &euro;30 million is received by way of a grant per person resettled or relocated.  Regarding the discussion we had on relocation and resettlement in connection with the IRPP, the refugee programme, the money kicks into that process.  Some &euro;22.6 million is committed to various activities set out in our national programme for the AMIF which is agreed with the European Commission.

When people come into our offices &ndash; this is a general rather than a parochial point &ndash; we note that there is a delay.

An example is where somebody from India is recruited by a recruitment firm and told that her husband or partner can join her.  What is the backlog?  Why the delay?

At the meeting on 17 January, a number of instances of sexual harassment that have occurred was raised.  The letter from the Department of 7 February, following the meeting, stated that nine instances emerged between a one, a three and a five, according to the way they were presented.  Can the Department or the Irish Prison Service, IPS, advise if every instance, either intra-staff or those highlighted through a P19, the form which is used to register a complaint against a prisoner and lodged by a prison nurse, prison nurse officer or agency nurse working within a prison, has been acted upon with an appropriate investigation and follow-up?  I am anticipating the answer I will get but if the answer is "No", would the Department be prepared, in the interests of women working within the Prison Service and female contractors, to consider carrying out a confidential survey among female staff to inquire into these matters?</p></speech>

I am geared up to deal with the justice and equality Vote and not the prisons Vote, but if the Deputy sends us, or gives us, his list of questions, we will endeavour to answer them as best we can.  I propose to do so in writing with the advice of the Prison Service.</p> <p>  On the last occasion we were before the committee on the prisons Vote, the Deputy raised a large number of significant allegations.  We provided to the committee very detailed responses to those.</p></speech>

Are the Department or Irish Prison Service management in Longford aware of allegations that PMDS exists in name only within prisons, with scoring being picked at random and often subjectively determined by the relevant governor, rather than informed by the proper processes laid down when it was introduced and with ongoing monitoring by assistant chiefs and chiefs with regular reports, as Mr. O'Driscoll has outlined the process?</p><p>I ask that the Department make the necessary inquiries into that.</p><p> I made a few comments to clarify my position on the mess committees, as opposed to the POA's view of my position, at the beginning of the meeting.  In the Secretary General's response of 7 February you said that voluntary mess committees "operate as independent ... entities from the Irish Prison Service".  I note from an email I have seen that the director general of the committee communicated to all governors on 28 January and used the same sentence.  How this can be?  We established that there was a lengthy industrial relations process that led to their establishment and that staff costs and the prison gratuity were covered by central funds or the Prison Service itself.  If they are independent, as the Irish Prison Service and the Secretary General asserted, and not under the control of the Irish Prison Service, would this not constitute a breach of rules 30 and 31 of the Prison Rules of 2007 regarding the employment of prisoners?</p></speech>

It is also alleged to me that in excess of &euro;2 million has been spent on mess facilities over the past number of years from the capital budget of the Prison Service directly.  The IPS has contracted a private company, Cater Care of Limerick, to audit the mess facilities for environmental health purposes.  The audit reports are made to the Irish Prison Service and HSE environmental health officers also carry out inspections of the mess facilities and report to the Irish Prison Service.  The governor of each prison is an <i>ex officio</i>member of each mess committee.  How, therefore, can we consider them to be independent?</p></speech>

I will get to the content of the other meeting in a moment or two.  The question on the mess committee stands and I hope Mr. O'Driscoll will get back to us on it.</p> <p>  The email that I referred to, which was sent to governors on 28 January, stated that mess committee staff were advised to engage professional financial advice regarding the tax status of committees and the financial books that were to be kept.  On the question of independence, it seems to be a Pontius Pilate move in that we seem to be taking control of an awful lot of things in terms of expenditure, light, heat and various other things.  I am totally for the appropriate availability of food, meals and everything in the Prison Service but governors are on the committee so I do not see the level of independence or any separation.  The line suggests the Prison Service is oblivious to tax status and the financial books.</p> <p>  In Mr. O'Driscoll's response to me, which he said was very detailed, he sent a list of balances when we had asked for audited accounts.  He pointed out that the balances may not all be profit but he did not answer the question of who audits or when it is audited and we are still oblivious to that.  He did, however, send us the procedure but nobody doubts that procedures are in place for how cash could be managed.  I respectfully suggest that it is the Department which has not tested some of the issues I brought up at the last meeting.  The Department has taken people's word for things but that may not be enough.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to note that as well.</p> <p>  The email goes on to ask governors if they are aware of any misuse of Prison Service materials.  We would love to think everybody was above reproach but these questions are arising.  I am not saying governors are involved but they could be and we do not know.  If there are practices that are wrong, what do we expect governors to say other than that there is nothing to see here?  Would the Department consider asking the Comptroller and Auditor General, or an appropriate arms-length body such as the Department's own internal audit unit, which the procedure states can do spot checks, to carry out a forensic audit of all mess committees going back to their establishment, including interviews with all relevant personnel?  I would prefer the Comptroller and Auditor General to do it.  Mr. O'Driscoll said he is not answering and I understand why but I ask him to take it on board.</p> <p>  Is the Department or is the Irish Prison Service aware of an alleged amount, in the region of &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, being taken from the tuck shop or tuck shop account in a Dublin prison to fund a trip for a group to a sporting-related event in the United States between 2010 and 2013?  It is a serious allegation which has come up umpteen times.  Given the existence of such allegations, would the Department ask the Comptroller and Auditor General or another appropriate arms-length body to carry out a forensic audit of all tuck shops over the past ten years, including holding interviews with all relevant personnel?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll mentioned vehicles.</p></speech>

I mentioned vehicles at the last meeting, and in his reply on 7 February, Mr. O'Driscoll indicated that all vehicles are accounted for and that all assets have been verified by local management as being on-site.  What if certain members of local management endorsed the absence, loan or alternative use of prison assets?  We are taking people at their word.  That is fine.  Please God, all of these people are people of the highest integrity.  However, ringing someone to ask whether he or she was speeding on a road and accepting his or her answer does not amount to an investigation.  It seems to me that there is a crisis of confidence among hard-working prison staff at all levels about being able to call out wrongdoing in the culture that currently exists.  What are we doing about it?  Why, if there is a robust system in place, are people coming forward in other ways to other people in various forums, including to Members of the Oireachtas and members of various committees, this one included?  Is all the information coming up in research vexatious, fantasies concocted by disgruntled staff with an axe to grind, or are some or all of these matters true?  Are we prepared to check?  Surely prudence demands that all matters are independently investigated.</p> <p>  I put it to Mr. O'Driscoll that, contrary to his claims against me, he has not tested the information I have put to him but, rather, has simply asked a question and accepted an answer, assuming therefore that an answer to my question was correct instead of carrying out an independent investigation in the interests of the taxpayer and of the health and safety and well-being and a healthy working environment and culture for prison staff?  Is the Department of Justice and Equality open to the recommendation I am making now, that is, the establishment of a GSOC-style inspectorate, separate from the Irish Prison Service headquarters in Longford, with statutory powers to provide prison staff with the support and protection they require, and the confidence to which they are entitled?  They should be above reproach and unable to be infected by any culture that may exist among a small number of staff at various levels.  The Department is only aware of information provided by headquarters in Longford, and is dependent on that information.  It appears from my research that the Longford headquarters is only aware of and only as good as the information provided to it by individual prisons.  It seems that some or all individual prisons operate as islands on a number of issues.  My research has led me to question the existence of a parallel investigative judicial and enforcement system across our prison services.  I hope those questions will be noted and answered.</p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Chairman could provide for me, in writing, the Standing Order which allows for the validity or worth of my utterances to be adjudicated upon by other members of the committee.  I look forward to receiving that, and information on the Act that determines that.  I have been very careful.  I have taken legal advice and chosen my words very carefully today.  I have not identified anyone and I have focused on processes and procedures that are absolutely relevant to the expenditure of the State and Department of Justice and Equality.  I question the Chairman's competence to tell the Secretary General that he does not have to answer my questions and can, in effect, disregard the questions that I, in trying to use my time efficiently, have put to him.  I accepted this morning, in advance of this meeting, that he could answer the questions after this meeting in consultation with the experts involved in the Prison Service.  I would appreciate a written response to that from the Chairman, and I thank him for staying on.  We are missing votes as a result, but I believe these matters are of the utmost importance, and prudence demands they require investigation and actual testing, rather than the sort of testing we have seen in the past.</p> <p>  I thank all of the witnesses for coming here today, and continue to extend to the Secretary General every good wish in his new role.  I hope he will understand my questioning in the spirit in which it was intended.  I am only interested in protecting the taxpayers and ordinary prison officers in their place of work.</p></speech>

The Deputy has made it very clear that he had questions to put, and that he had made his own investigations and inquiries.  No member of the committee is aware of any of the documentation or research the Deputy has carried out.  I accept his statement that it is his own research.  At committee meetings every week, we agree a set of minutes and we also agree a list of items on which the committee will follow up.  We follow up on those items as a committee rather than having 13 individuals going in 13 different directions.  We operate as a committee rather than as unconnected people.  Everything we do is done by committee.  Anything done otherwise is not the action of this committee.  The questions that have been raised today do not have to be answered until such time as the committee agrees to put those questions to witnesses.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  They were here to listen and note what was said, but the committee has not requested that they respond to any of those matters.  The committee may choose to send the transcript of this meeting and endorse all of the questions that have been put, but that will be considered and decided upon by the committee.  Until that decision is made no request has issued.  There are 13 members who make 13 different types of comments every week.  </p></speech>

I said that several times today.</p></speech>

I have put the questions and they are a matter of public record.  I ask that Mr. O'Driscoll answer them, irrespective of what the Chairman has said.  If he requires the questions in writing or in duplicate, to double the process, or as Parliamentary Questions, he will have them in 24 hours.  However, he could circumvent that process by taking on board what I have asked in the public interest.</p></speech>
