    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500003#B00300"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Imelda Munster.  We will take the normal business of the committee at Thursday's meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2018 includes a chapter on greenhouse gas-related financial transactions.  Ireland has a number of targets related to climate change that it must meet and there are potential financial consequences for not meeting these.  Ireland has not met its targets since 2013 and has spent &euro;121 million purchasing carbon credits to date to comply with these obligations.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment estimates that a further &euro;2 million to &euro;14 million will need to be spent up to 2020 in this regard.</p><p>In its Periodic Report No. 6, this committee addressed the failure of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to reach targets relating to carbon emissions and renewable energy.  Today, we have invited before us representatives from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, to discuss research they have carried out and published relating to carbon taxation and measures taken that have affected carbon emissions.  We have noted this in recent months.  We are not trying to decide policy but rather ascertain whether those already implemented are having a positive effect or otherwise.</p><p>Three research papers have been circulated to members: Fossil Fuels and Similar Subsidies from the CSO; Carbon Taxation in Ireland: Distributional Effects of Revenue Recycling Policies, which is an ESRI special article; and The Economic and Distributional Impacts of an Increased Carbon Tax with Different Revenue Recycling Schemes, an ESRI research paper published in October.  Today's meeting will help inform the committee and we will have a meeting with representatives of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on 19 November, which is in two weeks.  We will meet representatives of the Revenue Commissioners on 28 November and we can raise issues relating to carbon tax collection.</p><p>I welcome our witnesses.  From the CSO there is Mr. Paul Morrin, assistant director general, and Mr. Gerry Brady, senior statistician; and from the ESRI we have Dr. Aykut Mert Yaku and Dr. Miguel Tovar Rea&ntilde;os, research officers.  I thank them for coming before the committee this evening on a voluntary basis to discuss their research.  This is unlike other meetings, when we have Accounting Officers who are obliged to be present.  We wanted the witnesses to assist us in our work such that when we meet the Accounting Officer, we will have a good volume of information.  We are not experts in the area so we thought a meeting with the witnesses would be helpful in informing us in our subsequent meetings.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses, as well as those people in the Gallery, that all mobile phones should be switched off or put in airplane mode.  Merely putting phones in silent mode can still lead to them interfering with the recording system.</p><p>I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  That is a standard warning read at every meeting and it is not specifically directed at today's witnesses.  It is routine.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that they shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee with candour, we should remember to treat witnesses with courtesy.  We have received opening remarks for today's meeting and these can be noted and published.</p></speech>

The first two paragraphs of the opening statement are for the official record.</p>  <p>  We have been invited to discuss the research paper, Fossil Fuel and Similar Subsidies, but this is part of a wider Irish and international context for environmental statistics.  I will briefly describe this context before describing the research paper in some detail.  The United Nations system of environmental economic accounting, SEEA, is a statistical system bringing together economic and environmental information to a common framework to measure the condition of the environment, the contribution of the environment to the economy and the impact of the economy on the environment.  The SEEA contains an internationally agreed set of standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables to produce internationally comparable statistics.</p>  <p>  The statistical office of the European Commission, EUROSTAT, has developed a series of mandatory and voluntary environmental accounts modules based on the SEEA.  The CSO publishes a broad range of statistical releases on the EUROSTAT SEEA modules and other areas of environment statistics.  The releases most relevant to the committee's recent discussions, in addition to the research paper, Fossil Fuel and Similar Subsidies, relate to environmental taxes, environmental subsidies and similar transfers, environmental accounts air emissions and domestic building energy ratings, BERs.</p>  <p>  The following sections provide a brief summary of the research paper and the relevant official environmental releases.  I will first deal with the research paper.</p></speech>

The spread relates to various domains that are not to do with fossil fuels.</p> <p>It includes the agricultural sector and such.  The key issue is that there is an environmental impact.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Morrin" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500004#C00300"><p>Fossil fuels and similar subsidies, which go beyond fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  There is a fair bit of detail in my statement.  I will try to be brief.  Fossil fuel subsidies are a sustainable development goal, SDG, indicator.  The rationale behind the SDG indicator 12.c is to reduce "inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption" by restructuring taxation to reflect environmental impacts.  A UN environment report recommended that data for the SDG indicators should be compiled using a combination of direct transfers, price supports and tax expenditure, which is consistent with the approach followed by the CSO in its research paper.</p>  <p>  Data on direct supports were mainly obtained from Government appropriation accounts, the annual accounts of Government Departments and agencies and through direct requests to a Department or organisation.  Indirect supports are also known as tax expenditures.  A tax expenditure is defined under Irish legislation as a transfer of public resources that is achieved by either reducing obligations with respect to a benchmark tax or provisions of tax legislation that reduce or postpone revenue for a comparatively narrow population of taxpayers relative to the tax base.  Tax expenditures are defined relative to a system of benchmark taxes.  The reduced excise duty on auto diesel is compared with that for petrol.  Data on tax expenditures were obtained from Revenue or estimated using information from Revenue.</p>  <p>  The CSO estimated that the total amount of fossil fuels and similar subsidies in 2016 was &euro;4.1 billion, comprised of &euro;2.5 billion of fossil fuel supports and &euro;1.6 billion of other supports.  The fossil fuel supports comprised &euro;534 million of fossil fuel subsidies and almost &euro;2 billion in indirect fossil fuel supports in 2016.  It is broadly recognised that, aside from the environmental impact, these supports can have important social and economic purposes while being detrimental to the environment.  For example, agricultural subsidies accounted for &euro;1.5 billion of the &euro;4.1 billion total in 2016 but are recognised as important supports for the rural economy.  That is the key category that the Chairman is talking about.</p>  <p>  EUROSTAT is developing a new module on potentially environmentally harmful subsidies.  The new module builds upon work done by the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, the International Energy Agency and the International Monetary Fund.  The work undertaken by the CSO to date in this field of study is a work in progress and, for that reason, it was published as a research paper.  When the methodology for the new EUROSTAT module has been finalised, the CSO will review the approach taken in the research paper to ensure that our methodology is consistent with the EU requirements being developed by EUROSTAT in consultation with member states, including Ireland.</p>  <p>  The legal basis for the environmental taxes statistical release is included in the statement.  Environmental taxes are levied on something that has a proven specific negative impact on the environment.  Examples include the plastic bag levy, the vehicle registration tax and the carbon tax.  Some &euro;235 million was collected under the carbon tax in 2010, which increased to &euro;431 million in 2018.  Total environmental taxes in 2018 were just over &euro;5 billion and constituted 7.1% of the total amount collected under all taxes.</p>  <p>  The carbon tax and carbon credits are both classified as environmental taxes.  The CSO uses various data sources to disaggregate these taxes with the NACE industrial classification, which includes households as an additional sector.  In the period from 2010 to 2018, &euro;33.5 billion was collected from both carbon taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners publish the amount of carbon taxes collected for each fuel.  In 2018, 42% of carbon taxes were collected for road transport diesel and 11% of carbon taxes were for petrol, so road transport accounts for 53% of the total.  Kerosene accounted for a further 14%, marked gas oil for 13%, natural gas for 12% and solid fuels for 6%.</p>  <p>  The environmental subsidies and similar transfers release is compiled in accordance with EUROSTAT methodological guidelines.  The module has not yet been included in the EU regulation.  Environmental subsidies are intended to support activities that protect the environment or reduce the use and extraction of natural resources.  Examples include the capital investment plan for wastewater treatment and the organic farming scheme.  Total environmental subsidies paid in 2017 were &euro;895 million.  Production of energy from renewable resources accounted for 32% of the total paid out.  Wastewater management accounted for 26%, protection of biodiversity accounted for 23% and heat and energy saving subsidies for 9%.</p>  <p>  The legal basis for the environmental accounts air emissions statistical release is provided in the statement.  The CSO obtained the air emissions inventories data from the Environmental Protection Agency and disaggregate them by NACE sector as required by EUROSTAT.  In each of the years from 2007 to 2016, households accounted for between 22% and 24% of total greenhouse gas emissions.  In absolute terms, household emissions decreased from 15.4 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2008 to 12.7 million tonnes in 2014 before increasing to 13.5 million tonnes in 2016.</p>  <p>  The final release that I will describe is the domestic building energy rating statistical release.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland provides the CSO with a file containing the details of all domestic building energy rating audits and the CSO publishes them quarterly.  Around half of the total number of dwellings in the State have had a BER audit but the requirements of the scheme mean that some types of dwellings are under-represented, such as older rural houses that are not being sold or rented.  The BER data show how ratings vary by county, period of construction, type of building and the type of main space heating fuel.  Counties Longford, Offaly, Westmeath, Tipperary, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, and Cavan have the highest proportions of G-rated dwellings, which is the lowest category.  An analysis of the BER ratings for households using peat as their main space fuel shows that 42% had a G rating.  The proportion of G ratings for other solid fuels were lower, at 29% to 38%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miguel Tovar Rea&ntilde;os" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500004#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss our research.  I work for the ESRI in the area of energy and environment.  I am the lead author of the ESRI paper, Carbon taxation in Ireland: distributional effects of revenue recycling policies.  The study was funded by the ESRI&rsquo;s energy policy research centre.  It shows that a well-designed carbon tax and revenue recycling mechanism could reduce emissions and alleviate income inequality.  Consequently, this research finds that environmental and distributional policy goals are not necessarily in conflict if the policy is designed appropriately.  The model does not consider the economy-wide effects that will happen if taxes are changed.  This part of the research is discussed by my colleague, Dr. Mert Yakut.</p>  <p>  When simulating a carbon tax increase of &euro;30 per tonne, we estimate that carbon emissions would fall by 3.9%.  A tax increase of &euro;80 per tonne would yield a 10.2% reduction in emissions.  We use data on household expenditure and income and statistical methods to simulate the mix of products that people would buy once a carbon tax was applied.  For additional taxes of &euro;30 or &euro;80 per tonne, we estimate that on average, each household would pay &euro;2.70 or &euro;6.80 more per week, respectively.  While reducing emissions, an additional carbon tax is found to disproportionately affect low income households.  Poorer households spend a greater proportion of their income on energy, and therefore on carbon tax, than richer households.  This negative distributional effect can be corrected by returning some of the additional revenue to households using a recycling mechanism.  The study shows that if revenues were recycled in a manner that targets poor households, inequality would be reduced.  The study also estimates the distributional effects of allocating the additional revenue equally across households as a carbon cheque would do.  For additional taxes of &euro;30 or &euro;80 per tonne, this mechanism brings a smaller reduction in income inequality than the targeted mechanism.  In addition, a carbon cheque mechanism implies additional administrative costs.</p>  <p>  We use individual level data on household expenditure and income from the Central Statistics Office.  In addition, we use data on commodity prices from the same source.  This study focuses on household consumption behaviour under different scenarios of changes in prices and income.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aykut Mert Yakut" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500004#C00600"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to present our research.  I am a research officer working in the energy and environment modelling group at the ESRI.  My colleagues and I are analysing the economic and environmental impacts of climate change policies.</p> <p>In October 2019 we published a report entitled, The Economic and Distributional Impacts of an Increased Carbon Tax with Different Revenue Recycling Schemes.  The committee has invited me to discuss the results presented in the report.  It examines the distributional impacts of an increased carbon tax with different revenue recycling schemes.  A revenue recycling scheme is a policy option designed to eliminate or at least lessen the negative consequences of a tax increase by using the revenue raised.  The climate action plan proposes that the level of the carbon tax should reach &euro;80 per tonne of CO2emissions in 2030.  In a trajectory of an incrementally increasing carbon tax, the report compares ten revenue recycling scheme options.  The results indicate that total emissions will continue to grow over time owing to economic growth and an increase in population.  The suggested increase in the carbon tax will be helpful to Ireland in reducing its emissions, but it will not be sufficient on its own to meet the country's legally binding targets for non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions in 2030.  The strong economic growth profile of the economy will be marginally affected.  In the case of no recycling of carbon tax revenues, the annual average growth rate of real gross domestic product will drop from 3.3% to 3.288%.  In this case, on the other hand, household income and public fiscal balances deteriorate most among considered revenue recycling schemes.</p> <p> Using carbon tax revenues to reduce other taxes such as sales, wage or corporate taxes can reduce the macroeconomic impacts of a carbon tax increase and lead to increases in household income but they often result in disproportional effects on poorer households.  In other words, an increase in carbon tax has regressive impacts.  Returning carbon tax revenues to households in the form of transfers can, however, significantly reduce the regressive impacts at the expense of poorer macroeconomic performance.  Rural households face higher and regressive increases in consumption prices than urban households.  In urban areas, however, middle income households face the highest price impacts.  Carbon-intensive production sectors such as transport and mining will be hit the hardest by a carbon tax increase.  In contrast, low carbon-intensive sectors such as the accommodation sector can benefit from a carbon tax increase.</p></speech>

I must acknowledge that their opening statements were very brief.  It is a very comprehensive report and some of the findings are very technical.  I got frightened when I saw the mathematical formulae by which some of the figures were calculated.  </p>  <p>  Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cullinane have indicated in that order.  We do not have a set order of speakers.  Members should indicate if they wish to comment.</p></speech>

There has been a carbon tax in Ireland since 2010, but until next year it will have never stood alone.  Instead the revenue raised has been included in central funds.  It has been announced that from next year the revenued raised by way of the increase in the carbon tax, as opposed to the full amount, will be ring-fenced.  Is there any relationship between using carbon tax revenue wholly and demonstrably for climate change purposes and changes in behaviour?  Is there any such information available?  How can channelling the revenue into central funds help to change behaviour, or can it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miguel Tovar Rea&ntilde;os" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500005#D00400"><p>In the empirical literature carbon taxes have been shown to be the most cost-effective way of changing behaviour to reduce the consumption of polluting commodities.  The literature also shows that the use of revenue raised through these taxes should be transparent in order that people will accept their imposition.  These considerations should come together in the implementation of such a policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500005#D00500"><p>Let us suppose that transparency is lacking.  There is a ring-fenced fund of &euro;410 million, but it will be more than &euro;500 million next year.  Is it fair to say that if this revenue was to be used to fund a retrofit scheme or a pay-as-you-save scheme ,it would have a different effect from using it as part of general taxation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miguel Tovar Rea&ntilde;os" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019110500005#D00600"><p>Carbon taxes have been applied in different ways throughout Europe.  For example, in some cases Nordic countries use the revenue for general purposes.  These countries have the highest rates of carbon tax in Europe.  In other countries such as France the revenue raised has been used to subsidise retrofitting schemes and the like, as mentioned by the Deputy.  It really depends on the existing level of inequality in the relevant country and the level of transparency in the setting of the taxes.  In general, our research shows that economic inequality is created if a tax is imposed on commodities such as fuel for transportation or heating and the money raised is not returned to people.  Some households depend more heavily on these fuels, for example, those living in older houses or rural areas.

They cover all aspects of people's lives.  There are supposed to be subdivisions of the goals, but the high level indicators for many of the goals are still being developed, including for fossil fuel subsidies.  The aim is to break them down as much as possible to assess the impact on people's lives.</p></speech>

Is increasing the carbon tax the only way to coerce people to live environmentally friendly lives?  Is increasing taxes all the time to change people's bad fossil fuel habits the only way forward the witnesses can see?  Do they have any alternative way to get people to move from fossil fuels such as diesel, petrol and coal?  Are there other incentives that could be offered besides hitting them with an increase in the carbon tax all the time?  Excise duty is levied on petrol and diesel to keep the country running and we are adding more and more.  How can we compensate the people mentioned by the previous speaker, the marginalised and the poor, who do not earn high wages or are in receipt of social welfare payments?</p> <p>How are we going to compensate them?  Those on a big wage or who have money can afford all these taxes and to live the same kind of lifestyle they have been living because they have extra money, but the people who are caught are the marginalised, who are barely surviving from week to week.  All these taxes will hit them more.  It is getting harder for them to survive.  The Government is saying it will compensate them in a certain way, but I believe that, at the end of the day, they will still lose out.  I have a general question.  Is there any other way of getting people to change their habits besides imposing tax after tax?</p></speech>

If the price of a commodity increases, we expect the consumption of that commodity to decrease.  On other options, transportation may be electrified, for example, and electricity can be produced from more renewable sources.  This is also an option, but there is an investment cost.  People can change their heating system at home, but this also involves a cost for the households or the Government.  Someone must cover the cost.  Increasing carbon tax works in two ways.  It disincentivises the use of fossil fuel related commodities while at the same time collecting revenue to finance investment to change the way of doing business in the country.  Otherwise, a government must find some fund from somewhere else or cut other expenditure to finance all the expenditure in question.  Therefore, there is another political economy issue.</p></speech>

For how long can carbon taxes be raised before the camel&rsquo;s back is broken?  Are we going to continue to raise taxes and leave people behind?  That is all I am trying to get across.  I am wondering whether there are incentives other than taxes to change habits.</p></speech>

We have targets set but we are not reaching them.  We are not even reaching halfway.  I cannot remember exactly what reduction is required by 2030.  Do the witnesses see us reaching the target or getting anywhere near it in the next ten years?  Will we be behind every year and paying a penalty to Europe every year for being in breach?  Will the witnesses give us an idea as to when we will actually catch up regarding our emissions reduction targets?</p></speech>

One could do nothing and pay charges for doing nothing.  At the end of the day, a price has to be paid for the carbon generated in the economy, so if a carbon tax is created, it means there is some revenue that can be used to compensate poor households or invest in renewables or other kinds of green initiatives.  The options are quite clear.  We have to reach the targets.  The instruments that exist are established and clear around the world, including Europe.  Carbon taxation is a policy used throughout the world now.  As far as we can see, those are the options.  We either create policy instruments that can give some extra money or revenue or we just pay the fees, which will be just throwing money into a hole.</p></speech>

I am still involved in agriculture.  I was this morning, anyway.  Agriculture is blamed for 30% of the greenhouse gas emissions but we have a great product here &ndash; a green grass product that is naturally produced.  Forests are being burned in the Amazon at the moment just to create land.  While the policy is probably coming from Europe, we are to import from the South American countries.  First, those countries have to burn off the land and produce grass on it.  We have a natural product here.  There is an emissions cost in South America.  The finished product there &ndash; we are talking about beef &ndash; has to be loaded and brought across the whole Atlantic to Europe.  Where is the common sense?  Where are the policies on all this?  We are able to produce beef here naturally.  I am talking about farming here and keeping our own industry going.  Comparing like with like, what is happening does not make sense to me.  It is a lot of nonsense to say we should cut back on what we are producing, 90% of which we export, while bringing in beef from South America.  What will be the cost to the environment?  Will we have to burn forests to do it?  We will have to drag the product half way across the world on the Atlantic Ocean, presumably on diesel-powered ships.</p>  <p>  With regard to agriculture, we are not getting enough credit.  I am an active farmer.  We have green grass and are getting no credits for the grass we are producing, which is a natural product coming out of the ground.  We are getting no credits for hedgerows.  I bought a new machine two years ago just to trim our hedges and to keep the environment right for biodiversity or wildlife, including birdlife.  We are maintaining the hedgerows, yet we are being penalised for producing 30% of the emissions, or so we are told.  We get no credits for what we are doing.  Should this not be recognised in Europe or among the powers that be?  We should be getting credits for maintaining biodiversity, maintaining our hedges and maintaining our growth, in addition to ensuring road safety and maintaining ditches.  As a farmer, I believe we are getting an unfair deal through the system and in the way the system is being reported and the statistics are being made up.  That is only an opinion.  I will ask about this when I get the opportunity.  Farmers are getting a raw deal.  They are being told their emissions amount to 30% of the greenhouse gases of the whole country, yet they get no credit for maintaining hedgerows and biodiversity in general &ndash; the bees and birds.  It is a job to get answers.</p></speech>

They were asked to look at particular criteria and a particular model.</p>  <p>  Many years ago, in Galway, we aimed to reach 45% recycling and that could only be done over five years.  However, following a six-week pilot project, we achieved 70% recycling through encouragement and education.  People were ahead of the engineers, management and politicians.  A paper was written about it, entitled Incineration: A Burning Issue or a Load of Rubbish?  What I learned from that, and continue to learn, is that people are way ahead of us and want to change.  They just need policies that help them and create the environment where they can change.  I would love to see research on that.  I am just using Galway as a good example where people led the way and recycled against all expert advice.  The effect of it has been written up.</p>  <p>  I am a human being and mother.  There are many other ways to encourage changes in behaviour, rather than a punitive tax, which is regressive, and then having to come up with some imaginative way to undo it.  We are starting from the position that it is a regressive tax, as our guests have acknowledged, and then trying to undo it with a view to changing an element of behaviour.

Their attitude may have been influenced by children in school who are exposed to the green school programme.  We also asked people what most influenced them if they were buying a car and it was the fuel cost.  Only a small proportion identified the environment as their main priority when they were selecting a car.</p></speech>

I can only go on my experience.  We knock on many doors and climate change has been the main issue in the past two elections.  The electorate has been way ahead of the Government and politicians.  The main issues are climate change, health and housing.  People were crying out to be a part of the solution.  I am not taking issue with Mr. Brady's research; I am just saying it is very limited with a particular view, as opposed to having the remit to look at how behaviour changes.  That requires psychologists and representatives from other disciplines.</p></speech>

The people of Galway disagreed.  It has all been undone since because the waste collection has been privatised.  For a number of years, we led the way in the pilot project with 70% recycling and, on an ongoing basis when it was rolled out, 56% of waste was diverted from landfill on a voluntary basis through educational policies.  Of course, the result was that the system was privatised and we went backwards but it is a very good example of behavioural change being by the people.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to have a discussion on this issue and I thank the Chairman for facilitating it.  I will start with the ESRI, which has done some analysis on carbon tax increases.  Deputy Connolly spoke about the fact that carbon taxes are regressive.  If carbon tax is regressive as a starting point, then as I understand it, the ESRI is arguing that either welfare transfers or a tax and dividend model might mitigate the regressive nature of the carbon tax.

Would it not be better if we provided people with alternatives?  For example, if we were making grants available for people to transition from heating their homes with oil or gas, would that not be a better way of using money rather than increasing the carbon tax?  Would providing alternatives not be a better option than increasing carbon tax, whether it is public transport, ensuring that people can transition from using carbon fuels to heat their homes, or making electric cars cheaper, more accessible and more favourable?  Has the ESRI done any analysis of those alternatives and what the outcome would be in terms of reduced emissions?  Rather than focus on carbon tax increases, would we be better to focus on enabling people to change their behaviour?   What analysis has the ESRI done on the enabling part rather than on the tax part?</p></speech>

There are a number of ways in which we can reduce carbon emissions.  One, which I will argue shortly, is through carbon tax increases.  However, if people do not have the alternatives, they just pay whatever the carbon tax increase is, and if they do not change their behaviour, we do not reduce emissions.  Would it be better to do an analysis on what alternatives are necessary to enable people to make a transition?  A carbon tax is designed to change people's behaviour.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It could be argued that, so far, it has not really changed people's behaviour and has been a form of raising revenue, and even the whole discussion around it has been about ring-fencing the money for investment in climate mitigation measures.  If it does not change people's behaviour to the extent we would want it to, would it not be better, from a climate action perspective, to do an analysis on what would happen if we provided people with the opportunity to make real changes, either through grants or other support?  Would it be a better way of reducing our carbon emissions if we enabled people, rather than using the stick of increasing taxes?</p></speech>

We are investigating how much reduction in CO2 emissions one can get by improving the rating of the dwelling.  That research is still ongoing so we do not have results yet, but that will come at some point.  It is also important to highlight that there are many factors that could lead people to retrofit their houses.  To take the case of a person who is renting a dwelling, he is not in a position to ask for grants to retrofit the house because he does not own the house, so this is a kind of market imperfection that exists.  Even for people who own their house, the literature shows there is a lot of resistance to investing.</p></speech>

The witnesses should tell me what an ordinary family will do if their home is heated by oil or gas, they have a petrol or diesel car and they live in a rural area and do not have access to public transport.  What will they do to reduce their carbon footprint, based on a &euro;30 increase, that will see emissions fall nationally by 3.9%?  What specifically will they do?

The ESRI officials are not telling me what an individual is going to do, apart from the possibility that people might turn off electricity.  They may or may not do so.  That is a real assumption because they may be unable to do so.  There are several ways in which people can reduce emissions.  People can change their car - that is one option.  They can use public transport if it is available.  If it is not available, there is not much for them.  They can change the way their homes are heated.  They can get a grant or spend money on deep retrofitting.  What if the majority of families cannot afford a deep retrofit or an electric car and already use public transport?  I am trying to understand what substantial changes they could make.  Any changes would have to be substantial to reach a 3.9% drop.</p>  <p>  That is only for households.  I have not taken into account industry, which produces a great deal of carbon.  Agriculture produces a great deal of carbon too.  There would have to be a significant change in behaviour for the State to see a 3.9% reduction in its carbon footprint.  A carbon tax increase would not have a major impact on industry or agriculture to that degree.  I imagine the majority of the reduction comes from ordinary households.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The plastic bag levy is another example of taxes and levies that work.  They can work where people have an easy alternative they can use.  What about carbon tax increases and what people would have to do to change their behaviour?  If a home is heated through oil or gas, the occupier has to make a substantial change and investment.  If a consumer wants to buy an electric car, it is a substantial investment.  We know the majority of people cannot afford to make those changes.

For instance, beyond 2020 in the air transportation sector, annual allowances will be decreased by 2.2% annually until 2030.</p> <p>As the cost of the EU ETS will increase, the burden of carbon emissions on the sector will be higher in the future, relative to what it is today.  As they are regulated by other markets within the European Union, there are national plans in every EU country.</p></speech>

We are doing ourselves a disservice by focusing too much on carbon taxes and carbon tax increases.  There should be more of a focus on how we can enable people to make a transition.  Deputy Connolly spoke about this aspect.  Most people want to see a transition as they want to be able to make a change.  However, it may not be affordable for them to do so, even if we were to increase the carbon tax.  For many, changing from heating their house with oil or gas to an alternative that would be more energy efficient would involve quite a substantial investment.  It would not be cheap.  The same can be said about changing one's car.  I have also cited the example of those who cannot depend on public transport.  No bus of any description passes through the village in which I live.  The families who live in the village do not have access to a bus service.  To bring their children to school, they either have to walk a long distance, cycle with them for seven or eight miles, or drive.  Most have no choice but to drive.  We need to conduct much more research, not just on the impact of increasing taxes, as I am not convinced by what I have seen.  We do not need to encourage people to make a transition because they are encouraged already.  We must conduct more research on how we can enable them to do it.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Deputy Cullinane said.  </p>  <p>  It was stated the ETS was being managed.  Is it being managed at a European level?  Is that what Mr. Brady meant?  I am going backwards from where I had intended to start.  The big polluters are expected to be managed under the ETS, while everyone else will be subject to a separate metric.  There is unfairness for the real person stranded in a village in County Waterford without a bus service.  He or she will feel a huge sense of unfairness.</p>  <p>  I refer to the ETS model, for which I am not blaming the witnesses, unless it was their idea.  The whole point of it is to reduce carbon emissions, but, technically, one can buy one's way out of it.  Based on my reading of the system, if a company is profitable enough, it can buy its way out, until it is no longer profitable.  All the while, the environment is heating up.  This is an economic response to an environmental problem.  I do not mean to cause offence, but it is a typical accountant solution to a social, environmental and human issue.  The ordinary man in County Waterford will be expected to put on an extra jumper or walk, but someone with a large company with ETS-graded emissions can buy his or her way out.  That is where we are going to fall down when we try to sell it to normal people.  It is similar to what happened when turf-cutting was banned on bogs in the midlands.  While I agree in principle with stopping people from cutting turf because peat is great at trapping carbon, it was very difficult for people to see a power station down the road pumping out peat smoke when they were not allowed to cut turf for domestic use.  People are logical.  They knew that the black smoke from Rhode power station was the same product as that which was coming out of their open fires.  I have a serious moral issue with this set-up because the big guys can get out of it until their profitability narrows to the point where they cannot buy their way out.  I personally do not see that as a solution to climate change.</p>  <p>  Deputy Aylward referred to farmers receiving more credits for the planting of trees and products that trap carbon.  I am not sure what he asked as I came in half way through, but is consideration being given to the carbon trapping potential of hedgerows, wild set-aside land or grassland?  They all trap carbon and are being maintained by farmers who are the custodians of the countryside.  Will they receive money for the grass also, or will it just be for the trees?  If not, why not?  Can anyone answer that question?  Will farmers be given some money for the rest of the green stuff with which they deal which also absorbs carbon dioxide?</p></speech>

Deputy Aylward is probably far more knowledgeable in this area than I am, but it is my understanding the REPS which became the GLAS was a rural environmental scheme which had nothing to do with carbon emissions.  It involved maintaining hedgerows, wildlife and so on.  If money is being given to farmers to benefit from the carbon trapping potential of trees, why is it not being given for the many beautiful fields of green pasture in County Kilkenny which are trapping the carbon we produce every day?  Are we separating the plants that merit a carbon tax?  Who makes that decision?</p></speech>

I am talking specifically about carbon.  Farmers will receive credits to encourage them to plant trees.  It is a carbon credit.  Why are they not receiving them for grassland and hedgerows?  It is the same trick, albeit with different levels or quantities of carbon.  I cannot see why the scheme only applies to one species.</p></speech>

I wonder about this.  I have no vested interest, but I become really concerned when I see such differences.  Who is gaining?  I am not suggesting anyone here is, but why are farmers being encouraged to plant a particular type of tree when so many metres of hedges are doing the same job?  Who makes the decision?  Is it the people who are making money out of the planting of trees?  I am not referring to farmers but to the investment people who are waiting on them to grow.  No one would make a capital return on a hedge in County Kilkenny, but it absorbs carbon, which is what I thought this was all about.</p>  <p>  We export about 90% of our agri-products to other countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and further afield.  Something occurred to me about that, about which I might be wrong.  As I did not know about this meeting, I was under some pressure to prepare for it.  I refer to oil imported from Saudi Arabia.  Oil imported from Saudi Arabia is taxed in Ireland.  In a similar vein, should it not be the eater, rather than the producer, who pays the carbon tax on food?  People in Saudi Arabia drill the oil out of the ground and it is then brought here.</p> <p>I understand that the fumes from the fuel go into the air and the fumes from the production of agricultural products are going the other way.  Who decides on the difference between the two products?  Who thought that was a good idea?  In terms of environmental impact, would it not make sense to charge the lad who wants the expensive steak that costs a great deal to produce?</p></speech>

I am not sure if any of the witnesses are familiar with organic chemistry.  The documents indicate that 72% of our emissions are non-ETS and one third are agriculture.  Is that just the production of food?  Does that include fumes from tractor or does it relate only to livestock?</p></speech>

Cattle produce methane which breaks down.  Methane is given a global warming potential of 25 versus carbon.  I assume all the witnesses are familiar with that.  It means methane is 25 times worse than carbon.  I hope the witnesses, as statisticians, will get this.  Methane breaks down after 12 years but has a 25 times greater warming effect.  That is the concept but it does not take into account that methane breaks down in 12 years.  It is not that it continues to rise and is never broken down.  There is a process of methane breaking down to carbon.  The British Veterinary Association is arguing, as I do, that this variable is wrong.  The report attributes a disproportionate level of emissions to agriculture.  I fully support the expert climate committee.  The report is about culling the heard.  My argument would be that if the herd size is left static - I am not suggesting this should be done - the same amount of methane will be produced and it will break down after 12 years.  However, it has been given a heating rate 25 times higher than carbon in the current calculations.  The British Veterinary Association recently developed an algorithm specifically for livestock which takes into account that methane does not break down to nothing but turns into carbon.  However, it has been given a rating that is 25 times worse than carbon.  Ultimately, it ends up as carbon after 12 years.  If the witnesses are suggesting that the solution to the overheating of the environment is to cull livestock, we will all die of hunger.  Separate from that, farmers produce food in this country to a high standard and we are all privileged to eat it.  Methane is being given a bad name because it is not as warming as it is alleged to be in the document.  The British Veterinary Association questions the current variable and is seeking to have another variable used for livestock.  The CSO witnesses might respond on this question.</p></speech>

I am a representative of people in Ireland.  I note from the document that 28% of our emissions are tradeable, while 72% are not.  We will be disproportionately affected because we have accepted this variable according to which methane is 25 times more warming than carbon.  Methane in its non-broken down form is 25 times more warming than carbon.  Something has to be done because, as a country, we are being unfairly treated owing to the 72%: 28% ratio of non-tradeable and tradeable emissions.  Another issue relates to whoever decided it was a good idea to let the people with the ETS tradeable emissions away with it.  That seems so unfair to the ordinary person.  I understand the science and logic behind it but whereas the big stuff is being managed, which I am never happy about, the smaller stuff is not.  Ironically, Ireland is on the back foot because of our lack of industrialisation in that we cannot buy our way out of it.  We are being even more disproportionately affected by the methane weighting.</p>  <p>  This point may have nothing to do with the witnesses.  We want the earth to cool down.  There is an idea that food miles do not count.  When representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine appeared before this committee a few weeks ago I made a suggestion about some of the larger supermarkets.  I was doing some online shopping at the weekend and the vegan section appeared on the website in question before other sections offering balanced diet options.  I asked myself whether people believe that eating soya or almonds produced in a country far from here is better for the environment than having a steak?  I suggested to the Department witnesses that perhaps there should be an indicator on the packet that one might be eating this low biological value protein or whatever one has found but it has come all the way from Afghanistan on a jet this morning.  They suggested that could be considered anti-competitive.  If the point is to ensure the environment cools down, that seems to me to be selling our souls to more powerful people.  All of this adds up to it being very difficult to bring people with us on this issue.  Ordinary people understand that taking one transatlantic flight emits as much as driving a car for a year.  They understand that we do not grow quinoa in Kilkenny but other people do not get it.  We cannot expect a family to replace their oil heating system with a heat pump when overall they are still producing the same heat. </p></speech>

To give an example in Ireland, we import a large amount of finished goods, for example, cars.  The emissions associated with the manufacture of cars and aeroplanes that would be used in Ireland do not count against Ireland.  They would be counted against where the steel and automobile manufacturing is located.  There are swings and roundabouts.</p></speech>

We produce so much food, yet the emissions trading only applies to slightly more than one quarter of our emissions.  I would prefer to have a dinner in front of me than have the lights on.  I prefer to have a plate of good food than to have the television on.  I am not sure whether we can sell all of this to ordinary people.</p> <p>I think it is deeply flawed.  It is specifically deeply flawed in terms of agriculture.  We need to do some work.  It would be useful if we looked at the British Veterinary Association algorithm I have mentioned because it would help us.  We have heard about elasticity and how people respond to prices.  We are being told that if a person with a static income is in Waterford with no bus, the solution is to put on another jumper if he or she has one.  I am not sure that is what we should be doing.  I am not sure we should be telling people to set off for school by foot an hour earlier, or to turn the lights off and use a candle.  Is that sort of behaviour regressive?  What if people require huge amounts of energy to power their computers?  It might not be so difficult to put on an extra jumper if one has an extra jumper.  This is about families.  We are hoping to roll out broadband to rural Ireland and everywhere else in Ireland to give people equal access to education and the world.  I am concerned about people who might not be able to afford to turn on the Internet because of having to buy a new jumper.  I have a problem with this approach.  I am fond of figures and accountants.  As politicians, we have a social and human responsibility for how people live their lives.  I do not think the solution is an extra jumper.</p></speech>

This is one of the reasons I wanted to talk here.  The Revenue Commissioners have given us some information about the collection of carbon taxes.  The last figure I saw was for 2018.  When officials from Revenue come in, we will ask them for an update.  I suppose I am putting on the record what was collected.  We have had a general discussion.  Part of it comes back to whether the revenue collected from carbon tax is being spent to meet the required targets.  The job of this committee is to examine where the money that is collected is being spent.  That is kind of where we are at.  I know there are climate plans, etc., but that is probably for another committee.  The figures here are quite small.  I want to put them on the public record so people will know them.  In 2018, approximately 40% of carbon tax receipts - &euro;182 million - came from auto diesel.  Carbon tax receipts from petrol were &euro;48 million.  There were receipts from aviation and gasoline as well.  They were the principal items which seemed to be a big element of the total carbon tax collected.</p><p>We want to address how carbon taxes are used.  We are very taken with the report that has been published by the CSO.  I want to read from it.  As it was written by the witnesses, they will be familiar with it.  I want to help the people who are listening by putting this on the public record.  According to the report in question, &quot;The OECD has undertaken a considerable amount of work on potentially environmentally damaging subsidies&quot;.  This is one of the reasons we are here now.  The Committee of Public Accounts wants to talk about this particular topic.  We spoke about the emissions trading system at previous meetings.  Under the heading of &quot;CSO Methodology&quot;, the report makes it clear that &quot;A subsidy is classified as a potentially environmentally damaging subsidy if it is likely to incentivise behaviour that could be damaging to the environment irrespective of its importance for other policy purposes&quot; such as social policies and other policies.  The report continues:</p> <blockquote> 	Examples of such subsidies include providing fossil fuels at lower prices to certain industries and providing fuel allowances to households to alleviate fuel poverty.  Providing fuels at a subsidised price may result in increased emissions through unnecessary use of such fuels.  An alternative to household fuel allowances is refurbishment of the property through improved attic, wall, floor, and window insulation.  Those measures would greatly reduce the amount of energy required to heat a dwelling as well as resulting in much improved heat retention. </blockquote>  <p>This is one of the issues we want to focus on.  The report includes a commentary on the various damaging subsidies.  In 2016, &euro;2.5 billion was provided for fossil fuel supports.  I ask the witnesses to explain what that involves.  Does it involve VAT refunds on fuel?  What does it involve?</p></speech>

We use the excise rate on petrol as a benchmark.  When a comparison is made with diesel, marked gas oil or kerosene, which have a lower excise rate, the amount of revenue forgone can be seen.  The quantity of auto diesel may be 3.5 billion litres.  When that is multiplied by the difference in the excise tax, a calculation of revenue forgone for auto diesel can be made.</p></speech>

It appears somewhat perverse from a climate change perspective that we are incentivising the use of diesel, which is more harmful to the environment.  We know that for other policy reasons, fuel allowance is given to people to help them to heat their houses during the winter.  Much of that is spent on fossil fuels.  We collect taxes and give them to people to maintain or increase their burning of fossil fuels.  I almost see it as a bit of a cash for ash scheme, if Mr. Brady will pardon the slight analogy.  It is not quite in the same category.  Does Mr. Brady get the logic of what I am saying?  We are giving the taxes we are collecting to people to continue to burn fossil fuels and create more ash up the chimney or wherever it goes.  We have our own little cash for ash system.  It is not in public view.  We just want to put it out there.  That was the nickname given to the scheme in the North of Ireland.  Is there a parallel?  I ask Mr. Brady to respond to the point I am making.  Is my logic valid?</p></speech>

I do not know who is watching the meeting at this hour of the evening, but they might pick up on it.  When I saw the CSO's figure, I was taken aback, but when I looked at it, I understood it.  We are collecting all of this revenue from the carbon tax and there is little transparency as to how the extra amount provided for in the budget will be spent next year.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said there is a need for a whole-of-government approach in Accounting Officers being able to demonstrate where this tax revenue will go.  I am not suggesting it should be put into a separate fund or anything like it -  it can be accounted for in a transparent way in the general fund operated by the Revenue Commissioners or the Central Fund - but we just want to see greater transparency.  I know that in the Estimates for this year there was a move by including a schedule and an appendix to start showing where some of the revenue would be spent, but some of that is not connected to the carbon tax.  Some of the items are EU-funded agriculture schemes that were introduced to provide income support for farmers and food production.  Now they are being wheeled in as measures that are good for the environment.  They do serve that purpose, but they were probably primarily introduced to provide income support at the beginning.  Is there a further breakdown of the information available to the CSO that it could supply to us?  We are not asking it to carry out any more research.  We will have representatives of the Department before the committee to talk about the broader issue and some of the policy issues that have been thrown at us.  We will put this one to them directly when they are before us in a couple of weeks' time.</p></speech>

Lots of social objectives will be met by the figure of &euro;4.1 billion.  This is a research paper we have developed in line with the standards set.  The EUROSTAT standards are coming at us and the figure might change over time as the standards change, whereas the figure for the subsidies is much more concrete.  The crucial point is that everyone should bear all of this information in mind.  There are a lot of moving parts.</p></speech>

Is it &euro;100 million?  I am not sure what the figure is.  If the figure for income forgone is &euro;4.1 billion per annum for subsidies that are damaging to the environment, the little extra collected is trivial.  It only amounts to crumbs relative to the big picture, hence the earlier comments about taxation.  It is only a small part.

Whether the committee takes the approach of trying to cost the damage is to the environment, some countries might argue that the carbon tax should be &euro;150 per tonne.  Another approach would be to look at the cost of production, which would give a very different figure.  Some of the debate on methodology still has to happen.

Those were the type of points I wanted to raise.  We wanted to talk about this issue and we will be talking to the Department, which is the Accounting Officer to this committee.  We wanted to get some hard information from the witnesses in terms of the report that they produced so that we are not just talking to the Department on a general basis.  There is a volume of information on the record now for the Committee of Public Accounts to use as a base when we are discussing the matter with the Department in the next couple of weeks.  We have a base of information that will help us in those discussions and maybe in formulating a short report on that matter in due course.</p>  <p>  I thank all of our witnesses for coming in at short notice at this late hour of the evening.  They are voluntary witnesses and we thank them for their input.  It will help us to take this matter further with the Department when its representatives are here in the coming weeks.  I thank both the witnesses from the CSO and the ESRI for their attendance here and for their valuable help.  The clerk will pursue any follow-up information that has been mentioned.  We have agreed that already.</p>  <p>  The meeting is now adjourned until Thursday, 7 November, when, as already indicated, we will be meeting representatives from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

I find it difficult to understand because in different circumstances where a rate is to be changed, amendments to alter the rate have been accepted, but they have been ruled out of order.  If, for example, the Government wished to change the rate from 20% to 25%, that could previously be amended to change the rate to 24%, 23% or whatever rate was suggested, but such amendments have been ruled out of order.  Several amendments have been ruled out of order.  It makes our lives difficult and lacks consistency.</p></speech>

He refers to amendments Nos. 22 and 24, which are not at the beginning of the list of amendments.  The first amendment in his name ruled out of order has the potential to increase a charge on the people and, therefore, must be ruled out of order according to Standing Order 178(3).  I presume that each member who has had an amendment ruled out of order will have received an explanation.  If the Deputy wishes to return to the matter, however, I am happy to discuss it again.</p></speech>

We have proposed such a measure for a number of years.  The USC continues to be a hated tax for workers.  I accept that the Minister will argue it is a good means of catching income, which it is, relative to income tax.  Nevertheless, the idea is to convert the USC from being something that hits everybody to being a higher income social charge that hits only those earning more than &euro;90,000.  It was originally intended to be an emergency tax because of the crisis but it has become central to the projected revenue of the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

The USC still exists, however, and brought in &euro;3.7 billion last year.  After the policy of abolition was ditched, we were promised the USC would be merged with PRSI, a report would be done and progress would be made in that regard, but there has been nothing.  There is no progress in the Bill in respect of the matter.  Will the Minister indicate where the USC will go?  Will it also be captured in the review he is carrying out of the relief for those with a medical card?</p></speech>

The Deputy has not specified the level of income tax rates that would apply under the proposal.  It is estimated, however, that the removal of the application of the USC on all incomes below &euro;90,000, as suggested, would cost approximately &euro;2 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely the new income tax bands would need to be as high as 70% to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure that it is a cost-neutral proposal.  In the event that it was levied as the USC, the rates would be as high as 70%.  Neither of the estimations takes account of any behavioural change that could result from the significant increase in marginal rates of taxation.</p> <p>  Introducing any higher rate would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates are a clear disincentive to work and could cause harm to our international competitiveness.</p><p> Introducing a USC exempting all those earning up to &euro;1,731 per week would considerably erode the tax base.  The current exemption threshold for USC is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that 28% of all income earners will not be liable to USC in 2020.  To go ahead with the path suggested by Deputy Murphy would mean that 95% of income earners would be exempt from USC. </p><p> The redistributive nature of our tax code has been acknowledged by many experts.  Deputies will recall that during the economic crisis it reached a point where 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax and this was, in retrospect, unsustainable. </p><p> Deputy Murphy's proposal could also introduce considerable complexity to the tax code by expanding the current two rate income tax system to a five or six rate system, a considerable additional complexity for taxpayers, employers and Revenue.  If such a structure were introduced this would lead to an even more complicated system of taxation. Having regard to all of these measures, I do not believe this is a direction in which we should be taking our tax code.  As outlined in previous debates on this, I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.</p><p> On the question that Deputy Doherty put to me, I did publish the report on the integration of USC and the income tax code as part of all the papers across the budget day week, as I think I indicated to him I would.  I will be keeping that in mind when I take a look, for example, at the future of the relief Deputy Murphy and I discussed a moment ago. </p></speech>

The USC should be renamed because it would no longer be a USC.  Instead, the charge should be called a higher income social charge and only apply to the very top earners in our society, which would be a progressive move.  I do not accept the argument that introducing new tax bands is an extremely complex thing.  Other countries have more tax bands than we have so it clearly can be done.  It is a question of political choices as to whether one hits ordinary working people with a tax like the USC or one does not do that but makes up for that through a combination of imposing a higher income tax on the very highest earners.  Bear in mind that for all the talk of the higher marginal rate these higher earners would benefit from the fact that the first &euro;90,000 is not getting hit so it would take a long time before the increased rates of income tax would overcome that.  The Minister should make up for it on the basis of income tax but also, which I am sure we will get on to, in corporation tax and wealth tax.  This is really about a different model of taxation.  In my opinion, there is a broader model of taxation where one actually taxes corporate profits and the significant wealth that exists in our society.</p></speech>

Is it still the case that USC will be merged with PRSI?  Is that the position at this point in time or is he returning to the previous position whereby USC will be abolished?   The Minister has produced papers but what is the current position?  This committee is dealing with the Finance Bill, which leaves it as is, and this was promised a number of years ago.</p></speech>

To deal with the whole issue of progressivity and fairness, we should have this discussion in the context of the fact that we have a very, very progressive and redistributive tax code in the first place.  According to work done by the OECD we are the most progressive EU member state when it comes to the progressivity of our tax code and we are the third most progressive in the OECD.  The Deputy will be aware of the information on the reduction in GNI coefficients, which is a measure for looking at the equality of income distribution within societies.  Again, it shows that the combination of our tax and welfare code means that we have delivered the seventh largest reductions in market income within the OECD.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on what would be the effect of a model such as he proposed, I do accept that it would mean that for those who were on very high incomes, the progressivity or the rate at which they begin to pay more and more tax would accelerate.  If one looks at those who are on high incomes one could make the case that for those people it is more progressive.  I do think there are trade-offs between one's tax base and how progressive that tax base is.  I think one is better off having a progressive broad tax base as opposed to what, I think, the Deputy is suggesting, which is that one would have many people not paying this tax at all and then, for those who are paying it, they pay it at a very progressive rate.  The model the Deputy appears to be advocating here is a model that would make our USC code vulnerable all over again in terms of the number of people who would not be paying it.  </p> <p>  In terms of the question posed by Deputy Doherty, the report that I published outlined ten different options on how integration between USC and PRSI could take place.  The cost varied between &euro;600 million and &euro;1.2 billion per year if one is looking to keep revenue neutral.  Because of all of that, it is going to be very difficult to make progress on that in the short term.  In the short term, particularly with all of the uncertainty that we have, the main thing we will see in USC will be a variant on what we have done recently, which is either modest changes in rates or people paying different rates of USC on different rates of income versus what they are paying at the moment. </p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister published, on budget day, a report, which among other tax expenditures, deals with the issue of the home carer credit.</p><p>It does endeavour to address the issue I am raising here and have raised in the past, namely, the level of awareness of this credit and whether those who are entitled to it are claiming it.  I know Revenue has made progress in extending this credit automatically to those who are entitled to it but I remain of the view that there are many couples who are entitled to it but are not claiming because they simply do not know about it.  Page 89 of the report does seek to address that issue.  It talks about the amount claimed versus the amount used.  There is a difference of &euro;47 million, which is the amount that is unused.  It makes the case with regard to the explanation above, which involves couples who would be better off availing of the standard rate cut-off point for dual income couples where part of one spouse's band at the lower rate is transferred to the other spouse.  Taking that into account and the data sources, which it says are different for each data set, the conclusion is that the awareness is pretty high.  In my experience, there are people who are entitled to it who are not claiming it.  I hope the Minister can give an update to the committee.  The purpose of the amendment is really to get a discussion on it because there is a report.  However, I am still of the view that there are people who are not claiming it and are not aware of it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#D00200"><p>A review of the home carer tax credit was carried out this year by my Department and Revenue following the methodology outlined in the tax expenditure guidelines.  The review was carried out to inform future policy making in this area and forms part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to reviewing tax expenditures on a regular basis.</p> <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy was specifically addressed in this report following our discussion of this matter on Committee Stage last year.  I hope the report, which is entitled "Review of the Home Carers Tax Credit" and as the Deputy acknowledged, was published on budget day, would meet the needs outlined by the Deputy and that, therefore, he would agree that an additional report is not necessary.  </p> <p>  I will deal with the awareness of the credit and progress since we last discussed this issue.  The report concludes that awareness of the credit is reasonably high.  To further demonstrate this, data from Revenue indicates that around 119,800 families claimed the home carer tax credit in 2017 but only 83,800 families benefited from either the full or partial credit.  It is, therefore, not accurate to suggest that people are not aware of their entitlements because there may be genuine reasons, as the Deputy has touched on, as to why they have not been able to or decided not to use the credit.  For 2017, the total cost of the home carer tax credit was approximately &euro;83.5 million.  As the Deputy indicated, it could be because that potential claimants' entitlement to other tax credits was sufficient to reduce their tax liability to nil without needing to avail of the home carer tax credit. </p> <p>  Although the administration of the tax code is a matter for Revenue, I have been advised that Revenue contacts PAYE taxpayers to remind them that there is a four-year time limit for claiming additional tax credits and reliefs.  For example, in 2018, 127,632 letters issued to all PAYE taxpayers who had not claimed additional credits or reliefs from 2014 to 2018 reminding them that they may be entitled to make a claim on or before 31 December 2018.  Since this communication, an additional 474 claims were made for the home carer tax credit and I understand that similar letters have been issued by Revenue this year.</p> <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, Revenue pre-populates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the home carer tax credit where it was claimed in the previous year.  Revenue also automatically grants the home carer tax credit where it identifies eligible persons whose circumstances indicate that they would benefit from the credit.  For these reasons, I am satisfied that everything is already being done to ensure that everyone gets the full value of their tax entitlements and given that a review of the credit has just been conducted, I do not believe there is a need to carry out another report, as the Deputy has suggested.  I would ask that he keep this in mind but if he or the committee has further views about what we can do to draw attention to this credit, I would be very happy to hear them and to see if we can engage on it.  </p></speech>

In that context, given that they must be on a very low income, would it not be sensible to look at a refundable tax credit so that they would get a benefit from it?</p> <p>  Revenue has different practices relating to different issues in personal tax cases.  For example, if somebody qualifies for a retirement pension, Revenue will very quickly write to that individual to say that he or she may be liable for income tax in the future.  Revenue does that relatively quickly because it has a system in place with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In respect of potential benefits and also going back to the earlier comments made by the Minister, the Minister spoke about the Irish income tax system being progressive.  I agree with him that it is very progressive.  The problem is that in Irish society, like many European societies, we now have an awful lot of people on very low minimum wages.  These are the people driving around as Deliveroo drivers.  These people are really out working but they do not qualify for very much despite being on very low incomes.  I know refundable tax credits have been a difficult issue technically for Revenue but I assume that technology in Revenue has moved on and that it would be possible to provide refundable tax credits, particularly in the case of families at work on very low incomes.  I am aware of the supports from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in terms of the payments to working families but these are also potential payments to families and individuals with children or others qualifying under the home carer's tax credit.  It is reasonable to look at the technology to see whether it is possible to pay it to people who qualify and for Revenue to initiate that.  It may be very difficult for people on very low incomes to generate a claim or they may be a bit frightened of Revenue and are not proactive in seeking to generate a claim.  I would be grateful if the Minister could advise us where the thinking in Revenue is going on this issue and whether in terms of the policy developments in his Department, he recognises that certain low-income people miss out on potential tax benefits they could have for a variety of reasons and that we should aim to ensure that those people do receive them.  Revenue is very quick when it comes to areas like retirement pensions or second incomes where they are declared and is on to them immediately, which is great.  However, it should act as quickly when it comes to people's entitlements.  </p></speech>

The report indicates that there may be merit in an updated re-examination of the legal status of non-married couples.  It sets it out in the context of a broader reform because that is relevant as well for couples who are not married and where the transferability of some of the lower-rate band is not there.</p><p>I raised it recently by way of a parliamentary question and in his reply the Minister referred to a Supreme Court decision in 1980, the constitutional provision and that Revenue said it would be very difficult administratively to treat such couples in the same way as married couples because of the lack of official documentation in certain cases and so on.  The issue is not going to go away.  In his response to the committee on the home carer credit, can the Minister set out the broader context of the treatment in respect of the taxation of couples who are not married but are co-habiting?</p></speech>

To add to it, I hope that when the Minister clarifies the issues in respect of co-habiting couples that he will also examine, prior to Report Stage, whether an amendment is required to deal with this unfair situation.  As Deputy McGrath said, this issue is not going to go away.  As we know, more and more people are not getting married and are instead co-habiting.  They are, therefore, at a disadvantage.</p> <p>  On the broader point on the lack of uptake and the information available, on most Committee Stage debates on Finance Bills I have said I have huge respect for Revenue and what it does.  However, in some cases there is a lack of information.  I am conscious that sometimes when more information is provided things can become more confusing.  I wish to tease through the home carer credit.  Is a person who is married, working part-time, earning less than &euro;7,000 per year and in receipt of child benefit for one child who attends primary school entitled to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#E00300"><p>I will deal with the different questions that have been put to me.  I will begin with the shared point made by Deputies McGrath and Doherty on the issue of couples who are co-habiting but are not married.  This is the reason I hesitated in giving a fuller answer to Deputy McGrath on an earlier section.  I am aware of the legal reasons such couples are treated differently from married couples.  I will come back to the committee with a note on this before Report Stage which will outline this further.  I do not have the information on why this is the case to hand.  I take Deputy McGrath's point that given all of the changes in our society, the nature of families and the composition of parenting, it is likely this will be a more prevalent issue in the future than it has been in our recent past.  </p> <p>  On the questions Deputy Burton put to me regarding income and the non-drawdown of the home carer's tax credit, based on the information I have available to me it appears that the drawdown of this tax credit is quite high and it is very plausible that the reasons it is not being drawn down by some is not due to a lack of awareness of the credit.  Rather, it is because by the time people check whether the credit would be of use of them they have availed of other credits which means the home carer's credit is of little or no use to them.  That relates to the Deputy's second question.  I am inclined to think she is right in terms of income and what this means for people's ability to draw down this credit.  </p> <p>  Page 18 of the report we published, Review of the Home Carer Credit, indicated that most households availing of the credit only have a single income and the vast majority have an income of less than &euro;60,000, with over one-third having an income of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000.  The report breaks down the data by gender and different income levels, which leads me to think, as I outlined in my earlier response, that the key reason it is not being drawn down is that other tax credits have been used up and those who are accessing the credit are on quite low incomes in the first place.  By the time they consider whether they should access the home carer credit, it is no longer relevant or beneficial to them.  </p> <p>  The Deputy's last point referred to how we deal with those who are on low incomes and the relevance of the tax code to them in terms of supporting them via redistribution.  The Deputy is correct.  The level of tax paid by citizens who have low incomes is now quite low.  The ability of tax to act as a redistributive policy for such people is becoming less and less relevant because the amount of tax they are paying in the first place is becoming lower and lower compared to a number of years ago.  In terms of giving support to those citizens, particularly those who are in work, other areas of policy, apart from tax, will be more important, such as the cost of medical and child care and other things with which the Deputy is familiar.  </p> <p>  On the question put to me by Deputy Doherty, I will go through the conditions for the home carer tax credit.  The married couple or civil partners must be jointly assessed.  The home carer must care for one or more dependent persons, and there is a definition of "dependent persons", including a child for whom the person is in receipt of child benefit, a person over the age of 65 or a citizen who is permanently incapacitated.  The dependent person cannot include a spouse or civil partner.  They must normally reside together for the purposes of tax.  To obtain the full credit, the home carer's income must not exceed &euro;7,200 in the tax year and the couple must not claim the increased standard rate band for dual income couples in the year for which they wish to claim the home carer tax credit.  </p></speech>

There are different degrees under which that could be argued.  Sometimes providing a lot of information can be confusing.  I cannot find easily accessible information on this for members of the public who, for example, have an adult living at home.  What does it mean when someone is "permanently mentally incapacitated"?</p></speech>

I refer to the previous speaker's query.  This is a difficult issue.</p><p>It is obvious that the poorest families in Ireland are those where everybody is out of work.  Those families are also likely to have people with disabilities or medical needs of different kinds.  Without a great deal of education and training, the capacity in the family to work is low.  Another aspect concerns the high cost of childcare.  There have been some small improvements regarding early years education.  The Minister spoke earlier, as well as in the budget, about being a centrist.  The crisis for centrists in thriving economies is that there is a problem with very low income people at work.  Have the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners considered people in that situation, who, to use the words of the Taoiseach, get up in the morning and go out to work?  Many people get up in the middle of the night, because they are carers, and then work very hard.  </p><p> One of the ways to help such families would be to have refundable tax credits.  That idea is not without its flaws, but nothing in this system is perfect.  Is it possible for the Revenue to do that?  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?  I ask that because we have people, whom we will discuss later, earning high incomes in receipt of large tax exemptions.  We are now talking about small money for people on low incomes and who also have significant home care responsibilities.  We do not seem to be able to do anything to make sure that those people get everything in the tax code that can be provided to them.</p></speech>

To be fair, the Revenue website is clear that a couple cannot both use the standard rate cut-off point, that is where one spouse uses a portion of the other spouse's share of the band.  That also applies to the home carer tax credit and that probably partly explains why we think more people might be entitled to it than is the case.  Once an individual's income, let us say the primary earner, exceeds &euro;37,000, the benefit of the home carer tax credit begins to slide.  Once income increases to &euro;44,600, there is no benefit from the home care tax credit.  It does not work in the same way as most tax credits, such as the case of a jointly-assessed couple where tax liability is calculated and then reduced by the number of applicable tax credits.  The home care tax credit does not operate that way and that is not widely understood.</p></speech>

I referred to that point in my own definition of the conditions for the home care tax credit and it is made clear on the website of the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  Turning to Deputy Doherty's question regarding defining "permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity", it is defined, according to the Revenue Commissioners, in practice by the ability or inability of a citizen to maintain themselves or look after themselves.  This is clear in the operation of the home care tax credit.  In my involvement in debates on the home care tax credit to date, that particular issue has not been identified as a potential reason for the non-drawdown of this tax credit.  My expectation is that there is enough clarity regarding what that means because in the many debates on this issue to date, this has not been raised as an issue.  It may have been raised, however, with the Deputy  The reason for that tends to relate to the issue mentioned by Deputy McGrath.  The other issue I have identified and raised is that the income threshold for citizens availing of this tax credit is low compared with the average.  This credit, therefore, is not of as much use as we might think when looking at the ability of people to access it.</p> <p>  Regarding the cost of allowing refunds on unused income tax credits, as highlighted by Deputy Burton, this matter has been looked at because it has been called for on several occasions by different working groups involved in this debate on how we support low-income citizens.  The last time it was looked at was in 2009.  The Revenue Commissioners indicated that the cost of doing this would be approximately &euro;2 billion per annum and I have not been given any reason to expect that figure has changed.  The Revenue continues to maintain that there would be considerable difficulties with the technical implementation of this measure.</p></speech>

Those changes included an increase in the entry to the higher rate of tax and some reductions in the USC, but there were no changes in these annual exemption limits.  A couple aged 65 and over, therefore, could be taxed in this way.  That would mean no tax because they would be under the exemption limit.  The couple could also get what is called marginal relief, which typically only applies if their income is slightly above these limits.  If income is significantly above the limits, that couple could then be taxed in the normal.  </p><p>These thresholds have not changed in the past five years and, therefore, more older couples are moving away from that exemption limit system of being taxed to being taxed in the normal way.  This is the final budget of this Government and the purpose of this amendment is to have a debate on whether the Minister believes this issue needs to be reviewed.  Three budgets in a row have resulted in changes to income tax and the USC.  There have been no changes in the tax treatment of older couples, however, and the issue should be discussed.</p></speech>

I remain satisfied that the current limits are appropriate.  In 2017, this measure benefited 80,500 taxpayer units.  Little evidence is currently available to indicate that the current exemption limits are causing any undue financial hardship for those aged over 65.  Deputy McGrath may have different evidence, to which he will no doubt refer if he has it.  Age exemption is only one of the many types of relief available to those of retirement age.  Those aged over 66 are exempt from employees' pay related social insurance, PRSI, while those aged over 70 benefit from a reduced rate of USC.  Other income tax credits may also be available, depending on the personal circumstances of the individual.  Those may include the personal tax credit, credits for widows or widowers, blind individuals, those caring for incapacitated children or dependent relatives and for health expenses incurred by the taxpayer.</p> <p>  These apply in addition to the various expenditure measures that give support to those aged over 65, including the State pension and the free travel pass.  At current levels, the age exemption has an Exchequer cost of &euro;79.7 million per annum.  Even a modest increase to the limits would come with a significant cost.  For example, it is estimated that an increase of &euro;1,000 for individuals and a &euro;2,000 increase for couples would cost an additional &euro;36.6 million in a full year.  Any consideration of such changes would need to be cognisant of the significant demographic changes projected to happen in the future.</p><p>For example, it is estimated that the share of the population aged 66 years and over will more than double between 2016 and 2071, while life expectancy rates are set to increase by six years for males and seven for females.  As a result, even without making additional changes such as the ones the Deputy is considering, there will be significant pressure on the Exchequer to fund expenditure in areas such health and social welfare.  Therefore, it is my view that the current income exemption limits are reasonable and continue to represent the appropriate use of limited resources, taking account of the various other State supports for the over-65s.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  If there are particular matters or items on which the Deputy wants further information or to have costed, I will make it available to him, as I would to any other committee member.</p></speech>

The policy objective of the Government and Sinn F&eacute;in is the same, if we are to take as read what the Government stated in the programme for Government that it would end the anomaly whereby the self-employed were unable to avail of the tax credit of &euro;1,650 availed of by PAYE workers.  The anomaly was supposed to be ended a number of years ago.  We have been making progress towards that end and in this Finance Bill the Minister has suggested the tax credit be increased to &euro;1,500 from the current level of &euro;1,350.  As the Minister will be aware, to equalise it with the tax credit availed of by PAYE workers, it needs to be increased to &euro;1,650.  It is appropriate in the last year the Government will bring forward a finance Bill in the current D&aacute;il that the commitment given be honoured.  My party is merely facilitating the Minister in honouring his own commitment by placing the amendment before the committee today.  I am interested in knowing why it was not ruled out of order, given that other ones were, but we will come back to that issue later when we deal with amendment No. 22.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for offering such forbearance and an opportunity to me to change the budget, but I will explain why I am not in a position to accept his amendment.</p> <p>  In this Finance Bill I have provided for an increase of &euro;150 in the earned income credit to bring it to a value of &euro;1,500 per year.  It is estimated that the credit will be of benefit to approximately 217,400 cases in 2020.  In view of the particularly limited resources available to me in budget 2020, it was not possible to increase the earned income credit by &euro;300 to &euro;1,650 as proposed by the Deputy.  Such an increase would cost &euro;40 million in 2020, as compared to the &euro;20 million first year cost of the &euro;150 increase which was achievable within the resources available to me.  It would also give a disproportionate benefit from the budget, if we were to go down the route proposed by the Deputy, to the self-employed as compared to all other individuals, including PAYE workers, pensioners and welfare recipients.</p> <p>  I accept that differences remain in the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However, it is the case that some of these differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For instance, the self-employed continue to benefit from a broader expenses deduction regime than employees.  There are also significant timing benefits in the payment of tax liabilities which are available to the self-assessed but not to PAYE workers, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer.  Deputies will also be aware that the overall contribution to the Social Insurance Fund by the self-employed is significantly less than that of employees as no equivalent of the employee PRSI contribution is payable.</p> <p>  I am aware of the commitment to increase the earned income credit to &euro;1,650 by 2018.  However, the different constraints I had to consider and also the fact that I had made so few other personal tax changes in the budget meant that bringing the credit to &euro;1,500 was as far as resources would allow me to go and also as far as I felt it was appropriate to go in the context of other changes I was not in a position to make.</p></speech>

It is right and appropriate that the self-employed be treated fairly and equally with PAYE workers.  I will be pressing the amendment.  The Minister stated the change would give an increased advantage to the self-employed over PAYE workers.  When we come to subsequent sections we will deal with issues where a real advantage was given.  The cost of the proposed change would be &euro;40 million, but the special assignee relief programme, SARP, costs far more than that sum.  The additional advantage under the SARP, as a result of the Minister's decision to extend it, is not an extra &euro;150 as it would be under the amendment but &euro;123,000 for at least 12 individuals with earnings above &euro;1 million, eight of whom have earnings above &euro;3 million.  If we are talking about a disproportionate advantage from the budget, we know where the Minister's priorities lie.  This is a commitment that was given and it should have been delivered on.  I am pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister proposes to extend this programme, which was due to run out at the end of the year, for a further two years.  It provides a relief of 30% of income for tax consideration for individuals who are assigned within their companies from abroad to take positions in Irish-based operations of their employer or in an associated company.  The individual must have an income of at least &euro;75,000, with an income tax relief applied on the salary above &euro;75,000, with an upper threshold of &euro;1 million for the tax year of 2019.  In effect, this means somebody earning &euro;1 million would be &euro;123,000 better off as a result of the continuation of this scheme.  That would apply to a person who will work here in 2020 and falls into this category.</p> <p>  The number of people applying for this has increased and the cost of the scheme has also increased.  The year after it started the cost was &euro;1.9 million but, in 2017, the cost was &euro;28.1 million.</p><p>The number of employees availing of this is now 1,084.  The serious questions must be asked.  We had a discussion earlier about support for families with low joint incomes which have, in some cases, people with mental and physical incapacity.  They may not have much support available.  On the other hand, in 2018, eight individuals earning more than &euro;3 million benefitted from this scheme, and that benefit amounted to &euro;123,000.  A total of 23 other individuals earning between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million benefitted from the scheme.</p><p> This speaks clearly to the priorities of the Government.  It talks about a tax giveaway and the Minister has just voted against his own programme for Government commitment that would cost an additional &euro;20 million.  In 2017, this scheme cost &euro;28.1 million and that is likely to have increased in 2018 and 2019 and again in 2020.  This is a major tax break for some of the wealthiest people in society and it should not be justified.  I ask the Minister to drop this ill-advised scheme.  It is completely unfair when people are out there trying to get by week by week.  They are feeling the pressure of everything around them, whether it is the cost of insurance, rent or other living expenses.  This scheme is for individuals coming from abroad who have special roles within companies and they can write off nearly a third of their income above &euro;75,000 up to &euro;1 million for tax purposes.  It is not acceptable.</p><p> The scheme goes further and there are other issues with respect to private tuition fees, etc.  I am completely opposed to it at a time many other supports are required.  The Minister announced an additional &euro;2 million for people with autism in the budget.  I have experience of talking to people who are trying to navigate a system that is simply not working and that does not respond to their needs or the needs of their children or families.  The Government has provided &euro;2 million to support all those children with autism and their families or to try to increase services.  Meanwhile it is providing &euro;40 million or perhaps more for the people in this scheme, some of whom are millionaires or multimillionaires.  They will get up to &euro;123,000 in tax benefit next year as a result of this section in the budget.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I have conducted a review of the SARP scheme.  As he will be aware, I have put in place a cap of &euro;1 million for new applicants, which will apply to all applicants from 1 January 2020.  I have put in place such a cap driven by my own concerns to ensure we have the right balance between schemes that reward people on a high income and the benefits those individuals bring to the rest of our economy.</p> <p>  I will say a word about those on high incomes and then a word about the benefits that are brought to the rest of our economy.  On a number of occasions, the Deputy made reference to the fact that somebody on &euro;1 million would have a reduction in income tax that is payable of &euro;111,000.  This is the figure supplied to me by the Revenue Commissioners.  What the Deputy did not go on to acknowledge is the other part of the equation, which is that the individual on &euro;1 million would pay income tax and USC of &euro;355,511.  The Deputy is correct that he or she would pay less tax but he or she would still pay an effective tax rate on &euro;1 million of 35.55%.  I have introduced the cap of &euro;1 million for new applicants and all applicants from 1 January 2020 precisely to address the concerns I had regarding the benefit that could be made available to some, particularly those on a high income.</p> <p>  I will now deal with the broader rationale for the scheme because it is not to deliver benefits to those already well paid and, in some cases, very well paid.  The rationale for the scheme is that it provides one of the tools we need to ensure Ireland is able to get a particular form of investment from particular companies located in Ireland.  If I look at what those benefits are, the report I commissioned last year and made publicly available drove the Report Stage amendment on which I just commented.</p><p>Last year the companies in which these individuals work employed over 155,000 individuals and paid over &euro;1.9 billion in PAYE taxes and over &euro;2.5 million in corporation tax.  They are the wider benefits the scheme has been put in place to address.  The cold reality I face is that the scheme has to stand up against the fact that other countries in Europe have even more favourable schemes, the purpose of which is to attract individuals and then the companies which are located and providing employment in Ireland.  Concrete examples are France, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and Malta where there is a similar scheme in place.  The scheme in place in France offers a deduction of between 30% and 50% of total income.  Under the Dutch scheme there is a minimum salary threshold of &euro;37,000 and it provides the employee with a 30% tax-free allowance.  The Portuguese scheme for qualified non-resident professionals offers a 30% reduction in the income tax rate.  Many other open economies, small and large, have schemes such as this in place. The reason we have ours is to attract individuals who other companies are looking to attract in order that they will be located in Ireland in order to provide the tax revenue that will allow us to make progress in dealing with the issues that really matter to citizens and society.</p><p> The Deputy made reference to a personal experience with autism services.  In my constituency I have had a lot of experience of the effect access to autism services can have on citizens.  The sum of &euro;2 million is provided to draw up an autism strategy.  We are spending significant amounts of taxpayers' money to ensure we will have the supports and public services needed for families and, in particular, young boys and girls with autism.  To do this, we need tax revenue.  This is part of what we do to allow us to be competitive against other countries which have similar or more lucrative schemes to ours.</p></speech>

Any parent of a child with autism will say he or she needs access to services.  The Minister for Finance could have announced a significant amount of funding for services to be delivered to children and adults with autism, but it was not provided.  Instead, he announced a sum of &euro;2 million for a strategy that might or might not be followed by services in the future.  He also announced a tax scheme that would not be in place in 2020 but which will, as a result of section 8 of the Bill, confer in some circumstances a benefit of &euro;111,000 to multimillionaires.  That is not fair.  A teenager with autism in my community will say it is not fair.  Any parent who is struggling to find a school placement will say it is not fair, as will any parent or teacher who cannot obtain a diagnosis for a child who has all of the traits of autism.  I accept that the people in question will pay tax, but that does not take away from the fact that we will all vote on this measure, although some may abstain, to confer a benefit of &euro;111,000 which others will not gain.  A person who is working flat out or running his or her own company and earning good money will not get it as it is only for foreign employees who will come here under a specially assigned programme.  The argument is that it is about creating jobs, but let us look at the facts which speak loudly.  The 1,084 people who availed of this benefit in 2017 had to state in their tax returns how many jobs had been created as a result of this &euro;28.1 million tax giveaway.  How many jobs did they or their companies create as a result of it?  The figure was an 383 additional jobs.  This figure cannot be verified, but it is what the companies are telling Revenue.  It represents a cost of &euro;78,000 per job.  If we think that is good value for money in job creation, we have got bigger problems than this scheme.</p> <p>  The question is about fairness in the tax code and this is not fair.  The scheme is costing us a fortune and the cost is increasing rapidly each year, going from &euro;1.9 million in 2013 to &euro;5.9 million in 2014 and nearly doubling again in 2015 to &euro;9.5 million.  It doubled again in 2016 to &euro;18.1 million and went up by another &euro;10 million in 2017 to &euro;28.1 million.  We do not yet have the figures for 2018 and 2019, but if they follow this trend, the figure for this year is likely to be between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million.  If it follows the same trend next year, it could be anything up to &euro;100 million.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, the members of which will support the Minister, may believe that somewhere, somehow, 31 individuals earning &euro;1 million should benefit by &euro;111,000 as a tax bonus in this Finance Bill.  The Minister may argue that the eight individuals who earned in excess of &euro;3 million in 2017 are so hard done by that they need this committee and Parliament to give them that extra bonus.  I do not.  It is wrong and appalling, given all of the challenges people face and the lack of resources in certain key sectors.  </p> <p>  Today there are close to 700 patients on trolleys.  It is crazy that patients who are vulnerable and in need of treatment are lying on trolleys in hospitals while we are putting resources into this scheme.  That is not fair and it is our job to call it out.  Not many people know about the scheme, but it is appalling and should be ended.  It was supposed to end.  The Finance Act states it is to finish at the end of this year.  However, it is not going to finish because the Minister is going to keep giving the benefit and I am sure Fianna F&aacute;il will give it too.  I am sure some members who have not even been following this debate will come in when we call a vote and push the button to award this benefit.  They may not know that people could be watching this debate and telling themselves that they will be &euro;111,000 better off as a result of a decision the finance committee will take in the next few minutes.  Some of them will not receive that amount, but there are up to 1,000 people who may qualify.  Many of them are wondering whether they will receive it, while everybody else, stuck at home, is paying tax at a rate of 40% above &euro;35,000.  The individuals targeted by the scheme can reduce their tax liability by waiving 30% of the income they earn between &euro;75,000 and &euro;1 million.</p> <p>  I feel very strongly about this issue which I will push to a vote, having argued about it every way I can in the past few years.  It speaks volumes about Fine Gael.  Who has the ears of the Government?  It is not the kids I see or the parents who come to my constituency clinic.  The Minister will say nobody has a monopoly of empathy and I know that he is empathetic.</p><p>If only those parents had access to the people who designed this section of the Bill and have given this amount of money to the individuals in question, but they do not.  The people concerned waltz in and out of Government Buildings.  They are the tax accountants who are telling the Minister that this provision is needed.  Why is it needed?  They are saying it is needed because 383 additional jobs were created as a result of this &euro;28 million tax break, but the figure has actually dropped.  The number of additional jobs created under the scheme dropped by 90 between 2016 and 2017, while, at the same time, the amount of money we had to give the individuals in question went up by &euro;10 million.  Communities are crying out for investment.  If there was anything near this level of investment, they would create 383 jobs in the morning.</p></speech>

As Deputy Pearse Doherty outlined, it is a really blatant pro-super rich policy by the Government to hand over the money in the form of a tax break to some of the highest earners in society.  Those affected will not have to pay up to &euro;130,000 in tax next year, a sum they would have had to pay prior to the budget.  The money could have been spent on many things that we need in our society.  It could have been spent on public transport, healthcare services, education services or housing, but instead the Government is making a political choice to give it to people who already earn &euro;1 million gross per year.  The Minister says we have a great, progressive tax system, but that can only be claimed in looking through a very narrow lens at income tax revenue.  How can he justify this tax giveaway or tax expenditure for those who are earning huge amounts of money?  What have they done to deserve it?  Why do they deserve it more than low paid workers who are still paying USC or those who are awaiting treatment in the health system?  Why do they deserve it more than those whose children with special needs are awaiting appropriate services and care?  It is disgustingt is a political choice made by the Government to benefit the very highest earners, but there is simply no justification for it and it is scandalous that Fianna F&aacute;il is going along with it.</p></speech>

If one believes ending it would not have an adverse impact on Ireland's FDI offering, of course, one would abolish it.  If one felt it would make no difference to the 156,000 jobs in the companies that have SARP employees, one would take the view expressed by Deputy Paul Murphy.  The companies in question paid &euro;2.5 billion in corporation tax and almost &euro;2 billion in PAYE contributions.  The scheme was independently assessed by Indecon which produced a very detailed report which made a recommendation following a cost benefit analysis.  One can criticise that analysis or question the assumptions made, but the conclusion was that the benefit of the scheme exceeded the cost.  IDA Ireland which Deputies here are very quick to praise when it suits them is strongly of the view that a scheme such as SARP has a role to play.  It is part of our offering in attracting foreign direct investment.  The landscape is very competitive, as we all appreciate.  The question is whether one believes all of the jobs we have attracted through our FDI offering and all of the investment we continue to secure would continue to be attracted and secured and that the scheme plays no role whatsoever in that regard.  I do not take that view and believe the scheme does play a role.  It might not sit comfortably with any of us that it is part of our FDI offering, but the reality is that it is.  Such a scheme is also part of the offering of many of the countries with which we are competing for foreign direct investment.  That is the fact of the matter.  It is for those reasons that Fianna F&aacute;il supports the retention of the SARP.</p></speech>

Deputies have described the reality for families they know and represent who are looking for better services and need support for their children or other family members who have great needs.  I feel the same way in wanting to make progress to ensure those families and citizens will receive the support they need and deserve.  I want to see the same happen.  The world in which I live also involves travelling abroad with IDA Ireland to other countries that have schemes such as this.  When I meet representatives of other governments, I am made aware that they want the companies we are discussing that provide employment in Ireland to be located in their countries.  I cannot wish away that reality.  It is the reality in which this country trades and within which we try to attract investment and generate income which we then use to fund the public services we need.  </p> <p>  I wish to respond to the point about autism services made by Deputy Pearse Doherty because while it is anchored in personal and constituency experience which I understand and respect, I will not allow the Deputy to create the impression that all the Government did in budget 2020 was invest &euro;2 million in autism services because he knows that the Departments of Health and Education and Skills provide many multiples of that amount to employ staff to provide the public services citizens who are dealing with the challenge of autism need.  He knows that happens.  I will not allow a comparison to be made between this scheme and the figure of &euro;2 million when the reality is that multiples of that figure are being provided to support citizens with autism and their families.</p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty understands the role of foreign direct investment in the economy and how valuable it is, but all Deputy Paul Murphy wants to do is nationalise it because he is opposed to that kind of investment in this country.  In that sense, it does not surprise me that he is against a scheme like this.  However, if I was to make a policy decision that resulted in international investment or companies located in Ireland moving elsewhere, the Deputies would be the first to lambaste me for the flight of jobs or investment from the economy.  They can have it both ways, but I cannot.  The reality is that other countries offer schemes such as this.  </p> <p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the creation of an extra 383 jobs, but he did not refer to the number of jobs retained - 839 - which makes a big difference to the equation.  None of the Deputies supporting the amendment has referred to the fact that the companies for which these employees work are huge payers of income tax and corporation tax.  Every time Deputy Pearse Doherty quotes the benefit of &euro;110,000 delivered under the scheme, he should also quote the &euro;355,000 paid in tax.  The reality that if this scheme was not in place, it is likely that that &euro;355,000 would be paid in tax in another country and that the jobs associated with the scheme would be located elsewhere.  I want to have them here in order that Irish citizens can benefit and the tax revenue raised from this investment can be used to fund better public services.</p></speech>

If one looks at the form, one will see that there are two requirements to be in providing data for Revenue.  The first concerns the number of jobs created as a result of the operation of the SARP.  I will read it for the Minister.  The form refers to the number of employees in the company as a result of the operation of the SARP.  The increase in the number of jobs is 383.</p><p>That is an increase of 383.  An asterisk notes that this does not include any of the employees who availed of SARP relief.  The second figure is the number of employees retained by the company as a result of the operation of SARP relief.  This figure does not have the same requirement.  Let us be clear.  The asterisk indicates that this information is a required field and it is necessary for the preparation of the annual report.  As the Minister knows, these individuals claim SARP relief for a period of up to five years.  They are therefore the same individuals.</p><p> These are not all new jobs.  The companies themselves provide these figures.  There is no real audit suggesting that this has been checked.  Deputy McGrath can offer a great defence of this scheme based on multinational companies, outlining an Armageddon scenario in which we lose hundreds of thousands of jobs.  However, the companies themselves say that this scheme has increased the number of jobs in all of these firms by just 383.  Only 839 jobs have been retained, and this figure can include the individuals who avail of SARP.  SARP was availed of by 1,084 individuals during that period. </p><p> As I said, I will not get into a debate on autism services, but the Minister is completely and utterly wrong.  There is no additional line item providing for autism services.  I can take him to west Donegal.  Where is the local home support liaison?  There has not been one there for years because of budget cuts, decisions the Minister made.  As I say every time, this is not personal.  Deputy Donohoe holds the office of the Minister for Finance and he makes these decisions.  This is one of the decisions he is making and I do not agree with it.  It is pathetic, wrong and appalling.  So much more can be done and so many other needs come ahead of the eight individuals who earned more than &euro;3 million and will get a &euro;111,000 tax cut as a result of this section.  However, the Minister has made this decision and he must wear it and justify it.  I ask him not to do that by suggesting that these companies will all flee if he does otherwise.  They are not suggesting that at all; they are not saying this scheme is needed to retain thousands of jobs.  They say it is needed to retain 839 jobs.  As I said, some of the 1,084 people who availed of SARP last year are the same people who availed of it the year before.</p><p> Those jobs are being retained as a result of SARP.  One could argue that they are needed in the companies concerned.  They are in key areas.  Deputy Joan Burton was T&aacute;naiste when this was introduced.  At the time it was claimed that 20 additional jobs would be created for every job supported by SARP.  That is on the D&aacute;il record.  That would mean that the forms the companies submitted to the Revenue in 2007 should have indicated a year-on-year increase in the number of employees of more than 20,000, not 383.  </p><p> Yes, the Indecon report has made recommendations and there is now a &euro;1 million limit.  However it still comes down to brass tacks.  Is this the best thing we can do?  The Members here will have to go back to their constituencies.  Can the Minister justify to the next family that comes to his constituency office his decision to give a tax benefit of &euro;111,000 to people who in some cases are multimillionaires instead of investing in services needed by these parents and children?  I would not be able to do that. </p></speech>

I will do so.  I conclude by noting again that the Deputy is quoting a figure of &euro;111,000.  Let us also quote the &euro;355,000 of tax paid by the same individual, an individual who might not have been in this country if a scheme like this was not in place.  It is a scheme that many other countries have.  Let us also quote the figure of 155,000 people who are employed in companies in which the SARP scheme makes a difference.</p></speech>

In order to get those jobs we have to be competitive.  We benefit from additional tax revenue by attracting those jobs.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#P00400"><p>I move amendment No. 5:</p><blockquote>In page 11, to delete lines 16 to 21 and substitute the following:&ldquo;company, and <br /><br />(b) whose business consists wholly or mainly of the holding of shares only in the following (and no other companies), namely, its qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries and where it has a relevant subsidiary or subsidiaries, in that subsidiary or in each of them;&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The amendments concern the proposed changes to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP.  I will speak initially to amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which are linked.  The intention of the provisions in the Finance Bill is to open the scheme to group structures, whereby an individual employee could work in various companies within the group structure.  The definition of a qualifying holding company, however, stipulates that the holding company must not carry on a trade or trades, which is the issue I seek to tease out, given that the provision does not reflect the commercial reality that in many cases holding companies do carry on trades.  It could happen, for example, that an SME group grows organically, and the company carries on a trade and sets up a subsidiary to do so in Britain or Northern Ireland to expand its business into new lines of activity.  Why should this disqualify the holding company and the wider group from relief under the KEEP scheme if the group's activities are eligible within the framework of the relief?  What would be the unintended consequences if the restriction was removed from the definition?  For example, would there be a cost to the Exchequer?</p><p>I turn to amendments Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive.  The Bill as initiated disqualifies a company from the relief where it fails to submit the prescribed report with details on KEEP options and shares allotted, for example, by 31 March in the year following the relevant chargeable period.  It seems unduly harsh that a company and its employees could be automatically disqualified from the relief in circumstances where, for example, a filing is made a day or two late.  KEEP is a more complex scheme than most and, if we are to encourage SMEs to use the scheme, the penalty should be proportionate.  Accordingly, I propose that &quot;may&quot; will be substituted for &quot;shall&quot;.  It is especially relevant when considering the cohort of companies, such as SMEs, that is intended to be within the scope of the measures.  Replacing &quot;shall&quot; with &quot;may&quot; will give Revenue the ability to disqualify the company or group for consistent non-compliance, a power it should have.  The obligations for reporting placed on a company operating KEEP are more onerous than the obligations on those operating an approved profit-sharing scheme or a save-as-you-earn scheme.  The adjustment, if amendment No. 9 is accepted, will be proportionate.</p><p>On page 11, lines 18 to 21, inclusive, a new test is established for a qualifying holding company, namely, as a company &quot;whose business consists wholly or mainly of the holding of shares only in the following (and no other companies), namely, its qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries and where it has a relevant subsidiary or subsidiaries, in that subsidiary or in each of them&quot;.  There is confusion over the precise meaning of the test and how it will work in practice.  We have proposed the amendments to require the Minister or the Revenue to come forward with guidance on the provision.  The KEEP scheme is complex enough, and the background is that just 87 employees have been in a position to avail of it until now.  We should avoid, therefore, any steps that would further complicate it.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 is redundant, given that the other amendments have not been ruled out of order.  It was tabled in case amendments Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, were ruled out of order but they have not been.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#Q00100"><p>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would have the effect of removing the restriction on a qualifying holding company in respect of the carrying on of a trade or trades.  The Finance Bill 2019 provides for significant broadening of the types of companies and structures that may avail of the KEEP and increases the scope of activities that may be carried out by a qualifying holding company, including management functions for the companies within the qualifying group.  The intention behind the changes being introduced is to ensure that the types of companies that are provided for under the legislation reflect commercial reality.  The amended definition of a holding company, as included in the Bill, was on the basis of policy formed in response to a comprehensive SME public consultation process which took place in May and June of this year.  The specific policy of including companies where there is trading activity within the holding company was not presented to my officials as an essential change required by the majority of SMEs as part of this comprehensive stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>  On the point the Deputy raised, the definition we have of a holding company is one that met the needs of the majority of companies that were involved in this process with us and which the Revenue Commissioners and my Department considered appropriate to implement.  We are not aware of a policy need or demand to change it further.  The Deputy might offer different views on that and between now and Report Stage we can listen to those views.  In any event, if a company wishes to grant share options under the KEEP, and this comment is in reference to amendment No. 6, it must ensure that they come within the requirements of the scheme.  The amendments I am bringing forward will facilitate greater numbers of companies in this regard.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is an especially onerous imposition on a company which is seeking to avail of a valuable relief such as KEEP.  That is the reason I believe, with regard to amendment No. 7, it is appropriate to keep the word "shall".  If we are making an expanded scheme available to a greater variety of companies, there should not be any ambiguity regarding the requirements that must be met for the scheme to be made available and for the Revenue Commissioners to be satisfied that those requirements are being met.  For that reason, it is important that we retain the word "shall" as opposed to "may".  My experience of similar changes in the past is that we can change it to "may" at some point, or one might decide it should be "may", but we find at a later point that there are difficulties with companies that are participating in the scheme and companies which subjectively feel they may be entitled to be in the scheme.  We need that to be objectively the case and we rely on the Revenue Commissioners and records that are supplied to the Revenue Commissioners to make that determination.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 proposes that a company might continue to be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as a qualifying company where the company fails to comply with the annual filing requirements.  It must be remembered that KEEP operates on a self-assessment basis with no Revenue Commissioners pre-approval required, so the strict filing requirement is key to ensuring timely returns are made to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not believe that is too much to ask, given the valuable nature of the relief.  This also ensures that the requirements on us to demonstrate our compliance with state aid obligations can be fulfilled.  For this reason I do not intend to accept the amendment.  I ask the Deputy to reflect on the rationale I have put forward for that.</p> <p>  With regard to amendment No. 8, the amended definition of a qualifying holding company has been drafted in such a way as to allow certain flexibility in terms of holding company activities.  The change was requested by companies and I am happy to oblige.  I believe that the "wholly or mainly" test is not in any way an onerous one for KEEP companies to meet.  Indeed, it should be noted that this does not reflect any policy change in this regard and it provides ample scope for qualifying holding companies.  Revenue Commissioners guidance notes, and the Deputy mentioned this, will be updated setting out further information relating to the amended definition of a qualifying holding company.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they intend to issue this guidance by the end of this year.</p> <p>  As regards the Deputy's request for a report on the practical operability of KEEP in amendment No. 9, I remind him that as part of the preparations for budget 2020 officials from the tax division of my Department undertook a stakeholder consultation process on tax incentives for SMEs.  This included the KEEP.  We received 17 responses and upon analysis of the submissions, my officials identified common themes and established a shortlist of the key issues for discussion at the follow-up event.  The changes we made were based on that process.  The Deputy pointed out to me on a number of occasions, and it was a valid point, that not enough companies were accessing this scheme and that, in particular, small and medium sized companies were unable to benefit from it.  We carried out two different consultation events on it.  Those events and reference to this scheme in the tax strategy group papers motivated us to make the changes we have made here.  Our judgment is that once we gain state aid approval for these changes, as we will be required to do, they will have a significant effect on the number of companies that will be able to access this scheme.</p></speech>

Does the Minister not agree there is a danger in incentivising key employees to be paid with share options in terms of the dynamic that it creates in the incentives for the employees?  A factor cited in the crash of 2007 and 2008 was the impact of that incentive, which was not so much to achieve long-term sustainable growth, but to achieve increases in share prices in the short term.  Second, am I right that the maximum benefit one can get from this in a year is &euro;100,000 worth of share options and &euro;250,000 worth over three years?  Perhaps the Minister will provide clarity on that.  What happens if one gets more than that amount of share options?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the Revenue Commissioners will issue updated guidance notes.  As the transcript of today's proceedings might not be online before we have to decide whether to table Report Stage amendments, will the Minister share the notes he has quoted from with the committee?  We might not have the transcript online in the next few days in advance of the Report Stage deadline and I wish to reflect on what he has said.  However, if he will deal with the state aid issue, I will be satisfied with that for now.</p></speech>

Of course, this is an independent decision made by the Commission and we will have to engage with it on it.  I will share my note.  I will ensure that the committee's secretariat is given a copy of my speaking notes and the Deputy can then reflect on them.</p><p>As I understand it, Deputy Paul Murphy's question is whether the operation of a scheme like this could act as a catalyst to the growth of share option schemes.  My judgment on the matter is that the key catalyst in place is the fact that we have so many larger companies located here which already have very generous share option schemes in place.  That is the catalyst to the availability of share option schemes in smaller companies, not the availability of a scheme like this one.  The catalyst is that larger employers are competing for the staff of small companies.  If a company has the ambition to float at some point, it uses that as an incentive to be competitive with large employers that are here.</p><p> On the Deputy's question regarding the caps in place, the total market value of all schemes does not exceed &euro;100,000 in any one year of assessment or &euro;300,000 in all years of assessment.  Any shares that are granted beyond those caps would not receive a benefit from the scheme.  It has been highlighted to me that there is a third criterion here, namely the amount of annual emoluments of the qualifying individual in the year of assessment in which the qualifying share option is granted.</p></speech>

I am against the extension for a number of reasons and have some questions to put to the Minister.  I am against it because the fundamental effect of the so-called "help-to-buy" scheme is to transfer money into the pockets of developers having passed through the hands, briefly, of a select group of potential first-time buyers.  The scheme was introduced originally on foot of significant lobbying by the CIF and it appears there was also significant lobbying in favour of its extension.  The Minister might be able to tell us more about that.  The scheme is being continued with no additional rules, albeit those were speculated about in the media.</p> <p>  Does the Minister have any evidence that the scheme works?  In Britain, a similar scheme is being wound down on the back of studies that show there is massive dead weight in it.  The people who are getting the money from the help-to-buy scheme would have been able to buy in any case and they are still buying the same kinds of houses without the scheme.  It is an expenditure that provides no benefit whatsoever for the State.  Ordinary workers on the average industrial wage cannot access the help-to-buy scheme in the first instance.  I do not see the economic rationale for the scheme and the money would be far better spent directly by the State to build houses.  I am interested to know whether the Government has carried out any study similar to the study carried out in Britain, which concluded that there was a very substantial dead weight in the scheme resulting in the decision to wind it down there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#R01000"><p>We have not carried out any study beyond the study and information I published as part of budget 2019.  I have retained the scheme because it provides important help for people who are looking to buy their first home in particular.  On the view that could be created that the scheme looks in some way to support developers or the purchase of valuable home, the average house purchase price available under the scheme tell a very clear story in this regard.  If one looks at the purchases properties with the assistance of the scheme, approximately 56% were priced between &euro;226,000 and &euro;375,000.  These are houses that people typically seek to buy as their first homes and I want to have measures in place that help low and middle-income citizens to do that.  It has been a standard feature of tax codes to have such supports available.  The scheme is providing a valuable support to those looking to buy their first home and is merited for a further period.</p> <p>  The amendment is technical in that it addresses an error in the original drafting of the section.  As announced in my Budget Statement, the section extends the help-to-buy incentive by 24 months to 31 December 2021.  In extending the scheme for two more years, Revenue included a new formula of words to determine the tax look-back for applicants.  The amendment removes the proposed new section 477C(7)(c) from section 15 as it runs the risk of reducing the relief available for many applicants.  The current draft set out in the Bill means an applicant in 2020 will not be able to rely on the 2019 tax for relief.  Revenue's intention was to align applications with the annual tax return cycle and the consequences of the change were not fully appreciated at that time.  Revenue believes the existing text would be sufficient to ensure the relief allows applicants to continue to avail of their tax in the year immediately prior to the application for claims in 2020 and 2021.</p></speech>

That is the proposal notwithstanding the fact that a study of a similar scheme in Britain has concluded there is a massive dead weight and it is a waste of public money.  When the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, introduced the scheme, he was very open that it was about propping up property prices.  He commented openly in the media that it was about increasing property prices and, thereby, incentivising the construction sector to get involved in building these houses.  The Minister may think or argue that his final purpose is to allow people to access homes, but part of the logic of the scheme, or an intermediate point at the very least, is to prop up property prices to incentivise developers to build homes.</p><p>Is that not the Minister's purpose?</p><p> Third, I have found records of lobbying engagements with the CIF for the continuation of the help-to-buy scheme.  How many lobbying engagements, meetings, communications have occurred between the CIF and the Department on the scheme over the past year?  </p><p> Finally, does the Minister accept that the house prices to which he refers, in excess of &euro;300,000, are out of the range of two workers on a median wage of &euro;30,000, that is, a combined income of &euro;60,000?  They simply will not be able to buy a house in that range.  The scheme does not work.  A cohort of workers who would like to access the housing market are unable to do so, but even if they could, does the Minister accept that a far simpler and more effective way of using public money is to use it to build public housing?</p></speech>

We were told that it was about increasing supply.  I do not know how increasing demand at a time here is no supply will increase supply.  It has pushed up house prices.  We see this from the analysis.  We should remember that the &euro;20,000 that has been collected from some taxpayers has been put into the pockets of other taxpayers.  Some 21% of those who claimed this amount were for purchases of properties in excess of &euro;375,000.  That is very much at the upper end of income distribution in this State.  A person would need a household income of &euro;96,000 to purchase a property at that price, and that is not the income most households earn.  We can see from the analysis undertaken by the Parliamentary Budget Office that more than one fifth of the subsidy goes to the upper end.  It is grand for the Minister to make statements but the facts do not stack up.  A large portion of the &euro;100 million tax break goes to individuals who are purchasing property and who do not need this tax break to get a mortgage to purchase a home.  Does the Minister accept that?  Does he further accept that it is clear from the figures that a significant amount is going into the pockets of individuals who do not need the money to purchase a home because 41% of them are able to get a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%?  A direct line cannot be drawn that 41% is equal to &euro;41 million but I strongly those who can meet a loan-to-value ratio at that level are likely to be in the higher income brackets, given the prices of property at this point.  Does the Minister accept that 41% of successful applications are going to individuals who do not need the money to purchase a property in the first instance?</p></speech>

The reason I am not commissioning a further study into a decision I have made is that I have had two studies on it, the latest of which was undertaken 12 months ago for last year's budget.  I published it and all the information relating to it.</p> <p>  On lobbying, I had one meeting with the CIF at which there was no reference to the help-to-buy scheme.  I met its representatives and they did not bring it up.</p> <p>  There is no information available to me on the income levels of people who access the scheme.  I have other forms of information but a key dataset that I use is the value of homes that are purchased under this scheme.  While I made the point that 56% of the homes are valued at between &euro;226,000 and &euro;375,000, 13% of properties purchased with help from this scheme have a value of less than &euro;225,000.  It is fair to assume that those properties, particularly if they are in the larger cities, are first homes or perhaps family homes that have been purchased by people who need support because of their income level.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty made a point about the loan-to-value ratio and asked me to confirm that 41% of approved claims were made by households which have a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%.  Those are the figures and that is correct.  However, just because there is a loan-to-value ratio for those people of less than 85%, that does not also mean that a degree of support will not be a help to them.  Many other purchases are going ahead that have a loan-to-value ratio higher than 85% for which the scheme is very helpful.</p></speech>

What does he want them to do with that money?  Does he want to be able to go for a couple of foreign holidays?  He is taking that money from other services.  It is money that he could put into hospital trolleys, autism services or other areas which need it.  In that context, where people do not require the funds to purchase their house, how does he think that it is appropriate to hand out cheques for &euro;20,000 to more than 40% of the claimants?</p></speech>

He also stated that he does not disregard the fact that this would support other issues.  What other support do these people need?  Some 41% of people who claim this tax relief do not need it.

It is also about creating a framework in which we will see an increase in supply of homes.  While I would not make the case that the scheme is the key reason we have seen an increase in the number of homes being built in the State, as I could not stand over that, I believe it is contributing to that.  According to the figures for housing supply during the lifetime of the scheme, the number of completions has doubled from 9,896 in 2016 to 18,000 in 2018, and this trend is set to continue.</p><p>I have acknowledged that means that just over 40% of those looking to access this scheme do not need the same level of financial support-----</p></speech>

For somebody who is looking to buy their first home, a case can be made for offering a degree of support for that.  Even if I was to take the Deputy's point and say that somebody purchasing a home that has a loan-to-value ratio of less than 85%, and he may make the case that they do not need any support because they are able to purchase the home with that loan-to-value ratio, I would go back to the broader reasons a scheme like this is needed.  It has been a contributory factor to an increase in the supply of homes in our country.  Until I see the supply of homes get to a certain point, and I believe we still have a way to go on that, I believe a scheme like this has a role to play.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#T00400"><p>That is ridiculous.  There is no evidence to suggest that two different metrics are connected.  I will read from the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, examination in respect of this.  It states:</p><blockquote>In 2018, at least 56% of HTB claims were above the average house price (&euro;286,931).  This poses some risk as schemes which stimulate demand for more expensive properties could put inflationary pressures on property prices.</blockquote> <p>That is what this scheme does.  It puts money into pockets of individuals, some of whom need it to get on to the property ladder and others who do not need it.  We know that at least 41% did not need it but that figure will increase because there are people who had a loan-to-value ratio of, for example, 87% who would only have needed a portion of the scheme to benefit.  This is about stimulating demand.  There is no need to stimulate demand.  We have 10,000 people homeless.  Thousands upon thousands of people have moved back to live with their families in their childhood bedrooms.  In some cases, couples and families have moved back home.  There are people who are sofa surfing.  Local authority housing waiting lists are bulging.  The demand already exists.  To suggest that putting money into pockets of individuals who do not need it to get onto the property ladder - in this case we are talking in the region of &euro;40 million - is somehow leading to demand is wrong.</p><p>The rationale behind this scheme, and I am trying to figure out if the Minister has moved the goalposts or if we are sticking with this rationale, as was argued at the time by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, was to assist people to get onto the property ladder and meet the requirements of the Central Bank, which meant that one needed to have 10% of the house purchase price.  The rationale was that the State was providing one with 5%.  It was to do with the affordability and the rules of the Central Bank at that time.  I disagreed with it because as the Parliamentary Budget Office has outlined, increasing that type of demand can put pressure on house prices.  It does not matter if more houses are built.  If that is the rationale, the argument still exists that people will need assistance to get onto the property ladder.  The only way we can combat that is by driving down house prices.  The suggestion from others, including the PBO, is that this has gone the other way and put inflationary pressure on house prices, which is making it worse for families.</p><p>This scheme was supposed to end.  That is written into the law of the land.  The Minister cannot finish a scheme.  He has the same problem as Fianna F&aacute;il with property schemes.  He does not understand when they need to end, and there is no justification to continue it at this point in time when the PBO is asking who is benefiting from it.  It is the wealthier in society who are benefiting but why?  We can see in terms of the breakdown of the value of houses that they are at the upper end of the scale.  This is not a good way of dealing with the housing crisis.  It has failed.  </p><p>If I was a first-time buyer I would be praising the Minister.  Who would not want &euro;20,000 at the time when one is making a huge investment?  Everybody would want it.  They would want &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 if they have a Minister for Finance who was willing to write a cheque and hand it over to them but we have a responsibility to balance all the needs of society.  The idea of providing this type of support for people who do not need it, which is going contrary to what we need in that it is pushing up house prices and which is concentrated at the higher level of house prices, does not make sense.  The Minister needs to end this scheme.</p></speech>

It did a detailed analysis pointing out that the scheme is a subsidy to producers.  Unless subsidies to producers are very carefully tailored or are happening, as when this was introduced, when a market is dead, they produce what subsidies to producers produce, that is, they line the pockets of the producers.  In this case, they are providing an assistance to the building industry, which admittedly has many different problems, that is not required.  They are effectively helping to drive up prices.  In my constituency and that of the Minister, whether it is a new or a second-hand house, the traditional house that civil servants and so on looked forward to being able to buy, many of those properties have increased in price from &euro;400,000 to &euro;500,000.  The analysis sent by the Parliamentary Budget Office shows clearly that a significant proportion of the people are so well off they can get the 85% loan values we just heard about.  All the evidence is that they may be delighted to receive the subsidy but that they do not particularly need to receive it.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about &euro;100 million being spent on this scheme.  Is he even open to trying to target it, perhaps to people who are struggling to get on the ladder of home ownership and offer them some help, or is it his intention simply to help drive up house prices, which is what it is doing?  I cannot understand the advice the Minister is receiving from officials and why we are receiving very clear advice from the Parliamentary Budget Office that was a new element.  I understood he was possibly being advised to pay some attention to the detailed reports.  Nobody from his Department contested the reports that we received, debated and examined yet the Minister seems to be of the view that he should simply ignore the distortions that the scheme as it is now, where he is proposing to simply renew it, has produced in terms of outcomes.</p> <p>  This is a producer's subsidy and, as such, the producer's subsidy is helping developers.  I use the word "developers" because the financially driven model of house building the Minister is overseeing is producing results where, for instance, funds are now producing people who can attract money from investors.  They are producing these monstrous proposals of strategic housing infrastructure that has 218 beds with a kitchen being shared on one of each of the six floors.  We can talk about this all day.  There are major problems around smaller builders being able to become active in the market while, at the same time, a wall of money is being thrown by investors into fund-type vehicles.</p><p>Hence, there is a phenomenon of various large companies, which have so much money that they do not know what to build, deciding to build bedrooms that they rent out forever.  We are moving further away from a democratic model where home ownership is significant and important to everybody in the country.  We want to retain that model, but the Government is changing it to a highly financialised model, which is driving up house prices and assisting a certain kind of developer.  In 20 years, people who once aspired to own their own homes, having worked hard, will not be able to do so.  They will retire in their 60s without a home on which the mortgage is paid.  They are likely to be lifetime renters.  The Minister has said that the Government is spending &euro;100 million on subsidies in the housing market.  Can that money not be used to target the people who need support, rather than those who, based on the evidence in the PBO report, could qualify for a significant loan?  I am sure the Minister knows from his own commercial background that all of this is driving up prices, shutting more and more people out of the housing market and putting them into permanent and expensive rentals for life.  They will not have an asset or security of tenure, and when they reach retirement, they will have to fall back on the willingness of the State to secure affordable rentals.  They will not have access to a home they can ever own, but only affordable renting.  This particular scheme was initiated by the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, at a certain point in time.  I disagreed with it then, but it was a time the market was totally flat and developers did not have money jingling in their pockets.  Now certain developers are so rich and attract so much investment that they can dictate terms to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and Fine Gael.  This is the kind of stuff we once associated with Fianna F&aacute;il, but with the way everything is going, it now seems Fine Gael has become the downtown office of the CIF. </p></speech>

The first charge made against me is that the scheme drives prices.  The paragraph relating to this issue in the PBO report states:</p><blockquote>The PBO undertook a modelling exercise to examine the impact of the scheme on new properties using data from the CSO.  A difference in difference (DID) estimator technique is used to evaluate the impact the Help-to-Buy scheme had on house prices.  It compares prices for new properties (treatment group) with prices for existing properties (control group) before and after the scheme was put in place.  Overall, the results suggest that the HTB scheme did not have a statistically significant impact on prices. </blockquote> <p>The Deputy asked whether I took account of this report.  She then claimed that this scheme drives prices.  The report she is quoting examines the impact of this scheme on prices and concludes that it does not have a statistically significant effect on them.  That is significant because the independent report I commissioned on this reached a similar conclusion.  While it said that a small increase in prices may have been attributable to the scheme, the primary drivers of house prices remain wider economic conditions and the continuing misalignment between demand and supply.  Let us bear in mind that this report, which is being used to anchor a charge that this scheme has led to an increase in prices, concluded that there is no evidence of a statistically significant impact on prices.</p><p>I refer to the impact of this scheme on supply.  I again quote the report to which the Deputy referred:</p><blockquote>When the scheme was announced there were concerns it could increase demand and lead to higher prices, particularly if the supply remained fixed.  This would offset any gain made by the buyer as the benefit would be passed onto the seller through a higher price.  However, following the scheme&rsquo;s introduction there was a significant increase in the number of house completions. </blockquote> <p>It goes on to state that it does not claim this scheme is the cause of the increase in supply.  I am not saying that either.  I am making the case that this policy has contributed to the increase in supply we are now seeing.  Another part of the report the Deputy has been quoting makes the case that any effect on prices is not statistically significant.</p></speech>

That is the conclusion of the PBO.  We can all read selectively if we want and while I do not dispute what the Minister said, I have also read other sections that state that there is a risk of inflationary pressures.  We could argue about such issues for forever and a day, but this scheme has not fulfilled its objective and I am, therefore, pressing this to a vote.</p></speech>

Throughout the country, many people travel a substantial mileage.  Although some live in cities, due to their work they may have to travel to various parts of the country.  Many people in rural Ireland are forced to drive because of the lack of public transport and people on average wages must rear their families, with the general costs of mortgages and so on.</p><p>The Government seeks to apply carbon tax, and I am sure the Minister will talk about the Government assisting people with fuel allowance and so on.  Nevertheless, I refer to people who are not in that category and who have no choice but to travel long distances to work.  The amendment seeks to raise the mileage limit to the figure stated not in order that everyone will reach it but rather for work purposes only.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the tax credit to the people I have described.  We are making some sections of the community poorer because they go to work, having got up early in the morning, in the way Government has previously highlighted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#V00400"><p>I will support the amendment.  The Government has introduced many plaudits and grand schemes, and often talks about climate change and the need for us to engage and change our ways, for which there are all kinds of incentives.  As every member will know, however, people in rural Ireland often have to travel to work and college but there might not be any public transport such as a bus.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, with the Government's support, wanted to lock them all up, take their cars and throw away the key.</p> <p>  This is a meaningful opportunity for the Minister for Finance to put his money where his mouth is and support such people.  The limit is high enough that it will be used for genuine reasons.  Many people, as the Deputy noted, have to crisscross and cover large areas.  Where I live, people often have to cover Munster and Leinster, and that is the way it is.  Hundreds of people leave County Tipperary every morning to travel to work in the construction industry in Dublin.  Apart from the distance, there is pressure, use of time and fatigue when travelling in traffic.</p><p>The first 100 miles are fine but the rest of it is at a snail's pace.  It is agonising and it contributes to pollution.  The Government cannot seem to see that.  In this case we are asking the Minister to assist, perhaps through a tax credit that could be claimed over 15,000 km per annum.  It would be some meaningful attempt to have fairness and equity.  It would support na daoine go l&eacute;ir, those fir agus mn&aacute; who get up early in the morning, sometimes very early or in the middle of the night, to travel huge distances to work, and at huge risk also because they are out on the road in all kinds of weather especially at this time of the year.  I appeal to the Minister to give serious and favourable consideration to these people.  In a couple of years' time we will be trying to encourage them to change to electric cars and so on.  We need to show some cause or sentiment of understanding as to how difficult the challenges are they face with the kilometres they travel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#W00200"><p>Individuals can already claim a tax deduction for the costs of travel expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their employment or office.  This does not include the cost of travelling between home and work.  It is a long-held view, supported by much case law, that expenses of travel between home and work are not wholly exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of an employment.</p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Mattie McGrath appear to be suggesting a broad-based relief rather than a targeted scheme.  In this regard I draw their attention to the tax expenditure guidelines issued by my Department, which stipulate that "the key rationale for Government intervention ... by way of a tax expenditure ... should be the existence of a market failure" and that a tax-based incentive should be more efficient than a direct expenditure measure.  A measure such as the one proposed does not appear to address a clear market failure in circumstances where alternative measures are already available.</p> <p>  I appreciate that some people are using cars to travel long distances to where they work and I am aware that many might not have the public transport options that are available to people who live in our larger cities.  Leaving aside the very obvious difficulties in ensuring compliance for such a scheme, providing a relief specifically for those who live further from their place of work - in this case perhaps 20 miles or more each way - would also raise questions from an environmental perspective with the kinds of changes we are looking to make in the long run.</p> <p>  I absolutely understand why the Deputies have put forward this case.  With regard to making a change in carbon pricing - and going back to Deputy Fitzmaurice's comments - we are not looking to introduce carbon pricing or carbon taxing; it is already in place.  We are looking to increase it further.</p> <p>  Putting in place a measure such as proposed by the amendment would also create huge challenges for us from a compliance point of view and for Revenue in trying to ascertain whether the travel had actually occurred.  It would also raise the challenge that we would be putting in place a tax subsidy for journeys that are already happening.  We want to provide ways to reduce the number of journeys and over time try to make more of them available to be completed through public transport than is currently the case.</p> <p>  I absolutely accept that the effect of the change in carbon pricing is very different for citizens who do not have many public transport options available to them.  For the reasons I have outlined, however, I am regrettably not in a position where I would be able to accept amendment No. 11.</p></speech>

The reality of market failure is that in many parts of the country, and through no fault of their own, people must drive distances to work simply because there is no public transport, as the Minister has already outlined, and probably because balanced regional development is not in place.  A person must drive 20, 30 or 40 miles to make sure they are able to provide for their families or for children going to college, yet the Minister said there would be a difficulty in carrying out such a scheme.  It would not be such a difficulty for a person to prove the mileage he or she is doing.  It is not aimed in any way at incentivising people.  Reference was made to trying to get people onto a different route.  There is a sad reality to some of what we are trying to do here.  There are people in what I will call "middle Ireland" who do not qualify for anything.  If one is on a lower income threshold then one might qualify, and there are some helps for people who would be at the lower thresholds.  I recognise that but I am talking about people from the middle Ireland who pay most of the taxes, and who go out to work every morning and do the normal things of trying to keep kids in school, trying to keep a mortgage paid and trying to keep the students in college.  These people would not be getting any more in their wages.  They would be going from their house to their place of work.  It is not that they would be zooming around the country for the sake of it.  Nobody decides or wants to be travelling like that.  I know people who commute from Roscommon to Intel.  There is no public transport system there or to other such places, be they in Westmeath or Kildare, that would take people to or from work when they need it.  I will not criticise that because one cannot be all things to all people, but we have to give a bit of recognition to these people.  To be quite blunt, all we are doing is kicking them in the teeth in every budget.</p></speech>

The Construction Industry Federation, which I am sure the Minister meets regularly, has said that its members cannot get tradespersons.  Workers must travel, even farther from Tipperary and other places, up to work in Dublin.  They do not have public transport to suit them, or it is not available at times they need it.  There is an impact.  They could not afford to stay in Dublin, even if they could get a bed.  The Government is really squeezing these people.  Many of them have families at home and in those cases the family may have to have a second car.  The van might be used for work and the family would need a second car to bring kids to school and to do all the other necessary shopping and living in the country when one does not have public transport or the access to services.  We need to have some bit of imagination here and try to look at this.  There should be no problem with enforcement or verifying how the miles are clocked up.  We are not talking about leisure purposes, we are talking about travelling to and from work.  If a person is working on a major project in a bigger city he or she could be travelling there for six months, a year or two years.  They could easily get verification of their travel.  It is not that they want to travel.  Many of these people do not have the choice but to travel or they could lose their employment.  Do we want that?  We have problems enough getting people to fill positions now, but thankfully that is a good complaint.  We must support the people who are the middle Ireland, as we referred to earlier.  They are all the time being knocked and kicked back, and they get no incentives or supports.</p></speech>

In my response I acknowledged there is a world of difference between the effect of carbon pricing on somebody who has a bus or a Luas at the end of their road and somebody who does not.  Not acknowledging that reality is going to make it even more difficult to try to win the arguments around changes such as this in the future.  I take on board Deputy Fitzmaurice's comments when he spoke about the difference in public transport options between living in Dublin or living in Ballinalsoe.  There is an obvious and very big difference, but I differ from the Deputies on their proposed tax credit suggestion.  First, if we were to go down that road, anybody anywhere would be able to claim it, including those who live in cities and who have public transport options.</p><p> Second, and I appreciate the difficulties with this, but over time we are looking to provide the changes in respect of where employment is created, how we organise Bus &Eacute;ireann and incentives for hybrid and electric vehicles to try to change the travel journeys that have been referred to which, ultimately, are difficult for those who are making them but also have consequences for our environment.  </p><p> Finally, there would be compliance difficulties with something like this that the Deputies may well feel will not be realised but, ultimately, we have lots of other experience within the tax code  whereby when we bring in changes such as this but do not have a way of proving that they are going to be properly implemented, difficulties occur.</p><p> The Deputies referred to middle Ireland on a number of occasions.  I know well the needs of middle Ireland, like they do.  We are trying to make progress in meeting their needs in other ways but I, regrettably, do not feel that this is one of the ways in which we can do it. </p></speech>

In my view it is healthy and is healthy to promote it.  A key goal of workers and unions is to achieve wage growth that outstrips the increasing cost of living.  We can see that one of the ways to do so is to increase the bargaining power of workers through their unions, them to negotiate larger slices of the pie on behalf of workers while also encouraging and enhancing productivity.  We can see from many of the analyses that have been done at international level that this can go hand in hand.  Where there is a well organised workforce, there are heightened levels of productivity that benefits not only the workers but the employers.  </p><p>This State has moved away from that trend for different reasons and I do not suggest that the tax credit is the only reason.  The labour force survey showed in 1994 that nearly half of all employees were members of a union but by last year, the figure had fallen to 25%.  What has happened in the private sector is more concerning.  Union density was 20% in 2010 but six years later, the figure had halved.</p><p>A review was completed following a commitment made in budget 2016 to examine the appropriate treatment for tax purposes of trade union subscriptions.  The scheme that operated in the past, which provided an income tax relief of &euro;300 in respect of trade union subscriptions, should be reintroduced.  At the time a small amount was available to workers but, in 2010, when it ended, 337,000 workers were availing of the tax credit, which was the equivalent of &euro;70 per annum for union membership.  Now we have rehashed this matter on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in previous years, regarding the differences between the treatment of members of trade unions and members of other organisations who can write off their dues or fees against their tax bill.</p><p>The trade union tax relief or credit was abolished in 2011 at a time of deep austerity when many reliefs and credits were abolished.  Given that the State has the third highest rate of low-income workers in the OECD, and the fact that we have had other debates about how taxpayers subsidise the SARP scheme and so on, the reintroduction of the trade union tax relief should be considered under the legislation.  That is why my amendment seeks a report on the matter to be laid before the House within six months.</p></speech>

Low pay is a serious problem in the economy.  We know from the information and analysis being done by various bodies that it is a growing problem, particularly in terms of the gig economy.  One of the ways to ameliorate and limit the downsides of the gig economy, and the abuse of workers, is for workers, particularly workers on low pay, to be encouraged to be able to join a trade union so that representations on their terms and conditions of work can be made.  It is notable that since Ireland joined the EU there has been a significant expansion of individual workers' rights, whether that is women at work, older people at work and people with a disability being able to find work.  We have done that in the context of our membership of the EU, which has, by and large, encouraged a social partnership model.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that we also have an alternative model in recent times in the economy, which is significant foreign direct investment.  Many multinationals are anti-trade union because that is the tradition of the economies and regions that they come from.  However, we also have a significant problem in sectors such as the hotel and hospitality industry.  We have a significant problem affecting women workers who are on low pay.  One of the few ways of addressing the low pay issue is the Low Pay Commission which, I, as T&aacute;naiste, set up and agreed with the Minister's former leader, the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.  This was to review the issue regularly.  We need to move from minimum wage increases on a regular basis for the economy to thrive.  It is a pity that on budget day there was no announcement that the minimum wage increase recommended by the commission would be implemented in January.  We have been told that the increase has been just postponed rather than cancelled, and we can come back to that at another time.</p> <p>  I do not understand why there is so much opposition to the proposal for trade union relief and a study in this regard when all of the international evidence proves that economies featuring a well paid workforce do particularly well in combating problems such as poverty and lack of employment.  Certain American cities, for instance, have introduced protections for workers.  All of the evidence intimates that they are the cities that have grown because they are more attractive places to live and in which to operate.  </p> <p>  It makes a lot of economic sense to examine the support available for trade unions.  A tax relief would be a support to trade unions.  We have an example of a tax relief that is in the current tax code, as the Minister's officials will be aware.  I refer to donations, for instance, to charitable organisations, including Concern, that do an awful lot of work in the Third World.  The relief means that the body, which is the subject of the donation, can claim a tax relief.</p><p>I can understand that there may be an awful lot of objections in principle to any kind of tax relief for trade unions on the part of the Minister's officials.  We have incredible tax reliefs for businesses that come to Ireland, some of which have fantastic records in respect of conditions of employment while others have appalling records and are driving down our standards and the standards of living of our people.  There are a number of different approaches available with regard to this.  The Minister can ask his officials or the Parliamentary Budget Office to come up with a report that would look at the pros and cons and the experience in other countries, which is that when wages and conditions are good, an economy is more likely to thrive.  I saw the Deliveroo workers cycling around town in the rain yesterday and wondered what kind of pay and conditions they are on.  Many of our economies are moving to that model.  If we have a vigilant trade union movement that represents workers who have poor pay and conditions, allowing the contributions of workers to the unions to be reflected in some kind of tax relief scheme to enhance the finances of trade unions will repay the wider economy.  We must bear in mind that a trade union subscription is being paid out of after-tax income in general and, therefore, the reason for recognising that this tax might be repaid is the fact that it is coming out of the after-tax income.  If we recognise that the work of trade unions is valuable, we would provide a scheme where some or all of that tax that has been borne by workers out of the income they use to pay their subscription would be recycled within the economy back to the trade unions to allow them to continue their really important work of representing and defending workers' rights and in that way, defending our standards of living and our society so I support it.  </p></speech>

Trade unions have a very important role to play in our society.  I spend a considerable amount of time dealing with them.  I spend my time dealing with differences but, at times, there are lots of things on which we agree.  I believe the most important relationship between where economies meet societies is the share of our national income that is absorbed in earnings to workers.  When that trend goes down, as it has, it creates really big problems for living standards and the return citizens get from working.  The analysis put forward by Deputy Burton regarding the effect that healthy unions and healthy economic institutions can have on living standards is right.  I read the same analysis myself and I can see it.  While we might differ a bit around the edges on it, Deputy Burton is correct in respect of the core point that when collective institutions work well, they can play a role in economic gains being distributed fairly and if that fair distribution happens, it is good for living standards and maintaining consent for how economies should work.  I do not know why Deputy Burton is addressing her comments to my officials here.  I must reassure her that they are very reasonable officials and the advice-----</p></speech>

It is a matter for them.  All they do is evaluate the pros and cons of different things we must do and evaluate.  What I would say with regard to the point made by Deputy Doherty is that I fundamentally do not believe that it is the place of the Finance Bill to require me to produce reports.  On the other hand, because of Standing Orders, it is pretty much the only kind of amendment the Deputy can put down.  If he was to agree to withdraw his amendment, I will ask for a report that would look at the pros and cons of this and what is international practice.  The Deputy will be aware of the other reports on this that have been done that say it is not worth doing and that there is a really big deadweight cost.</p></speech>

The factors that are now influencing members of trade unions within the private sector in particular are far deeper than the cost of joining that trade union.  All that being said, I am as aware as the Deputy is of what is happening with changes in parts of our economy.  I accept the overall point that strong collective institutions and representative bodies can help play a role in making sure gains are fairly distributed.  In my three years as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in particular, I have had plenty of engagement with the trade union movement in Ireland and while I disagree with it about a number of things, I also believe it is an important institution with regard to how we can have not only a good economy but a good society.  If the Deputy is willing to withdraw the amendment, we will get that report done and perhaps it can play a part in a more informed debate on this issue in advance of the next Finance Bill.</p></speech>

They currently get no tax relief on those subscriptions in the same way as somebody paying a trade union subscription does not get any tax relief.  Those issues should be examined.  They do not have to be the main part of the report but the Minister should have regard to them because not all employers pay those subscriptions or membership fees and, technically, because they are not a necessary requirement of somebody's employment, that person cannot claim them as a deductible expense.</p> <p>  My next point is tangential but it might be my only chance to raise it.  Can the Minister give us an update of the review of the flat rate expenses?  I am very conscious that we are here considering the Finance Bill but for 2020, there may be changes to people's take-home pay that we are not considering because Revenue is conducting its review of flat rate expenses.  Any change that will come in will be an administrative one so it will not come before the House.  It is something we need to be cognisant of and at least discuss.  Can the Minister give us any update on where that stands?  </p></speech>

It is a valid point.  On a serious point, I welcome what the Minister said.  Obviously, the intention of this amendment is to ensure a report is produced.  The Minister has agreed to produce that report.  Therefore, I will withdraw the amendment.  I hope that we would receive this report in sufficient time.  We called for six months.  I know some reports are released on budget day, which is problematic to say the least given the amount of information that is released.  If we could try to ensure it is done within the same timelines, it would be appreciated.</p></speech>

One of the problems the Minister may have is the complication of the scheme given the relatively small amounts of contributions.  However, the donations scheme and the tax relief relating to donations to Third World charities and other charities, which basically allows the receiving body to claim a standard rate-based tax credit provided that whoever has contributed has given his or her name and address and is a taxpayer, might constitute a much easier way of doing it.  It might not produce the same value of income as the original scheme used to produce.</p><p>However, it could be a very important stream of income with a high level of certainly where people joined a trade union.  I urge that this aspect also be examined.  It was introduced by Ruair&iacute; Quinn in the 1990s and has worked well for the various charities.  They would probably like it to work better, but it has certainly worked quite well for them.</p></speech>

It would not be the subject matter of the report because it is about a different matter, but I will ensure that part of the report will look at this issue which the Deputy has raised on many occasions.  We will give it recognition in the report.</p> <p>  On Deputy Pearse Doherty's point about timing, we will do it within six months.  The report will not be about the role of trade unions in the economy or society; rather, it will be about the very specific issue of tax relief, acknowledging past views, and look at what happens elsewhere to see whether there are options for us and what the pros and cons are.  To manage everybody's expectations, I am not committing to seeking a tax strategy group type paper or something on that scale, but I believe that within six months we can sum up how it happens elsewhere, the pros and cons in whether it should be done and inform the committee and the Minister of the day on the issue.  Many things are happening in the global and national economies that need strong governments, parliaments and institutions such as unions.  We should be looking at these matters afresh.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Burton's point, I am sure the report that will be produced by the Department of Finance can look at that option.</p></speech>

We are talking about high levels of rent and the Minister is well aware of the current figures from the RTB.  The national average is &euro;1,202 per month, with renters in Dublin seeing a significant increase and experiencing greater pressure as the level stands at &euro;1,713 per month.  These figures represent an annual increase of 7% and there is no sign that it is slowing down.  </p><p>It can be seen that the cost of rent is outstripping wage growth for many renters, including young families and workers.  I discussed some of the resultant impacts earlier.  We can see the outcome, with people having become homeless in emergency accommodation, while others have moved back into their parents' homes.  Many are at the pin of their collar in just trying to get through the week.  The rental market is broken and we need to fix it.  As we do so by increasing capacity, we must also ensure relief and a reprieve for renters.  We are asking, therefore, for the introduction of rent relief equivalent to one month's rent for those renters not already receiving a State support. </p><p>Prior to my or the Minister's time, rent relief was introduced in 1982 through a finance Bill.  It was introduced initially to alleviate the pressure of the high cost of rent for those aged over 65 years.  In the following years it was extended to all age groups in society and available to everyone.  In 2009 the Commission on Taxation argued that it was actually increasing the cost of private rented accommodation and recommended that it be discontinued.  It was abolished in 2011 by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan.  It was not abolished overnight but phased out.  Many other property related reliefs were also, rightly, then on the chopping block.  We all know about some of the property reliefs and how they contributed in no small part to the financial crash we suffered later.  I refer to a budgetary perspective.  The reliefs also led to some of the banking problems.  Rent relief was not available to any first-time renter after 7 December 2010, which change was made in a finance Bill.  However, it continued up to last year for those renters who were already in receipt of it.  It was phased out over several years, between 2010 and 2018.  However, in the previous year it was possible to obtain relief up to a figure of &euro;400.  It was available at a higher level in previous years.  </p><p>The Minister is familiar with our position.  We believe three things need to happen.  The first is a rent freeze to deal with the concerns expressed in the report of the Commission on Taxation.  It rightly pointed out that rent relief was leading to an increase in rental prices because landlords were pricing in the relief and passing on the cost to renters.  The introduction of rent relief, therefore, has to coincide with a proper rent freeze, as we have seen in some jurisdictions recently.  We also need the burden of rent to be lifted from renters.  The third measure for which we are calling is a significant increase in capital investment in public housing, including cost rental units.  One of the concerns of the Commission on Taxation about the rent relief measure introduced in 1982 was that it did not benefit those who did not have taxable income, including some students and others in the low income bracket.  That is why we have argued a refundable tax credit or relief should be introduced.  I have made my pitch now and think this change is warranted.  It would affect about 250,000 renters and is badly needed.</p><p>It is ridiculous that people who could get a mortgage to buy the property they are renting would pay less per week or month than they pay in rent at present.  The system is broken and  annualised increases are only going in one direction.  Something has to give.  Up until now that has meant people giving up their rental accommodation.  In some cases they have fallen into homelessness and emergency accommodation but, in more cases, people have ended up moving back in with their parents.  This is not a far out proposal.  It was done 1982 and up until 2017, people were getting rent relief.  This is not a mad, radical Sinn F&eacute;in idea.  What we are trying to do is take into account the concerns of the Commission on Taxation and address them through the refund while also introducing a rent freeze as a temporary measure.  There is no point in introducing rent relief as a temporary measure unless we bring in a rent freeze and increase capacity.  A significant increase in capacity should have the effect of reducing rents throughout the State but even with the right resources, that will take at least three years.  That is why my party is arguing for this relief to be put in place for at least three years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#GG00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The previous tax relief in respect of rent paid was abolished in budget 2011 and is no longer available to those who commenced renting for the first time from 8 December 2010.  This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief ran the risk of increasing the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be the risk of a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.  In addition, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient income tax.  The Government has taken many different steps to address concerns about the cost of rental accommodation, including significantly increasing capital investment for the availability of more homes within our country.</p> <p>  Finally, at the time of its abolition, rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum and based on certain assumptions, it is likely that the annual cost of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal, if introduced, would be even higher.  I listened carefully to what he said and accept that many tenants are under severe pressure because of increasing rents.  I acknowledge the effect that has on their standard of living and on their concerns regarding the future and where they will live but that is why we have rent pressure zones, RPZs, in place under which we have capped the magnitude of rent increases that are planned.  If we were to introduce a measure like this, there is a risk that rent increases would always be pressed right up against the cap on allowable increases in the RPZ in which a home is located.  It is for these reasons that I am not in a position to accept the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#GG00300"><p>If the Minister accepts all my positions, those reasons disappear.  The Minister made a point about rent increases going right up to the RPZ caps but I said that there is no point in bringing in a measure such as this unless a rent freeze is also introduced.  It is of little comfort for those who are paying an average of &euro;1,713 per month in Dublin, or in excess of &euro;2,000 in some cases, that their rent will only increase by 4% next year.  They are already stretched.  When one has an elastic band and one has taken it to the point where it is about to snap, telling the elastic band that it will be okay and that it will only be stretched a little further is no good because it will snap.  That is what is happening in this regard.  The system is broken and renters are the collateral damage.  If a rent freeze was introduced, rents could not increase to the higher level.</p><p>The second argument that the Minister made related to students and those on low incomes but I addressed that point in my opening contribution.  If this is a refundable tax credit, it means that they will also benefit from this measure.  This can be designed in a way that allows those on low incomes who do not have a tax liability to benefit from the relief.  </p><p>The Minister is correct that the relief was abolished but people can still avail of rent relief now.  People will also be able to avail of rent relief next year and up until 2021 because of the retrospective nature of claiming reliefs going back four years.  In 2018, the eight-year phasing out period was completed.  Data for 2015 show that 135,000 renters benefited from rent relief while in 2009 and 2010, 200,000 renters benefited.  The pressure on those 135,000 individuals four years ago or on those 200,000 renters ten years ago was far less than it is today.  There is no comparison between the pressure on renters today and the pressure on them ten years ago but we provided rent relief ten years ago to 200,000 renters, even though the relief was being phased out.  There was a justification at the time for abolishing the relief because it pushed up rental costs but that can be dealt with by the introduction of a rent freeze.  </p><p>This should only be a temporary measure.  We should not provide rent relief to renters <i>per se</i>.  That should not be part of our tax code because it should not be necessary in a society with a functioning rental market.  I do not want to get into party politics on this but the system is broken, for whatever reason.  I could argue that it is because of Fine Gael or whatever but regardless of the cause, the system is broken when people are being asked to pay these rents.  We have a duty and a responsibility to take some of the burden off them.  There is a way of designing this that deals with the issue of rents reaching the upper cap, that is, by introducing a rent freeze.  The argument made by the Minister about those on low incomes and students is addressed by the refundable nature of the relief.</p></speech>

I explained the technical difficulties that exist.  I made the point that if we were to bring in refundable credits, it would of itself have a cost consequence that we would have to take on board.  The figure I shared with the committee, which in fairness was for all reliefs, was &euro;2 billion.  I would not be in a position to introduce a refundable relief for one area but not for another; there would be an expectation that it should be introduced across the board.  The Deputy is assuming that I can do something that I have said the Exchequer cannot afford.  Even if we could afford to do it, despite the significant technology available to the Revenue Commissioners, the technical capacity is not there to do it.  Earlier I explained why we cannot do it.  In his presentation on rent relief, the Deputy referred to a refundable relief but the amendment to which I was speaking does not.  He clarified that in his statement.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that my concerns about this could be dealt with by the implementation of a rent freeze.  There is no rent freeze at the moment and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has explained on a number of occasions on behalf of the Government that the introduction of a such a measure could have unintended consequences.  It could make it even more difficult for tenants in the future and those who might be tenants in terms of the supply of rental accommodation and what might happen in the rental sector.  </p> <p>  The Deputy has resisted the urge to go down the road of making political charges on this and I will do the same.</p><p>I accept the point that we have significant issues with rent levels and what this mean for those paying rents and their fears for the future.  My genuine assessment of the Deputy's proposal is that in the absence of a freeze this is not the correct policy measure.  While a freeze would be attractive in the short term, beyond that it could have difficult consequences.  I then said that in the absence of a refundable approach, a road I do not want to go down in the tax code, we could end up putting in place a tax credit scheme that does not benefit those who need it the most, similar to the argument the Deputy looked to make against me on an earlier amendment.  In any event, the Deputy is aware of the pressures that mean rent increases are pressed up more and more against the 4% cap.  My assessment is the implementation of such a measure could be a further catalyst of this happening.  This would not be in the long-term interests of tenants or the use of taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

This has been discussed on numerous occasions at various committees and in the D&aacute;il by myself and others with regard to the ways around the 4%.  This committee relies on verifiable statistics.  Rents are increasing at 7% annually.  The Minister argued that a temporary rent freeze would have other effects.  I assume he is suggesting it would drive people away from investing in the market.  We know what is happening and we will get to it later.  Large institutional investors are buying up property.  The funds are now the largest landlords in the State and later we will discuss the big giveaway in terms of how they are taxed.</p> <p>  I wonder whether, if rents in Dublin were &euro;3,400 instead of an average of &euro;1,700, we would make the same argument.  I genuinely believe the Minister would.  Of course, a rent freeze can be introduced.  One was recently introduced in a European jurisdiction.  We can do it if we believe rents are too high at a point in time.  There should not be an indefinite freeze.  We would not be allowed to do that indefinitely under the Constitution but it would be allowed on a temporary basis.</p> <p>  I do not buy the argument on the refundability of tax credits or the idea that if we introduced a refundable tax credit in this regard, we would have to do it for every tax credit.  That is not true.  It is us in the House, who are elected by the people, who decide what tax credit is refundable.  There is no legal requirement on us.  There is nothing in the finance code or any legislation ever passed in the House that states if a renter's tax relief was refundable, we would have to do the same for every other tax relief.</p> <p>  With regard to the capacity issue, I take the point.  I missed the earlier discussion on the &euro;2 billion cost of reliefs to which the Minister referred.  The number of people who are able to avail o tax reliefs and multiple tax reliefs in the State is substantial.  The number is approximately 250,000.  The majority of the individuals who are renting, particularly given the levels of rent, are not receiving support from the State and this means they have a taxable income but a small but significant number of cases, such as students and others, need to be addressed.</p> <p>  I made the point earlier that I have great respect for the Revenue Commissioners and their ability and for the Revenue online service.  I do not buy that they would not be able to deal with, in all likelihood, 10,000 or 20,000 refundable credits.  We must remember that when this relief was introduced in 1982, the requirement was to submit an application to Revenue for the credit.  It is not outside Revenue's capacity to be able to deliver a refundable tax credit in this regard.  We are not speaking about 2 million workers or millions of different reliefs or credits that could be available throughout the entire tax code.  We are speaking about a specific relief and a cohort who would be able to avail of that relief.</p></speech>

What is explicit in my argument is the experience of knowing if we make a change in the implementation of a relief in one part of our tax code that would ensure it would be more than beneficial to people on lower income, the demand to do it in respect of other reliefs in our tax code would be high.  It would be difficult to make the case regarding why we should ring-fence refunds for one tax credit while saying that others would not be refundable.  The figure I have for making all of our reliefs refundable is &euro;2 billion.</p> <p>  With regard to the technical capacity of the Revenue Commissioners, the Deputy is entitled to his view on what they might be able to do and he has acknowledged the respect he has for them.  He can have a view on them.  I am accountable to him for the policy commitments I make that they then implement.  Their advice is they do not believe they would be in a position to implement a refundable approach to all the credits in our tax code.</p></speech>

The Minister makes the valid point that if we make a tax credit refundable in one area, there would be an expectation other areas.  I am sure every PAYE worker will have an expectation that the Minister should exempt one third of their income from income tax because he has just done it for 1,000 employees.  It is the same argument.  Is there now an expectation that all other workers will get one third of their income exempted from income tax in the way that has been done for SARP?  Do they have a legitimate expectation?  Yes.  Will the Minister do it?  Not a chance in the world.</p> <p>  The committee could make this decision, because of the issues for renters and the pressure they are under, and because certain people who are renting and seeing increases, even within the RPZs of 4%, are being pushed over the edge and into homelessness and back to their families.  It is weighing heavily on them in terms of financial stress.  We all know what financial stress can do to one's physical and mental health.  There is an issue as the system is broken.  If the Minister introduces a refundable tax credit for this cohort of individuals, a minority of them would avail of it and that is easily within the capacity of the Revenue.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what the Minister is saying.  We are having a factual argument but there is an underlying issue.  That is the problem.  We are dealing with one issue in the Bill and we will deal with other areas where there are nice wee benefits.  These guys are crying out for help.  This is not radical.  We had a tax relief when rents were half the price they are and when we did not have 10,000 people homeless or the pressure and the crisis we have.</p></speech>

It is correct that the decision I made on SARP is factual but what is not factual is the Deputy looking to create a perception of me as making tax decisions that look to benefit an elite.  I am as aware as the Deputy, as I say to him on many occasions, of the type of suffering or difficulty to which he refers.  The decisions I made, which were factual, with regard to SARP, are driven by my view that not having such a scheme in place over time could affect employment in the international part of our economy.</p><p>That is all that motivates my views.  I am expressing it as the Deputy brought the special assignee relief programme, SARP, into the debate.  It is welcome that the Deputy has acknowledged that there would be a demand for making part of the tax code relate to refunds.  It would create a demand and expectation that it would happen across many existing reliefs.  I am informed that were it to happen, the overall cost would be the figure the Deputy and I have adebated.</p><p> I am being told to repeat again that it would be very difficult technically to do what is set out in the amendment.

I will say it to his face that he is making decisions that will benefit the elite; I would not say it behind his back if I was not willing to say it to his face.  Of course, that is what happening with section 8 of the Bill.  It will benefit the elite.  In some cases the people in question are multimillionaires.  That is my view, but the Minister has a different version, which is that it is being done for a wider and more noble cause as he outlined to the committee.  Whether there is that expectation, PAYE workers could legitimately ask why somebody availing of the SARP can have 30% of income excluded from taxation when they cannot do so, despite bursting their backsides in working on a factory floor and paying &euro;1,700 per month to try to keep a roof over their heads.  It could be a legitimate expectation.  I am trying to counter the Minister's point and, regardless of the expectation, there is no requirement for us to legislate for it.  It was mentioned that this would cost &euro;2 billion, but it would not as refundable tax credits would not be introduced across the board.  There is a crisis in housing provision and did we all not sign up to the idea that there was a housing emergency?  If there is such an emergency, we must act in a way that reflects it.  There was no such emergency ten years ago when rents were lower and there was rent relief provided.  I am arguing that this should be introduced on a temporary basis, to be joined by the two other prongs of a rent freeze and a significant increase in capital investment to increase capacity in the system.  Even if rents were to stay as they are, they are not affordable.  The costs the State is asking families to bear every month are mad.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

Section 97 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following after subsection (2K):<blockquote>&quot;(2L) (a) In this subsection<blockquote>- 'annual service charges' means the expenditure described in section 18 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011;<br /><br />'commercial unit' has the same meaning as it has in section 1(1) of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011;<br /><br />'multi-unit development' has the same meaning as it has in section 1(1) of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011;<br /><br />'owners' management company' has the same meaning as it has in section 1(1) of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011;<br /><br />'residential unit' has the same meaning as it has in section 1(1) of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011;<br /><br />'unit' means a commercial unit or a residential unit.<br /><br />(b) A deduction shall not be authorised by subsection (2) in respect of the annual service charges due to an owners&rsquo; management company in respect of a unit in a multi-unit development unless the person chargeable can show that:<blockquote>(i) in respect of a residential unit the registration requirements of Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 have been compiled with in respect of all tenancies which existed in relation to that residential unit in that chargeable period, and<br /><br />(ii) the annual service charges have been paid to the owners' management company.</blockquote>(c) For the purposes of subparagraph (i) of paragraph (b), a written communication from the Residential Tenancies Board to the chargeable person confirming the registration of a tenancy, relating to a rented residential premises to which paragraph (a) applies, shall be accepted as evidence that the registration requirement in respect of that tenancy (and that tenancy only) has been complied with.<br /><br />(d) For the purposes of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b), a written communication from the owners&rsquo; management company to the chargeable person confirming the payment of the annual service charges relating to a unit to which subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) applies, shall be accepted as evidence that the annual service charges have been paid.&quot;.&quot;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote> <p>As this amendment deals with the substance of both amendments, there is no need, as such, to respond specifically to amendment No. 18.  In essence, the effect of the amendment is to prevent a tax deduction for annual management charges or fees against rental income, unless a landlord has registered the tenancy with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, and paid the management charge to the estate owners' management company.  We all agree that having tenancies registered with the RTB is more than desirable and what is expected.  It is the law of the land.  We also acknowledge that there are very significant problems in many multi-unit developments with maintenance and upkeep.  Many management companies are not functioning because of a failure in some cases by owners to pay the required management fees to them.  The thrust of the amendment is to see if the Minister is willing to examine the proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#JJ00600"><p>Amendment No. 17 specifies proof of payment of management fees by landlords and registration of tenancies with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, in order to obtain a deduction of such expenses for tax purposes.  I will deal first with the registration of tenancies with the RTB.</p><p>Section 97(2)(e) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 permits the deduction for tax purposes of &quot;interest on borrowed money employed in the purchase, improvement or repair of the premises&quot; against rental income.  However, section 97(2I) provides this interest relief is not authorised unless the person claiming it can show that the requirements under Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to register residential tenancies with the RTB have been complied with.  The purpose of section 97(2I) is to encourage compliance with RTB registration, rather than to deny the tax relief for interest.  To ensure compliance with RTB registration, the return of income form, Form 11, includes a tick box to confirm that the tenancy is registered with RTB.  If the box has been ticked and, on examination of the return, the Revenue Commissioners find that the tenancy had not been not registered with the RTB at the time of filing the return, interest deductibility is denied.</p><p>Landlords are required to register details of all of their tenancies with the RTB within one month of the commencement of the tenancies.  Whereas new tenancies should be registered within one month of their commencement, provision is also made in the Residential Tenancies Act for late registration at double the normal fee.  An acknowledgement from the RTB confirming registration in the case of a late registration will be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as evidence of compliance with Part 7 of the 2004 Act.  However, a person claiming an interest deduction in the annual tax return must be able to indicate compliance with the Part 7 requirements at the time of making the return.</p><p>If a tenancy is registered late, the Revenue Commissioners adopt the following administrative practice as set out in its manual:</p><blockquote>Interest relief that has been denied for a particular chargeable period because a tenancy was not registered by the return filing date for that period can subsequently be restored if the landlord avails of the late registration facility, subject to the usual four-year time limit on claims for repayment of tax.</blockquote> <p>The first amendment also specifies certain proof related to payment of management fees in multi-unit apartment complexes, while the second asks for a report on the tax deduction for such expenses.  Apartment management fees are an allowable deduction against rental income under this provision, provided they are borne by the landlord.  Clearly, an item of expense is not allowable for tax purposes if it has not been paid.</p><p>On the issue of claiming deductions for expenses not actually borne, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that whereas the vast majority of taxpayers submit accurate and timely returns and declarations, Revenue minimises the opportunities for those who might seek a competitive advantage through non-compliance by conducting an extensive programme of compliance checks each year.  In 2018 Revenue compliance activity focused on, among other areas, the rental sector.  There were 5,277 compliance interventions in the rental sector in 2018, with a total yield of &euro;41.62 million.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while audit interventions and yield per audit are accurately recorded electronically in each case, the current recording system does not support extracting data for yield by specific expense restricted.</p><p>Neither of the proposed amendments is necessary.  Rental income is dealt with under the headin gof self-assessment and if a return was audited, the Revenue Commissioners would seek proof of payment of management fees and registration with the RTB to verify that a deduction was allowable.</p></speech>

If the note could be shared with the committee, it would be very helpful.</p> <p>  The Minister detailed in the reference to section 97(2I) of the Taxes Consolidation Act the connection between allowing the deductability of certain payments arising from purchase or repair of a property and it being contingent on a box being ticked on the form to confirm that a tenancy has been registered with the RTB.</p><p>That is welcome and I accept that requirement is there.</p><p> The issue the amendment focuses on relates to landlords claiming tax deduction for the annual management charges of fees paid to a management company.  The Minister has acknowledged these are tax deductible.  Yet, there does not seem to be any corresponding requirement for landlords who claim that relief to demonstrate that they have registered with the Residential Tenancies Board.  Not every tenancy would result in interest deductibility being relevant.  There may be no loan associated with a particular property, but the landlord could claim the tax deduction for the payment of the management fees.  Does the Minister get the point I am making?  I am referring to the connection with that as opposed to with interest deductibility.  That is the issue this amendment raises.</p></speech>

I know this is an issue with which the Minister is familiar.  People who avail of physiotherapy sessions can claim tax relief on expenditure if it is carried out by a registered practitioner under the legislation or if the person has a referral.  However, in many cases people have to be referred by a general practitioner to claim the relief under the tax code.  I am trying to tease out whether the Minister would be open to allowing tax deduction, as such, for people who go directly to a physiotherapist for treatment.</p></speech>

"Health expenses" is defined in that section as "expenses in respect of the provision of health care...including the services of a practitioner."  A practitioner is an individual who is registered in the register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 or the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act 1985 or, in respect of health care provided outside the State, is entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practise medicine or dentistry there.  In the case of physiotherapy, tax relief can only be allowed in circumstances where the practitioner administering the therapy is a qualified practitioner, as defined in these terms, or if the treatment has been prescribed by a practitioner, as defined in these terms.  GPs, therefore, often act as an access and control point for the scheme of tax relief on health expenses.  Treatment by a physiotherapist is dealt with in the same way as other treatments for health purposes in that to obtain relief the treatment must come within the terms of section 469 of the 1997 Act.  If physiotherapy was allowed without the need for the treatment to be prescribed by a practitioner, it would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief and this could greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.  Given my budgetary constraints I am not predisposed to such a potential cost increase.</p> <p>  This is a broadly availed-of relief.  In 2017 there were 486,200 claims at a cost of &euro;172.5 million.  The current legislation safeguards this tax relief and I do not propose to change it.  For the reasons outlined I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The issue really is that people have to incur extra expense to get a referral.  It involves going to the GP to get a referral to see a physiotherapist.  Only then will any expenditure the person makes on physiotherapy qualify for tax relief.</p> <p>  I understand the budgetary constraints.  What the Minister is saying is that there could potentially be knock-on effects.  Presumably, the Minister will be concerned about self-referrals or people referring themselves for various therapies.  Realistically, people are not going to do that for tax relief purposes.  Tax relief is granted at the standard rate.  Is that the Minster's objection to it?  Is it because it would then have to be applied in respect of other forms of therapy?</p></speech>

If we do not have some kind of gatekeeper in place, as we do now, since a patient can only get relief if he is referred by a GP, my concern is that we could end up with a considerable escalation in cost.  Thus, the debate I am having with Deputy McGrath on physiotherapists could end up being applied by people who might seek acupuncture or other forms of medical relief but who might not do it without having to go to a GP first.</p></speech>

I hear the Minister's concerns on the matter.  In the real world many people go to the physiotherapist for necessary treatment but do not go through a GP.  Requiring them to go through a GP costs them &euro;40, &euro;50 or &euro;60 depending on which part of the country the person is in.  That is the cost simply to be referred for physiotherapy.  People involved in sports and so on regularly seek treatment but are unable to benefit from the relief.  Will the tax relief make a difference to them in terms of whether they seek treatment?  It is in place for a reason.  It is in place because it is medical care.  It is there for a reason.  I think there is a strong argument in this regard.</p></speech>

In the real world this relief costs &euro;172 million.  My concern is that if we were to make it more broadly available, there would be very considerable cost consequences.  There is merit in making it applicable only to a form of relief in respect of which a general practitioner acts as a gatekeeper, for want of a better phrase.  This repeats an argument we have had.  We are discussing making the relief applicable to physiotherapists.  The demand would then be extended to other healthcare services that many citizens access without a visit to a GP.</p></speech>

If we believe - I am using the word "we" loosely - relief should be available for a visit to a physiotherapist, we should not put barriers in seeking it.  The Minister has acknowledged that no one is going to self-refer to a physiotherapist and pay 80% of the cost in order to get 20% back.  If we believe the health outcome of a visit to a physiotherapist is a public good, why put that barrier in place?  I am not suggesting the Minister is not living in the real world.  If someone presents with a sports or similar injur, a GP will refer him or her to a physiotherapist but will charge a fee of &euro;50 to do so.  That is the problem and it creates a barrier to access.  A lot of people will not visit a GP.  They will go straight to their physiotherapist.  They know their own body and know that they need treatment.</p> <p>  We have to start from a principled point of view.  All we are doing is creating a barrier.  There are very legitimate reasons to create barriers in availing of tax reliefs.  However, I do not know how someone could scam the system, unless he or she was the son or daughter of the physiotherapist and it would have to be a big family to make it worth the money.  I do not understand it.  Deputy Michael McGrath is looking for a report on the matter.  That suggestion should be given active consideration.  What is the breakdown of the figure the Minister has presented for the cost of this relief?  What portion is accounted for by physiotherapists?  Does Revenue have that information or does it combine all of the figures included in the Med 1 claim forms?</p></speech>

I note that we are extending another tax relief through the living city initiative which has been bedevilled by delays and changes.  Initially it applied to two areas and Georgian buildings only.  It was then extended to six areas and all pre-1915 buildings were made eligible.  The commercial element was removed and it was made available to landlords.  The state aid rules came into effect and changed the whole initiative again.  Throughout there has been an extremely low uptake.  We are talking about 20 applications per annum.  In the entire lifetime of the scheme there have been three applications in Galway.  Is there a genuine case for continuing the scheme which is being kept on a lifeline?  I remember the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, saying some things worked and some did not, but this scheme was worth the risk.  Is it simply not working?  If so, why are we extending it?  There has been a very low uptake.</p></speech>

We have seen an increase in interest in the scheme which is carefully targeted at a small number of areas in a small number of cities which we are trying to influence.  Revenue has advised that 51 applications were received up to the end of 2016.  Subsequent to changes made in 2017, a total of 177 successful applications have been made.  Given the very small nature of the scheme and the fact that the number of applications has increased, I have decided that there is merit in extending it a little further.</p></speech>

This measure exempts State bodies from taxation and we are backdating it by 20 years.  Moreover, why were the agencies not added to the Schedule before now?  Why were they not added by way of a statutory instrument, as has been done in the case of other agencies?  My concern is that one of the conditions of section 227 of the Taxes consolidation Act 1997 is that if a non-commercial State body has paid income tax, it is not entitled to claim it back when it is added to the list.  Is that why this measure is being backdated by 20 years?</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, the programme for Government contains a commitment to the establishment of a second air ambulance service in the southern part of the country.  That happened earlier this year when a charity, Irish Community Rapid Response, established an aeromedical service based in County Cork.  On average, the service flies 50 missions a month.  This has taken pressure off the air ambulance service based at Custume Barracks in Athlone.  Its objective is to ensure the air ambulance based at Custume Barracks can respond to far more emergencies in the midlands and the west. </p><p>To fund the operation of the service, Irish Community Rapid Response must raise &euro;2 million per annum.</p><p>The service is provided by a UK-registered helicopter company.  Post Brexit, that company will have to re-register in the Republic of Ireland in order to be licensed to operate here.  A VAT exemption is currently in place in the United Kingdom.  However, when the company registers here, it will no longer be able to avail of that exemption and communities across the country will have to fundraise for the 23% VAT on top of the &euro;2 million it costs to operate the service.  It is a challenge for Irish Community Rapid Response, ICRR, to raise &euro;2 million a year.  It should not be asked to raise another &euro;500,000 on top of that just to pay a VAT bill.  There is precedent on this issue.  The Irish Coast Guard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, are exempt from paying VAT.  This charity and communities across the country are fundraising for a vital air ambulance service that is fulfilling a commitment set out in the programme for Government.  I want an assurance that when this company re-registers here, it will not have to raise an extra &euro;500,000 just to pay VAT.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendments in section 22 is to ensure that the<i>status quo</i>is maintained in relation to those tax measures or reliefs in the event of a disorderly exit of the UK from the EU.  However, this has no bearing on the VAT treatment of goods or services received by a person, which I understand to be Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s main concern.  I note that Deputy Naughten appears to be concerned with the VAT treatment of helicopter services that are provided by a Cork-based air ambulance, which is run by the charity Irish Community Rapid Response.  Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s concerns appear to emanate from the fact that, post Brexit, the company operating the helicopter, which is currently UK registered, will have to register in Ireland and charge VAT on its supplies, meaning that Irish Community Rapid Response will be faced with an additional 23% VAT bill.  I am advised that the ICRR is registered with the Charities Regulator in Ireland.  Such charity activities are generally outside the scope of VAT and, therefore, many charities are not required to register for VAT or charge VAT in respect of the services they provide.  Nevertheless, it is important to note that VAT is a tax on consumption which applies to supplies made by a person and not to supplies received by them.  In this context, many charities incur VAT on the services they receive.  This is a feature of the VAT system itself, and it is not possible under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, to introduce an exemption based on services received, nor to introduce an exemption based on the recipient of a service.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware of the VAT compensation scheme we have introduced for charities, which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  This scheme seeks to reduce the VAT burden on eligible charities.  Under this scheme, charities that are registered with the Charities Regulator can claim for VAT on any expenditure incurred in relation to their charitable activities, except where the charity is already entitled to a refund, deduction, relief or repayment of that VAT.  The scheme entitles charities to claim a refund of a proportion of their VAT costs based on the level of non-public funding they receive.  Where the total amount of eligible claims from all charities exceeds the capped amount, which is currently set at &euro;5 million, claims will be paid on a<i>pro rata</i>basis.  This scheme will ensure that charities are at least partially compensated for the VAT they incur on goods and services received in the course of their activities. Charities can submit only one claim per year.  The scheme will reopen on 1 January 2020 for the submission of claims relating to expenditure in 2019.</p></speech>

This section of the Bill aims to maintain the <i>status quo</i>after the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, as does this amendment.  The Irish Coast Guard and the RNLI do not have to pay 23% VAT.  The Coast Guard is a private organisation which operates on behalf of the State.  The RNLI fundraises significantly across both this country and the United Kingdom.  Irish Community Rapid Response has to raise a substantial amount of money on an annual basis.  It has put that model in place and has fulfilled a commitment in the programme for Government.  It has signed a contract with a UK-registered company and everything is currently in order.  This particular charity is facing a substantial penalty of &euro;500,000 in fulfilling a programme for Government commitment purely because of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union.  All I am looking for is the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>.  This organisation did not go about this process for any reason other than to provide a service and ensure we have a rapid emergency air ambulance service across this country, which takes huge pressure off our ground-based ambulance service.  It ensures people are treated quicker and get to hospital quicker.  It addresses many issues we had due to the closure of many smaller hospitals across the country, yet it now faces a penalty of an additional &euro;500,000 because the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union.  We need to find some way to address this particular challenge.</p></speech>

The charity to which he refers will be treated in the same way as the Coast Guard.  VAT is charged on services that are purchased.  That is what happens with the Coast Guard and that is what will happen with this charity.  We need to get more information from the Deputy to see whether there is a particular issue here which would help us understand the problem with which he is dealing.  While he is correct that this section of the Finance Bill seeks to maintain the <i>status quo </i>for tax measures and reliefs, it does not have any bearing on the VAT treatment of goods and services received by a person.  It is our understanding that the particular company to which the Deputy is referring will be treated in the same manner as the Coast Guard.</p></speech>

In this case, as the charity does not have the competency to operate a helicopter, the cost and financial burden of meeting the relevant regulations would be phenomenal.  It has therefore contracted a company from the UK to provide this service.  As the company is based and registered in the UK, it is currently exempt from paying VAT.  After the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, that company will have to re-register here in order to be licensed to fly in this jurisdiction, and will have to comply with Irish VAT law.  As a result of that, the charity will have to pay an additional &euro;500,000 for the cost of that service.</p><p>This is money that is fundraised in communities across the country.  It is used, as the Minister knows, to provide a vital service that is needed.  The ambulance service has not seen the investment that was long promised across the country.  When smaller hospitals were closed, we were given numerous commitments about the provision of emergency ambulance services, which did not happen.  Here we have a charity that is prepared to fill the void and fulfil a commitment given in the programme for Government.  As a result of the UK exiting the European Union, it is facing an extra penalty of &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

I do not dispute that what he is saying is absolutely factually correct.  The difficulty is that the charity will not see the <i>status quo</i>being maintained.  The aim of the provision included in this section of the legislation is to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  My point is that that will not happen in this instance.  Unless there is a change to the existing law, we will have this problem.</p></speech>

We will have to discuss the matter further with the Deputy who could be correct.  That is the truth of the matter.  The consequence of what he is looking for could be that the charity might be treated differently from others registered in Ireland.  From a VAT law perspective, the truth is we cannot do that.  I do not want to engage in false pretences, but the consequence of what the Deputy is looking for might be that the company would have to be treated differently from others registered here.  Given that we are referring to an individual company and now that the Deputy has explained it in the way he has, I will have my Department engage with him bilaterally on the issue to see if we can provide clarity on it before Report Stage.  It is possible that we might not be able to do what he is looking for.  However, before we can definitively say this, we should discuss the issue before Report Stage.</p></speech>

As part of the first stage in this process, section 23 of the Finance Bill increases the rate of dividend withholding tax from the 20% standard rate of income tax to a rate of 25% from 1 January 2020.  The second stage of the process will be implemented from 1 January 2021, with the introduction of a modified dividend withholding tax that will utilise real-time data that are being collected under Revenue&rsquo;s newly modernised PAYE system and allows a personalised rate of dividend withholding tax to be applied to each individual taxpayer.  It is intended that the legislation for the new collection regime will be introduced next year in Finance Bill 2020, allowing Revenue time to engage with stakeholders who may be affected and to develop the new systems required to ensure the overall successful roll-out of the measure.</p><p>In order for the new system to be fully operational by 1 January 2021, the companies and intermediaries affected will need to have collected certain information in advance of that date.  I am, therefore, introducing a Committee Stage amendment in Finance Bill 2019 to oblige Irish resident companies and intermediaries involved in the operation of dividend withholding tax to take all reasonable steps to obtain and keep a record of the tax reference number for each person beneficially entitled to receive distributions from 1 January 2021.  The amendment will also require companies and intermediaries to comply with Article 5 of EU Regulation 2016/679 in the collection and processing of such personal data.  The amendment is being introduced to give the companies and intermediaries affected sufficient time to collect the data and the first step to ensure the new regime will be fully operational by 1 January 2021.  It is intended that the new regime will allow taxpayers to pay the right tax at the right time and significantly increase compliance levels of tax on income on distributions from Irish resident companies by further reducing the gap between the dividend withholding tax withheld and the final tax payable by the shareholders.  I, therefore, recommend the amendment to the committee.</p></speech>

I believe the Minister is on record as saying the average figure is about 15% on small holdings.  We know that as a result of double taxation treaties and because of the ability of investors to reclaim dividend withholding tax, in some cases they are paying as little as zero.  This relates to Irish real estate funds, IREFs. and also to real estate investment trusts, REITs.  It is important to say that when REITs were introduced in Ireland, they were sold on a different basis than they are today.  When budget 2013 was introduced - I was in the D&aacute;il at the time - we were told: "The introduction of REITs may also assist NAMA in deleveraging its portfolio and allow it to bring more sustainable activity to both the commercial and residential property markets."  It was suggested it would allow ordinary persons to invest in a portfolio - persons who would not usually be able to invest - and that their investment would be not safe but safer as a result of the putting in place of the REIT structure.  In reality, we know that that is not what is happening.  We know that there has been a huge property plunder taking place in the past few years.  Three REITs were founded in 2013 and 2014 - the Hibernia, Green and IREF REITs.  There is also the fledgling Yew Grove REIT that was established last year.  The level of market capitalisation of the REIT sector between 2013 and 2015 rose from &euro;874 million to &euro;2.5 billion.  As of three months ago, before the sale of the Green REIT, property portfolios were valued at &euro;3.7 billion.  Is that figure accounted for by the structure that allows the ordinary person to invest?</p><p> In reality, that is not what is happening.  We see what is happening from the analysis done by the Central Bank, which is that the investors this year are not like Joe Public, as had been claimed before 2013.  There was intense lobbying on the setting up of the REITs structure at that time, and serious players from property, investors and industry lobbied extensively from 2011 for their introduction.  Representations were made to the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Irish Stock Exchange, and high-profile public meetings were held.  Senior National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, officials publicly endorsed the introduction of REITs, and a number of lobbyists ended up working for some of the bodies, particularly NAMA where they managed portfolios that were eventually sold to newly founded REITs.</p><p> What we were told at that time is not what has happened.  The majority of REIT shares are not held by ordinary Irish people but by investors outside Ireland, the two biggest being domiciled in Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  This means that when distributions take place, as they have to, they take place where the dividend withholding tax will apply.  Theoretically, they are supposed to pay at 20%, but in reality, people with small holdings pay 15% and, in many cases, because of double taxation treaties and other measures, they are able to pay zero.  We need to tighten up on this, and while the Finance Bill tightens up on it to a certain extent, it does not go far enough.  When I argued for a dividend withholding tax of 20% as an introduction, I said that figure would need to increase to 33%, which is what capital gains tax is at this time.</p><p> We have the same situation with IREFs.  The total asset value of the Irish funds industry was &euro;4.2 trillion in 2018 and IREFs benefit from an enjoyable tax treatment in the form of the gross roll-up regime, which means there is no taxation within the fund regardless of the assets and the accumulation of value within the fund.  Taxation is only applied to distributions and we apply the dividend withholding tax of 20% because the vast majority of shareholders are non-resident.  They can also reduce this 20% substantially.  It is going in the right direction to change the rate to 25% but it should go a lot further and capital gains tax should be applied to these assets.  My amendment proposing to change the rate from 25% to 33% has been ruled out of order, but the Minister needs to give serious consideration to it.  There are also serious questions relating to REITs, though I welcome some of the moves we will deal with later.  They were about to pull a fast one and I will address this in more detail in the context of what we put into the Finance Bill two years ago.</p><p> The tax nature of these structures is causing problems and we cannot allow these funds to be exempt from tax on rent, from capital gains tax inside the fund, and from income tax while we only apply a withholding tax that they can reduce.  This has a huge effect as they have been buying up properties in what is an ongoing property plunder.  In five or ten years we will look back on this and ask how the Government allowed it to happen.  What some of these funds are doing is absolutely scandalous, as is the fact that we are benefiting from it through the tax code.</p></speech>

In regard to the dividend withholding tax, the anchor of 25% is to try to make it equivalent to where we would be from the point of view of income tax, where there is a 20% rate and a USC rate of 4.5%.  It is more in the nature of a compliance measure than a new policy measure because I am trying to make sure that the tax that should be paid as dividend withholding tax is paid.  The Deputy asked if the dividend withholding tax was paid in all REITs or IREFs, and he is correct that the tax is reduced further for those that receive income in other jurisdictions with which we have a tax treaty, which is a factor behind the levels of tax that are being paid by some who receive income from REITs.</p> <p>  When I sat in front of this committee a year ago, I said I would do two things.  First, I said I would get the Department of Finance to do some work for me to help us form a view on the impact these entities are having on the property market.  That was done and the findings were published.  Second, I said I would act on any advice in the aftermath of the Revenue Commissioners getting data on the levels of tax that were being paid.  I have done this with some of the changes I brought in on budget night.  Some of the behaviours and some policies that are being followed have to change, and that is why I am making the changes.  Some of the provisions of the Finance Act 2016 were introduced with particular objectives in mind, but I have become aware of the extent to which the objectives have not been met so I am changing the law to deal with that.  The Deputy may feel I should go further, but I believe the actions I have instigated in this Bill are powerful enough to deal with my absolute expectation that the entities that we are discussing pay taxes at the levels we expect.  I will keep this under continual review, particularly in the area of the operation of IREFs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#OO00300"><p>I acknowledge that there is progress here and I acknowledge the piece of work the Minister has done, which was as a result of an amendment I tabled to the Finance Bill this time last year.  The year before, we had met departmental officials and they were very helpful in looking at the introduction of a dividend withholding tax at 20%.  On many occasions, I have raised the issue of the tax that is being paid by these companies.  While it is right that the Revenue advises the Minister on this, some of the filings of these companies are publicly available.  It is very clear that some of these companies are paying effective rates of as low as 3%.  My frustration is that we are always two years after the issue.  This may be dealt with next year, but in the meantime, these funds are not sitting back but are gobbling up a huge amount of property and they have billions of euro of Irish property in them.</p> <p>  Later on, we will raise issues relating to the stamp duty effect.</p><p>Last year, in the Finance Bill, I argued for an anti-avoidance measure whereby a company that derives its profits from shares in property would not be able to avail of the 1% stamp duty rate.  We understand, however, that the REIT involved in a sale will be able to do just that.  This raises serious questions.  While we are making some progress in this regard, time is of the essence because these guys do not sit around.</p><p> The Minister stated that we need to make sure that these entities pay the appropriate level of tax but what is the appropriate level of tax?  These companies should pay capital gains tax and should not be exempt from the tax.  That is a frustration for me.  The exemption does not make sense, as the Green REIT sale brought into clear focus.  All the gains the company made were to be valued on the day of the sale, which meant there were no gains whatever based on the acquisition value.  It is not about whether these entities are subject to a tax rate of 20%.  The question is what level of tax they pay.  We can set the rate at 20% but these entities will not pay 20%.  They are institutional investors, not Joe or Mary living in Blackrock, Gweedore or Caherciveen.  They are institutional foreign investors.  They do not pay income tax as we know it because they are not resident in Ireland.  These institutional investors will be hit by the 20% dividend withholding tax but will reduce their tax bill, as the Minister has acknowledged, because of double taxation treaties.</p><p> How do we deal with that issue?  We can increase the rate of tax and the Minister has increased the rate of tax to 25% and set out his arguments for doing so.  There is no reason not to link dividend withholding tax with capital gains tax because these funds do not pay capital gains tax.  Why is the dividend withholding tax not set at the same rate as capital gains tax, as Sinn F&eacute;in argues?  That would not fully solve the problem because there are other ways in which these investors can reduce their tax bill and pay a lower effective rate.</p><p> There is a burning question in terms of policy.  I spoke about the lobbying that took place at the time and how REITs were being sold.  The impact can now be seen.  The tax status of these funds are without doubt allowing them to push up property prices.  There is no way that a company could afford to buy the type of property that these funds are purchasing in Dublin, for example, apartments costing in excess of &euro;500,000, if it was not for the nature of the tax structure.  It would otherwise be impossible and impractical to do so.  It is not their fault they are doing this.  It is our fault that they are doing it because, as a Parliament, we - again, I use the term "we" - are deciding to give them this tax benefit and structure.  When these entities buy properties at such prices, they set a level in the market that others then chase.  This is having a huge impact.  It is wrong and does not benefit us.  At the time, it was argued that these funds would help NAMA and allow for the ordinary Joe Soap to make safe investments in a diverse property portfolio.  That has not happened.  Instead, serious pressure has been put on individuals and Ireland's reputation has been damaged. </p><p> I welcome the amendment in terms of making sure that the companies which have to pay the tax are given reference numbers and so on.  The level of tax, at 25%, is what we are discussing in this section.  The Minister has argued that the rate should be aligned with corporation tax and USC.  It should be aligned with capital gains tax.  We are talking about property and these funds do not pay capital gains tax whereas all other companies have to pay capital gains tax.</p></speech>

I am using information that is available from the Central Statistics Office.  Its figures indicate there are approximately 126,000 apartments in Dublin and 210,000 apartments nationally.  Residential properties owned by REITs account for 2.38% of the total Dublin apartment stock and 1.4% of national apartment stock.  Figures on the ownership types in respect of tenancies show that, despite the growth in the scale of REITs which I acknowledge, the top 20 landlords in the country, including the different entities and institutional investors we are discussing, still account for around 3% of total tenancies in Ireland.  I take a different view from the Deputy.  While I acknowledge these entities have scale, on the basis of the figures I have shared with the committee, their scale and influence is lower than the Deputy has argued.</p></speech>

In relation to chasing things, most of the key measures I introduced were implemented on budget night via resolutions.  I decided that the appropriate way of dealing with this matter was to do so immediately.  Many of the measures that we may discuss later were implemented on the night of the budget.  I accept the Deputy's point that when addressing issues such as this, one can spend time chasing the issue because by the time one has dealt with the issue, something else will have taken its place.</p> <p>  On change within the sector overall, I repeat the point I made on budget day.  Entities such as these can and do play an important role in creating greater diversity in the building and purchase of commercial property and apartments.  I have certain expectations regarding how tax is paid in this sector.  My Department and I will keep this matter under review in the run-up to the next budget and Finance Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#PP00500"><p>To explain my view that the Minister has missed my point, while I do not doubt the figures he has supplied, not every apartment is for sale.  We have to look at the impact these companies are having on what is available in the market.  It is not just what is available but also what is about to become available because these entities are buying properties off the plan.  In terms of what is available, they have a big slice of the market.  As I said, a REIT is now the biggest landlord in Ireland and these funds are increasing in size.</p> <p>  We need landlords - that is not an issue - but normal companies operating under normal company rules would not be able to do what these REITs are doing because their business model would break.  They would go into liquidation and fail because they would not be able to buy apartments for &euro;540,000.  Any accountant would tell us that would not add up.  The only way the REITs are able to do that, and the reason we see headlines about the purchase price paid for some properties, is through their tax structure.  When big boys that can unleash that type of money enter a market in which there is not a huge amount of availability, it will obviously have an effect.  The only way these entities can do this is because of the tax structure.  They would not be able to do it if they were normal companies.  Normal companies registered in Galway, Dublin or wherever else cannot do what REITs are doing as they would be subject to all of the other taxation measures from which REITs are exempt.</p> <p>  As I said, we are moving in the right direction, albeit slowly and painfully, but the Minister is chasing his tail.  There is a bigger question here in terms of the types of funds that we have now operating in the property market and the taxation structure that allows them to do what they are doing. </p></speech>

I repeat the point I made regarding the number of measures I brought in on budget night to ensure they were immediately implemented.  I take the Deputy's point that we should look at the share of what has been purchased.</p><p>In parallel to looking at that, it is also the case that by forward purchasing particular forms of development, these entities make it more likely for that development to be built.  That is something we need to take into account in looking at this issue.  The Deputy draws a comparison between a "normal company" and a REIT.  At the same time, the REIT also has requirements on it that a normal company does not have.  For example, a REIT is required to distribute out its income in the way a normal company is not.  A REIT has a debt limit requirement in a way a normal company does not.  I have introduced many changes in this Finance Bill that will affect REITs that a normal company will not be subject to either.</p></speech>

REITs do not.  A company has capital gains tax to pay but REITs do not.  They have to distribute a certain portion of their income or of their proceeds.  The structure of this is the investors are foreign investors and, therefore, are only subject to dividend withholding tax that in some cases they are reducing to close to zero.  This is why we are discussing the issue of what the dividend withholding tax rate should be because we are dealing with this part in isolation.  The Minister mentioned we are dealing with what the appropriate rate of capital gains tax is but I would like him to clarify for me if he is suggesting that he will apply capital gains tax to a normally functioning REIT.</p></speech>

They will not be subject to capital gains tax.  We go back to the point that if they will not be subject to capital gains tax, then it is property that makes up REITs.  They are not buying shares in Apple or Google.  It is property that is making up REITs and, therefore, they derive the dividends they are disbursing as a result of either the rent roll they are getting from the fact that these are now some of the largest landlords in the State or the fact there is acid appreciation within the structure.  Of course we should be applying capital gains tax.  I have beaten this issue so we might come back to it next year and the Minister might agree with me on it one year later.</p></speech>

I am also aware of the potential effects of tax policy on demand in the marketplace.  I understand that.  We are all painfully aware of what happened the last time credit was a catalyst to things that happened in the property market that we are all searingly aware of but I am aware that credit is not the only catalyst to incentives in the property market.  I get that.  As Minister for Finance, I have to act in a way that I believe is proportionate and that reflects the expectations the State has on how tax is paid.  That is what I am aiming to do with the changes I have made.  The Deputy believes they should go further but he acknowledges changes that have been made.  I believe those changes are at the right level.</p></speech>

The Minister signalled on budget day that from January 2021 he would seek to bring in a modified dividend withholding tax regime, using real time data collected by Revenue under the new PAYE modernisation programme.  It was signalled that could involve a personalised rate of dividend withholding tax for each individual taxpayer.  Can the Minister confirm he is not legislating for that now and that it will be in next year's Finance Bill?  In arriving at a personalised rate of dividend withholding tax, I would assume, for example, that that could be a rate of zero for certain qualifying non-resident investors.  Will this work be conducted over the course of 2020?  What will it form part of?</p></speech>

Section 24 of the Finance Bill 2019 provides for several new measures to encourage micro or small-sized companies to undertake research and development activities and avail of the research and development tax credit.</p><p>One of these new measures provides for micro and small companies to submit pre-trading claims for the research and development tax credit, which is limited to offsets or repayments calculated by reference to payroll taxes and VAT liabilities for the same period.  A technical amendment is necessary to ensure the existing clawback mechanism for research and development tax credit claims, and the standard penalty regime, will apply correctly in the event of an overclaim in respect of this new measure for pre-trading claims.  I commend these amendments to the committee.</p><p> It may be of assistance to committee members if I now read the speaking note for section 24, which summarises the changes being introduced to the research and development regimes in this Bill.  I will also circulate the speaking note to the committee in advance of Report Stage.  It is the third speaking note we have agreed to circulate.</p><p> Section 24 of the Finance Bill amends the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act to provide for the research and development tax credit and for an accelerated capital allowance for expenditure on scientific research.  The primary policy objective of the research and development tax credit is to encourage companies to undertake high value-added research and development activity in Ireland, thereby creating high-quality employment and investment.  During the year, as part of the Department's initiative of focusing on tax incentives for smaller firms, a public consultation on the research and development tax credit was carried out.  As a result of this, I am pleased to say this section provides for a number of enhanced supports for micro and small companies to encourage greater uptake of the research and development tax credit by smaller firms.</p><p> The rate of the research and development tax credit for micro and small companies will be increased from 25% to 30%.  In addition, an enhanced and simplified method to calculate the payable element of the research and development tax credit based on twice the current payroll liabilities is being introduced.  I am also providing for pre-trading claims to the research and development tax credit, limited to offsets or repayments calculated by reference to payroll taxes and VAT liabilities for the same period.  These measures for micro and small companies are subject to a commencement order pending approval.</p><p> I am also making some amendments of general application to all claimants.  The limit on outsourcing to universities or institutes of higher education will be increased from 5% to 15%.  This will support the Government's policy of building the knowledge exchange system between industry and the education sector.</p><p> The section also provides for a number of amendments to improve the overall efficiency and administration of the tax credit.  With regard to section 765, these amendments limit the availability of buildings accelerated allowances to buildings or structures, the construction or development of which is scientific research.  It also provides that where a company may qualify for a scientific capital allowance and the research and development tax credit, both reliefs cannot be claimed in respect of the same expenditure.  This is addressed as an anomaly in legislation identified by Revenue.</p></speech>

We have debated quite a bit the distribution of the research and development tax credit.  The wider issue is that we need to look at what is happening in terms of small and medium enterprises and micro enterprises here.  They are not productive enough and I hope this move will be a support.</p> <p>  Last year, I also asked for what we referred to as a research and development light application process, similar to what is in operation in the North.  Has that been legislated for?  One of the concerns of companies is that going through the process is very cumbersome and difficult.  They go through the same process as some of the multinationals.  There is also a risk with regard to clawback.  I ask the Minister to clarify this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.629" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#SS01500"><p>We have not introduced the process the Deputy has described that takes place in Northern Ireland.  We have tried to make a number of changes to make it easier for these smaller companies to apply for the changes we are making, but the broader changes to which the Deputy referred a year ago are not part of this in terms of the application process.  Of course, if I had said "Yes", God knows what trouble I could have got into with the Acting Chairman, but that is not the reason we have not done it.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy's broad point, in recent days the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, published an OECD survey on entrepreneurship in smaller companies in our economy.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of it.  It points to two issues of concern to me.  The varying productivity levels in our economy are now becoming quite pronounced.  We have many different companies at the very frontier of productivity, not only in Ireland but throughout the world, because of the nature of what they are doing.  We have another cohort of companies that tend to be indigenous and smaller, and not only are they significantly behind the first group, as one would expect, they are behind the average.  We are going to have to find a way to address this.  I hope that what we are doing here will be part of the answer, although there are a number of measures we will need to continue and new measures we will need to take.</p> <p>  I want to see and encourage more and more of the people working in the very large companies at the frontier of productivity and new forms of technological development in Ireland setting up their own companies in Ireland.  I am seeing encouraging signs of this happening, but we have a way to go.  What is driving the changes that came out of the public consultations we did earlier in the year is trying to find new ways to provide smaller and micro companies with an opportunity to get at least some of the supports that tend to be associated only with the very largest companies.</p></speech>

Is there a particular reason the Department did not look at the system in the North?  Perhaps it did look at it.  It uses a different template and process for applying for the credit.  Why it is not being introduced in the Finance Bill?  Is it something the Minister will keep under active consideration?</p><p>As a result of talking to businesses and business representative bodies, I am aware that this is one of their concerns.  Maybe that is flagged up in the consultation.  I am not sure since I am not familiar with the report.  It is being said to me directly.  Those who administer applications for research and development for companies on both sides of the Border will state that the process here is difficult and challenging compared with that which applies in the North.</p></speech>

That could be one of the matters to which the Deputy is referring.  I understand that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is beginning to review the nature in which some of its credits are available up front, because it wants to ensure that credit is being drawn down against activity that meets the definition of the activity the credit is for.  I am happy to look at the roll-out of this.  We have made other changes over time, especially to the KEEP scheme, which we brought in with the explicit objective of trying to benefit smaller companies.  It has turned out that the drawdown has been some way short of what we expected.  We will monitor this over the next year and if there are any lessons in respect of how it is being drawn down on which we need to act.  I am sure that I, or the Minister for Finance of the day, will do so.  The issue of how we can ensure that more of our smaller companies are engaged in higher-value research and development activity will be a significant area of focus.  We will have to keep the roll-out of this change under review.  If further changes are needed, I am sure they can be examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.633" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#TT00300"><p>One point that has been made is that for a small or micro-company involved in research and development and claiming this credit, there is a clawback scenario that can occur.  If that company, which is not trying to scam the system, falls foul of the technical rules, that clawback could have a serious impact on it.  The suggestion is that many of them just stay away from it because the risk is too great.  If the company thought that it was availing of this and then found that it was not entitled to it after spending money on what it believed was eligible research and development activity, it would have a detrimental impact on the company, given the size and nature of the small and micro-companies that we are talking about.  Is that something that has concerned the Minister or been raised?  I ask him to keep this under consideration.  We are moving in the right direction but we need to go a bit further because, as the Minister acknowledged, we are way behind the curve in some areas.  I made the point before that while every bit of foreign direct investment is welcome, if we stripped that away from the Irish economy, the picture behind that does not look too pretty.  Some of it is excellent but some is not pretty when measured against our competitors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#TT00400"><p>Some is excellent but there are other parts that have some distance to go with regard to productivity.  Clawback is not an issue which has been raised with us in the consultation seminars that we have done or the engagement that I have had with my team about it.  A clawback provision is in place if the credit ends up not meeting the needs that Revenue has for it.  We will have to keep this under review.  It is an important departure from research and development tax credit policy and it is justified.  My intention is that the share of value that smaller companies have of the total research and development tax credit will increase.  We will have to see how that works out over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

The purpose of the formula in section 497(3) is to enable a company availing of EII to identify an amount that would be in excess of the annual allowable investment limit of &euro;5 million such that the excess would not be a qualifying investment.  If a company was to use the formula as it stands, it would never result in an excess being identified.  This is incorrect, as an excess will always exist if the aggregate investment in a 12 month period is greater than &euro;5 million.  The amendment will correct this and will allow a company identify an excess that may exist.</p><p>Similarly, the purpose of the formula in section 497(4) is to enable a company availing of EII to identify an amount that would be in excess of the lifetime allowable investment limit of &euro;15 million, and once more than that, the excess would not be a qualifying investment.  In light of the current formula, if this was to be implemented in practice, an excess would not be identified.  The proposed amendment seeks to correct this by ensuring that Revenue looks at the greater of the lifetime limit or the total investments made, therefore ensuring, should it exist, that an excess is identified.</p><p>I take this opportunity to inform the select committee that I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to modify the current requirement in the Bill that an investor must hold EII shares for ten years or more in order to avail of tax relief on a maximum qualifying investment of &euro;500,000.</p><p>On amendment No. 30, EII is a state aid measure operating within the European Union's general block exemption regulations and as such, it applies to all regions in the State.  A regional variation of EII would require separate state aid approval from the European Commission.  The package of measures that I have brought forward is meant for all regions of the country.  While I absolutely appreciate the importance of the EII scheme to the midlands, I am also aware, as Deputy Denis Naughten's amendment identifies, of the very particular challenges that peat regions are facing in the Deputy's constituency and others in the midlands.  I hope he is aware of the efforts that we have under way to deal with some of that, some of which will be funded by the change in carbon pricing.  I cannot vary the effect of the EII scheme based on county.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.639" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#TT00900"><p>I thank the Minister for his comments.  I know that this matter is close to the Acting Chairman's heart.  My amendment seeks to provide an enhanced tax relief for job creation in the midland counties that have been directly impacted by the cessation of turf cutting.  Those counties include Roscommon, Galway - the eastern part - Longford, Offaly, Westmeath and Laois.  The EII should probably be examined.</p><p>I accept that the current scheme is a broad one covering the whole country but I believe we should consider making a separate State aid application in respect of the affected counties in light of the significant employment losses they face.  Effectively, the Dublin equivalent of the decision being made in the midland counties would be Google deciding tomorrow morning to pull out of Dublin lock, stock and barrel.  That is the scale of the impact across the middle of the country.  The big difficulty is that if Google moved out of Dublin tomorrow morning, alternative enterprises would come in to fill the void very quickly.  This is not the case across the midland counties.</p><p> We recognise the challenges in attracting foreign direct investment to our region, including its towns.  The best way we can support the indigenous economy is to support existing businesses in expanding and encourage start-up businesses to locate in our counties.  We face 2,000 direct job losses in 33 days time.  The PSO for Lough Ree Power will expire on 9 December and it will expire on 31 December for west Offaly power stations.  Approximately 2,000 indirect jobs across the midland counties will be affected.</p><p> I accept the Government's support and investment.  I publicly welcome it and thank the Minister for his engagement in that regard.  The reality, however, is that the State will never be able to put in resources at the scale needed to compensate for the job losses.  While we can provide incentives and create the necessary environment, and while the fund being put in place to provide the required seed capital is very welcome, the reality is that we need to deliberately encourage private sector investment across the counties.  The only way we can ensure that investment takes place in our region, rather than in the congested Dublin area, is to put some type of incentive in place.  As the Minister knows, the region has been accepted as part of the EU coal regions.  It is receiving a special designation and recognition at EU level.  From my engagement with the Commission and having been a member of the Council of Ministers, I am aware that there is a sympathetic view of and approach to the coal regions and the peat region in Ireland.  I accept there cannot be a major differential in supports in various parts of the country but I seek small alterations to the EII that would ensure an investor considering where to invest would actually think of the midland counties first.  I refer to supporting indigenous local businesses first rather than adding fuel to the economic fire in Dublin.  This could help to provide some of the counterbalance needed away from the city of Dublin because of its housing and congestion problems and commuting challenges.</p><p> Within the taxation system, we need to acknowledge the challenges faced across the midlands in replacing the jobs about to be lost in Bord na M&oacute;na and in addressing the longer-term impact on existing businesses.  There is a need to ensure that we provide jobs not only for those in Bord na M&oacute;na today but also for the next generation.  Taking action in this regard could result in some emigrants from the region coming back and taking up a job if it becomes available, or perhaps starting their own businesses.  A small alteration to the EII would be very positive.  What I am looking for is a report.  A report is needed on some types of taxation supports that would encourage private investment in the midland peat counties.  I am open to suggestions but it is important to consider a unique taxation approach.</p></speech>

Look what happened.  The Deputy knows I cannot say there will be a particular tax rate or change for one group of counties and not for others.  I simply cannot make taxation, particularly taxation related to the creation of income and employment, county specific because every neighbouring county would quickly claim it wanted the same arrangement and that it was being penalised.  The dominoes would begin to fall.  What we can do is prioritise expenditure, and that is what we are doing.  We are prioritising the need for a fair and effective transition for the workers the Deputy represents who are now losing their jobs.  It is far more effective for us to be prioritising the use of resources through expenditure.  We can control and target that.  The Deputy will be aware of our thinking on how we propose to upgrade the energy efficiency of homes in the midlands, particularly local authority homes.  I am sure the Deputy will play a part in influencing it.  He will be aware of the work and thinking on what can be done with the peat plants that may no longer be used in the way they have been.  The Deputy is a former Minister, not to mention a public representative for the area in question, so he will be aware of the expenditure-related work that is under way to make progress on all these matters.  The communities he represents will play a role in influencing what we are seeking to do in the area.  I cannot even pretend that we are going to have tax measures that will relate to particular counties.  I have many other colleagues in the Oireachtas representing constituencies they know they will soon face the challenges faced by Deputy Naughten.  If I were to make tax policies specific to the Deputy's county, I would be in an untenable position.  All my Oireachtas colleagues would seek the same for theirs.  I understand the Deputy's desire to prioritise investment and change in particular parts of the country, including his, but I hope he can see the case for doing so through expenditure rather than tax measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#UU00500"><p>I thank the Minister.  I hear exactly what he is saying.  I accept and welcome the fact that there is expenditure in our region.  We are, however, talking about the equivalent of Google leaving Dublin.  The reality is that while the public expenditure is very welcome, it will not deal with a problem of the scale in question, not only in terms of the imminent threat to the economy but also in terms of the long-term outlook.  All we have to do is consider what happened in the valleys in Wales, which have become a rust bucket.  The same is happening in the United States.  The Minister will have seen the impact on the coal areas in the United States.  From his Council of Ministers colleagues, he will have heard about the political challenges faced in the coal regions right across Europe in dealing with this issue.</p><p>We have an opportunity in Ireland to lead by example and to show how we can provide that just transition.  However, to do that, we all must accept that we need to stimulate private sector investment across those counties as well.  We cannot solely rely on public sector expenditure in those areas to protect the many jobs that will be impacted.  We need to drive innovation and support the growth in employment in local small businesses.</p><p> I am asking that we would have a report to see how we could provide some innovative support.  I do not want a situation where, for argument's sake, we take funding or investment away from north Tipperary and bring it to County Offaly.  That is not my intention.  I am not talking about a major differential.  The reality, however, is that the employment investment incentive currently applies to the city of Dublin, where we need to calm down the economy and not add to the problems of congestion, housing, office accommodation and, now, even water, given that the Dublin area is experiencing in terms of water quality what we experienced for six years on the trot without any break.  Those infrastructure challenges that are in Dublin do not exist to the same scale in the midlands.  However, we require investors who want to invest to look to the midlands first.  I am suggesting that we nuance that support to ensure people would consider that first.</p><p> I do not believe I am being unfair in asking for a report to look at the potential options.  This happened in the past.  While I accept mistakes were made in the past, some very good decisions were made as well.  Very close to us here in Dublin, I think of the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, which was established on that very basis of geography.  We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

The first concerns the 40% that is to be claimed upfront in year one, as opposed to 30%, and then the 10% in year three.  The 10% in year three was subject to conditions laid out by Revenue in terms of research and development and job creation.  Do those conditions still apply and, if the relief has been paid out in year one, is there a clawback mechanism and how does it work?</p></speech>

Obviously, they looked for the 40% upfront and they also argued for micro support to mirror the seed enterprise investment scheme, SEIS, in Britain, which provides 50% for micro companies, given the volatility and higher risk in regard to start-ups.  I am interested to hear about this.</p></speech>

One of the four points that came out of the consultation, however, was that there should be the introduction of a micro SME similar to the UK seed enterprise investment scheme, including an enhanced investor return of 50%.  The British one provides a 50% return and exempts the shares from capital gains tax, which is to do with the higher risk of investing in a micro company as opposed to an SME.  It is not something I am really arguing for.  I am just interested in the consideration of that.</p></speech>

When we were making decisions in regard to the EII scheme, further changes were needed.  The issue the Deputy is referring to was brought up in the public consultation, but my view is that, given we had introduced the SEI scheme last year, I want to see how that is going to work before I decide if further change is merited for the EII scheme.</p></speech>

This followed quite a bit of criticism, it is fair to say, from some companies and sectors in regard to delays, documentation, getting approval and so on.  Now that has been up and running for a year, has there been an assessment of whether all of those issues have been ironed out so we are not seeing companies waiting 12 or 14 months or experiencing the challenges they were reporting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#VV01500"><p>There have been improvements.  I am not receiving the same level of complaint in regard to the operation of the scheme that I was receiving before the changes in last year's Finance Bill.  It has improved.  There is still a gap, however, in terms of explaining to companies the effect of the changes we brought in last year.  We still have work to do to explain what those changes are and explain to companies that this is a scheme they might be able to benefit from.  While it has got better, we still have work to do.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Naughten, there is no point in my being dishonest with him and committing to do a report that I am not going to do.  I am not going to be dishonest to either him or the committee in that regard.  If I make a tax change for part of the country, as the Deputy can appreciate, there will be a knock-on effect in that other counties will look for the same.  Even if I wanted to do it, from a state aid point of view, I would not be allowed to make a change on a level below our country.  Even if I wanted to do it, which for the reasons I have explained I do not, I would not be able to do it.</p> <p>  That said, given the analysis the Deputy has put forward in regard to the needs of those counties, I accept his argument.  There is little difference between the Deputy and me on the analysis.  With regard to the point he made that this is the effect of Google withdrawing from those counties and the fact we do not have another Google to replace it with, I accept his argument.  However, this is the reason that, in the change to carbon pricing we have made, nearly &euro;1 out of every &euro;3 of new money that will be raised by the higher level of carbon pricing is now being prioritised in line with the need for transition measures.  The counties the Deputy is referring to are the ones in which we are going to begin this work.  I cannot offer stronger evidence of our commitment to trying to respond to the needs he is raising than the degree to which we are prioritising the first year of carbon pricing revenue to deal with these issues.  I hope to have the opportunity to visit the affected communities.</p><p>The first test we will have to pass in carbon pricing is showing that it can have an effect in communities where employment is lost as a result of a change in the carbonised nature of the economy.  It is one thing to help people to deal with the effects of higher carbon pricing and another to help them to deal with the effect on transport.  The Deputy represents communities in which jobs are being lost.  They are part of the first test we have to pass in how carbon pricing will work.</p></speech>

Everyone accepts that we face a huge challenge in the region in trying to stimulate employment creation.  The public sector investment is welcome and I do not want to knock it, but if we are to create long-term sustainable jobs, we can only do so by growing and supporting existing and new businesses in the region.  I have made a suggestion in a constructive manner that we look at how we can get people to focus on and look at the region.  How do we do it if we will not do it this way?  As we all accept that it needs to happen, how will it happen otherwise?</p></speech>

It will happen through the local structures being put in place.  It will happen through the local authorities and local communities.  It will happen as a result of the fact that we have funding that will be used to try to lever private sector investment in local economies.  The funding to which we are referring will have a larger effect than relatively minor changes we could make to the tax code for which the Deputy is looking and which I cannot make under state aid rules.  To answer the Deputy's question about how we can do it in a different way, it is will happen through the agencies, the just transition commissioner, the LEOs and making use of the money that will be provided from the proceeds raised in having a higher level of carbon pricing.</p></speech>

Everyone accepted the merits of the schemes at the time.  We are talking about trying to rehabilitate the economy of a region that is about to be wiped out.  I accept that the provision would not have a massive impact on the level of investment, but it would be an indication from the Government that it wanted to see private sector investment in the area, particularly because of the unique challenges we are facing.</p></speech>

The living city initiative is a micro and deeply targeted scheme at neighbourhoods in a small number of cities.  While I completely understand why the Deputy might see it as being analogous to what he is looking for, there is no comparison with the level of scale.  We are talking about a small number of houses, whereas the Deputy is talking about large communities.  That is why we can do it, but we cannot do what the Deputy is looking for.</p></speech>

We have in the past introduced specific geographical schemes for cities and parts thereof, but when Google leaves rural Ireland, we can come up with reasons we cannot introduce such a measure.  The point I am making is we need to find some way to stimulate private sector investment in the region.  I will leave it at that because we are only going around in circles.</p></speech>

It was recommended that consideration be given to extending the rules to cover a wider range of transactions between associated persons, including non-trading transactions.  Domestic non-trading transactions involving associated persons chargeable to Irish tax in respect of the transaction will remain outside the scope of the transfer pricing rules.  This was provided for to address the concerns raised in the Coffey review about the potential impact on domestic intra-group financing.</p><p>Amendment No. 34 ensures the exclusion from transfer pricing rules of domestic non-trading transactions will apply, not only where the parties to the transaction are chargeable to tax but also where they would be chargeable to tax but for the fact that dividends received from Irish companies, paid from taxed profits, are exempt from tax.  The amendment ensures the exclusion will be available in respect of certain non-trading transactions involving a company the business of which consists wholly or mainly of the holding of shares in an Irish company.

Obviously, we are calling for a report because we cannot call for an amendment.  The Minister likes to talk sometimes about the importance of a broad tax base and this is one way of broadening the base by way of taxing financial transactions.  It is not solely or even primarily about raising revenue but about trying to curb speculative transactions which are of no social good whatsoever.  There are proposals for an EU-wide financial transactions tax to which the Irish Government is opposed.  Other European countries have already moved in the direction of a financial transactions tax.  </p></speech>

The proposed rate on exchanges of shares was 0.1% and the proposed rate for derivative transactions was 0.01%.  Since it was first mooted, Ireland has had concerns about the financial transactions tax proposals which are widely shared by other member states, including some of the countries participating in enhanced co-operation.  In line with these concerns, I continue to believe that the tax only makes sense if it applies on as wide an international basis as possible.  Otherwise, transactions will gravitate toward those financial centres which are not covered by it.</p> <p>  If Ireland was to participate in an EU-wide financial transactions tax, this would necessitate the abolition and replacement of our current tax, a stamp duty on financial transactions.  I am advised by Revenue that the yield from the Irish stamp duty of 1% on transactions in shares, stocks and marketable securities was &euro;420.7 million in 2018 and currently stands at &euro;326.5 million to the end of October 2019.  Instruments used in the financial services industry such as derivatives are generally exempt from stamp duty unless they relate to immovable property in Ireland or shares in Irish registered companies.  The financial transactions tax proposal is still being discussed by my Eurogroup colleagues and by the ten member states involved in the enhanced co-operation process, of which Ireland is not one.  </p> <p>  I am aware that a number of EU member states, like ourselves, currently operate forms of a financial transactions tax.  These include France and Italy, where such taxes are applied to shares in companies with market capitalisations in excess of &euro;1 billion and &euro;500 million respectively.  If such conditions were to be put in place here, it is likely that our ability to levy such a tax would be severely limited.</p> <p>  It is not possible to accurately estimate from data held by Revenue the yield of a financial transactions tax modelled on the proposed EU one.  Our concern is that we would be putting in place a tax on transactions which would likely leave Ireland unless such a measure was introduced at the same time across the EU, of which there is no sign at the moment.  It is for these reasons that I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

It says that it is not necessarily against the idea but that everyone would have to do it at the same time.  This is just an excuse to lag behind developments and to try to maintain our tax haven status.  The Government will always find an excuse.  When enhanced co-operation is taking place, for example, the Government is very pointedly not involved even though it is something that is happening on a cross-member state basis.  The Government then shifts the goalposts and says that it must happen all across the EU but it is not really interested in that happening either.</p> <p>  This is partly about tackling or moving away from the tax haven model of the Irish economy.  Profits from financial and insurance activities in Ireland last year amounted to &euro;23.8 billion.  That is a profit of &euro;625,000 for every single employee in the IFSC, which is an extreme outlier in terms of financial profitability and it points to the reality that Ireland is a major tax haven.  Ireland plays a particular role in the chain of tax havens around the world.  It is not the same as Panama, Bermuda or elsewhere but plays a particular role and part of that accounts for the size of our financial sector, which is absolutely out-sized.  This means that we suffer from the finance curse.  This amendment is about dealing with that.  We estimate that on top of the stamp duty, this measure would raise an additional &euro;209.6 million on an annual basis.  Clearly, there are lots of very good things upon which that money could be spent but it is also clear that this Government is not interested in that.</p></speech>

The clearest proof I can offer of the difficulty of making this happen is that a group of other EU countries have been involved in enhanced co-operation on this proposal for over six and a half years and it still has not happened.  Included within that enhanced co-operation procedure are countries that are many times bigger than Ireland with very large financial services sectors.  The clearest evidence that I can offer to Deputy Paul Murphy of the difficulty in making this happen is that countries that are committed to doing it - and Ireland is not one of them - still have not done so.  They have not done so because once they get into the nitty gritty of doing it, they run into the global complexity of the issue that I have described that affects Ireland or that I am seeing through an Irish lens, namely that in order to avoid losing investment, employment and the location of companies, it would need to happen on a global level and there are no signs of that at all.</p> <p>  Ireland is not a tax haven.  We have very clear tax policies which are independently implemented by the Revenue Commissioners.  We always have issues that we need to address to ensure that tax is being paid fairly and effectively within our country but we are not a tax haven.  The proposal that the Deputy has outlined here is not practical in terms of it actually happening for our country and as I said, countries larger than Ireland have decided not to do it.</p></speech>

Section 28 provides for a number of amendments to the tax regime for Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs, to ensure that the correct tax is paid in relation to the disposal of property by a REIT and to encourage long-term, stable investment in rental property.  One of these measures provides that where a REIT disposes of a property, it must either reinvest the proceeds in property assets or distribute the proceeds to shareholders within a two year period.  I am proposing an amendment to this provision to ensure that it is proportionate and operates as intended.</p><p>The amendment has two elements.  The first element provides that the proceeds from a disposal of a property can be used to repay any debt associated with the disposed property.  The second is to extend the reinvestment period to include the 12 months prior to the disposal, in addition to the 24-month period following the disposal of the property in which the REIT may reinvest the proceeds.  Following consultation, it has been advised that it is not uncommon for a REIT to acquire a new property before the disposal of a property, whose disposal is being used to fund or part-fund the new acquisition.  I commend the amendment to the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.714" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2019110500002#YY00400"><p>I will make my point on the overall issue.  My concern about this section, which deals with REITs, is the tax that will be paid now on the disposal of property.  It will not be capital gains tax at 33% but, presumably, class 4 corporation tax at 20%, which is not what other companies would pay if they were disposing of properties.  This refers back to my earlier comments.  This is property being disposed of by a type of company or structure where any other company would have to pay capital gains tax on it.  The amendment I tabled, which was ruled out of order, proposes that capital gains tax should apply regardless of whether it is being reinvested into the company.  That is what applies to any company involved in property transactions.  I feel strongly about this but I will not say anymore about it because I rehearsed it earlier.</p> <p>  With regard to section 28, I welcome the closure of this loophole, which requires a REIT to be in operation for 15 years.  I made my point on Second Stage and I will repeat it now.  Let us consider the reality if the REIT is in operation for 15 years and take the example of the REIT that is currently involved in a sale, Green REIT to Henderson Park, of &euro;1.3 billion of assets.  Let us say it was operational for the past 15 years.  That would mean those assets could be valued at the date of transaction and, therefore, there would be no capital gains to be paid on the transaction.  That is what is happening at present.  The Minister is introducing this measure which, I guess, would have an impact in respect of the sale to Henderson Park, but it should apply even if the REIT is operational for 15 years.  If a REIT is getting out of the market, selling its assets and it is not going into another REIT, why would we allow capital gains tax not to be applied in respect of the significant uplift that happened?  In the case of Green REIT, the appreciation of the assets within that fund structure is &euro;300 million and the capital gains tax that must be paid as a result will be &euro;100 million.  When this measure was identified on budget day, there was no attributable income.  Can the Minister confirm that the measure will bring in anything up to &euro;100 million or can he give us an indication of where it would apply?</p> <p>  The reason I ask is that we need to know as legislators, as this is highly technical, if there is some other loophole here that allows for this sale to go through without capturing it.  I presume that this is about capturing a REIT that is only in operation for four or five years, is now disposing of all its assets and is able to use that structure to secure a huge win for its investors of up to &euro;100 million.</p></speech>

It is proportionate and is related to the fact that my predecessor and I always stated that the reliefs made available to the REIT sector were made available on the expectation of its long-term operation.  The changes I have made here are driven by that broad policy consideration and my intention to follow that through to the end.  That is the reason I made these changes.  We touched on the issue of capital gains tax, the level and whether it should be paid here.  I have given my view on that but probably will do so again.  However, the Deputy asked two quite technical questions and, if the Acting Chairman agrees, I ask that we go into private session and have the questions answered.  Then I am happy to continue with a debate on the policy choices.  Given the sensitivity of this matter, I wish to ensure the committee is given accurate answers on it.</p></speech>

ensure that the original holder of excessive rights provision is fully reinstated to the form it held prior to this year's Finance Act.  Section 29 provides for a number of amendments to the tax regime for Irish real estate funds or IREFs.  Amendments Nos. 43 to 49, inclusive, make a number of changes to section 29 as published.  As the amendments are quite lengthy, I will provide committee members with a longer speaking note to give as much detail as possible on the material contained in the amendments.  I will take members through the speaking note, which I will circulate to members along with a number of other speaking notes tomorrow.  What we are going through here is very technical.  If any Deputy wants to meet my officials in advance of Report Stage regarding any questions they may have about it or issues they want to be clarified, my officials are available to them.  </p><p>As the Deputies are aware, following a review of the first IREF financial statements filed earlier this year, Revenue have identified aggressive tax practices by some IREFs.  As a result of this, I have moved to introduce additional anti-avoidance rules and further compliance requirements into the IREF taxation regime as part of Finance Bill 2019.  A number of these measures were introduced via financial resolution on budget night.  </p><p>Section 29, as published, introduces new restrictions on the interest deductions that can be taken by an IREF in arriving at the surplus available for distribution.  Tax will now be payable at fund level on the excess interest.  As a result of stakeholder engagement following publication of the Bill, particularly with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I am proposing a Committee Stage amendment to allow relief from the resulting tax charge for interest paid on genuine third party debt.This amendment will ensure that the provision operates as intended to address excess interest charges on related party debt without acting as a disincentive to property development using genuine, arm's length, third party funding.  To ensure that this exclusion is only available for genuine third party debt, a robust and comprehensive definition of associated enterprise is being introduced in the new section 739KA contained in amendment No. 43.  The robust restrictions to the relief for third party debt are further supported by an anti-avoidance measure, which provides that the relief will not be available in respect of third party debt that is used to acquire property from a connected party.  There is one exception to this provision, namely, in certain circumstances where an IREF acquires property on which significant development has been carried out for the purposes of property rental.</p><p>Amendment No. 44 introduces a new provision to tighten the interest restriction rules by amending the definition of specified debt to ensure that it includes debt advanced to a partnership of which the IREF is a partner as well as debt advanced directly to the IREF itself.</p><p>Amendment No. 45 relates to the profit financing cost ratio introduced by financial resolution on budget night.  It corrects a technical anomaly in the formula that occurs in situations where an IREF has a loss.  It also ensures that for the purposes of the profit financing ratio, only the annual income profits are taken into account and not any realised or unrealised capital gains or losses.  As the profit financing ratio formed part of the financial resolution, the appropriate method to correct these issues is to introduce a new section 739LAA, as contained in this amendment.  In conjunction with this amendment to the profit financing ratio, amendment No. 45 provides for third party interest on the acquisition of a property to be included as an allowable part of the cost for the debt-to-cost limit ratio.  This is in line with the normal treatment of interest as an allowable cost for capital gains tax purposes.  These amendments will not compromise the financial resolution and will take effect from 1 January 2020.  Amendment No. 45 also includes two provisions required to prevent any unintended consequences to the charge to tax now being at fund level in certain circumstances.  The first ensures that the rate of tax levied on the IREF as a result of the new anti-avoidance measures is 20% regardless of the underlying legal form of the IREF.  The second ensures that transactions with an IREF do not come within scope of the transfer pricing exemption that will apply to certain domestic transactions between entities within the scope of Irish tax.</p><p>Amendment No. 48 relates to the measure in section 29, as initiated, which proposes to transfer an existing holder of excessive rights charge from the shareholder to the fund.  However, it has been determined that the provision as currently drafted would unintentionally result in an additional layer of tax and would remove the current ability for some investors to claim double tax relief in their home tax jurisdiction for Irish tax paid on their IREF profits.  A broad range of stakeholders have advised that this measure would negatively impact on current property development projects, including residential housing projects.  Officials have been unable to identify a method to resolve these issues in the legislation as currently drafted and, therefore, I propose to withdraw this provision from the Bill.  As a result, the holder of excessive rights charge will remain at the level of the shareholder, rather than the fund.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 49 provide for a number of corrective amendments that are purely technical in nature.</p></speech>

The Minister was not mincing his words when he stated it is deeply technical.  We will need his expanded speaking notes and we will look at the amendments further on Report Stage.  It will be too late at that Stage and the amendments need to be dealt with on Committee Stage, but some of this is extremely technical.  I welcome that the areas that have been spotted by Revenue are being closed down in terms of aggressive tax planning.

The majority of the amendments which I am proposing to the section correct drafting, cross-reference and typographical errors in the Bill, as initiated.  The remaining amendments address two minor issues that were identified following publication of the Bill and which need to be amended in order for the legislation to operate as intended.</p><p>Amendment No. 61 clarifies the definition of &quot;financing return&quot; in order to ensure the legislation provides a clear definition and is consistent with the related definition of a financial instrument.  Amendments Nos. 53 to 56, inclusive, relate to the application of anti-hybrid rules as they interact with worldwide systems of taxation.</p><p>The purpose of the new section 835AB being introduced in section 30 of the Bill, as initiated, is to ensure that the application of anti-hybrid rules does not give rise to a deemed hybrid mismatch where no mismatch occurs.  The amendment corrects small errors in language that occurred during the drafting process and ensures that the provision is effective in respect of other worldwide tax systems internationally in addition to the Irish worldwide tax code.</p></speech>

Local authorities are the regulators with responsibility for the drinking water quality of private water supplies, if I may make that distinction.  </p> <p>  As the utility supplying public water, Irish Water is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies meet the standards of the drinking water regulations.  Other suppliers including group water schemes and private suppliers are similarly responsible for the drinking water they provide.</p> <p>  The EPA's primary focus is to oversee Irish Water's response to drinking water quality failures.  However the agency also requires Irish Water to take actions to prevent drinking water quality failures from happening in the first place and is working to ensure that investment is prioritised for those water supplies that pose the greatest risk to public health.</p> <p>  Irish Water must notify the EPA of any drinking water quality failures and the agency then oversees Irish Water&rsquo;s investigation and their actions in response to the failure.  As part of the agency's role in drinking water quality investigations, it may audit drinking water supplies and treatment processes, issue legal directions, take legal prosecutions in certain circumstances, or place a water supply on its remedial action list.  The remedial action list was first prepared by the agency in January 2008 and is a dynamic list of public water supplies that the agency has identified as at risk and as priorities for remedial action by Irish Water.</p> <p>  I will briefly address some of the issues affecting the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  In its most recent report on the quality of public drinking water supplied by Irish Water published in September this year, the EPA found that the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards and 99.6% compliance with chemical parameters in 2018.  While this indicates that the majority of public water supplies are safe, further measures are necessary to improve the security of our supplies and avoid long-term boil water notices into the future.  The 2018 report set out a series of issues affecting the quality of the drinking water supplied by Irish Water that require action, namely, ensuring adequate disinfection of treated water, reducing the presence of trihalomethanes, THMs, in treated water, replacing of lead water mains and household pipes, eradicating persistent pesticide failures above the limit set out in the drinking water regulations, and establishing drinking water safety plans for supplies.  These issues have been recognised for a number of years and the EPA has recommended that Irish Water take a strategic national approach to them to prevent further drinking water quality failures.  The report also highlighted that cryptosporidium detections have increased in the past three years.  It was detected in 25 public water supplies in 2018, up from 17 in 2017 and 12 in 2016.</p><p>Cryptosporidium is a parasite found in human or animal waste and, if present in drinking water, can cause persistent diarrhoea.  Illness is often more severe in small children and elderly people and can be very serious in people who are immunocompromised.  If cryptosporidium might be present in a supply, appropriate treatment processes, referred to as a "barrier", must be put in place.  These barriers also serve to address certain other parasites, including giardia, which can give rise to similar illnesses, if consumed.</p><p> Adequate treatment is required at all water supplies where cryptosporidium has been identified as a risk.  It is not enough to have a barrier in place; it must also be properly operated and maintained.  At the end of 2018, the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list, RAL, included 15 supplies with inadequate treatment for cryptosporidium.  The EPA will continue to monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s progress towards ensuring that all supplies have an adequate barrier to cryptosporidium.</p><p> The issuing of a boil water notice is not a statutory function of the EPA but is done by Irish Water or a private water supplier in consultation and agreement with the HSE.  As the environmental regulator of Irish Water, the EPA emphasises that there is a need for boil water notices and other water restrictions, in certain circumstances, to protect human health.  During 2018, 44 boil water notices were in place in 14 counties, affecting more than 97,000 people.  This is an increase compared to 2017, during which 42 boil notices were in place, affecting more than 21,000 people.  The main reason for the increase in the number of people affected is that 65,000 people were on a boil water notice for three days in early 2018 when a disinfection failure occurred at the Vartry reservoir supply.  More than 13,500 people were also affected by 12 precautionary boil water notices issued due to Storm Emma in March 2018.</p><p> It should be noted that a long-term boil water notice is one that is in place on a supply for longer than 30 days.  Of the 44 boil water notices in place during 2018, 26 were short-term notices and were lifted within one month.  Five were long-term notices that were in place for longer than one year.</p><p> I want to turn now to the recent boil water notice affecting parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  In addressing this, I acknowledge this is an evolving situation and, if the Chairman allows, I will say a few further words on the current issues at the conclusion of my statement.</p><p> Irish Water informed the EPA at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October of a mechanical failure at Leixlip water treatment plant, which had occurred on Monday, 21 October.  The EPA participated in a meeting between HSE and Irish Water on the afternoon of Tuesday, 22 October to assess the risk this incident posed to consumers.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council, following consultation and agreement with the HSE, issued a boil water notice.  The boil water notice was a preventative measure and was necessary to ensure that public health was protected and consumers were not at risk from cryptosporidium or giardia, the microscopic parasites that can cause illness.</p><p> On Thursday, 24 October, EPA inspectors conducted an audit at Leixlip water treatment plant.  The purpose of the audit was to establish the full facts of the incident and the corrective actions taken.  It was also to verify the performance of Leixlip water treatment plant and to assist in gathering the information to facilitate the lifting of the boil water notice.  EPA inspectors also reviewed the recommendations of the agency's previous audit of 22 March 2019 and assessed the implementation of the actions taken to address those recommendations.</p><p>In the audit, the EPA inspectors found the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October, and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, when remedial works restored the affected production line.  The water treatment plant appears to have operated satisfactorily between 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October and the current issue emerging.  There was sampling of treated water for cryptosporidium and giardia in the critical period before, during and after this incident.  These samples indicated that the quality of water supplied following restoration of the production line was satisfactory.  A blockage in the coagulant dosing line resulted in operational difficulties with the water treatment processes and gave rise to elevated turbidity levels in treated water.  The elevated turbidity levels in treated water indicated a significant risk to the safety of the water supply because the treatment barrier for the removal of cryptosporidium and giardia was compromised and there was a risk of breakthrough of microscopic parasites into the water supply.  There was a failure to respond to multiple alarms that activated in response to the elevated turbidity.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council implemented automatic plant shutdown for the whole plant when turbidity alarms were not responded to within 15 minutes on 24 October 2019, the day of the audit.</p><p> While the Leixlip water treatment plant was resorted to a satisfactorily operating status following the incident, the level of treatment at this plant is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water, as further evidenced by the emerging situation.  In particular, there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Filter upgrade works are under way to reduce this deficit but will not be sufficient to confirm adequate treatment.  In its October audit report, the EPA recommended that ultraviolet disinfection be considered by Irish Water as an additional treatment barrier to inactivate cryptosporidium and giardia at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  As an ultimate failsafe, ultraviolet disinfection will inactivate any cryptosporidium and giardia parasite in the water supply to ensure the protection of public health.</p><p> The boil water notice in question was lifted by Irish Water at 4.30 p.m. following meetings on the afternoon of Friday, 25 October, between the HSE and Irish Water and between the HSE, Irish Water and the EPA.  During an audit of the Leixlip water treatment plant in March 2019, the EPA highlighted the risk of this type of incident occurring, following a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the plant, and recommended that plant operators respond immediately to any alarm generated, and that if an operator failed to respond to an alarm, that Irish Water should ensure the plant automatically shuts down to prevent inadequately treated water being supplied to consumers.  In May, in response to that audit, Irish Water confirmed the plant would automatically shut down when an operator failed to respond to an alarm.  The EPA audit on 24 October found the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented on one production line at the Leixlip water treatment plant in April 2019 and was only implemented on the remaining two production lines at the plant on the day of the audit.  The EPA's report following the audit on Thursday, 24 October, was published on 30 October on the EPA's website.</p><p> As committee members are aware, there is an emerging issue at the water treatment plant in Leixlip and I will take this opportunity to advise the committee on the EPA's engagement on the issue at this point.  Yesterday morning, 4 October, Irish Water advised the EPA there were operational issues at the plant over the weekend.  On Sunday, 3 November, two out of three of the production lines at the Leixlip plant were shut down from 1 p.m. due to high turbidity levels in the raw water entering the plant, attributed to the very high rainfall experienced on Saturday, 2 November.</p><p>This shutdown had depleted the reserves of treated water in the reservoirs and distribution network served by Leixlip.  Due to ongoing heavy rainfall yesterday, there continue to be issues with the quality of raw water entering the plant.  The increase in turbidity in the filtered water gives rise to a risk of breakthrough of the parasites cryptosporidium and giardia into the water entering the distribution system.</p><p> A meeting was held yesterday afternoon between Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the HSE and the EPA.  Following the meeting, Irish Water, in consultation with the HSE and having assessed the risk to public health, decided that a precautionary boil water notice was needed.  The Leixlip plant returned to water production from all of its production lines yesterday evening to ensure the continuity of the water supply.  Of course, it is vital that the supply be returned to safe production as soon as possible.  The EPA will play its role in verifying that the plant is operating safely, which will include an audit of the plant.  The appropriate time to audit will be when Irish Water and Fingal County Council are satisfied that the plant has returned to satisfactory performance.  The EPA's role will be to verify that performance before the boil water notice can be lifted.</p><p> I assure the committee that the agency will continue to provide regulatory oversight.  We are happy to answer whatever questions arise from our statement.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we are meeting in the midst of what is happening.  When we scheduled this meeting, it was intended to review the previous boil water notice in the areas in question and the broader issue of water quality.  I thank the EPA officials for attending during what is a busy time for them and the witnesses who will appear before us later.  However, it is important that we scrutinise the issue and get answers today.  With that in mind, our first questioner will be Senator Boyhan.  Due to time constraints, I will keep members' contributions to three minutes apiece.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.804" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#J00300"><p>I will be well able to do this in three minutes.</p> <p>  I thank the EPA, Fingal County Council and Irish Water for attending.  Their presence is important.  I will stick to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, which we had the advantage of having supplied to us earlier.  I will take him through three or four points.</p> <p>  This is a critical public health issue for people in areas served by this water supply.  More important, it is an issue of public confidence in the water supply chain and all those involved therein.  That is why we must deal with it.  I do not want to speculate or comment on press coverage; rather, I will deal with the facts that Dr. Ryan has just put on the record.  I draw his attention to page 2 of his statement, where he referred to auditing drinking waters and treatment processes and the EPA's capacity to issue legal directions and take legal prosecutions.  What directions has it made and what prosecutions has it taken in respect of the Leixlip plant?  He also referred to the EPA's remedial action list.  How is that progressing?  Will he make a copy available to the committee?  It is important that we fully understand it and see who has designated responsibility for the relevant actions.  He might also provide something charting the progress that has been made and the key people responsible for delivering the actions on the list.</p> <p>  Page 3 mentions replacing lead water mains and household pipes.  It is not a major issue for discussion today, but by raising it, Dr. Ryan has put it into this meeting's domain.  He might provide us at some future date with a progress report on the EPA's planned works for the changeover from lead water pipes.</p> <p>  Mention was made of cryptosporidium and related issues.  I would hate to think there was cryptosporidium in any water supply.  Dr. Ryan discussed the parasites that humans and animals can acquire from water.  Can Dr. Ryan tell us that there is no cryptosporidium in any water supply?  What affected water supplies does the EPA know of?</p><p>On the UV system, I am very familiar with it.  I know from work I have done in relation to it how successful it is.  In his opening statement, Dr. Ryan referenced a recommendation that an UV system be put in place.  Did that happen?  What was set in train?  The EPA made the recommendation in regard to the UV system and the likely success of it in killing off cryptosporidium and other parasites, etc.  Was there follow-up in regard to that recommendation?  There is no point in making recommendations if they are not followed up.  I ask Dr. Ryan to update the committee in that regard.</p><p> I thank the witnesses.  They have been very helpful.  If they cannot address any of the issues I have raised today, I ask that they would keep the committee apprised in regard to those matters.</p></speech>

I appreciate his assistance in keeping the proceedings on schedule.  I invite Dr. Ryan to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00300"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his questions.  On what legal action we have taken against Irish Water in regard to the Leixlip plant and the current incident, our primary focus is that the plant is back in operation and producing safe drinking water.  This is where all our focus and attention is at the moment.  This is evidenced by us auditing the plant, issuing our report, issuing the recommendations and working with the stakeholders to ensure that the boil water notice could be appropriately lifted.  There has not been a specific legal enforcement measure taken against the plant in regard to the incident.  We would have to give careful consideration to whether that is appropriate or if we have the powers to do that.  As I said, our primary focus is to ensure that the plant is back in operation and producing safe water for consumers.</p> <p>  On the remedial action list, we can make it available to the committee.  We track and keep it up-to-date.  It is very much part of our discussions with Irish Water.  It is focused around directing investment in putting in place appropriate infrastructure in priority areas to ensure that drinking water quality is improved.  It is important to mention that our reports in 2018 and previously show that the overall general quality of drinking water is very high, although, unfortunately, we have this very significant issue in front of us at the moment.  We will make the remedial action list and the current situation in that regard available to the committee following this meeting.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of lead.  We mentioned it as one of the priorities that we are tracking with Irish Water.  We will also provide follow-up on that to the committee in due course.  </p> <p>  With regard to the number of supplies that are currently at risk from cryptosporidium, we will make that list available as well.  Approximately 16 supplies on the remedial action list specifically reference a problem with cryptosporidium.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the installation of a UV system.  We have only just issued that recommendation to Irish Water.  We have given it one month to respond to that recommendation.  We understand that it would be a significant piece of infrastructure to install but we will await the response from Irish Water in that regard.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan has indicated that he would like to come back in, but I propose to call members in the order in which they indicated, following which those who wish to come back in for a second round may do so.  I have indicated the time constraints that we are all under such that we will all have to play to the same rules today.  I call Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.809" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00500"><p>I thank Dr. Ryan for his presentation.  To put this in context, we are asking questions today on behalf of not only the 615,000 people who are affected by a second boil water notice in two weeks, which are the most significant ever in this country to my collection, but many thousands of other people.  The witnesses are here to answer the public through our questions.</p> <p>  I have read the audit report of 24 October.  Like Senator Boyhan, I would like to touch on the recommendation regarding UV treatment.</p><p>According to the EPA audit report, "the level of treatment at this plant [Leixlip] is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water".  Dr. Ryan made that point again earlier.  Was the March 2019 audit the first time the EPA made this point, or does it go way back to the 2008 report?  While I acknowledge Dr. Ryan's clear statement that "the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards", these two significant outages have significantly rocked people's confidence in the water supply.  All witnesses must realise how angry, upset and concerned people are about this.  I will deal with more of that when representatives of the Department, Irish Water and Fingal County Council are in attendance.</p><p> Dr. Ryan has mentioned a recommendation that was made recently.  As far as I can see, it was made in March of this year.  Was that the first time UV treatment was recommended?  I am particularly concerned about the automatic shutdown now in place in Leixlip.  It is to be welcomed.  An automatic shutdown was recommended in March.  According to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, in May of this year, the EPA received a response from Irish Water to the effect that "the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented".  He is now saying that it was partially implemented only.  I ask him to comment on that.  I know it is in place now.  That is important.</p><p> As someone who is eminently qualified in this area and is certainly better qualified than me, will he explain what happens with the lag time when an issue is found?  I invite any of his colleagues who wish to come in on this matter to do so.  A couple of weeks ago, there was an outage following an incident that began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  It ran for 18 hours, in effect.  The plant was shut down at 10.15 p.m. on the Monday night.  Many people have told me that there is serious concern about contaminants getting into the system in the intervening period.  I know that those involved need to sit down for a meeting.  What happens in these circumstances?  Is Dr. Ryan happy that boil water notices are issued as quickly as possible?  That is the fundamental point.  I am asking about the current outage as well as last month's outage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.811" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#L00200"><p>I can confirm that March was the first time we raised the issue of UV disinfection.  It is only in recent years that we have been tracking the deterioration with Irish Water through sampling and measurement.  The number of giardia detections was one in 2015, one in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018, but there have been ten such detections so far this year.  There has been a deterioration in the infrastructure treating the plant.  We are now convinced that this is the right way to go.  We mentioned it in March.  We strongly recommended it in our October audit.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the recommendation that the plant should be shut down automatically.  When we came back, we found it was implemented on one of the lines only.  The audit finding was very much that the shutdown should apply to the entire plant.  It is clear that this was misunderstood.  This was remediated when we got back out there in October.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the lag time.  The current situation is evolving.  We are satisfied that we have been notified promptly.  We were involved in discussions yesterday on the implementation of the boil water notice.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the issue that arose in October.  Clearly, there was an operational difficulty that allowed a window of time to happen when remedial action could have been taken.  Alarms were not responded to.  It was not a normal or foreseen event.  The alarm is usually raised when there are operational or mechanical difficulties.  We are usually notified when there is an issue.  It is clear that there was a period of time the plant was operating even though alarms were ringing.</p><p>That said, once we are notified, we get involved in conversations with the HSE and Irish Water.  Public health is first and foremost in everybody's mind in that regard and, as such, the boil water notice was issued and precautionary measures, which I am sure will be addressed in detail by Irish Water, were taken, such as flushing out the system before the boil water notice is lifted.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's queries.</p></speech>

I welcome the comments of the officials and I am conscious of the role of the EPA.  I am tempted to say one does not miss the water until the well runs dry.  I am a former schoolteacher and recall a child being asked to make a sentence using the word "uisce" and coming up with "Uisce in&aacute;r saol: cosanta" or, in English, "Water in our environment: protect it".  That is the premise we must start from.  I was secretary of a group water scheme for 21 years and know the difficulties associated with large and small plants.  Information is critical.</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan referred to 99% or 99.6% of water being of perfect drinking quality after treatment, which is good news.  I am more concerned about whether the quality of water in our rivers and lakes is continuing to deteriorate, as I believe it is, and their role in that regard.  It has been suggested that flooding caused the problem in the Leixlip plant.  There has always been flooding.  When the officials from Irish Water appear before the committee, I will deal with a similar situation involving Irish Water in County Louth, where people have been on a boil water notice for 105 days.  Two reports issued by the EPA specifically deal with the Tallanstown group scheme.  I am sorry to widen the discussion, but this issue does not just affect the 600,000 people impacted by the problem in Leixlip.  It is just as important for the 600 people affected elsewhere or the 92,000 who were on boil water notices last year.  As the EPA officials pointed out, that figure increased from 21,000 the previous year.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the quality of drinking water.  Does the EPA have confidence that when it carries out an examination and reports to Irish Water and local authorities, those bodies take action on issues arising?  My experience is that one can tell the bodies what needs to be done, but no action is being taken.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  How effective is the reporting of those bodies to the EPA regarding its recommendations?</p> <p>  One may think I am naive but that is not the case.  I refer to two drinking water audit reports in my local authority area.  It is alarming that it took 12 days for a boil water notice to be issued when the water was known to be contaminated.  This issue is as important to the people I represent as the members who are concerned about the issues in Leixlip.   I ask the officials to address that point.  It goes back to the point raised by Senator Boyhan regarding action in terms of legal responsibility and the remedial action list.  I would like the committee to be provided with that information.  More important, I ask that the EPA officials meet representatives of each local authority and Irish Water twice a year to keep people informed.  I was not informed by the EPA or Irish Water that the two reports to which I referred were available.  They were not mentioned to me in my myriad communications on the matter or to any other public representative for County Louth.  I am not blaming the officials for that, but I want to know how effective are their recommendations regarding what action is needed in the interests of protecting public water supplies.</p></speech>

Our water quality in Ireland reports are produced on a three-yearly basis and we also produce an annual water indicators report.</p><p>We saw some improvements to about 2012 but they have been declining since.  We expect the next three-year report will be out within the next quarter or two.  We will have the overview then.  We did and still do assist the Department in its river basin management planning, which looks at that work, and we provide the evidence on which it develops the plans for all the stakeholders to implement.  There has been a decline in overall water quality in rivers and lakes over the last decade.</p><p> I refer to the question of our confidence in Irish Water following up on the actions we require of it.  In our audit reports, we set out our recommendations.  We give Irish Water a month to respond to us and we find that, as one would expect if there are number of recommendations, some of them will need to be dealt with immediately and some of them will take a certain amount of time and investment to be delivered.  It provides us with a response to the audit recommendations and then we track that every quarter and we get a response from Irish Water on all open cases once every quarter.  We track each of the individual actions that have been set out in our audit reports, and as they progress, if we find there is an unacceptable delay, we have the ability to go back out and issue a legal direction to it undertake to either provide us with the action plan for delivering on the action or to carry out the specific action within a specified time.  We actively track that and we actively ensure the actions we seek are being undertaken.  It is part of my work programme to do that on a continuous basis.</p></speech>

I have eight questions but first I want to put on the record that it is precisely on an occasion like this that the value of the Environmental Protection Agency is proven and I want to commend the witnesses on the audit reports, which are short, concise, clear and easy to understand for those of us who are not specialists.  It gives us a fully independent view of the facts, and that is enormously valuable, both to us on the committee and to the members of the public.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses take us through what happens after the EPA issued the March-April 2019 report in some detail in terms of its engagement with Irish Water or with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  Is there a mechanism for escalating that engagement if there is a feeling, as the months progress, that the recommendations are not being acted on in an appropriate timeframe?  I am particularly keen to know if at any stage the Department is involved in that process if the EPA feels Irish Water is not responding properly.</p> <p>  If the eight recommendations outlined in the March-April report had been fully implemented before October, would it be the EPA's view that the October incident and subsequent boil water notice would have been avoided?  That is an important question the public has a right to know the answer to.  There has also been quite a lot of public debate about whether this is an operational issue, a management issue or an investment issue.  I know it does not have to be one of those issues in particular or the other, but I would like to know, particularly with respect to the October event, now that the EPA has done that audit, whether it was primarily an operational issue or as Dr. Ryan seems to indicate in the opening remarks, might there be some investment upgrade issues there as well?</p> <p>  On the basis of the information we have about yesterday, there seems to be a different cause to what took place.  Maybe the witnesses could compare, in as simple and non-technical language as possible, the October event and the November event, albeit the EPA has not done an audit yet for what took place yesterday.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  One of the things I am confused about is that this plant has received considerable funding for significant upgrades.  It was upgraded in the 1990s and there was an additional upgrade in 2014 of about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million so there has been a little bit of a public debate about this being an old plant.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of this?  Is it that there is an older part and a newer part of the plant?  Where are the problems?  Again, I ask them to do so in as clear a manner as possible.</p> <p>  I am concerned by a bit in Dr. Ryan's opening statement.  It seems to be a little bit different from the version I have.  On page 6, it says: "the Leixlip Water Treatment plant is now operating satisfactorily."</p><p>However, the opening statement then goes on to say there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Dr. Ryan went on to say that there are upgrade works under way but when they are completed, if I understood him right, those works will not be sufficient to address the problem.  Can we have more information on that and what would be required in terms of works and their possible cost to ensure the public would have confidence that these kind of issues are not going to be repeated?</p></speech>

I am going to ask Dr. Minihan to address as many as she can.  We will then come back and pick up on any of the other overarching questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle Minihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#O00300"><p>If I might begin by addressing the Deputy's question about the follow-up on the March audit, the EPA did follow up on the audit.  We received a response from Irish Water on 3 May which set out the actions it had taken to address each of the recommendations in our March audit report.  As part of that, we are continuously tracking Irish Water's implementation of our audit recommendations via an open investigation file, which an inspector continuously monitors.  In that response, Irish Water committed to completing certain works by specified dates.  We tracked the progress of those works and we have been concerned with slippage identified by Irish Water.  For example, in the response of 3 May to the March audit, the filters were due to be upgraded by quarter 4 of 2019, the end of this year.  That has now slipped to quarter 2 of 2020.  We have continued to monitor and engage with Irish Water to address that slippage and engage continuously to see what the problems are around it.</p> <p>  If I could come back to the Deputy's question about how there seems to be a difference between the October event and that of yesterday, he is correct.  October's event was a blockage in a chemical dosing line which meant the water was not being treated correctly for a period.  There was also a period in which alarms were activated and not responded to.  I think the Deputy's question related to whether, if our audit recommendations from March had been put in place, the October event could have been avoided.  Our October audit report clearly called out that if the automatic shut-down had been put in place across the entire plant as was recommended in the March audit report, we believe the incident itself would have been avoided in October.  That action, the automatic shut-down of the plant, is the fail-safe which ensures that whatever happens, if an alarm is not responded to the plant is shut down and cannot produce water that is possibly unsafe or contaminated.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.826" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#O00500"><p>I live in Leixlip and we have always had our water supplied by the Fingal treatment plant.  It has been expanded to provide water to other locations in recent years as it has been augmented.  I do not remember there ever being a boil water notice at that plant.  This is the first time and it has happened twice in a few weeks.  What is different about Leixlip in terms of the Liffey is that while Poulaphouca is supplied closer to the source, Leixlip takes its intake further downstream.  Upstream to that there are sewage treatments plants and pumping stations.  We have become accustomed to keeping an eye on the river and if there is a grey look about it we would be concerned.  Was there an issue in respect of the intake?  One reason that was given was the very heavy fall of rain, which is not unique as I think we will all accept.  What is the nature of this discolouring?  Is it internal or external?</p><p>Is it correct that there are three production lines, one of which is old and two of which are new?  Was the plant designed to allow them to be separated, or can that be done?  Why is the output of the entire plant, both the new and the old sections, contaminated?</p><p> Finally, I refer to the spillage upstream at Osberstown wastewater treatment plant in March.  It might have been caused by one of the pumping stations.  Are there holding tanks at the pumping stations in case of failures, as opposed to at the treatment plant?  The volume of that spillage, 12,300 cu. m, translates to something in the region of 600 lorry-loads.  It was huge.  What is the additional dosage when that happens, and what is the communication between the two plants like? </p></speech>

I will divide them if the Chairman does not mind.  It has been reported to us that the heavy rainfall has caused a turbidity issue with the water from which the plant has been abstracting during this incident.  We have not carried out our audit yet, but we will be going to the site in the next couple of days to fully assess the issues.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council will be able to provide chapter and verse on the plant itself.  Perhaps Dr. Minihan can provide a precis.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that the Paterson Candy plant was completed in 1974 and upgraded in the 1990s.  The Mahon and McPhillips plant was completed in 1988.  They make up what is referred to as the "old plant" at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The new plant, which is referred to by Irish Water as the "AECOM plant", was completed in 2014.  That is the distinction between the old plant and new plant.  The Deputy asked if it was possible to separate output from the old and new plants.  Separate streams come out, but the treated water is combined into one flow of treated water as it leaves the plant.  One of the questions discussed at the time of the first boil water notices was whether we could definitively tell where water from the PCI plant was going.  Because that water is all blended, with water from the old plant and the new plant leaving Leixlip and feeding the network as a single flow of water, it is not possible to do that.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that a sewer is a pipe of a certain diameter and it can fill up.  If there is no separation between rainwater and the sewage flowing through the pipe, capacity can be exceeded and there can be a combined sewer overflow.  In many cases, this overflow reaches rivers and waterways.  It tends to be more diluted than raw sewage because of water flowing through the pipe.  Part of our March audit examined these issues.  Our audit report included a specific recommendation for Irish Water to draw up a documented protocol for communication between Osberstown and Leixlip wastewater treatment plants so that operators would be alerted if there was an issue.  That is what happened.  My understanding is that the protocol is now in place if overflows occur.  It is absolutely true that if water is taken from a lowland location at the back end of a catchment close to the sea, it is more likely to contain material from agriculture, industry and towns and villages.</p></speech>

Now it is my turn.  I will begin with the deficit we now have.  Witnesses have described it as effectively constituting an ongoing deficit.  Even with the completion of the upgrade works, there will still be a deficit.  In Dr. Minihan's view, are the current outages a hangover from the previous round of outages?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.834" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle Minihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#Q00100"><p>The fact that the filters in the old plant need to be refurbished indicates that additional treatment is required there.  A plan is in place to replace each of the 12 filters but they can only be replaced two at a time if we are to allow the plant to continue to produce water.  The timeline for their refurbishment has slipped to quarter 2 of 2020 and there will be a treatment deficit until their refurbishment, in terms of the quality of raw water extracted from the River Liffey as compared to the requirements.  Our audit report included the recommendation to install ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant as this would provide assurance for a water supply that serves over 600,000 people.</p></speech>

How long will it take to implement such a measure?  People are concerned about the current outage and would like some reassurance over the suggestions that it will be ongoing until quarter 2 of 2020.  When could an ultraviolet programme be put in place?</p></speech>

Irish Water received the audit report on 30 October and it has a month to respond.  This month will give Irish Water the opportunity to assess what additional treatment it plans to put in place and what the feasibility of ultraviolet disinfection is, as well as a timeline.  Once we receive a response, we will consider it and determine whether any timeframe is appropriate.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Ryan disappointed at the fact that the March-April audit recommendations were not implemented fully?  He referred to it as a misunderstanding.  How could such a misunderstanding have arisen?</p></speech>

We are satisfied that it was a misunderstanding.  We are disappointed because our recommendation was for a fail-safe shutdown of all of the plant, which clearly did not happen.  Irish Water has now taken remedial action and an automatic shutdown is in place as of 24 October.</p></speech>

He said no legal enforcement may be required.  He went into the history of it a bit and said he had doubts about the powers in respect of taking such action.  I am a bit concerned by this.  Dr. Ryan is telling us that he has doubts about the EPA's powers to take a prosecution.  In the case of the Leixlip plant, he said no legal prosecution has ever taken place on this particular issue.  That is a major concern to me and to the public.  Can he clarify whether I misunderstand or am misquoting from what Dr. Ryan said?  If he has such doubts, can he share them with the committee today?</p></speech>

That is our primary focus.  Whatever powers and authority we have, we deploy to that end and we will continue to do that in the current situation.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement powers under the drinking water regulations are limited but we engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the legislation governing drinking water.  The EPA would welcome the strengthening of its enforcement powers in this regard.</p></speech>

I want to focus on what will happen now because I am conscious we are asking these questions while people do not have access to safe drinking water.  What, if anything, would the EPA do differently in the process?  Dr. Ryan mentioned his disappointment at the initial audit and recommendations not being implemented.  The EPA will do another audit in a few days when this issue has been addressed.  What will the EPA do differently to ensure any further recommendations it makes, even if they are the same as those that were made in March and October, will be implemented?  Is it the EPA's job to do that?</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Minihan in particular about filter replacement and ultraviolet, UV, treatment of the water plant.   As an expert in this field, what timeline does she envisage there should be for the installation of UV treatment of a plant such as this one?  My main concern is that if this issue is rectified in the next few days, given that this is early in the winter and with winter storms approaching and more heavy rainfall, we could be back here discussing this issue in two or three weeks.  Confidence in the quality of our water supply has taken a hammering in recent days.  We want to ensure people realise their drinking water supply is safe and can be used.  From the EPA's quasi-independent perspective of the process - it is not Fingal County Council, Irish Water or the Department - what should that timeline be?</p> <p>  What is the nature of the report the Minister apparently has asked the EPA to do separately?  I note from the Department's opening statement that the Minister has instructed the EPA to give him a special report on what has happened.  What will be in that report and will it be made public?</p></speech>

To be clear on the next steps, this is an ongoing issue and there is a boil water notice in place.  When we carry out another audit, it will be directly focused on getting the evidence to facilitate the lifting of that boil water notice.  That is the next immediate action from us.  We will do that, as I said in my statement, at a particular point.  The plant has to come back up to operating at what Irish Water would characterise as a satisfactory performance.  Our job will be to verify that performance.</p></speech>

We will look at the results of sampling and we will take a considered view.  The open issues from the audits in March and October will be keenly tracked by my team to ensure their implementation.

The reason for that is that the size of the UV facility that will be required at Leixlip is significant.  As it is a significant piece of infrastructure and investment, it will need time to be physically be put on site, installed and verified to enure it is operating.  That is because the volume of water treatment at Leixlip is so significant.</p></speech>

We have an evolving situation and it will probably expand a little.</p><p>The Minister has requested that we bring to his attention the issues generally concerning water quality in Ireland and the rate of pace of infrastructural development.

To go back to what happened between March and October, in the regular engagement with Irish Water is there any engagement with or notification of the Department in particular, for example, if a concern arises over slippage of the original deadlines that are given in the Irish Water report?  Is the Department informed throughout the process or does it learn with the rest of us when a boil water notice is issued?</p> <p>  In terms of slippage, I think I am correct in saying five of the eight recommendations were not implemented between March and October.  How many of those were subject to slippage and could the witnesses elaborate a little more on that?</p> <p>  I am also keen to understand if the problems we are talking about are confined to the older part of the plant, notwithstanding the fact that the supply is all ultimately mixed, or if there are problems with the plant that was upgraded in the 1990s and the new plant in 2014?  I would welcome if the witnesses could separate out that.</p> <p>  I would welcome a little more information from Dr. Ryan on the previous question I asked on whether, even if all the works that are currently within the capital programme are completed, there still are additional difficulties he would like to see addressed.  Is that the ultraviolet filter or are other works required?</p> <p>  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but while the EPA did not recommend the ultraviolet filter in the March report, it recommended it in the October report.  Is there a reason for that?  Is it something the EPA had raised previously with Irish Water and Fingal County Council?  I would welcome a bit more information on that too.</p></speech>

At the end of each quarter, we publish our remedial action list that sets out the priority supplies we have identified for action and investment by Irish Water.  That sets out the completion dates by which the works on those supplies will be completed.  We then engage with the Department regularly post the publication of our remedial action list.  It is available on our website each quarter and we provide regular updates as part of that to identify where there is slippage.  There is ongoing and regular engagement with the Department.</p></speech>

His question was manifold.  Some of the recommendations relate specifically to the old plant but a number relate to the plant as a whole.  The key recommendation that Irish Water should ensure that there is automatic switchover between the duty and standby polyelectrolyte dosing pumps had not happened.  Another was that operators respond to the alarms.  As we noted earlier, the automatic shut-off in the event of operators failing to respond to alarms was implemented only in the new plant, which was where the March issue arose, and not extended to all the plant.  Our recommendation clearly called out the need for it to be across the plant.  However, as Dr. Ryan indicated, we do not believe that was deliberate but rather was a misinterpretation.</p> <p>  The other actions relate to the plant as a whole and have seen slippage.  Our audit report of October asked Irish Water to reconsider the dates by which those works would be undertaken and, as we have already indicated, a response is awaited on that.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan outlined that the EPA has legal power but it needs to be strengthened.  Has the EPA reviewed all of the audits across the country, or will it do so?</p><p>It is clear that in the case of Leixlip, but also that of County Louth, the actions recommended, not just in one report but two, have not been implemented.  Will the witnesses undertake to review those reports with a view to putting them on the remedial action list, if necessary?</p><p> Dr. Minihan said the remedial action list is published on the website.  We have a communication problem here.  The witnesses may say we should be able to look at the website but all public representatives, at national, regional and county levels, need to be supplied with the reports and met twice per year.  Will they commit to this?  Publishing on the website is not sufficient.  Irish Water does not inform anybody about what is in the reports.  It is said that it is up to us to have the competence to read them but if the witnesses asked everybody in this room about them, they would note that nobody was aware of the remedial action list until this morning, although it is available on the website.</p></speech>

It clearly has not done so.  Even the National Transport Authority fines bus companies if they do not meet the demands and requirements of their contracts.

That is clear.

We are satisfied with the timeliness following the October incident.  It has to gather a certain amount of information to be able to have an informed discussion with us and the HSE, and in order that we can fully understand the risk and consider what actions need to be taken to mitigate the risk and to address what has happened at the plant.</p></speech>

A certain amount of cryptosporidium will be in the water, having come from the plant, because it is not possible to get rid of it all.  Is the EPA satisfied with the range of levels of contamination that has been set?</p> <p>  Does the EPA do any testing of the water that comes into the plant before it is treated?  I ask because one of the largest treatment plants in the country is upstream of the Osberstown treatment plant, which might have an impact.</p> <p>  Am I correct that the plant in Leixlip is self-regulatory?  I mean that Irish Water controls the plant and the EPA does not post people there on a permanent basis.

We are not happy with the levels but we recognise that it occurs where raw water is abstracted from a source such as the River Liffey that has the potential to be contaminated with cryptosporidium, giardia or other parasites.  That is why our other report recommended the need for ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant.  Ultraviolet disinfection will deactivate the cryptosporidium or render them harmless, meaning they will not be able to cause people to become ill.  The recommendation was made in our audit report of 30 October.</p></speech>

I thank our guests, and our upcoming guests, for their forbearance and time.  It is appreciated at this vital moment.</p> <p>  Focusing on the timeline for the current issue and the restoration of normal service, is it correct that there was a high level meeting yesterday or earlier today?</p></speech>

My understanding is that a clock normally starts for testing that is carried out by the regulatory authority, in this case the HSE.  Am I correct?  Has that clock started yet and is there a timeline for restoration or a standing down of the boil water notice?</p></speech>

The plant returned to production yesterday evening, as I understand, under the proviso that the boil water notice would be put in place to protect public health.  There is regular sampling at Leixlip and that sampling equipment or rig is required to run for 24 hours.  That went on yesterday and that sample will be available today.  We will get through approximately 13,000 l of water.  That sample will need to go to the laboratory and results will be awaited.</p> <p>  Following the return to production of the plant, given the raw water turbidity and the fact that there was a lot of rainfall yesterday and on Saturday, there will be a period of time for the filters to return to normal operating conditions.  In our engagement with Irish Water and the HSE, we have stated that we intend to audit that plant.  We would see that the time to audit that plant is when it has returned to normal operating conditions.  We will await confirmation from Irish Water and Fingal County Council as to when that will happen.  Irish Water are better positioned to answer the question about when the sample results will be available.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Michael O&rsquo;Leary, head of asset operations, and Katherine Walshe, head of environmental regulation.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Rock, and the committee members for the opportunity to address them.</p> <p>  I apologise to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by both the previous and the current boil water notices.  I welcome the opportunity to explain to the committee how the events happened, what actions we have taken and how we, along with our colleagues in Fingal County Council, intend to mitigate the risk of such events happening in future.  As the committee heard from the EPA, there are two plants in Leixlip, an old plant and a new plant.  As discussed, we have had problems with the old plant and are currently upgrading it.  It is where the problem occurred at the weekend.  The prolonged heavy rain on Saturday night presented issues with turbidity, or cloudiness, and the old plant could not treat the water to the required standard.  In fairness to the plant operators, on this occasion they reacted quickly.  They saw the alarms, kicked in and shut down the plant, preventing untreated water from entering the system.  They spent most of Sunday and Monday morning trying to return the old plant to service, using a wastewater discharge, which allows the plant to be run but to waste rather than into the system.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, this was not successful and our reservoirs throughout the city were running low.  We had to make the decision that rather than have water restrictions, where people would not have had water for flushing toilets, showering or washing, we would reintroduce the water with whose treatment we were not happy, while at the same time issuing a boil water notice.  It was a conscious decision taken over the weekend, and it is important to emphasise the difference between the incident in question and the previous incident.  The Fingal County Council operators acted correctly and Irish Water took a decision to introduce the water I have described because the only other option was to introduce water restrictions.</p> <p>  To end the current boil water notice, as was discussed with the EPA, satisfactory water quality tests will be needed.  The first sample was taken today and we will continue in that regard during the week.  On EPA confirmation that the plant is operating satisfactorily, unfortunately the plant is still not delivering the levels of treated water we would like.  It is still delivering cloudiness outside the limits set by the EPA and us, which is unfortunate but we are working as hard as possible to correct the problem.  It is not a plant failure or the result of a particular incident rather it concerns the filter beds we are currently trying to refurbish.  As soon as we are happy that the water entering the system is of good quality, we can start the clock and flush the slug of water through the system.  That is the current position.</p><p>Irish Water has a comprehensive compliance monitoring programme in place for every public water supply in the country to ensure that drinking water quality is adequately monitored and complies with legislation.</p><p> Since Irish Water was established in 2014, we have significantly improved water quality monitoring on public drinking water supplies.  More rigorous sampling regimes have been put in place, for example the number of tests for cryptosporidium and giardia doubled from approximately 800 in 2014 to more than 1,500 in 2018.  </p><p> The EPA and HSE, who have responsibility for regulating drinking water quality and protecting public health respectively, now have a single point of contact for all water quality issues nationally.  Water quality risks and failures are identified sooner, corrective action can be taken quickly, and the risk to public health from poor water quality has been reduced significantly.  Of course, we have more work to do in this area. </p><p> The quality of public drinking water in Ireland remains high with microbiological compliance at 99.87% and chemical compliance at 99.63%, as outlined in the 2018 EPA drinking water quality report. </p><p> All drinking water must be treated before being consumed to remove biological and chemical contaminants that can be harmful to human health.  Bacteria from animal or human waste and parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia are commonly found in open water bodies such as the River Liffey.  These organisms can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans. </p><p> Following consultation with the HSE, a boil water notice is imposed where water treatment may be inadequate to eliminate the risk of illness from microbiological contamination.  There are currently 17 boil water notices in place nationally impacting on approximately 14,000 people.  The largest is on Lough Talt in Sligo, affecting 12,500 people, where there is a risk of cryptosporidium contamination.  The majority of the other boil water notices relate to areas where treated water requires additional disinfection contact time, a problem identified through Irish Water&rsquo;s national disinfection programme.  Due to work under way by Irish Water, four of the 17 notices are on track to be lifted this year, with most of the others, including Lough Talt, on track to be lifted in 2020. </p><p> The greater Dublin area, GDA, drinking water supply serves all of Dublin and parts of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Drinking water in the GDA is supplied from a number of sources, predominantly the River Liffey, which accounts for 85% of the supply to Dublin, and the River Vartry.  Water is produced in Dublin on a 24-hour basis and the total water production capacity is 612 megalitres per day, which can reduce to 580 megalitres due to weather, drought or algal blooms, for example.  Demand for water in the GDA varies but the average daily demand is 570 megalitres per day, increasing to 600 megalitres per day at times of high demand.  Headroom or spare capacity in available water in Dublin is, therefore, between 10 and 40 megalitres per day.  That is important in the context of the old plant, which is having problems and which produces in the region of 20% of Dublin's water supply.</p><p> Leixlip water treatment plant, WTP, is the second largest water treatment plant in Ireland; the largest is at Ballymore Eustace.  Leixlip WTP supplies treated drinking water to more than 600,000 people in Dublin, Kildare and Meath, approximately one third of the greater Dublin area, including healthcare facilities, industry and many large commercial customers.  Leixlip WTP is operated by Fingal County Council under a service level agreement with Irish Water. </p><p> Leixlip WTP currently produces 195 megalitres per day of treated drinking water, with a maximum production of 210 megalitres per day.  Due to the phased expansion of Leixlip WTP since it first opened in 1967, current operations on the site are carried out across a number of plants known as the old plant, built by PCI in the 1970s and upgraded by McMahon Philips in the 1990s, and the new plant, built by AECOM in 2014.  These are separate plants and there is not a continuous upgrade process on the old plant.  The old plant produces two thirds of the water at Leixlip.</p><p> In 2019, there have been ten low level detections of giardia and one detection of cryptosporidium in treated water at Leixlip.  These test results were reported to the EPA and the HSE and not deemed to be an immediate risk to public health.  Given the detections, in consultation with HSE, Irish Water doubled its monitoring programme for cryptosporidium and giardia at the plant in 2019.  </p><p> We have also taken special interest in the operation of the filter beds in the old plant because if the filter beds are not meeting the levels required and there are instances of giardia, there are increased concerns.  We are currently upgrading the filter beds in the old plant and ideally we would take the plant out of service for a six-month or 12-month period to complete all the works and bring it back into service thereafter.</p><p>Ideally we would take this plant out of service for a period of six to 12 months, complete all the works and then bring it back into service.  However, because it supplies 20% of Dublin's water and because we cannot switch it off as we do not have any backup supplies, we have to do this work on an ongoing basis.  The plant needs to remain operational at all times.  This is akin to trying to change the tyres on a car while it is moving down the road.  It is a very difficult process and has led to some delays, which the EPA highlighted.</p><p> In March 2019, there was a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the new plant.  An on-site alarm was triggered but was not responded to.  The incident was reported at the time to the EPA and the HSE, which did not consider the failure to be a risk to public health.  Water produced remained safe.  The EPA conducted an audit of the new plant on 22 March.  Following recommendations made by the EPA in its March audit, the automatic shutdown requested by it was completed in the new plant.  A contract was issued to install automatic shutdown at the old plant but this work had not been completed when the incident occurred on 22 October.</p><p> On Monday 21 October, a mechanical failure occurred on a piece of equipment at the old plant at Leixlip.  I will describe the events in more detail.  At 3.15 p.m. a blockage occurred in a chemical delivery line leading to a failure of a pressure-release valve.  No pump alarm activated as the failure point was downstream of the pumps.  At 5 p.m., turbidity levels in filtered water started to increase as a result of the delivery line failure.  Turbidity is cloudiness in water due to suspended particles.  At 6.16 p.m., increasing turbidity in filtered water triggered an on-site alarm and sent an SMS text alert to the operators.  The alarm was not responded to and turbidity continued to rise.  At 7.07 p.m. an on-site high-turbidity alarm was activated on the clarified water.  The alarm was not responded to and turbidity continued to rise.  At 9.15 p.m., an off-site plant manager who had logged on remotely to the Leixlip plant noticed the activation of turbidity alarms and the lack of response on site.  The alarm was investigated and a contractor was called to clear the pipe blockage and carry out temporary repairs.  From 10.15 p.m. to 11.30 p.m., the repair was completed. A decision was taken to shut down the old plant temporarily to allow the treatment process to stabilise.  Between 11.30 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, the old plant was gradually brought back into operation.  The automatic plant shutdown did not happen when the alarms were not responded to because we had not yet put this facility in place.</p><p> The new plant at Leixlip continued to produce drinking water that met all drinking water quality standards while the incident was ongoing at the old plant.  However as the drinking water produced at both plants is mixed when it enters the network, all areas supplied by the Leixlip plant were subject to the boil water notice.  Irish Water was first notified of the incident at the old plant by Fingal County Council at 9.45 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  We immediately contacted the HSE and EPA.  We were in discussions with them throughout the day sharing data, reviewing the plant performance data and determining the level of risk to public health arising from the incident.  Following the consultation, a decision was taken at 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 October to impose a boil water notice on customers supplied by Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The Irish Water crisis management team, which was on standby, formally convened at 5 p.m. and the notification of customers began immediately.  Irish Water's foremost priority throughout the period of the boil water notice was to protect public health and to advise all customers as quickly as possible.  The first task of the team was to issue widespread communications with immediate effect.  Given the number and geographic spread of customers affected, multiple communication channels were used, with emphasis on mass communication and prioritising proactive contact with vulnerable customers and large water users.  </p><p> A press release with detailed advice and information and a map of the affected area was issued to national media in time for the 6 p.m. news on Tuesday, 22 October.  This information was posted on our website and on social media channels and briefed to our customer contact centre.  We directly contacted our registered vulnerable customers and an email went to elected representatives in the affected areas.  We contacted large commercial and industrial customers and worked with stakeholders to identify critical users such as hospitals, schools, nursing homes and cr&egrave;ches.  Engagement with customers, stakeholders and media continued through Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  A more detailed interactive map of the areas affected was posted on the website and shared widely.  Further details of customer communications are provided in the appendix to my written statement.  I thank the media, elected representatives, local authorities, business and industry groups, Departments and all who extensively and proactively shared our advice to customers while the boil water notice was in place.</p><p> Irish Water's website experienced difficulty on Tuesday, 22 October due to very high volumes of traffic to the site.  Our IT teams worked throughout Tuesday evening to rectify the situation and, by Wednesday morning, the website was fully operational.</p><p>Our IT teams worked throughout Tuesday evening to rectify the situation and by Wednesday morning the website was fully operational.  This was clearly not satisfactory and we are working to ensure that the site can cope with high volumes in future.  During this more recent boil water notice, it has been able to handle the increased volumes.</p><p> On the lifting of the boil water notice, on Wednesday, 23 October Irish Water sought to identify clear criteria for lifting the boil water notice as quickly as possible while still ensuring no risk to public health.  Lifting criteria agreed with the HSE and the EPA were as follows: satisfactory sample results for giardia and cryptosporidium; a satisfactory EPA audit of the old plant; and confirmation that all remaining at-risk water had passed through or was removed from the network.  The result of the first sample covering the period of the incident was available on the morning of 24 October and water quality was satisfactory.  Results of the second and third drinking water quality samples taken on 22 and 23 October were returned on Friday, 25 October and these samples were also satisfactory.  The EPA inspectors carried out an audit of the Leixlip plant on Thursday, 24 October, accompanied by the HSE, Irish Water and Fingal County Council.  Initial feedback from the EPA inspectors at the site indicated they were satisfied from a technical perspective that the boil water notice could be lifted.  The final audit report from the EPA was issued on 30 October.  On the network flushing side, Irish Water carried out extensive network modelling to work out how much of the water produced at Leixlip on 21 and 22 October was still in the network.  Proactive flushing was carried out by Fingal County Council on Friday, 25 October to remove any remaining at-risk water from the extremities of the network.  Irish Water continued discussions with the HSE and the EPA during Friday, 25 October to ensure all criteria agreed were met to allow the boil water notice to be lifted.  The HSE confirmed at 4.30 p.m. that it was satisfied that the boil water notice could be lifted and this was communicated immediately and as widely as possible to all customers and stakeholders through all available communication channels.</p><p> The following immediate actions have been taken.  Throughout the incident, Irish Water and senior Fingal County Council staff have been in contact with each other.  The discussions are ongoing and we are trying to prevent the last and current incidents from happening again.  The Leixlip water treatment plant is already staffed on a 24-hour basis and Irish Water has requested that Fingal County Council increase staffing at the plant to ensure an appropriate level of vigilance and eliminate the risk of an alarm not being responded to in future.  Irish Water will work with Fingal County Council to agree more on-site presence by Irish Water staff at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  Irish Water is looking at all potential enhancements to operations that will further safeguard water quality at Leixlip water treatment plant and all other large plants nationally.  Automatic shut-off at the old plant is now operational.  It is worth highlighting that automatic shut-off should be the option of last resort in a plant with 24-hour staffing as alarms should be responded to and a shut-off takes the plant completely out of production.  Shutting down and restarting a water treatment plant brings its own risks and given Dublin&rsquo;s lack of headroom, this could also present supply challenges which we are experiencing at the moment.  Irish Water is in the process of bringing all critical alarms nationally into our national operations centre.  For this to be beneficial, however, Irish Water needs to be able to contact plant operators directly when an alarm is triggered.  This is not part of the current working arrangements.  Irish Water is carrying out a review of the filter upgrade programme under way at the old plant to expedite its completion, bearing in mind the current water supply headroom challenges.</p><p> The recent incident at Leixlip caused significant disruption to customers and is not acceptable to Irish Water.  That goes for the current incident as well.  Our priority is to provide a safe, secure drinking water supply and we accept responsibility for this incident.  We will continue to notify the EPA and HSE of any reportable incidents as soon as we are aware of them.  We are working with Fingal County Council to take all necessary steps to reduce the risk of an incident like this happening again.</p><p> Irish Water is preparing a detailed written response to the issues raised by the EPA following its recent audit.  At the time of the incident auto shut-off had been installed at the new plant and was in the process of being installed at the old plant.  It should be reiterated that auto shut-off is an option of last resort.  A plant of this size cannot be reliant on the sole response of individuals.  The incident highlights the fact that we must use all available technology to prevent a failure like this happening in future.  Under the current working arrangements this is not possible.  Filter beds in the old plant are being upgraded.</p><p>This work started in 2018 and will be completed by the second quarter of next year.  Any acceleration of this work must be balanced with the need to maintain sufficient water supply to the greater Dublin area.  </p><p> Irish Water is fully committed to the Workplace Relations Commission process, initiated by the Minister and now under way, to replace the current service level agreements, SLAs, with local authorities with arrangements which will provide Irish Water with the necessary full control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk and provide a single identity for customer-facing services.  Completing that process is likely to take some time and we believe that several operational issues must be addressed in the interim, under the current SLA, to reduce current risks to the provision of safe and reliable water services to our customers.  I thank the committee members for their time.  I will take any questions they wish to raise with me or my colleagues. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.913" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#CC00200"><p>I would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to today's meeting.  I am joined by Mr. David Flynn, the water advisory unit's principal adviser.  We are meeting in the light of a series of very significant and serious incidents in our water supply system.  These boil water notices are a major disruption for people and businesses across a large part of our capital city and surrounding areas in Kildare and Meath.</p> <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has expressed his deep concern regarding these incidents, particularly in light of the audit of the Leixlip facility carried out by the EPA following the first boil water notice.  The lessons of the audit in March 2019 do not appear to have been learned.  The cause of this weekend's incident is now under investigation by Irish Water's process engineers and Fingal County Council.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council must fully co-operate and collaborate to deal comprehensively with the issues at Leixlip.</p> <p>  It is a matter for the EPA and the HSE as regulators and for Irish Water as the water utility, working with the local authority, to ensure that national standards are complied with.  The priority in such an event is always to ensure that people's health is protected.  Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA are all working together in their respective roles to ensure that notices are lifted as soon as water supplies are verified as safe to drink.</p> <p>  However, given the scale of the first boil water notice, the Minister has requested the EPA to provide a report on that incident directly to him once it has finished its own investigations.  This report will outline the conclusions of the agency's investigation and any findings that may require a broader policy response.  The Minister will consider this report once he has received it.</p> <p> The Minister has also spoken directly with the managing director of Irish Water, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and the director general of the EPA to better understand how this situation is arising and to ensure that water quality issues are properly dealt with.  The Minister will also meet the managing director of Irish Water and the CEO of Fingal County Council once he has received the EPA report to review any lessons learned from the incident.</p> <p>  Overall, the EPA reports that the quality of drinking water in Ireland&rsquo;s public water supply remains high, as we have heard today.  Our supply is safe but it is not yet sufficiently secure.  There are risks to the quality and quantity of water supplied.  These risks are associated with the nature and age of our infrastructure, as well as with the approach taken to the operation of our water supplies.  Both our water and our wastewater systems require substantial and sustained investment in order to bring the systems up to the quality and resilience standards required of a modern service, to provide for population growth and to build resilience in the face of climate change.  To support these aims, the Government has approved the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024.  This comprises &euro;6.1 billion of investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.</p> <p>  Also critical to this improvement programme is the reform of water service delivery.  Operating through service level agreements with 31 local authorities, Irish Water has responsibility for public water services but lacks direct or operational control for services on the ground.  Without predetermining the outcome of investigations into the exact operational issues at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant, it is clear that there is a critical gap in control between Irish Water's legal responsibility for providing water services and local authorities' operational responsibility on the ground.  This is not satisfactory and is no longer fit for purpose.</p> <p>  The Minister is therefore seeking an agreement that would replace the current service level agreements for the provision of water services with arrangements which provide Irish Water with the necessary control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk; ensure that Irish Water is not left without an appropriate skilled workforce to carry out its statutory functions and that local authorities are not left with stranded costs; and address workers' concerns about the future deployment of the current local authority water staff.</p> <p>  There has been engagement on these issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, most recently last Thursday.</p><p>However, in the light of this most recent incident it is important that all parties now engage with these issues with renewed determination.  This is a challenging and complex process.  However, the objective is to deliver a single national publicly owned utility that operates to the highest standards nationwide and that the full benefits of the one utility model are realised.</p></speech>

I am joined today by John Daly, director of services.  Leixlip water treatment plant was initially constructed in 1967 and has been upgraded and expanded six times, most recently in 2014 when the capacity of the plant was extended from 168 million l to 207 million l per day.  The treatment plant is a conventional plant for the treatment of river water, which involves coagulation, settlement, filtration, chlorination and fluoridation.  It is made up of two sections which we refer to as the old and the new and the incident on 21 October occurred in the older installation.</p> <p>  Fingal County Council currently operates Leixlip water treatment under a service level agreement with Irish Water.  Prior to the recent incidents, there has been no general boil water notice due to a failure of the Leixlip water treatment plant.  Fingal County Council staff supported Irish Water and the EPA during the period of the first boil water notice, which assisted in the notice being lifted as early as possible.  We are working with Irish Water to do likewise in respect of the current incident.  The EPA audit report of 28 October describes the causes of the incident which occurred on 21 October.</p> <p>  From our analysis, the accumulation of debris commenced at approximately 3 p.m.  Early indications of deterioration in water quality were identifiable between 5 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.  By 6.15 p.m., the water quality was outside the normal operating limits for acceptable water quality and reached a critical level by 7.50 p.m.  When the incident was identified at 9 p.m., prompt action was taken and the repair was effected by 11.30 p.m.  Shut down of the system occurred at approximately 10.15 p.m.  The EPA requirement for an automatic shutdown of the plant or individual elements of the plant or both was in place in the new section of the facility before the incident and was planned for the old section.  Automatic shutdown has now been implemented throughout both treatment plants.  This is a significant intervention, which will assist greatly in preventing any such future incidents.  I am referring to the incident on 21 October. </p> <p>  In addition to the automation, Fingal County Council is in the process of further strengthening, monitoring and control at the plant since the incident, pending implementation of Irish Water's national control centre as follows: the supervised control and data acquisition, SCADA, computerised control system is being upgraded this week to require regular activation of operational controls by the duty operator to demonstrate response to all alarms; the critical alarms system will be upgraded to provide for automatic alerts in order that the on-call duty manager is notified quickly; the introduction of additional systematic monitoring and review of the SCADA system over the 24-hour period is being implemented and enhanced arrangements for plant supervision by the on-call duty manager are being implemented to support operations over the 24-hour period.  In addition, critical incidents will be notified to Irish Water immediately and in this regard, the out-of-hours protocol with Irish Water has been reviewed, which will enhance the communications of incidents.  The additional requirement to investigate the lining of the alum tank, which was the initial cause of the incident on 21 October, will be carried out by Fingal County Council as soon as possible and within a six-week period.  This will require the tanks to be drawn down in sequence and examined.  Following assessment, any capital investment will be identified to Irish Water for action.  The matter of the failure to respond to alarms is the subject of an ongoing internal investigation.</p> <p>  It should be noted, however, that Fingal County Council views the optimal solution as being the implementation of the Irish Water's national control centre and we welcome the EPA recommendation that Leixlip be connected to the centre without delay.  The completion of the new plant facilitated the implementation of a range of refurbishments and improvements to the older plant, which could not be progressed until the new plant was commissioned.</p><p>The following works were identified: upgrade of controls and a new SCADA system, which is now complete; rehabilitation of the filter channel, which is now complete; repairs and replacement of electrical equipment, which has commenced and is ongoing and automated chlorine dosing, which is now complete.  Other works identified were automated back wash sequencing, which is now in place; PH correction, which currently is in design phase; replacement of valves and deep pipework, which is complete; and rehabilitation of sand filters, of which four out of 15 such filters have been refurbished.  Progress on these items is jointly monitored by Irish Water and Fingal County Council staff.  We note the recommendation by the EPA for a system-wide risk assessment of the plant.  Fingal County Council will assist Irish Water in a rapid review and the identification and implementation of any necessary works.  Fingal County Council acknowledges the disruption due to the issue of a boil water notice and offers apologies to all those affected by the issuing of the boil water notice on 22 October and the second notice, which is currently in place.  We remain committed to performing our duties under the service level agreement with Irish Water to ensure a continued safe water supply.</p></speech>

Several members have indicated they wish to put questions.  Before that, however, can Mr. Gleeson tell us whether he has a sense of when this boil water notice will be lifted?  At the opening of his statement he said something to the effect that the results of the latest tests had come back and the torpidity level still is not satisfactory.</p></speech>

We are waiting for the plant to improve.  We will carry out testing and hopefully the torpidity levels in the raw water will drop in the meantime and the plant will start to produce clear water.  It is operating correctly.  There are no identifiable failures within the plant at the moment.  It is simply that the filter beds are not operating as we would like them to.</p></speech>

To follow the Chairman's question, I would like Irish Water, the Department and Fingal County Council to give us a clearer view as to what the estimated time should be.  Are two or three tests needed before we get the all-clear from the Health Service Executive, HSE?  When can the more than 615,000 consumers expect to have clean drinking water again?  That is the question that those watching us here want answered.  How do we try to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again?  We will not get 100% assurance but as best as possible.  The whole of my area in Fingal is affected.  People are very angry and concerned and the October incident, which appears to have been a monumental failure in process, has created a real difficulty in respect of confidence in the robustness and safety of our water supply.  We do not want that to be the case.  We need to find out what we will do now and how quickly.</p> <p>  I welcome aspects of the statements that have been made, particularly by Irish Water and Fingal County Council, about things that have been done very quickly but one striking point in the EPA report is that the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday 22 October.  In that period two alarms showed up in the control room in Leixlip, one at 6.16 p.m. and one at 7.07 p.m. and when they were not responded to and contaminated water was still going into the system a text message was sent to the operator and that was ignored.  For anyone reading the report or watching this meeting that is absolutely inexcusable.  How many other times have alarms been ignored?</p><p>I am sure the witnesses know when they have been ignored.  I know of a couple of instances in the past in my area.  I will not go into specifics as it is unfair to do so.  How many other incidents have occurred?  What happens when alarms are actually ignored?</p><p> In his opening statement, Mr. Gleeson stated: &ldquo;Irish Water is in the process of bringing all critical alarms nationally into our national operations management centre.&rdquo;  I welcome the fact that the chief executive of Fingal County Council has also stated that the council wants that to happen without delay.  Mr. Gleeson also stated: &ldquo;For this to be beneficial, however, Irish Water needs to be able to contact plant operators directly when an alarm is triggered.&rdquo;  If an alarm is triggered, be it in Ballymore Eustace, Leixlip, Galway or any other plant, is it the case that Irish Water cannot contact them directly?  The weakest link in the chain seems to be around when an alarm has been triggered because of contaminated water and that public safety could be at risk.  Thankfully, both of the recent shutdowns have been precautionary.  I want to assure people about public safety with regard to water supply.  What happens if an alarm were to go off tomorrow and was not responded to?</p><p> I congratulate Ms Farrelly on her appointment and I know this is her first time before the committee.  These are serious issues, however.  It clearly is an absolute breakdown in process and procedure.  I can only go from the report of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and trust what it has said.  People want to get this fixed.  What steps will be taken between now and then?  Irish Water referred to the filter bed replacement which has gone to the second quarter in 2020.  Will Irish Water speak about the UV treatment?  Additional technologies were looked for in March and, specifically, in October.  What will that entail in terms of capital investment and time required to put that in place?</p><p> Going back to our current crisis, we need to get a handle on communications as to when Irish Water estimates water supply will be back.  It is a big issue for the infirm, the sick and the elderly.</p></speech>

We have listed several actions.  However, direct control and our ability to directly communicate with staff is not in the current way of working.  It is subject to the Workplace Relations Commission, meaning I am limited to that process.  In certain areas, we need to look at improving ways of working under the current service level agreements, SLAs.</p></speech>

The water quality had deteriorated by 6.15 p.m. and reached critical level at 7.50 p.m.  It was identified at 9 o&rsquo;clock.</p> <p>  That said, there was a failure in our monitoring system on that day.  That is subject to investigation and includes a disciplinary process which is under way.</p> <p>  In reaction to that, I can strengthen the systems that are there.  That strengthening has already happened which is evidenced in terms of the prompt reaction taken on Sunday to this current incident.  This includes a level of automation.  Alerts are sent automatically to the on-call duty manager, for example.  It also includes increased requirements from the on-call duty manager.  I want to introduce increased out-of-hours site visits.</p><p>The SCADA, supervisory control and data acquisition system, which helped us identify the problem from 21 October, can be monitored remotely or on-site.  Increased monitoring and reviewing of that system is important to understand if it is working well or if there is a problem we can address.  It is not just a reliance on alarms.  It is that plus regular auditing and review of what the reports tell us.  Bringing in these improvements is under way and will help prevent this type of incident happening again.</p><p> The overriding shutdown of the system, which is now in place, would have prevented the incident in any event.  Many improvements have been introduced in the past two weeks.  Some are ongoing over the next couple of days.  However, they will help to prevent this type of incident.</p><p> The ongoing incident is different as the committee has recognised.  That relates to the quality of the raw water.  We would be hopeful that the treatment will return to normal later this evening, provided there is no further deterioration in the raw water supply.  That then instigates a process, outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, earlier, which leaves it in a position to commence its audit.  There are several steps to go through once the water returns to normal.</p><p> We are not in a position to give a precise timeline for the next day or so.</p></speech>

I suspect we will be looking at something similar this time.  As Ms Farrelly said, the plant is still not operating properly.  The window for the slug of water to flush through the system has not started yet.  This is unfortunate and we are not happy about it but I have to be realistic about the situation.</p> <p>  I would be a hands-on managing director.  Often, when I had a problem plant, I would go along in the middle of the night, talk to the operators and understand what was happening.  Under the current working arrangements, I cannot do that.  I cannot visit that site without an invitation and without permission.  To me, that does not seem realistic.</p></speech>

Within the 30-day period in which we have to respond to the audit, we will carry out an assessment.  We will discuss with the EPA the merits, or not, of having UV treatment there.</p> <p>  The location of the Leixlip plant, as has been referred to earlier, is downstream at the bottom of the catchment.  Accordingly, UV is probably a requirement but we need to carry out the assessment.  It is a major investment and we would need to be 100% sure that it is required.  That assessment will be carried out.</p> <p>  In terms of the level of investment itself, one is looking at tens of millions of euro, as well as considerable operational costs because of the power demands of the UV system.  When the assessment is complete, installing UV in a plant the size of Leixlip, with 190 Ml of water leaving the plant per day, will require planning permission and a procurement process.  The best-case scenario is two to three years at this point in time.</p> <p>  Even if we had UV in place yesterday, we would still be in the current situation of a boil water notice because the pre-treatments, such as the sedimentation tanks and the filtration, have to be working properly for UV to be effective.  UV is the final belt and braces in the treatment for cryptosporidium.</p></speech>

Deputy Breathnach is correct that any boil water notice is wrong.  This is the single largest boil water notice we have ever had.  It is six times greater than the total number of people affected by both boil water notices last year.  It is also important that part of this has happened in a plant which in recent times has had significant upgrades, such as a new plant in 2014.</p> <p>  I am concerned that it was stated that the November incident is not a plant failure.</p><p>I completely accept from all the information we have received that there were two very different sets of incidents in October and November.  If the witnesses are telling me that yesterday's event was not a plant failure, and given the fact that it is highly likely we will have a similar volume of rain in a short period of time at some point in the future, it seems that the plant ultimately is not designed right if it cannot cope with what was not the most exceptional of rain events.  I will come back to that.</p><p> I know that Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh has to come in and do the batting for the single utility, but on the basis of what Mr. Gleeson said, even if one had a single utility, that would not have made any difference to yesterday's incident because one is talking about the plant functioning properly.  While we are very keen to have discussions around the single utility, I do not see how people responding to text messages, the failure to put in the shut-down system or yesterday's events would in any way be affected by a single utility or not.  That is a separate issue.</p><p> I am still not clear on the alarm, so somebody needs to explain who the duty operator is.  I am not looking for the person's name, but is it a member of Fingal County Council staff or is it a private operator?  Was this individual asleep when he or she got the text message?</p></speech>

What I am saying is that we had an incident where we were told that an alarm system was not responded to over an extended period of time.  That had a negative impact on 615,000 people.  I would just like to know how that can happen.  That is an important question to ask.</p> <p>  We got an update on where the implementation of recommendations from the March EPA report are at.  I would like an explanation for the slippage that the EPA spoke about.  What was the reason for that slippage and in particular, is installing an emergency shutdown system a very complicated job?  Is there a reason that took longer than clearly the EPA thought should have happened from its report?  I know the witnesses will not have completed their formal response to the EPA's October report, but are they in a position to give us any indication of timelines for the implementation of those nine recommendations?  I know the witnesses have spoken about the UV system, but can the committee give us any more information in relation to that?  Obviously that is very important to us.</p> <p>  In light of what the witnesses said about yesterday's events, what additional work do they think is going to be required to reduce or possibly eliminate such an event occurring again?  I am accepting what they are saying that the plant operated properly yesterday in terms of the shutdown and the notifications, but for us to ensure that does not happen again, what additional works are required?</p> <p>  With respect to the Department, it was clear from what the EPA was saying earlier, and this also speaks to what Deputy Breathnach was saying in terms of his own experience in Louth, that it is giving the Department regular updates in terms of failure to implement the recommendations of its audit report and slippage in those.  The most recent one was in September.  What do people in the Department do when they get those reports?  Do they get involved, engage with Irish Water or engage with the relevant local authority?  At what point does this get brought to the attention of the Minister, given the scale of the issues that we are talking about?</p> <p>  In terms of the impact on families and businesses, is there going to be any compensation available?  For example, many businesses will have lost trade or incurred very significant costs as a result of not having access to properly treated water.  For example, no tankers have been provided to provide freshly treated water and people have had to buy significant volumes of expensive bottled water.  This applies not just to the 615,000 people but people generally affected by boil water notices.  Who foots the bill for the additional cost that is put on those businesses and householders?</p></speech>

We have a national body that deals nationally with the EPA, so these incidents are very quickly identified and addressed with the EPA and the HSE through our crisis management team.  We do this nationally and it works very effectively.  We were also able to talk to other plants such as Ballymore Eustace and Vartry and increase their production, so again, the national utility took that role on.  We looked at the network and how we could divert water from one network to another when we knew the Leixlip plant was not operating correctly.  There is huge value in the national utility and bringing in a single management system with single standards, single measurements of sampling and testing, and a single type of quality system will be hugely beneficial to a national water system.</p><p>As I have stated before, the plant is fully operational and provides 20% of the water supply in Dublin.  The filter bed upgrade, probably the most important piece of ongoing work, has proved difficult without impacting on production.  It has been a problem.</p><p> A system of automatic shutdown was implemented in the new plant.  Owing to a misunderstanding, our personnel felt they had satisfied the audit by implementing the system of automatic shutdown in the new plant and the secondary plant, which is more complicated and more difficult to prepare.  We had placed a purchase order and there was a contractor involved.  However, we had not done the work, which I agree is a failing of-----</p></speech>

There was no point in us delivering water by tanker, but we did consider it.  However, it is the same as water coming from the tap when there is a boil water notice.  There is no advantage in having water supplies from a tanker.</p></speech>

It is my local authority area.  The standard in the slowness to respond to alarms is not acceptable to us and we are taking every measure to ensure it will not happen again.

If one looks at the nine recommendations made in the most recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, audit report, five of them use the term &ldquo;Irish Water and Fingal County Council should&rdquo;.  That can create a difficulty as in such situations one agency will ask if it was a direction for it or the other agency.  There are issues with this control and responsibility.</p> <p>  The EPA will provide the Department with regular updates at a monthly meeting.  We have quarterly output monitor group meetings which include us, Irish Water, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, NewERA and the EPA and at which we look at the overall outputs of Irish Water in terms of investment, leakage management, the urban wastewater treatment directives, challenges and the remedial action list.  At the last meeting of the output monitoring group I was at, the issue of Tallanstown came up.  It showed up as a spike as a significant boil water notice had arisen in the previous period.  Individual audit reports are not addressed to the Department but to the operator.  The March report was not particularly brought to our attention.  We were not particularly aware of a significant issue in Leixlip, save that it was mentioned on the website.  It was not addressed to the Department, stating we should be aware of it and that, therefore, we needed to talk to somebody about it.  The seriousness of the incident meant that the Minister felt he needed to ask the EPA if there were other actions that needed to be taken or if there were policy impacts.  The next time we meet we will have had the experience of dealing with this incident and it will need to be discussed because, as has been pointed out, it is completely out of scale with anything else we have experienced before.</p></speech>

To clarify, the reason we are so focused on the turbidity, or cloudiness, of the water coming out through the filter beds is that for the measurements we are taking, once the turbidity goes above a certain level, it means that the cryptosporidium or giardia bugs can get through the filter beds.  We are not measuring continuously for the bugs.  We are measuring the beds to see what level of particles is getting through.  If larger particles are getting through, then there is a chance that giardia or cryptosporidium can get through too.  It is precautionary.</p></speech>

It was voluntary registration and a matter of whether people deemed themselves vulnerable.  We did not question it.  Some of those customers may be highly vulnerable, such as those on dialysis, so they really need to be kept up to date.  We do not pry into what the circumstances of others are.  There is an immediate call-out to those vulnerable customers in the event of an incident with water.</p></speech>

Staleen in my constituency is a classic example.  There were major problems last year.  We eventually got to a solution.  While today's debate centres on Leixlip, it is symptomatic of other micro-problems across the country.  I will start with the issue of turbidity.  Heavy rain and flooding are common in Ireland.  The witnesses say it was exactly the same in Tallanstown, on a smaller scale.  The reality is that there are almost 100,000 people in addition to the 600,000 people impacted by the Leixlip plant who have boil water noices.  I think the figure was approximately 92,000.  If the flooding and heavy rain continues, as it does in this country, will it not become commonplace rather than exceptional in many of these schemes if the necessary equipment cannot be installed?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the gap in controllers.  There also seems to be a gap in the response.  We are here to discuss a nationwide issue.  It was clear in Tallanstown that there was a similar problem with a breakdown of some form of communication, of alarms or otherwise, and it was found by the EPA that it posed an unacceptable risk to public health and to consumers of that public water supply.  There was a 12 day gap where somebody did not issue a boil water notice, knowing that that water was in danger of contamination.  There were reports of people who were sick for a considerable period.  I asked this question this morning, when I did not get an answer, and will ask it here again.  I say that Tallanstown was a microcosm of Leixlip because it started with flooding, moved on to alarms not operating and then moved on to the issue of two audits in the scheme I am referring to, where the response to those audits was unacceptable.  Have we learned a lesson from that?  Will the witnesses, along with the EPA, be looking at the audits that have not been acted upon with a view to putting those on the remedial action list that the EPA referred to?</p> <p>  I have a number of comments about other issues.  The witnesses mentioned voluntary registration.  In my experience, in Louth, other than the odd text and email to public representatives, the public do not receive notification unless they have voluntarily registered.</p><p>When boil water notices go on for a long period of time, there is no excuse for people not to be informed, whether by the local authority or Irish Water, which has a list of domestic and non-domestic supplies.  I was involved in a group water scheme for 21 years.  The information is there but it needs to be transmitted to people when there is a boil water notice.</p><p> I understand the issue of tankers.  There is no excuse not to provide people with bottled water when there are boil water notices.  I want that addressed, whether for small schemes or large schemes covered by Leixlip.  I sent at least ten emails to Irish Water, which were responded to but in which there was not one mention of the EPA reports.  I ask for those reports to be made available, as they come about, to members of the local authorities and to D&aacute;il representatives.  There need to be regular meetings of public representatives, whether national or otherwise.  My blood has boiled over the past 105 days, as has that of the public, but I smile when I hear how alarms do not operate.  The Cavan Hill water scheme in Louth, which was one of the biggest in the country at the time, used fish to move from one tank to the other when there was contamination.  It is beyond me that the alarm systems, with all their modern technology, were not responded to.  Tallanstown was a microcosm of Leixlip because there was a breakdown in communication as to who was in charge of the plant.  I understand that people were on holidays at the time.  People are very concerned about the quality of water.</p><p> To what degree is the EPA monitoring the water at the extraction point, before it goes into treatment?  I can go on for a week about issues relating to the River Glyde supply, whether in the form of aluminium from the mine in Magheracloone, which was flagged to Irish Water, or pesticides.  What is the cause of the flooding in water, which has not been a problem heretofore?</p></speech>

There have been two boil water notices in quick succession, having been none previously, and people are really afraid, worrying whether it is safe to drink their water.  The tone of the witnesses needs to reflect the fact that there is real fear about the quality and safety of water.  More than one in ten people are affected so it is huge.</p> <p>  On the issue of cloudy water, how does rain get into the water treatment plant?  It comes in where there is not a combined sewer and surface water gets into the pumping stations, making the intake at Leixlip not as good as one would want and requiring a greater clean-up.  How wide is the risk assessment in the context of rainfall levels?</p><p>Does it look further upstream, at both the pumping stations?  Are there holding tanks there or not?  What happens to overflows when there is a lot of rain?</p><p> I live in Leixlip and have got my water there since the late 1970s, so this is highly unusual.  New developments now have separated systems so the phenomenon should be reducing, not growing.  There are more households using the system and, of course, there is a lot of industry, with one wet industry in particular that uses a dedicated pipe.  Does this get its supply wholly from Leixlip?  </p></speech>

The new plant at Leixlip is working okay and, even with higher turbidity in the river water, it can manage where the old plant could not.  This shows that the technology can manage the situation if it is put in correctly.  He asked about the response in respect of Tallanstown and he said information was the key.  That is correct.  As soon as we were aware of the issue at Tallanstown we contacted the EPA and the HSE and emergency sampling and testing took place.  It was deemed that there was no immediate risk and, after further consultation with the HSE and in light of the cryptosporidium risk, it was decided that a boil water notice should be imposed.  The notice was initially for some 2,000 people and this number was reduced by the number who found alternative supplies, leaving between 500 and 600 people.  We have carried out weekly cryptosporidium testing in the interim and, to date, samples have been clear.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about EPA reports.  We have written to every individual customer on the remedial action list.  We want to get the information out and we are fully transparent.  It is not in our interests to sit on information and as soon as we know something we are happy to liaise immediately with both the EPA and the HSE.</p> <p>  Bottled water is part of our response to all vulnerable customers.  An offer is made but very few take it up because boiling water makes it okay.  Deputy Breathnach mentioned technology and referred to the use of fish in tanks.  This used to have a benefit because, when river water was polluted, they would leave one tank to go to the fresher water.  It was also very good for school tours but technology has moved on and it is now possible to put in monitors and sensors of raw water, which we test as it comes into plants.  In Leixlip, we have continuous ammonia monitoring and any increases cause alarm bells to ring at the plant.</p></speech>

In the Leixlip audit for March there was a misunderstanding about the shutdown but all other open items are being acted upon.  They are just taking longer.  We can correct some of the items straight away but some, such as the UV issue in the report, require an analysis and a discussion with the EPA.  If the EPA makes a recommendation we take it on board.  Open items on an audit are not necessarily a bad thing.</p></speech>

We are bitterly disappointed with this and we fully understand the impact it has on customers, both domestic and non-domestic.  The raw water which is extracted comes from the full River Liffey catchment upstream.</p><p>We are not just looking at pump stations or combined sewers.  We are looking at everything that is in the catchment area, and all of that comes down as far as Leixlip.  It is not just the combined sewers, misconnections or issues such as that.  It is everything that is happening from the perspective of agriculture, pesticides and so on.  That is what comes down, and we do sample in that regard.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the risk assessment.  In its audit report the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, outlines risk assessment in the plan.  However, we are very much in the space of drinking water safety plans where we do a risk assessment from source to tap, as we call it.  We go right back into the catchment.  That risk assessment will be part and parcel of our assessment around the need or otherwise for UV.  The risk assessment has to take the catchment into account.  We will then know what we have to treat in the plant, but when it leaves the plant, we also have to take the network into account and see how it is behaving.</p><p> In terms of the wet industry the Deputy referred to, whereas they were always fed solely from Leixlip, they now receive water from Ballymore Eustace as well.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. O'Leary.  In terms of Leixlip, I am familiar with the area from Leixlip to Ballycoolin as I was involved in laying the pipework going out that way.  First, is there a problem with staff shortages in Leixlip?  I note Irish Water has job vacancies there at the moment.  Second, is a sand-type system used?  I presume there is UV, chlorination and all of that on it.  What was the problem with the alarms that they were not activated?  Generally, they are fairly foolproof.  Third, is there a problem downstream with torpidity?  Torpidity will change.  People need to understand, in fairness to Irish Water or any group supplying water, that the regulations have changed so much that when it goes to a certain specification, a boil water notice must be issued.  Are there problems with the sewerage systems belonging to Irish Water where overflows have occurred and pressure is being put on it?  That is in respect of the Leixlip set-up.</p> <p>  In terms of Irish Water's five-year framework, if one reads Michael Brennan's book, and I refer to Coffey Construction also, the money in that ran out over a month ago.  Is there a problem with the amount of funding Irish Water needs?  To put in the machinery the witnesses are talking about in Leixlip and other places throughout the country, it will need a good deal of funding.  Does Irish Water need more funding to get emergency works done?  It is fine for the EPA to do reports.  What people need to realise is that before Irish Water was established, a part of this country, namely, Roscommon was subject to a boil water notice for ten years.  Irish Water needs a lot of money.  Judging by the budgets I have seen, there are many areas across the country that need major works, but to be honest, Irish Water does not seem to have the budget required for that.</p><p> Will the delegates address the leak detection issue?</p><p> When the Leixlip plant is up and running again and the boil water notice has been withdrawn, will Irish Water have scoured all of the lines from the plant that supply water to the 600,000 people affected?</p><p> The next question is for Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh and the Irish Water representatives.  The level of funding for sewage treatment plants in smaller towns has been changed this year by the Department.  No funding is proposed for a plant in a small town where raw sewage might be flowing into a river because Irish Water does not have a scheme in it.  The delegates must realise that where I come from, a rural area, we look after our own water supply through a group water scheme.  There was a scheme for sewerage systems, but small towns and villages have been left in a position where raw sewage can flow into rivers.  There are communities that are willing to come together in that regard, but because there is no Irish Water scheme in a town, there is no funding in place.  We were told that Irish Water was coming up with such a scheme.  Is it coming up with one?</p></speech>

At Lough Talt in Sligo Irish Water was going through the imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI, process.  It is dragging on.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh should be very familiar with the national parks.  Is the process nearly complete for the people surrounding Lough Talt who have experienced a problem with the water supply for the past ten years?</p> <p>  Is Irish Water going to move forward in undertaking the Shannon job if there is a problem in Dublin?</p> <p>  On procurement, Irish Water is stopping smaller contractors from operating because of the way it is increasing its turnover figures.  If it keeps doing so, it will limit water works in Ireland to four or five contractors.  The smaller operators that once worked for the councils are becoming sub-contractors.</p></speech>

We have modelled the water network from Leixlip.  At any point in time we know where the water at risk is, whether it be after 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours.  We were speaking about samples earlier.  If we know that the plant was stable, we would know where water would have passed through at the 72-hour mark.  To lift the initial boil water notice, we had to undertake some scouring at the extremities of the network to remove any remaining at-risk water.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Lough Talt.

The recruitment process ended yesterday.</p><p>The vacancy will be filled quickly.  As the range of other skills required at the plant is available, there is no shortage right now.  It is difficult for every local authority to maintain experienced staff for Irish Water duties.  As staff retire, we are generally finding it more and more difficult to recruit and fill positions.  Right now the treatment plant is staffed satisfactorily.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be interested to know that the first proper and full imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI, effort is to be carried out there by an Irish authority from beginning to end.  The Deputy will be familiar with the issues from what has happened in other areas.</p> <p>  We are aware of the community group sewerage scheme issue.  It is more complex than the issue of group water schemes.  We have a poor level of experience of smaller community managed sewage treatment plants because of their complexity and requirements.  There is limited support available among the existing group.  If available, the rural multi-annual programme for connection to an existing Irish Water pipeline is something we said we would look at.  There is a review group for rural water services and we said we would look at it as an issue.  However, it is complex and it is unlikely to be an area where we will come forward immediately with answers.  It is something that is being looked at.</p></speech>

I welcome the contributions that have been made.  People understand how grave the issue is and it is not only an issue because it affects the greater Dublin area; it is of significance because of the size of the outage.</p> <p>  As I put most of my earlier questions to the Environmental Protection Agency, Irish Water and Fingal County Council, I want to turn to the officials from the Department.  What assurance has been given by the Department and the Minister that, should additional funding be required by Irish Water or Fingal County Council to implement the recommendations made, additional funding will be made available?  Can that commitment be given here?  I believe it would be useful post the resolution of the November incident.  The committee could reconvene with the agencies represented today for a special session to ensure we would be kept abreast of developments in the implementation of the recommendations made.  In that way we could ensure oversight by the committee in the sense of being hands on.  That is a proposal I am making formally.</p> <p>  In his statement Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said the Minister had spoken directly to the managing director of Irish Water, Fingal County Council and the general director of the Environmental Protection Agency.  When did that happen?  Was it a face to face meeting, or was it on the telephone?  I have a particular reason for asking that question.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh referenced how reform was critical to the improvement programme for water services delivery.  He said Irish Water had responsibility for public water services operated under service level agreements with the 31 local authorities but that the company lacked direct operational control of services.  He went on to say this was not satisfactory and that the set-up was no longer fit for purpose.  Who is responsible for changing it?  Who is responsible for changing the responsibilities Irish Water has and the relationship between Irish Water and the 31 local authorities?</p> <p>  What I have seen in the past week is a large degree of washing of hands of the issue by the Department and the Minister.</p><p>There has been a Pontius Pilate approach to this and it is not acceptable because at the end of the day the Minister is the line Minister and the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer.  When the Department makes such statements it is as if the Department is simply commentating on the issue.  The suggestion is that it is awful and not satisfactory and no longer fit for purpose.  The reason I bring the Minister into this is because the official mentioned it in his statement as well.  Who is responsible for changing it?</p></speech>

The first thing is to go back to the question of the alarm.  The EPA report in March indicated an issue with responding to the alarms.  I am interested to know how Irish Water and Fingal County Council responded.  What was done to try to ensure that that issue of non-response to the alarm that occurred in March, which was identified in the EPA report in April, did not recur?  There is obviously the issue of who did not respond to the alarm and why.  There is also the question of the management system in place.  Given that there had been an earlier incident I am interested to hear back on that matter.</p> <p>  The second question is for Irish Water.  It goes back to the question of the November incident and what works need to be done to ensure that the possibility of that type of incident is reduced as much as possible.  I understand from the last response that work is being done around the filtration system.  If it is decided to do the ultraviolet work and money is provided, would that reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the November incident or would further works be required to mitigate the effects?</p> <p>  My final question is for the Department officials.  I appreciate that the reports the Department received from the EPA right up to September did not specifically relate to this audit and the issue of slippage, as the EPA termed it, in implementation.  The references were more part of a general report.  The Department gets those general reports.  At what point does the Department start to red-flag stuff in a preventative way?  We have heard from other Deputies about boil water notices for over 100 consecutive days.  Is there a point at which the Department decides there is a problem it needs to get involved in?  If so, what does the Department do at that stage, other than receiving the information and being informed?</p> <p>  The Irish Water officials addressed a question on compensation for non-domestic customers.  Is compensation available for regular families?  The Irish Water officials seemed to indicate that if people request bottled water they will get it.  That is certainly news to me and probably to the vast majority of people who have been spending sums of money on this.  Is there a facility available for individuals and families who have spent significant sums of money on bottled water to recoup or to secure bottled water directly from Irish Water?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.1041" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gleeson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#RR01000"><p>The first question was on the alarms and the responsibility or response to the alarms.  I guess the majority of it is down to Fingal County Council.  We indicated our dissatisfaction in March with the non-response.  One of my fundamental principles on this issue is that we cannot have a system relying on the actions of one operator.  We need to put in place better control systems and auto-shutdowns but more automation as well.  Our national control centre has secondary responsibility or an extra layer of responsibility.  We need systems and ways of working around that to make it effective.</p></speech>

There was a particular staff issue that gave rise to it.  That issue was dealt with in March.  There is always ongoing training and repeat training for staff members.  That is part of how we address it.  We were asked about what happens at the plant, understanding what happened the night before and what has been happening on an ongoing basis.  That is implemented by the management staff at the plant.</p><p>Again, shortcomings could then be addressed with the individual employees.</p><p> I have been discussing with Mr. Gleeson whether we should employ additional staff, especially for the out-of-hours times.  That process is ongoing and will take time to implement.  In the meantime, we need to strengthen our monitoring and controls.  That process is ongoing this week.  We have significantly enhanced those already.  It is work in progress and improvements are already in place, with more to happen.  We are open to every solution here.  If it requires more staff to be on site at all times, then this is something we can look at.</p><p> There is an issue in that the older plant probably produces more alarms than a more modern plant, which is a factor.  We need to understand and prioritise the alarms so they are reacted to in the right way.  It is a work in progress, but improvements can be made and have been made.  Whatever is needed will happen straight away.</p></speech>

Many of the questions have been asked.  I believe there is a huge communication problem.  A system where Irish Water does not know who is vulnerable or who qualifies to be vulnerable is a problem before we even start.  Irish Water does not know what the 31 local authorities are doing because every local authority is different and I believe it needs to put something in place.  It is crucial.  We all know vulnerable people.  Can I go into my local authority and say to a council worker that I know a vulnerable person who needs water?  What do I do to get it?  It is an issue when one loses contact with the person on the ground.  I am from Carlow and Carlow local authority was always the base.  Carlow County Council always fixed the pipes and did the work.  When a person rang the council, he or she knew who he or she was ringing.  The person knew the face.</p><p>Irish Water has been an operational company since it began in 2014.  The company's lo-call number is 1890 278 278.  I give it out all the time.  I have my own number, which I call and get through to the local call centre.  I have done this several times because I have done it for other people.  Then the local call centre has to get through to Irish Water.  Then Irish Water must get through to the local authority, whichever one it is.  Local authorities cannot touch a pipe without getting consent from Irish Water.  There is now a system whereby a person rings a number, gets through to a call centre, then the call is passed on to Irish Water and then to the particular local authority.  It is not working.  The reason it is not working is that there are too many numbers.  I am constantly highlighting water outages or whatever is happening.  I do not mind doing that because that is my role.  I will do that.  People, however, are finding it hard.  It is not like going in and speaking to someone face to face.  I do not think this system is working.  Is there any way that Irish Water could change that?  I believe that local authorities have lost all power.  I deal with Gr&aacute;inne in Carlow, who is excellent.  I must give her credit where credit is due, but I feel that there is a huge communication problem, which is getting bigger.  Irish Water needs to look at that.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on that.</p></speech>

That is effective for the entire country.  It is not localised and is not relying on individuals' knowledge and so on.  We have separate numbers for customers to dial in and we have numbers for elected representatives.  I am relatively new in the position, but reading into it there is a single point of contact.  For the customer it should be seamless.  They do not see those various points of connection.  The Senator understands them but the customer just rings up that number and reports a leak, and we take it from there.  To me, the system is working.</p></speech>

There may be things going on behind the scenes between Irish Water and the local authority but when the customer rings our call centre that call should then be actioned and our call centre should then get back to the customer.  If this is breaking down in any area I would be happy to hear from the Senator and we could investigate the particular issues.  With all these things, we always aim for continual improvement.  From our perspective the customer is centre stage and the call centre is there to serve the customer.</p></speech>

Irish Water will always have to go back to the local authority anyway.  Without a face that one can contact it becomes a problem.  Perhaps we could look at some other way.  I am aware that Irish Water has a Twitter hashtag and 1800 numbers, and I know the company is given media coverage, but Irish Water has been given a lot of funding over the years-----</p></speech>

Deputy O'Brien is back, so perhaps the witnesses can give brief answers to his questions.  October was a unique situation.  We all accept that now.  An alert was missed, a sequence of events happened, alarms were missed and so on.  November was not so unique.  Rain led to turbidity, which led to cryptosporidium treatments not being as successful as they would have been.  Rain is not a unique occurrence.

The works required at Leixlip can be managed within that capital budget.  I am sure of that.  Regarding the Minister's liaison with various people, he was on the phone to senior executives in Irish Water almost immediately once he was notified of the incident on the Tuesday evening.  He spoke to the managing director in the following days.  Yesterday he spoke separately to Mr. Niall Gleeson, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and the director general of the EPA, and said he would be having a formal meeting with the managing director.</p></speech>

He gave the impression that this related to the Leixlip plant and the associated water difficulties.  I want to know if Leixlip and the boil water notice were discussed at that meeting.  Was that a regular meeting or a special meeting?  In response to a question raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Dara Calleary on 23 October, the Minister gave the impression that it was a special meeting specifically convened to deal with the first October incident.  Can Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh shed any light on that?  I know he is not the Minister and the Minister is not here.  I will ask himself when I have the opportunity.</p></speech>

I understand these committee hearings are attracting considerable interest on Oireachtas News, which is good because not everybody can come here.  I welcome our visitors to this meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The purpose of the meeting is to continue our deliberations on Traveller health.  We are meeting representatives of the Cork Traveller Visibility Group, the Health Service Executive and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  We all agree that health and ill health are key issues affecting Travellers who have significantly lower levels of life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality when compared to the general population.</p><p>It is not just a small difference.  It is a very big difference, and that is why we are having these sessions.<br/><br/>The facts on the level and scale of ill-health among Travellers and the health inequalities experienced by Travellers, as presented to the committee by the submissions and the presentations, are stark in many ways and they speak for themselves.  We know from the very well respected - though in need of updating - All Ireland Traveller Health Study that Traveller men's life expectancy is 66 years of age.  Traveller men's lives are cut short by 15 years compared to the general population, which is a huge and serious gap.  The difference for Traveller women is 12 years.  Traveller mortality is three and a half times higher than for the general population.<br/><br/>At our last hearing, we heard that there was a recent health study done in east Limerick that bore out these statistics, and some things stand out.  One was that only 29 people in the local Traveller population were over 50 years of age and only three of those were over 65 years of age.  We have the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, which is still valid but needs to be updated.  We have some local statistics and recent statistics which bear out those trends and those disparities.  Traveller babies are almost four times more likely to die compared to babies in the general population.<br/><br/>These growth health inequalities facts and figures were clearly spelled out in general and in very personal terms, because when we have had speakers in here, people have spoken about statistics, trends and social determinants of health, but they have been speaking about their brothers, sisters, fathers, babies and their close family.  Again, we are reminded it is a small population of about 40,000 people, and when we look at the trends on health and mental health, people are talking about their own.  That has come across very strongly in the presentations we have had to date.<br/><br/>We heard from Kathleen Sherlock from the Minceir Whidden Society, Maria Joyce from the National Traveller Women's Forum, Nora Mooney from the Kilmallock Traveller group, and of course the veteran health campaigner, Missie Collins.  We also heard from Jim Walsh from the Department of Health who outlined the Government's official response to the health crisis among Travellers.  We heard the strong call for the health action plan to be published and for real and ongoing consultative measures of national and local level to established or even re-established.  That is why the committee is conducting its second hearing on health today.  As members know, we have had three hearings on mental health.  This one is on health in general terms.<br/><br/>I welcome everyone.  We are joined by Ms Breda O'Donoghue, the director of advocacy, and Ms Liz McGrath, the health team co-ordinator, Traveller Visibility Group; Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, head of operations, primary care, HSE, Concepta De Brun, HSE social inclusion unit, Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, co-ordinator of a Traveller health unit; and Dr. Mary Favier, president, and Dr. Tony Cox, medical director, the Irish College of General Practitioners.<br/><br/>Before we begin, we have to remind everybody about privilege.  In accordance with procedure, I am required to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings will be given, and that they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity in such a way as that person might be identifiable.  Members are reminded the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses or an official either by name or in such a way then as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind everyone to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they can interfere with the sound and the recording system and affect the television coverage and web streaming.</p><p> I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement made to the joint committee will be published on the website after this meeting so it will be on the record.  After the presentations, there will be questions from the members.  I call on Ms O'Donoghue to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I have been asked to discuss the key issues relating to Traveller health and its impact on our community.  When looking at the key issues impacting Traveller health and the community, we must first look at the root cause of these issues.  Putting another way, we must ask what is killing Travellers today.  There is one answer which is racism.  Over the past 50 plus years, specifically since the 1963 Commission on Itinerancy, Travellers have lived in a hostile environment, where our culture and identity was to be absorbed into the settled community and our very existence repeatedly seen and referenced as a problem.  While we understand that this commission's report is out of print and, as some of us would argue, is obsolete, its legacy has affected the lives of Travellers to this day.  We are seeing the product of a systemic cultural denial and discrimination in our public services from education to social welfare, private enterprises, employment opportunities, accommodation and media.  The effect of this historical assimilation programme on mental and physical health has impacted the Traveller community severely, leading to suicide and mental health being at crisis point, which has been rightly recognised as such by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.</p> <p>  At the Traveller Visibility Group, TVG, our primary healthcare workers meet on a daily basis with Travellers living in Cork.  They see how a mistrust of public services, based on discriminatory attitudes and behaviours of staff, and how policies have deterred Travellers from using these services effectively.  Travellers feel they are constantly struggling and resisting discrimination in their daily lives, where they witness their children struggling in schools and have their own issues with employment opportunities and appropriate accommodation.</p> <p>  While the social determinants of health and their effect on the general Traveller community are all important factors, accommodation is widely acknowledged as the key issue causing health inequalities for Travellers.  As reflected in the social determinants of health, if one's living conditions are poor, this directly impacts on one's physical and mental health, education, employment and general well-being.  The vast majority of local authority halting sites are overcrowded, badly-managed, poorly serviced, under-funded and unhygienic.  Put simply, these halting sites are not fit for purpose and lead to illness, injury and stress caused by an overcrowded and high-risk living environment.  We note that in some cases these confined conditions can lead to community disputes around sharing very limited spaces and facilities.  As noted above, poor living conditions lead to poor health.  Cardiovascular, dietary and respiratory problems are common within the Traveller community and can be directly linked to poor living conditions.  </p> <p>  Suicide and mental health within the Traveller community is at crisis point.  This can again be linked to the poor living conditions and isolation felt as a result of the poor management of Traveller accommodation.  The situation is clear.  Travellers living conditions and the social determinants of health have worsened since the 1963 commission.  The lives of Travellers are directly impacted by an accommodation and a mental health crisis that directly impacts their physical health and many of these issues are caused by historic assimilation and discrimination.  We need to distance ourselves now from reports and recommendations and start a genuine programme of legislation by creating sanctions to ultimately fix the cultural denial and racism issues that impact so drastically on Travellers lives and their children's future.</p> <p>  In general, Travellers tend to use health services as a last resort, often ignoring ailments or health issues until they are at emergency point.  Prevention and early intervention are key to improving and addressing health inequalities and this is directly linked to improving relationships and communication between health services and the Traveller community.  The statistics featured in reports such as the All Ireland Traveller Health Study paint a clear yet stark picture that Travellers are dying younger than the settled community.</p><p>They are seven times more likely to commit suicide and 50 times more likely to finish school without a leaving certificate.</p><p> While this information may sound alarming today, the sad fact is that it is not shocking news within the Traveller community.  In fact, it is almost identical to the statistics in the last Traveller health study in 1987.  As Travellers, we can see this in front of our eyes every day.  We have a situation where many Travellers are not accessing health services, for various reasons.  However, it has been reported that when Travellers access these services, they often feel the services do not reflect the needs of the Traveller community.  One example is that written correspondence is often delivered to another person on a halting site or maybe not delivered at all.  Whether this is for genuine reasons or otherwise, the fact remains that most Travellers on halting sites miss very important appointments due to lack of postal delivery.</p><p> When using health services, Travellers have a fear of the response they will get when presenting with an issue, particularly around children's health, at accident and emergency units.  Many Travellers fear the hospital staff will make assumptions about an injury or illness that has occurred and fear blame for the situation.  There is an increasing fear of hospital staff contacting Tusla or other social welfare services because of assumptions that are made about the way Travellers treat their children.  While we appreciate and welcome the need to be vigilant for children's safety, time and again we see instances of Travellers being treated with distrust and suspicion within the health services, and this creates fear and mistrust among the Traveller community. </p><p> To look at health initiatives to support the Traveller community, there is clear evidence that Traveller-led health initiatives, organisations and peer-support workers build trust within the community and, from this, there is a willingness to engage more with public services.  The primary health care programme and the development workers in Traveller organisations play a vital role in assuring Traveller engagement with public services.  There is better uptake of health initiatives and services like screening and health checks when communicated by peers to the community.  When provided with supportive and accessible information, it has been noted that there is a higher uptake and use of such services.  For example, more Traveller women take part in cervical smear tests and breast checks than settled women, which is directly linked to the support of Traveller primary health care workers.</p><p> The strong relationship and knowledge sharing within the Traveller organisations is a huge support to the Traveller community on a local and national level.  The support and representation of national Traveller organisations in policy and advocacy work is hugely valuable, and continued investment and support is essential.  Training and capacity building within the Traveller community is vital to promoting health and well-being.  Currently, Travellers are more inclined to engage with health awareness programmes or other training when Traveller organisations are directly involved in delivering the training.  More support of such programmes is necessary and would have productive outcomes.</p><p> While we acknowledge that this peer support is vital, we need to see development within the public services to encourage Travellers to be able to use these services directly, with reduced or little support from Traveller organisations.  Traveller cultural awareness training should be funded properly and adapted to ensure that all public service staff, especially customer facing officers, are fully aware of Traveller culture and can engage with their customers in a culturally appropriate manner.  In order for Traveller culture to be understood and appreciated, Traveller cultural awareness training should be mandatory as part of public service staff induction training.  Refresher training for longer-term staff should take place on a regular basis in such services as health, education, social welfare and local authority services, which are the main areas affecting the social requirements of Traveller health and well-being.</p><p> It is not good enough for front-line public staff who work directly with Travellers to have no understanding or background knowledge of the Traveller community.  Travellers are part of Irish society and need to be treated as such, with the same understanding and nuance that would be afforded to any individual coming in, looking for assistance from a public service.</p><p> I have spoken to the committee today about the key issues affecting Traveller health and the community.  At its root is an historic policy that has been in play for over 50 years.  This needs to change and everybody has a responsibility to drive this change.  There is an institutional prejudice that has been passed down from a group of people who saw us as a problem, not a people.</p><p>We have moved a lot in some ways, in that Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group and not something to be absorbed into the general community as the 1963 commission hoped for.  While on paper we are recognised as an ethnic minority, the reality is the deep-rooted feelings of mistrust towards my community have not changed or moved on.  Until they do, then and only then will we start to see a positive change in the health status of the Traveller community.</p><p> For the past 20 or 30 years, Travellers have consulted with Government bodies on what can be done for the Traveller community.  We have sat on countless committees and boards to advise and assist.  While we must recognise there has been some positive change in this period, we must also agree the process is slow and, in some areas, ineffective.  The time for recommendations is over.  We need real support and resolute actions where the recommended budgets, guidelines and plans are fully realised and brought into everyday life.  There is no more we can do to assist in the societal change that is necessary to improve the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  We consult but who decides?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.1128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to the HSE to attend the committee meeting.  I am the assistant national director with responsibility for primary care services.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Concepta de Brun, the HSE regional social inclusion specialist and Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, the Traveller health co-ordinator for the Cork and Kerry community healthcare area.</p> <p>  The All Ireland Traveller Health Study in 2010 provided evidence of a widening gap in health status between the Traveller community and the general population.  It found that people from the Traveller community experience lower levels of life expectancy than the general population and higher levels of morbidity associated with chronic disease conditions and other causes.</p> <p>  The goals of the HSE are to promote health and well-being as part of everything we do in order that people will be healthier; to provide fair, equitable and timely access to safe quality health services that people need; and to foster a culture that is honest, compassionate, transparent and accountable.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that health services for people from the Traveller community are provided in accordance with these values and objectives.  The national Traveller health advisory forum, which was established in 2008, supports models of good practice in the delivery of health initiatives to the Traveller community at local, regional and national level.  It operates under the governance of the HSE social inclusion service, which is part of primary care and supports the delivery of actions in Government policies to improve access to health services and address health inequalities within the Traveller community. </p> <p> Each year, in the HSE approximately &euro;10 million is allocated through social inclusion services for Traveller health initiatives.  This funding supports staff working in Traveller primary healthcare projects and Traveller health units.  Additional funding is also provided through dormant accounts and mental health services.  The majority of HSE funding for Traveller health is used to support Traveller primary healthcare projects.  There are 27 such projects nationally, which are staffed by members of the Traveller community.  They adopt a peer-led approach, supporting members of the Traveller community to support others in achieving health outcomes.  The projects promote population health initiatives by providing information to families on vaccination and health screening programmes.  This approach has played a key role, as Ms O'Donoghue has pointed out, in improving vaccination rates in the Traveller community.  Traveller primary healthcare projects play an important health promotion role.  For example, they provide education on antenatal care, child development checks, smoking cessation, diabetes care and asthma medication management.  The positive impact of the work of the projects was highlighted in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.</p> <p>  All Traveller primary healthcare projects fall under the remit of eight Traveller health units.</p><p>They are located in the nine community healthcare organisations and serve a Traveller population of approximately 36,000.  The Traveller health units are key bodies in delivering appropriate targeted services to members of the Traveller community, overseen by co-ordinators such as Ms O'Reilly.  Every Traveller health unit has an annual action plan relating to the local health needs of the Traveller community in that given area.  These plans contain actions relating to primary care, mental health, public health and health and well-being.  Traveller health units have established regional networks to share learning, ensure consistent practice, and optimise efficiency and value for money.  Arising from these networks, regional initiatives have made a positive impact on the healthcare needs of the Traveller community.</p><p> We have provided a great deal of information in our written submissions on the range of actions being undertaken in general by the HSE, specifically in the Cork-Kerry area, in partnership with the Traveller community and other organisations to support Traveller health.  The key aims of the work are to improve access, opportunities, participation rates and outcomes in the healthcare system, to reduce health inequalities experienced by Travellers, to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate, to support positive mental health initiatives and to reduce the rate of suicide and mental health problems.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and for their interest in the actions being undertaken to improve Traveller health outcomes.  I acknowledge and commend the commitment and motivation of staff working in the Traveller primary healthcare projects, the Traveller health units, primary care services and the wider health service.  Through them, we are committed to providing fair and equitable access to health services and to supporting improvements in health outcomes for the Traveller community.</p><p> Ms De Brun, Ms O'Reilly and I are free to take members' questions, if they have any.</p></speech>

The ICGP is tasked with providing education and training to the general practitioners, GPs, of the country.  We are a membership organisation that sets quality and standards.  Approximately 85% of GPs are members of the ICGP.</p> <p>  As has been well elaborated on at this meeting, a recent study has found that the Traveller community is affected by several significant social determinants.  As the ICGP, we want to concentrate on those that most impact on general health.  The life expectancy statistics show stark inequalities in health among the Traveller population compared to the general population.  Studies in maternal health, communicable diseases, addiction and mental health, including suicide, serve as clear indicators of the extent of this health inequity.</p> <p>  The high levels of mortality and morbidity among Travellers are well documented.  The life expectancy figures are most stark.  A male Traveller can expect to die 15 years sooner than a male in the general population, with a female Traveller 11.5 years earlier than her counterpart in the general population.  The infant mortality rate is 3.6 times higher for Traveller children than in the general population.  While there have been improvements among Traveller mothers attending antenatal services and having shared antenatal care between maternity hospitals and GPs, more than 2% of Traveller mothers still receive no antenatal care.</p> <p>  It is encouraging to know that many Travellers engage with primary healthcare services in particular, as evidenced by the 2010 All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  The study found that up to 91% of Travellers obtained their health information from GPs.  Travellers' own health beliefs may impact on access to health services, however.  For example, GPs treat appointments as the start of a process in treating their patients whereas Travellers may view the consultation as a single issue that should be dealt with in one visit.  These are matters of which we need to be aware.  In some cases, if symptoms do not improve, it can lead to a visit to a hospital emergency department rather than a return to the GP.</p> <p>  Health initiatives for the Traveller community must be informed by the principles of equality, human rights, social inclusion and respect for Traveller values, beliefs, culture and perceptions.  As with the general population, Travellers should have improved access to, participation rates in and outcomes from healthcare services.</p> <p>  The very high prevalence of suicide among Travellers is of particular concern.  Measures that would help include on-site sessional counselling and general practice, culturally appropriate awareness campaigns and outreach services signposted to primary care.</p><p>Targeted health initiatives and associated information materials for Travellers and healthcare providers should be culturally appropriate.  Any identified interventions should be designed to improve self-esteem among Travellers, reduce stigma and remove barriers to care.  Regardless of the health policy initiatives instigated for Travellers, the views of Travellers must be included when designing such interventions.  Traveller participation and co-operation in previous studies, research and information design have been key to their success.</p><p> While Travellers experience issues with access to GPs, the same is true for large sections of the population.  Clearly, access to GP services needs to be improved and some basic improvements could make large differences.  Practices that offer a combination of booked appointments and some same-day appointments would improve Travellers' access to GP services.  Cultural awareness training is appropriate for all practice staff and should be developed with input from the Traveller community.</p><p> The process of obtaining and retaining a medical card needs to be streamlined and simplified.  The health outcome differences between Travellers and the general population are avoidable and with appropriate resourcing and planning, these issues can, and should be, addressed urgently.  The Irish College of General Practitioners looks forward to playing a significant role in this area.</p><p> We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

My first set of questions are directed to the HSE.  It was mentioned that one of the key aims of the HSE is to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate.  How is this implemented?  What training do HSE staff receive and who delivers that training?  Is the &euro;10 million annual funding to Traveller health initiatives sufficient given the health needs of the community?  Was an increase in funding sought under budget 2020 or in any of the last five budgets?  If so, what was the response from the Department of Health?  Ms McArdle described a Traveller health provision structure which is siloed from the rest of general service provision within the health service.  What are the documented experiences of Travellers accessing general health services or in other words, services that are not Traveller-specific?  Is there a long-term shift planned to mainstream Traveller healthcare within general services, perhaps as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms?</p> <p>  My next set of questions is to the ICGP.  We heard previously in our sessions on Traveller mental health that many Traveller patients have had their medical cards revoked.  If there is documented impact in this regard, what has been the impact thus far on Traveller patients?  I made the suggestion at a previous committee hearing that regardless of a Traveller's circumstances, until such time as we exit the current health crisis every Traveller should be given access to a medical card.  I would like to know if the witnesses agree with me in that regard.  Are the HSE and the ICGP doing enough in the face of the Traveller health crisis?  Is there prejudice when it comes to healthcare services and what is being done to root it out?</p> <p> My final questions are to the representatives of the Traveller Visibility Group, Ms Breda O'Donoghue and Ms Liz McGrath.  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that the main cause of poor health outcomes is substandard living conditions.  What type of engagement has the group had with local authorities in regard to raising the standards on that ground and has there been real dialogue between Traveller organisations and local authorities on how the issue can be addressed?  It was also mentioned that the uptake in cervical screening is higher among Traveller women than in the general population and that this is due to the Traveller-led nature of the health intervention.  Ms O'Donoghue also mentioned that the group is constantly consulted to give advice but that while there is consultation, when it shifts to Traveller-led services, it changes.</p><p>How can this model be developed for further inclusion and development within the HSE in respect of other forms of Traveller healthcare?</p></speech>

There are two or three parts to our approach in this regard.  The Traveller primary care health projects are co-designed with Travellers as part of an approach to health services, or health service pathways, that is led by Travellers.  This is not a health service in itself; it is a location where Travellers can help other people within the community to access health services in their areas.  My colleague, Ms de Brun, will give further details on that in a moment.  The other role of the Traveller health units is to produce culturally appropriate materials that are co-designed with the Traveller community, are tailored to meet people's needs and have messages that are suited to the Traveller population.  This is not about setting up a separate health service; it is about ensuring the services we provide through the health services are as accessible as possible to the Traveller community.  The different Traveller health units take a prioritised approach.  They may prioritise particular actions, for example relating to chronic diseases or screening programmes, in different areas.  The HSE materials are designed to be appropriate to and supportive of the Traveller community.  I ask Ms de Brun to talk about cultural awareness training.</p></speech>

If one has a strong Traveller health unit, more of one's staff will be trained.  Our new health plan includes a commitment to improve our cultural awareness training.  We rely heavily on the peer support workers in the Traveller primary healthcare projects to provide culturally appropriate training.  All staff who attend and sit with Traveller health units have participated in cultural awareness training.  In addition, we culture-proof and literacy-proof anything we co-design or deliver alongside our cultural awareness training.  We do not develop any materials without working in partnership with the Traveller community.  All small local projects that are achieving or are doing very well are brought to the regional network and the learning is disseminated among the peer support workers in that network.  Models of good practice then come to the national Traveller health advisory forums.  One of the projects we are working on at the moment is the national mental health promotion training programme, which is a "train the trainer" programme.  Twenty trainers have been trained as part of the pilot and we are ready to try to roll it out.  The project was co-designed by members of the Traveller community and mental health staff.  I will set out where we are falling down with our work.  We probably need a much more robust framework to ensure culturally appropriate training is given to people beyond primary care and not just in the primary care and social inclusion services where the Travellers are located.  I accept we need to do more with other care directorates.</p></speech>

The &euro;10 million allocation for primary care services is going into the structure we have described.  Each year, including this year, we have applied for additional funding under social inclusion.  Each year, we receive small amounts of funding in addition to that &euro;10 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  We would welcome any increase in funding.  We know there has been a dedicated increase in funding for Traveller mental health initiatives.</p><p>However, the Traveller primary healthcare units model we have described has real potential to be used to assist the wider care group.  For instance, the same group of people is being asked to work on health promotion or mental health initiatives.  Additional investment in the area would help us to increase capacity, allow us to sustain the number of people working in the area and help us to grow and expand the work that is being done.  We would welcome any such increase.  We do a lot with what we have.  We outlined in our statement the wide range of initiatives being carried out through our projects and the Traveller healthcare units nationally.  That demonstrates very good progress and outcomes for the amount of money we have.  We acknowledge that we are not there yet; this is a journey.  We would welcome any further investment.</p><p> The Senator asked about a siloed approach.  It is important to state that the network or structure we have described is not about a replacement or siloed health service but, rather, about having a place where we can support people to access health services.  It is not a separate service.  The aim is to ensure that people from all communities, including the Traveller community, are enabled to access health services.  Our data show that the value of the Traveller networks and projects is that many people from the Traveller community rely on them as their first point of contact because they trust the information provided by their peers.  That is a very important part of health service delivery.</p></speech>

I work in counties Cork and Kerry and have the privilege of working with some of the other delegates who are present.  Silos can occur and people can be left out or marginalised further.  If we wish to address the marginalisation of the community, we must take two approaches, namely, a targeted approach and a mainstream approach.  Those types of approaches run the risk of becoming worse or siloed unless there is genuine commitment to Traveller leadership, Traveller voice and community development through an empowering model.  Those of us in the HSE must listen when we are told that we are getting it wrong or that the Traveller community has an approach which it knows works within its community.  It is always very important to explore such options.  One can look at the issue through equality frameworks and analyse whether the targeted work we are doing is genuine or indirectly creating worse situations.  The latter is something we never want to happen.  It is a very good question.  In counties Cork and Kerry, we try to work from a community development approach.  We do not view the social determinants of health as aspects of health that are outside the control of the HSE but, rather, try to work closely and, it is to be hoped, respectfully with Traveller organisations in the area to see what we can do to address the health inequalities caused by discrimination, lack of education or poor accommodation.  We explore whether there is something we can do to influence these factors or ensure the voices of various groups are heard.  People have differing understandings of these matters.  It is a very good question.  There are many ways we can ensure that, rather than creating another silo, we genuinely address historical marginalisation.</p></speech>

As the Senator is probably aware, a Traveller health needs assessment was published in July of this year.  Some 99% of the Traveller community has registered with a GP and 98% has a medical card, which is encouraging.  However, it is not just about having a medical card; it is about accessing services and turning up for healthcare, preventative services and acute services.</p><p>In that same report, it is detailed that 83% access care with their GP even though 98% have the medical card, only 57% attend hospitals and less than 5% attend the mental health services.  Therefore, it is not just about having access to the medical card, but we would agree that all members of the Traveller community should have medical cards.  We have heard the shocking statistics about the mortality, life expectancy and suicide rates.  It is just shocking.  To think that group of patients in society would not have medical cards would be appalling and we would support all members of the Traveller community automatically having medical cards.  Those who do not have medical cards would not be turned away or refused access to services.  We all work in an out-of-hours service and we work in our practices and nobody is turned away because they do not have the means of paying for the service.  If somebody has a medical need, they will be seen.  That is my experience and that would be the experience of all my colleagues.  Medical card access is important but access to the services that are available is also important.<br/><br/>The Senator asked if we are doing enough in working with the HSE and in working to address prejudices.  I have a son who has started his four years of general practice training.  We have a core curriculum in the college, and within that core curriculum we have several learning outcomes that specifically address the problems of the Traveller community.  I brought that document in and I could read some of those outcomes to the Senator but we have several learning outcomes such as:</p><blockquote>Understand the consulting behaviours of specific marginal groups - homeless, travelers&rsquo; drug users, new communities etc...  Be aware of cultural diversity between the Irish settled community and those from other cultures...  Address prejudicial attitudes and discriminating behaviour that they and practice staff might have towards marginalized groups...  Be sensitive to the differing cultural needs of non-Irish patients and travellers.</blockquote><p>We have others as well.</p></speech>

For me, this is the same with teachers.  One can sit in a classroom and look at matters theoretically all day long but it does not mean a doctor or a teacher or anybody who has that level of understanding and empathy with the trauma of a particular community will be produced.  Should a core curriculum always be matched with GPs in training having to spend time in the communities in which they will serve?  Should they train directly with Traveller organisations and with the working class communities to understand the social context, rather than just learning in a classroom?</p></speech>

They will live those lives with them, share their stories and understand their healthcare needs and the problems they have.  Hopefully, by being mentored by those of us who have been in practice for a long time and who have been working in the community with our patients, they will take on the objectives we have put down in our core curriculum.</p></speech>

While we have loads of brilliant reports and recommendations, until we see sanctions being put in place as to why these recommendations are not being followed through on, as Traveller organisations we believe we will not see any real change.</p> <p>  Did the Senator ask about the primary healthcare team?</p></speech>

It is about the promotion of it and the acceptance that it is working right now and protecting it.  We are looking at primary healthcare workers who are at the end of their rope.  They are working within their own communities so they work all day on the issues affecting their own community and then they go home to the same issues in the evening.

Like Dr. Favier said earlier, it is about helping and supporting Travellers not only to have a medical card but also to retain it.  Going back to the postal service, people on sites are not getting the notices that their medical card is up for appeal or renewal and then before they realise, their medical card is gone.  There is need for real support around that and maybe more long-term medical cards for Travellers.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Senator Ruane because it was something I was thinking about as well as regards mainstreaming cultural awareness training.  Dr. Favier mentioned in her presentation that it should be mainstreamed, which means it is not at the minute.  Perhaps we should think about making interdepartmental and cross-agency training available to everybody who encounters the Traveller community in their walk of life, whether they are teachers, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, doctors or whatever.  That might help to address that issue so that people would understand if, for instance, someone turns up for one meeting but does not appear again afterwards.  Would that kind of all-encompassing approach work?</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue referred to people missing appointments and losing important documents because their addresses are not fixed.  The housing issue is very complex, but if that could be sorted out, that would get to the root of it.  Everything else will flow if we can sort out the housing issue.  There seems to be a lot of money available for housing but in identifying need, has a proper analysis been conducted on the type of housing that is required?  I know Travellers who are settled.  They are in a house and they are very happy there.  I know other Travellers who are part of a group housing scheme, for example, and who like to move in the summer or whenever.  There are others for whom movement is what it is all about and they cannot think of staying in one place.  How do we identify how much housing is needed?  Has any work been done on that?  In respect of architects and people who design accommodation, has an analysis been conducted on whether there should be training for them as well?  I am thinking of when they are required to design group housing and how they would do that in order that it would fit into the landscape and so on.  Is that being done or should it be done?</p> <p>  On the HSE, it is great to hear the kind of connections it is making with people and that much of what the executive is doing is informed by consultation.  I also acknowledge the frustration of the witnesses that everybody is not aware of the type of information they need to deal effectively with members of the Travelling community.  How could that be improved within the HSE or do the witnesses see that deficiency in other organisations?</p></speech>

I mentioned the postal service and people not receiving their mail.  That is just one example.  Travellers live in the present.  Sometimes their personal appointments can be put on the back burner, especially in view of what is going on around them at the time.</p> <p>  Regarding accommodation, a member mentioned that there seems to be money around, and there always has been.  Fortunately, funding has never been a problem for us.  For the past 20-odd years, we, as a Traveller organisation, have made submissions to the five-year Traveller accommodation programmes in our local area.  We have always included a needs assessment for the area in those submissions.  One of those recommendations has been transient sites, which work very well in other countries.  I refer to Traveller needs.  Some Travellers are quite happy to be in a standard house, some are happy to be in a halting site while others are happy in a group housing scheme.  Approximately 95% of Travellers in Cork are in local authority housing or rented accommodation but that is not by choice.  We have argued for years in our submissions that the preferred choice of accommodation of Travellers is halting sites, transient sites or Traveller-specific group housing schemes.  Unfortunately, our submissions went to the wind at the best of times.  However, I have been delivering Traveller culture awareness training to student architects in University College Cork for the past five or six years, particularly addressing Traveller-specific accommodation.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There are brilliant and workable Traveller-specific schemes throughout the country.  The fact that there are so few of them keeps us in crisis all the time, particularly where accommodation needs are concerned.</p></speech>

There is great potential for cultural awareness training on many issues, not just those concerning Travellers.  It would be appropriate in many different fora.  However, the best evidence would have to be applied.  That evidence shows that this training should always be provided using resources delivered by those who are affected, in this case Traveller groups themselves.  In any other niche type of education, the evidence always indicates that this is how the education is best provided, whether in the context of an undergraduate setting, GP training or in postgraduate education in which the ICGP is involved.</p> <p>  I also refer to the issue of accommodation and resources.  I have been involved in Traveller health for the best part of 20 years as a GP.  I can attest that accommodation issues have been front and centre in the past five to eight years.  It has so much to do with housing, but it is also about austerity in a wider context.  Resourcing issues are manifest in a lack of GPs, with new GPs leaving and not enough being trained.  As a result there is a shortage of appointments.  Vulnerable patients, who are more likely to need walk-in services or may default from an appointment and need to be offered another one in a timely fashion, can no longer be accommodated.  Patients wait a week to get an appointment with me.  There is very little flexibility because of a shortage of GPs and a shortage of training.  Other austerity measures, for example, concerning medical cards have disproportionately affected Travellers.  The validation of medical card lists is done in a broad sweep.  A cardholder can receive paperwork with which to check his or her medical card even though it was renewed and a new plastic card issued only three months previously.  This disproportionately affects Travellers who do not receive the correspondence.</p></speech>

We spend substantial time chasing and renewing them.  There are disproportionate effects and the effect on accommodation is highly pertinent because it brings significant health risks.  Some 80% of Travellers live in non-winter-proofed accommodation, leading to more condensation and respiratory illnesses.  It also contributes to the infant mortality rate and to later presentations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Travellers in such accommodation live in fuel poverty and spend disproportionate amounts trying to heat inappropriate accommodation, which has a knock-on effect on presentations to general practice.  Unless we address these systemic and ingrained problems, everything will have a knock-on effect and this always means the most vulnerable in society, of which Travellers are part, are disproportionately affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.1170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#O00300"><p>My question is for the ICGP.  I was on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and we discussed GP accessibility and the number of GPs relative to the population, which has been affected by austerity.  It means the most vulnerable people are left at the end of the queue.  My own partner had to wait a week and a half for an appointment in the primary healthcare unit in our area.  This affects certain people in the Traveller community even more.  Not only do letters go to different addresses but postmen sometimes do not go into a halting site.  What do Dr. Favier and Dr. Cox think is needed?  I have tabled questions on GP training and the numbers going through the colleges.  We can talk about services for the Traveller and Roma communities but we need to know what it will all cost.  Will this committee or this Parliament insist that the necessary money be given to provide these services?  Funding for services for the Traveller community has not increased for the past ten years.  We are hoping for crumbs off the table in the shape of the Dormant Accounts Fund to do work the witnesses do in the area of social inclusion.</p> <p>  This committee needs to identify the issues and address them with funding.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study found that 90.3% of children were reported as having problems, with asthma the most common condition.  What needs to be put in place to deal with that and how much will it cost?  Can the services be integrated into other services?  The HSE submission and questions from Pavee Point referred to jobs in primary healthcare projects.  Members of the Traveller community work between six and 12 hours a week and do not have pensions.  We will have to examine how many nurses will be needed to play the critical role between the community and the primary care units, and how much will be needed to fund them.  It could mean that more than &euro;10 million will be needed.  It is not good enough to have studies, programmes and assessments without getting down to the nitty-gritty and match the needs with money.  The responsibility lies with Departments and other bodies.</p></speech>

On the role of support workers, we recognise they are part-time and that there is a barrier to sustaining and retaining people long term in those roles and attracting new people to the role of project workers with respect to the lack of a career structure.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms De Brun who will outline the new initiatives being taken to develop a career structure and support people in their education and development in order that we can embed this model in the way primary care services are delivered.</p></speech>

We would not be able to deliver the services without them.  The peer support model works.  However, as it has developed and grown since 1994, it has been stuck in a social protection, poverty culture.  I do not say that lightly.  A person would be reluctant to take up a full-time job if it would affect their medical card eligibility.  Recent increases in the minimum wage resulted in some workers not having their medical cards renewed because they were over the income threshold.  The option for them, therefore, was to reduce their hours and, thus, their income, to retain their medical card or to leave.  The infrastructure on which all the successful work has been done proves that it works but it needs investment in planning for the delivery of existing and future services.</p> <p>  Another element to the start of this investment has been our work in partnership with Pavee Point and Maynooth University to deliver pre-capacity training through 100 hours of education.  I understand the interviews for members of the Traveller community to participate in that course in the university are taking place today.  We are hopeful 15 members of the Traveller community will achieve a FETAC level 5 to level 6 standard in their first year and that this time next year, they will start a FETAC level 8 qualification course.  The HSE has committed to finding the people who complete that course meaningful grade 4 minimum salary posts.  We ask the committee to examine other Departments and statutory bodies following suit on this as a broader range of posts need to be made available.  While we started this process with Maynooth University in providing training in youth and community work through a five-year plan, a big picture approach needs to be taken under the public sector duty heading to ensure Travellers are employed across all Departments and statutory agencies.  </p> <p>  It is important all Departments participate in intercultural health and training.  The HSE is providing intercultural health, which the Deputy availed of with respect to the south east group.   While we offer it, it is not mandatory.  However, if one is in any way committed, one will do it.  </p> <p>  We have worked closely with the ICGP and the school of nursing and midwifery to ensure culturally appropriate training as well as racism and discrimination training are part of the core curriculum.  Those relationships in developing that work date back 20 years.  Professionals receive that accredited module when they come into the system but we need to examine if there is more we can do and more we can offer.  We are heavily reliant on Traveller and healthcare projects to deliver that training.</p></speech>

We have taken 194 young doctors into the four-year GP training programme.  We had aimed to take in more than 200 and the ultimate aim in the next one to two years is to take in up to 240 but even if we had 240 doctors in training, that would just about address the turnover.  GPs are getting a little older and it is becoming increasingly more challenging to encourage younger GPs to stay in general practice or to work in general practice full-time.  They do not seem to like the idea of working in isolated, single-handed practices.  Only 2% of them in a recent survey said that this is what they wanted to do.</p><p>They like to have a blended career where they work in hospitals and universities as well as in general practice.  That is a challenge to try to get the number in training up to where it needs to be.  We need approximately 5,000 GPs in the GMS.  We do not have that; we have approximately 3,500.  We have approximately 1,800 practice nurses but we need at least 4,000 and perhaps even 5,000 because a practice nurse is an essential part of the community care team and the practice team.</p><p> Reference was made to chronic disease management and asthma, in particular.  There is a programme of care for children aged zero to six but that is just a GP visit card that entitles them to the services of a doctor.  It does not entitle them to other services outside that.  A GP visit card is a bit of a joke in terms of accessing all the services that are needed and to which everyone should have access.  That is something we are concerned about.  We are trying to set up a practice nurse training programme to encourage more to come into the service and we are trying to establish that with an academic body in Dublin.  We approached Sl&aacute;intecare and the HSE for support on that.  We are trying to grow our GP numbers and practice nurse numbers because they are an essential part of the healthcare provision in the community.</p><p> As members will probably be aware, there will be a chronic disease management programme for the older age group starting next year.  There was a recent agreement in that regard.  That is due to launch early in the new year.  It is chronic disease management for respiratory disease in general, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  It will start with the over-75s and as the years go by, that will be extended to the lower age groups.  The next group will be those aged between 65 and 74 and so on.</p></speech>

It would be helpful for us to have a quantification of the resources for this group, as sought by Deputy Joan Collins.  Perhaps the ICGP could provide the information.

For historical and complicated reasons, Travellers tend to congregate and coalesce in their living circumstances in areas that are deprived.  That is usually to do with circumstances such as where halting sites are placed or allowed or where they have been illegal.  Areas of high urban deprivation have specific needs.  There is a very easy win in terms of providing cohorts of funding to those particular general practices.  There has been some move towards that in recent funding streams but it needs to be substantially higher.  Travellers are part of the population for GPs in areas of blanket deprivation, as opposed to pocket deprivation, and we need to have more GPs in those areas and they need to take more time.</p></speech>

It would allow flexibility of appointments and a little wriggle room.  It would allow staff to take more time to fill in the form for patients who do not have literacy skills.  There needs to be an understanding and awareness that one just needs to allow a little bit more slack.  That is not just the case for Traveller patients but for many patients who are challenged in those areas.  More funding would very quickly provide a win-win.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.1197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#R00900"><p>The first question I have is to seek information.  Some like to go to support workers of their own sex when seeking advice and so on.  Are there many more women than men acting as Traveller-led support workers?  I suspect so.  Is it working better with women?  Do we need to ensure more men are engaged as support workers to get men to engage?  I do not know the answers; I am taking the questions out of the sky.  Obviously, we want to get all Travellers to engage with the health services.  Is there a disparity between the number of women engaging and the number of men engaging through Traveller-led services?  Is there a disparity between the number of women leading the services and the number of men leading them?  We need to examine this.  The delegates might tell me whether this is an issue.</p> <p>  I always believe in taking something positive from any meeting.  Many very interesting issues can be raised, and many good suggestions have been made.  I wish to focus on an issue that keeps coming up, namely, the bureaucracy encountered in gaining access to a medical card.  The medical card office is the most unforgiving in the country for anybody dealing with it.  It is utterly unforgiving.  If one does not answer a letter within a 28-day deadline, one must start all over again on the 29th day.  People lose heart as a consequence.  Those who are most remote from the system lose heart fastest.</p> <p>  I am interested in getting a little more feedback on the number of Travellers who are issued with letters but who do not act on them because they have moved on or who throw them aside because they are removed from the system.  Many people, including settled people, throw them aside also. The more removed a person is from the system, the more likely it is that the letter will be thrown aside as a bother and will be forgotten about.  In such circumstances, a person will go to the general practitioner only to be told the card has expired.  How significant is this issue?</p> <p>  I will go through all my questions.  The second issue I wish to raise concerns the statistics we have been given.  They indicate that 13% of Travellers finish secondary school and that 57% of male Travellers only get a primary education.  Ordinary literacy skills, such as reading and writing, are an issue.  We all come across this.  The older the cohort, the greater the issue.  It matters when trying to fill out a complicated medical card form and such documentation.  Is there information and evidence indicating people simply give up?</p> <p>  I do not believe this has just to do with ordinary literacy skills.  We often ignore what I call bureaucratic literacy skills.  This involves a higher level of skill.  I know a Department that made a very clever move in this regard.  Where a form was developed on one side of the Department, clerical officers or executive officers on the other side were asked whether they could fill it out without knowing what it was about.  If, with their bureaucratic literacy skills, they could not fill it out, it was no good giving it to a member of the ordinary public, or even a member of the public with third level education.</p><p>I wonder to what extent there is a problem with the two levels of literary skill.   I refer, in particular, to what I call the bureaucratic literary skill, that is, for form filling and so on.  I have been contacted by all sorts of people who find filling forms to be increasingly challenging.  To what extent is accessing documents a problem?  The volume of documentation required nowadays for the simplest tasks is frightening.  I spent a fair bit of time yesterday with somebody who wanted a supplementary grant for a house.  The person is a Traveller who was trying to provide information.  It seems that the system is more concerned with catching one person who might get something he or she should not get than the 1,000 people who might have got that to which they were perfectly entitled but just could not get the paperwork together.  Society seems to have become rigid in that regard.</p><p> I do not know how many people have studied the medical guidelines, although they may have done if they deal with medical cards.  There are two ways in which one can obtain a medical card, the first of which is according to strict financial guidelines.  I heard a case yesterday of a 65 year old who happens not to own their own house.  A Traveller could own a caravan, however, and would have no rent.  The guidelines, even for those over the age of 65 years, specify maximum weekly earnings of &euro;298.  Even on jobseeker's allowance, the basic rate is higher than that.  I am sure our guests will tell me that without means, one can obtain the card on a concession, but the guideline figures are very low.  The normal ways they help people are with mortgages; rent, although if one has a caravan, that does not count; and childcare, although in some cases the parents take care of the children and do not pay for commercial childcare.  The only other way of obtaining a medical card is in the form of a discretionary one, but the applicant will have to be good with a pen to know what is an eligible expense for a discretionary card.  I am highlighting the barriers.</p><p> When we take it all together, to what extent is the medical card challenge an issue?  One receives a nice little plastic card with a date on it.  If a credit card has a date, I know that it will be good until then.  In the case of a medical card, however, it might specify an expiry date of 2021 but halfway through 2019, I might be told I will be called for a random check.  How much of a help would it be if the cards were issued for five years and the expiry date was the expiry date, unless one could be proven to have defrauded on a massive scale one's entitlement to a medical card?  As the man says, the medical card is not worth all that much.</p><p> The issue of Traveller self-identification was raised.  The concept is nice but I can see the layers of bureaucracy that will apply.  There are two problems with self-identification, on which I would like our guests' views.  People do not necessarily want to self-identify.  Some do but others do not.  Some are proud but others are not.  Some feel cowed because of what life has taught them.  The other point is I can imagine the HSE adding another five pages to the forms to tie one up in that regard.</p><p> If our guests consider some of the issues I have raised to be valid, would it be worth our while asking the medical card section to appear before the committee and take a grilling on the issues?  That is my punchline.  Are our guests facing such issues and if so, should we present those issues to representatives of the medical card section?  I am sure our guests could raise other issues.</p></speech>

It would be a good idea to make such an invitation and the clerk to the committee and I have discussed it.  In the meantime, while we wait for the invitation to be made, could our guests comment on some of the barrier issues, such as to men accessing healthcare and the bureaucratic barrier we have discussed at length?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.1200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Favier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#S00300"><p>It is well established that all female patients consult their doctor more often than men, whether because of their own health issues or because they bring children and other family members to the doctor.</p><p>That is particularly true in the Traveller community because there are particular cultural barriers for Traveller men accessing the services.  It is an issue of which we must be aware.  Those barriers can range from sitting in the waiting room through to, for example, presenting to younger female doctors.  Those are cultural issues and it is for us, as GPs, to be aware of those issues, attempt to circumvent them and understand cultural issues around not wishing to present with mental health issues, for instance.  </p><p> We have recently rolled out a suicide prevention training programme that has involved almost 500 GPs and a particular part of that relates to the increased risk of suicide in the Traveller community and the issues for men presenting with mental health problems.</p><p> The access to services and educational opportunities for women in the Traveller community have come on extraordinarily in the past 20 years.  There has been a massive change and Traveller men are only starting to catch up from a health point of view, which is to be welcomed.</p><p> Bureaucracy issues fall disproportionately on the women because they often have to deal with trying to sort out all the medical cards and keep on the top of the paperwork and appointments.  As GPs, we would value clarification on the medical card issues because patients can present with a valid, brand new plastic card that is not valid.  Practices such as ours are long established and we know the patients well so there are many workarounds but in out-of-hours and GP on-call services, that is a fundamental problem.  Situations arise where there are tensions around patients presenting without cards, who has a card and who does not, and whether a card is valid.  It needs to be sorted out.</p><p> The bureaucracy issues apply on so many levels in respect of literacy.  There is a need for cultural awareness that form filling should not be done just for the sake of it.  The centralisation of services to what we call the offices off the M50 has proved problematic for patients and is challenging for GPs.  We meet significant literacy skill issues in the area of health bureaucracy.  There are problems that could be quickly solved, which would make everybody happier.</p></speech>

I am always cheered to hear anyone say that an issue would be easy to deal with and that will not only be a recommendation but an action for the committee.  I thank Dr. Favier.

I know of Traveller families whose first child turned 16 and, until then, had been part of the parents' application form.  It becomes a whole new ball game and application form at that stage.  Every document that is needed has to be copied.  It is a frightening and traumatic experience for some Travellers who have no literacy in their family.  It is a process that is repeated over and over again.</p> <p>  On the question about support work for Traveller women and men, the Traveller Visibility Group has a Traveller men's health development worker and he has a number of men's groups around the city.  There are not as many of those as there are Traveller women's groups but there are some and those men are looking for more information and development courses.  Men are still very much behind but, as Dr. Favier said, we are seeing them catch up a bit.</p></speech>

For every four workers, there is probably only one man and even that has only happened in the past five to six years.  We have begun to engage with men and get them in the door but we are way behind in comparison with the experience within primary healthcare projects for women Travellers.</p><p>One is in a situation where one is discussing sensitive information about people&rsquo;s personal lives.  One is not just going to go to anybody.  We have a situation where we are upskilling and engaging more young Traveller men.

Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Reilly has a good example of this in that it is not just gender that can be a barrier but age as well.  There is some good work happening in Kerry and in other projects where, having engaged older project workers, they are reaching out to older people and looking at the more specific issues to do with ill health in the older members of the Traveller community.</p></speech>

We have a mental health primary healthcare worker in Kerry.  It is still true, sadly, that members of the Traveller community do not reach the same age as my father did of 87.  The death rate is shocking.  In the Kerry project, they have started a small project with one community healthcare worker who is a woman.  She is doing community health in a slightly different way.  She visits the other people who deem themselves to be the older members of their community.  They share information and do many kinds of different things that might have happened in the club in the past.  Apparently, this has been quite successful for encouraging people who are not well to go to hospital.</p> <p>  Two male primary healthcare workers also work specifically with national organisations such as Pavee Point looking at the issues facing men&rsquo;s health, how best to respond to that and to support Traveller men.</p></speech>

The Traveller health units ensure all information is culturally appropriate, uses plain English and involves service users in the Traveller community in designing forms or information that will help people access health services.  This has been found to be successful.  We would again like to scale this up and use it in other parts of the health service to ensure people are enabled to access the range of health services.</p></speech>

I suspect it goes under the radar to a certain degree.  Where there is desperation and lack of hope, what usually follows is substance abuse.  I can say that from my own experience living in Clondalkin.</p></speech>

Taking a mental health promotion approach, the Small Changes - Big Difference programme has been a positive initiative in the Traveller community and through the Traveller health units to try to address both building awareness of substance abuse and misuse, and the causative relationship to mental health and to more serious addiction issues.  Through the national Traveller advisory forum, there was the development of culturally appropriate mental health materials to support positive mental health initiatives, which would include information on addiction and substance misuse.  Over the past two to three years there has been a positive uptake through the project on that and building awareness of the relationship between those behaviours and the impact then on health.  I ask Ms de Brun to provide more detail.</p></speech>

We do not have them to hand.  There is an ethnic identifier.  The centre can identify the number of Travellers attending its services, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  We rely on local relationships with the drugs task forces to deliver local needs approaches within the services.  For example, the drugs task force in Clondalkin has worked very closely with Travellers there to develop a culturally appropriate response to counselling.  We hope we will get the money to fund that soon.  The background to that is that it is counselling for people who are affected by alcohol and substance misuse in particular.  That model represents a local response.  We would like to see other Traveller health units engage with their drugs task forces and that moneys for addiction services would be invested in a similar way but we are not there yet.</p></speech>

At least 50% of Traveller men in our area, Cork city, have turned to alcohol and substance misuse.  We have made direct links between that and the loss of Traveller culture.  Travellers no longer living on halting sites or within the extended families, Travellers who have ended up in homeless services and felt very isolated, and Travellers who are using our service are telling us that their culture has gone and they have nothing to cling on to.  All their norms and traditions are gone and substance abuse is making up for that.</p> <p>  We have a brilliant Traveller counselling service.  Thomas McCann is a Traveller man who runs a counselling service.  Is that the answer?  Travellers in general do not use services.  I do not know if it is right to provide more services until we know what types of services are needed.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to read through the documentation prior the meeting.  I was held up at a meeting in my constituency.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  The ongoing engagement is really important.</p> <p>  We have touched on health literacy, something that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills has examined in terms of educational outcomes for vulnerable groups.  Representatives of the Traveller community took part in that.  In about three weeks time we will also look at issues relating to literacy.</p><p>We will include health literacy in that, as opposed to just literacy.  That is really important. It was really positive to see from the submissions that the Traveller community has workers working so well within the community.  They said it was hard to recruit the Traveller health workers although they seem to be doing a really good job.  It was very interesting to see that number of Traveller women going for BreastCheck and the test for cervical cancer is far higher than the number in the settled community.  Are there lessons to be learned from that about how it was possible to encourage women to go for these important tests that we all need to do?  Are there lessons to be applied to other aspects of Traveller health to encourage them to get involved?  I take the point that there was more success in respect of Traveller women's health and those lessons need to be applied to the men.  </p></speech>

The majority of the workers are on between eight and 12 hours, to retain their medical cards.  We take a very proactive approach to health literacy.  Most of the work that we do with the Traveller primary healthcare projects is literacy proofed.  We work very closely to try to get where possible accreditation through the FETAC system.  Much of what we do is rooted in education.  We need to be sure that we have the right people at the table when we are developing programmes in partnership with each other.  We also call in experts.  When we worked with the Asthma Society of Ireland we would have had doctors and nurses and specialists in diabetes at the table.  We would not have gone off to do it ourselves.</p> <p>  If there was to be investment in this model because it works, the question would be whether services would need to be enhanced in primary care as well as improving the terms and conditions for the workers and if investment needed for men's health as well because only one-fifth or fewer of those workers are men.  It is then a matter of considering the work coming through on mental health, health and well-being and other care groups and how to enhance that work by expanding that model.    </p></speech>

Our statistics in the Traveller population are second to none and we are beavering away at the men's screening programme where we have overachieved on our targets this year but we still have more work to do with the Traveller men.  That peer support model could easily be replicated for regeneration board areas of deprivation in all urban and rural areas.  The peer support model works.  Where there are poor health outcomes for other economically disadvantaged groups the learning that the Traveller community has could easily be shared.</p></speech>

Accessing addiction services is then very challenging and difficult.  The Traveller community and the community in general are resistant to accessing addiction services.  As a GP on the ground, I would appeal for more access to addiction services.  I really feel that is a challenge and there is a gap there.</p></speech>

Several meetings are clashing.</p> <p>  It is great that there is such good feedback on the model.  While we all need to ensure there is awareness and information, funding will be the biggest issue.  There is a good model that the witnesses know they can work with and pass on to other counties, but where will the funding come from?  Have the witnesses been in talks with the HSE or other agencies?  Funding is crucial.  Do the witnesses have proposals for this?  Have they talked to other agencies about rolling it out across the country?</p></speech>

The 27 primary Traveller primary healthcare projects are in every county.  There is a Traveller health unit across every part of the CHOs.  They were developed initially for primary healthcare, incorporating things like health promotion and accessing GP services.  In more recent years we have moved towards looking at specific targeted approaches.  For instance, on the basis of the all-Ireland health survey, there have been targeted approaches to identify the chronic health conditions driving morbidity and lowering life expectancy.  Even more recently we have looked at mental health.</p> <p>  The challenge is that we are still looking at the same cohort of staff within those projects.  The ask for us is investment.  Every year we make applications to the Government for expansion of those services.  We have seen investment in mental health services for members of the Traveller community, but it is only the start.  There is need for further investment to ensure that the good models that work in primary care can be expanded across other care groups to ensure that the different members of the Traveller community - not just the women who are supporting their children's health particularly, but also men and older people in all age groups - are attracted to working within and providing supports for the community.</p></speech>

It is like everything: funding will go to one area quicker than to another.  In my area funding is crucial.  Mental health is a major issue as are life expectancy and homelessness - an area I address all the time.  We need more funding in these areas; we need more information and awareness.  When fighting a case for someone who is homeless, I find there are no extra services for them.  We are hitting our heads against a stone wall all the time.  I know there is a certain service, but not to the scale needed.  Overall, we need to look at funding.  We need to look at all the areas that need to be addressed.  It is good that it is working in certain areas.  I think it is all down to funding, awareness and information.</p></speech>

We are very limited in our project.  We work with KPIs.  We are very conscious that our funding has to go in certain directions all the time.  We no longer feel that is working.  We need to be able to branch out into different areas.  What we are doing with the primary healthcare programme is great and the care-support workers are brilliant.  However, the problem is with what they are limited in doing.  That is the challenge for us at the moment.</p></speech>

It is so important everyone knows we are there to help and that there is information and help there when one needs it.  That is what it boils down to.</p></speech>

One question, which is for the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE, in particular, is whether you think there is prejudice among HSE staff and GPs towards Travellers.  What is your honest opinion on that?  What happens when that arises?  Are the appropriate measures, such as disciplinary action and so on, followed through?</p> <p>  The second question is a very practical one.  We had the Department of Health in two weeks ago, and it said it was down to the HSE to publish the health action plan.  Is that the HSE's understanding of that?  When is that going to come out?</p> <p>  Do you accept there is a Traveller health crisis?  When would you expect Traveller health and the general population's health to be one and the same?  Will it be in two years, five years, ten years or 20 years?  I do not mind who answers those questions and in what order, but I would like to hear from you all.</p></speech>

At a local level, if that comes back to a public health nurse or people say it is there, there are good local working relationships and generally people will share that experience and it can be addressed at a local level.  The training programmes are the key, both in educating our healthcare professionals and in maintaining and ensuring that people are regularly getting cultural awareness training.  In terms of data around specific incidence of prejudice, I do not have that data.  It is certainly something we can look at.</p></speech>

There is legislation to protect against discrimination, and that certainly would be enforced.  We would support service users, or any member of the population who experiences prejudice or discrimination in the way they access services, to ensure it is brought to our attention.  I do not have that data, but we can certainly find out for the committee if that would be of use.  The training approach would be the known way.</p></speech>

It is part of the health actions under the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, NTRIS.  It is one of 30 actions that are health related.  It is at the final stage of preparation, and my understanding is it is due to be published at the end of this year.</p></speech>

We know there is a gap, and we know what we need to do to address it.  Changes that look at population change, or demographic change, take a longer period of time than three to five years.  We are talking about a generation.  However, we know specifically the things that need to happen like uptake in engagement with primary care services in terms of managing chronic disease, engaging with the mental health service to be aware of the services that are available and, at the individual level, supporting each individual to access the health services that are needed.  After that, what that means for the population, trends and data will tell us, but I suppose the specific focus at the moment is that members of the Traveller community, children, adults and older people, know the services are available to them and that they are enabled and facilitated to access those services.</p></speech>

It is well established that they experience it in all aspects of society, particularly in institutions and in the delivery of care.  I am sure it is also their experience in general practice.</p><p>I would like to think that from a general practice point of view, because we tend to be embedded in communities, we know people for extended periods of time.  We know their histories and we know their context and, therefore it is less likely to be an issue, but I cannot say that it does not happen.  We need to accept reality and focus on ways that we can potentially change it.  In terms of ways we can change it, the committee spoke about the health action plan.  We would ask from a general practice point of view that it would be integrated clearly into a primary care and general practice setting and that we would not have this silo, with a glossy brochure, and where implementation would not just be integrated-----</p></speech>

Our first challenge is to make sure they do not get worse.  There has been such a structural undermining of some of the systemic supports, whether it is in the number of primary care workers in the Traveller area, whether it is the medical card issue or whether it is the accommodation crisis.  There are statistically more Travellers who are homeless.  The number is huge.  They all impact in the broadest sense on health outcomes.  That is the most important one.  I imagine it could be 25 years.  Again, I do not have a crystal ball, but it will be incremental, and there has to be an integrated approach.</p></speech>

I am speaking as a Traveller woman who has experienced those prejudices.  I work in a Traveller organisation and I deal with the community on a daily basis and people tell us that they experience those prejudices.</p> <p>  On the national plan, we have concerns that it does not seem to have a pathway and a structure at the moment.  We also think that it can only work if it is in partnership with the likes of the Traveller organisations, the HSE and primary healthcare.</p></speech>

People need to have an equal say on yet another programme or plan that is being rolled out and not just to be there.  I do not want to sit on another committee as an advisory person.  I want to be able to have a say.  I want my voice heard at the table, and I want to be able to have a say in the decision that is being made at the end of that meeting.  That is what I feel would work and what would help the national health advisory plan to work out and run a lot better.</p></speech>

While the facts and figures are stark, there were also very practical ideas and proposals put forward from both sides today, and we would hope to capture that in the report.</p> <p>  Thank you so much for your time this morning.

I have noticed when one is talking about disadvantaged groups that they are often patronised as if they did not have the same latent intelligence that the rest of society has.  In certain ways, I have often noticed that they would buy and sell the whole lot of us who are good at pushing pens.  Therefore that real partnership is vital because no one knows it like the Traveller community.  Nobody has actually walked the walk.</p><p>The big challenge for us, as settled people, is to ensure that everybody is treated equally and has an equal input, rather than an agency saying that it consulted and heard what people said in a box-ticking exercise.  It must be a real partnership.  My experience would tell me that is often not the case.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  The committee will invite representatives of the HSE and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection back before the committee under the heading of a different module to talk about the whole issue of medical cards, which came up frequently here and seems to be a practical barrier and one we might be able to do something about.
