    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#F00200"><p>I  thank the committee for inviting the EPA to assist, as appropriate, on the issues affecting the quality of water in Ireland, boil water notices nationally, and the recent boil water notice for parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath, noting that there is now another evolving situation at the plant in question.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues from the EPA's office of environmental enforcement, Dr. Michelle Minihan and Mr. Andy Fanning, who is a programme manager in the area.</p> <p>  The EPA is the drinking water quality regulator for public water supplies and works to ensure that drinking water supplied by Irish Water meets the standards of the drinking water regulations so that public water supplies are safe to drink.  Local authorities are the regulators with responsibility for the drinking water quality of private water supplies, if I may make that distinction.  </p> <p>  As the utility supplying public water, Irish Water is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies meet the standards of the drinking water regulations.  Other suppliers including group water schemes and private suppliers are similarly responsible for the drinking water they provide.</p> <p>  The EPA's primary focus is to oversee Irish Water's response to drinking water quality failures.  However the agency also requires Irish Water to take actions to prevent drinking water quality failures from happening in the first place and is working to ensure that investment is prioritised for those water supplies that pose the greatest risk to public health.</p> <p>  Irish Water must notify the EPA of any drinking water quality failures and the agency then oversees Irish Water&rsquo;s investigation and their actions in response to the failure.  As part of the agency's role in drinking water quality investigations, it may audit drinking water supplies and treatment processes, issue legal directions, take legal prosecutions in certain circumstances, or place a water supply on its remedial action list.  The remedial action list was first prepared by the agency in January 2008 and is a dynamic list of public water supplies that the agency has identified as at risk and as priorities for remedial action by Irish Water.</p> <p>  I will briefly address some of the issues affecting the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  In its most recent report on the quality of public drinking water supplied by Irish Water published in September this year, the EPA found that the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards and 99.6% compliance with chemical parameters in 2018.  While this indicates that the majority of public water supplies are safe, further measures are necessary to improve the security of our supplies and avoid long-term boil water notices into the future.  The 2018 report set out a series of issues affecting the quality of the drinking water supplied by Irish Water that require action, namely, ensuring adequate disinfection of treated water, reducing the presence of trihalomethanes, THMs, in treated water, replacing of lead water mains and household pipes, eradicating persistent pesticide failures above the limit set out in the drinking water regulations, and establishing drinking water safety plans for supplies.  These issues have been recognised for a number of years and the EPA has recommended that Irish Water take a strategic national approach to them to prevent further drinking water quality failures.  The report also highlighted that cryptosporidium detections have increased in the past three years.  It was detected in 25 public water supplies in 2018, up from 17 in 2017 and 12 in 2016.</p><p>Cryptosporidium is a parasite found in human or animal waste and, if present in drinking water, can cause persistent diarrhoea.  Illness is often more severe in small children and elderly people and can be very serious in people who are immunocompromised.  If cryptosporidium might be present in a supply, appropriate treatment processes, referred to as a "barrier", must be put in place.  These barriers also serve to address certain other parasites, including giardia, which can give rise to similar illnesses, if consumed.</p><p> Adequate treatment is required at all water supplies where cryptosporidium has been identified as a risk.  It is not enough to have a barrier in place; it must also be properly operated and maintained.  At the end of 2018, the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list, RAL, included 15 supplies with inadequate treatment for cryptosporidium.  The EPA will continue to monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s progress towards ensuring that all supplies have an adequate barrier to cryptosporidium.</p><p> The issuing of a boil water notice is not a statutory function of the EPA but is done by Irish Water or a private water supplier in consultation and agreement with the HSE.  As the environmental regulator of Irish Water, the EPA emphasises that there is a need for boil water notices and other water restrictions, in certain circumstances, to protect human health.  During 2018, 44 boil water notices were in place in 14 counties, affecting more than 97,000 people.  This is an increase compared to 2017, during which 42 boil notices were in place, affecting more than 21,000 people.  The main reason for the increase in the number of people affected is that 65,000 people were on a boil water notice for three days in early 2018 when a disinfection failure occurred at the Vartry reservoir supply.  More than 13,500 people were also affected by 12 precautionary boil water notices issued due to Storm Emma in March 2018.</p><p> It should be noted that a long-term boil water notice is one that is in place on a supply for longer than 30 days.  Of the 44 boil water notices in place during 2018, 26 were short-term notices and were lifted within one month.  Five were long-term notices that were in place for longer than one year.</p><p> I want to turn now to the recent boil water notice affecting parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  In addressing this, I acknowledge this is an evolving situation and, if the Chairman allows, I will say a few further words on the current issues at the conclusion of my statement.</p><p> Irish Water informed the EPA at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October of a mechanical failure at Leixlip water treatment plant, which had occurred on Monday, 21 October.  The EPA participated in a meeting between HSE and Irish Water on the afternoon of Tuesday, 22 October to assess the risk this incident posed to consumers.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council, following consultation and agreement with the HSE, issued a boil water notice.  The boil water notice was a preventative measure and was necessary to ensure that public health was protected and consumers were not at risk from cryptosporidium or giardia, the microscopic parasites that can cause illness.</p><p> On Thursday, 24 October, EPA inspectors conducted an audit at Leixlip water treatment plant.  The purpose of the audit was to establish the full facts of the incident and the corrective actions taken.  It was also to verify the performance of Leixlip water treatment plant and to assist in gathering the information to facilitate the lifting of the boil water notice.  EPA inspectors also reviewed the recommendations of the agency's previous audit of 22 March 2019 and assessed the implementation of the actions taken to address those recommendations.</p><p>In the audit, the EPA inspectors found the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October, and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, when remedial works restored the affected production line.  The water treatment plant appears to have operated satisfactorily between 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October and the current issue emerging.  There was sampling of treated water for cryptosporidium and giardia in the critical period before, during and after this incident.  These samples indicated that the quality of water supplied following restoration of the production line was satisfactory.  A blockage in the coagulant dosing line resulted in operational difficulties with the water treatment processes and gave rise to elevated turbidity levels in treated water.  The elevated turbidity levels in treated water indicated a significant risk to the safety of the water supply because the treatment barrier for the removal of cryptosporidium and giardia was compromised and there was a risk of breakthrough of microscopic parasites into the water supply.  There was a failure to respond to multiple alarms that activated in response to the elevated turbidity.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council implemented automatic plant shutdown for the whole plant when turbidity alarms were not responded to within 15 minutes on 24 October 2019, the day of the audit.</p><p> While the Leixlip water treatment plant was resorted to a satisfactorily operating status following the incident, the level of treatment at this plant is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water, as further evidenced by the emerging situation.  In particular, there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Filter upgrade works are under way to reduce this deficit but will not be sufficient to confirm adequate treatment.  In its October audit report, the EPA recommended that ultraviolet disinfection be considered by Irish Water as an additional treatment barrier to inactivate cryptosporidium and giardia at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  As an ultimate failsafe, ultraviolet disinfection will inactivate any cryptosporidium and giardia parasite in the water supply to ensure the protection of public health.</p><p> The boil water notice in question was lifted by Irish Water at 4.30 p.m. following meetings on the afternoon of Friday, 25 October, between the HSE and Irish Water and between the HSE, Irish Water and the EPA.  During an audit of the Leixlip water treatment plant in March 2019, the EPA highlighted the risk of this type of incident occurring, following a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the plant, and recommended that plant operators respond immediately to any alarm generated, and that if an operator failed to respond to an alarm, that Irish Water should ensure the plant automatically shuts down to prevent inadequately treated water being supplied to consumers.  In May, in response to that audit, Irish Water confirmed the plant would automatically shut down when an operator failed to respond to an alarm.  The EPA audit on 24 October found the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented on one production line at the Leixlip water treatment plant in April 2019 and was only implemented on the remaining two production lines at the plant on the day of the audit.  The EPA's report following the audit on Thursday, 24 October, was published on 30 October on the EPA's website.</p><p> As committee members are aware, there is an emerging issue at the water treatment plant in Leixlip and I will take this opportunity to advise the committee on the EPA's engagement on the issue at this point.  Yesterday morning, 4 October, Irish Water advised the EPA there were operational issues at the plant over the weekend.  On Sunday, 3 November, two out of three of the production lines at the Leixlip plant were shut down from 1 p.m. due to high turbidity levels in the raw water entering the plant, attributed to the very high rainfall experienced on Saturday, 2 November.</p><p>This shutdown had depleted the reserves of treated water in the reservoirs and distribution network served by Leixlip.  Due to ongoing heavy rainfall yesterday, there continue to be issues with the quality of raw water entering the plant.  The increase in turbidity in the filtered water gives rise to a risk of breakthrough of the parasites cryptosporidium and giardia into the water entering the distribution system.</p><p> A meeting was held yesterday afternoon between Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the HSE and the EPA.  Following the meeting, Irish Water, in consultation with the HSE and having assessed the risk to public health, decided that a precautionary boil water notice was needed.  The Leixlip plant returned to water production from all of its production lines yesterday evening to ensure the continuity of the water supply.  Of course, it is vital that the supply be returned to safe production as soon as possible.  The EPA will play its role in verifying that the plant is operating safely, which will include an audit of the plant.  The appropriate time to audit will be when Irish Water and Fingal County Council are satisfied that the plant has returned to satisfactory performance.  The EPA's role will be to verify that performance before the boil water notice can be lifted.</p><p> I assure the committee that the agency will continue to provide regulatory oversight.  We are happy to answer whatever questions arise from our statement.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we are meeting in the midst of what is happening.  When we scheduled this meeting, it was intended to review the previous boil water notice in the areas in question and the broader issue of water quality.  I thank the EPA officials for attending during what is a busy time for them and the witnesses who will appear before us later.  However, it is important that we scrutinise the issue and get answers today.  With that in mind, our first questioner will be Senator Boyhan.  Due to time constraints, I will keep members' contributions to three minutes apiece.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#J00300"><p>I will be well able to do this in three minutes.</p> <p>  I thank the EPA, Fingal County Council and Irish Water for attending.  Their presence is important.  I will stick to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, which we had the advantage of having supplied to us earlier.  I will take him through three or four points.</p> <p>  This is a critical public health issue for people in areas served by this water supply.  More important, it is an issue of public confidence in the water supply chain and all those involved therein.  That is why we must deal with it.  I do not want to speculate or comment on press coverage; rather, I will deal with the facts that Dr. Ryan has just put on the record.  I draw his attention to page 2 of his statement, where he referred to auditing drinking waters and treatment processes and the EPA's capacity to issue legal directions and take legal prosecutions.  What directions has it made and what prosecutions has it taken in respect of the Leixlip plant?  He also referred to the EPA's remedial action list.  How is that progressing?  Will he make a copy available to the committee?  It is important that we fully understand it and see who has designated responsibility for the relevant actions.  He might also provide something charting the progress that has been made and the key people responsible for delivering the actions on the list.</p> <p>  Page 3 mentions replacing lead water mains and household pipes.  It is not a major issue for discussion today, but by raising it, Dr. Ryan has put it into this meeting's domain.  He might provide us at some future date with a progress report on the EPA's planned works for the changeover from lead water pipes.</p> <p>  Mention was made of cryptosporidium and related issues.  I would hate to think there was cryptosporidium in any water supply.  Dr. Ryan discussed the parasites that humans and animals can acquire from water.  Can Dr. Ryan tell us that there is no cryptosporidium in any water supply?  What affected water supplies does the EPA know of?</p><p>On the UV system, I am very familiar with it.  I know from work I have done in relation to it how successful it is.  In his opening statement, Dr. Ryan referenced a recommendation that an UV system be put in place.  Did that happen?  What was set in train?  The EPA made the recommendation in regard to the UV system and the likely success of it in killing off cryptosporidium and other parasites, etc.  Was there follow-up in regard to that recommendation?  There is no point in making recommendations if they are not followed up.  I ask Dr. Ryan to update the committee in that regard.</p><p> I thank the witnesses.  They have been very helpful.  If they cannot address any of the issues I have raised today, I ask that they would keep the committee apprised in regard to those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan.  I appreciate his assistance in keeping the proceedings on schedule.  I invite Dr. Ryan to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00300"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his questions.  On what legal action we have taken against Irish Water in regard to the Leixlip plant and the current incident, our primary focus is that the plant is back in operation and producing safe drinking water.  This is where all our focus and attention is at the moment.  This is evidenced by us auditing the plant, issuing our report, issuing the recommendations and working with the stakeholders to ensure that the boil water notice could be appropriately lifted.  There has not been a specific legal enforcement measure taken against the plant in regard to the incident.  We would have to give careful consideration to whether that is appropriate or if we have the powers to do that.  As I said, our primary focus is to ensure that the plant is back in operation and producing safe water for consumers.</p> <p>  On the remedial action list, we can make it available to the committee.  We track and keep it up-to-date.  It is very much part of our discussions with Irish Water.  It is focused around directing investment in putting in place appropriate infrastructure in priority areas to ensure that drinking water quality is improved.  It is important to mention that our reports in 2018 and previously show that the overall general quality of drinking water is very high, although, unfortunately, we have this very significant issue in front of us at the moment.  We will make the remedial action list and the current situation in that regard available to the committee following this meeting.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of lead.  We mentioned it as one of the priorities that we are tracking with Irish Water.  We will also provide follow-up on that to the committee in due course.  </p> <p>  With regard to the number of supplies that are currently at risk from cryptosporidium, we will make that list available as well.  Approximately 16 supplies on the remedial action list specifically reference a problem with cryptosporidium.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the installation of a UV system.  We have only just issued that recommendation to Irish Water.  We have given it one month to respond to that recommendation.  We understand that it would be a significant piece of infrastructure to install but we will await the response from Irish Water in that regard.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan has indicated that he would like to come back in, but I propose to call members in the order in which they indicated, following which those who wish to come back in for a second round may do so.  I have indicated the time constraints that we are all under such that we will all have to play to the same rules today.  I call Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00500"><p>I thank Dr. Ryan for his presentation.  To put this in context, we are asking questions today on behalf of not only the 615,000 people who are affected by a second boil water notice in two weeks, which are the most significant ever in this country to my collection, but many thousands of other people.  The witnesses are here to answer the public through our questions.</p> <p>  I have read the audit report of 24 October.  Like Senator Boyhan, I would like to touch on the recommendation regarding UV treatment.</p><p>According to the EPA audit report, "the level of treatment at this plant [Leixlip] is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water".  Dr. Ryan made that point again earlier.  Was the March 2019 audit the first time the EPA made this point, or does it go way back to the 2008 report?  While I acknowledge Dr. Ryan's clear statement that "the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards", these two significant outages have significantly rocked people's confidence in the water supply.  All witnesses must realise how angry, upset and concerned people are about this.  I will deal with more of that when representatives of the Department, Irish Water and Fingal County Council are in attendance.</p><p> Dr. Ryan has mentioned a recommendation that was made recently.  As far as I can see, it was made in March of this year.  Was that the first time UV treatment was recommended?  I am particularly concerned about the automatic shutdown now in place in Leixlip.  It is to be welcomed.  An automatic shutdown was recommended in March.  According to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, in May of this year, the EPA received a response from Irish Water to the effect that "the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented".  He is now saying that it was partially implemented only.  I ask him to comment on that.  I know it is in place now.  That is important.</p><p> As someone who is eminently qualified in this area and is certainly better qualified than me, will he explain what happens with the lag time when an issue is found?  I invite any of his colleagues who wish to come in on this matter to do so.  A couple of weeks ago, there was an outage following an incident that began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  It ran for 18 hours, in effect.  The plant was shut down at 10.15 p.m. on the Monday night.  Many people have told me that there is serious concern about contaminants getting into the system in the intervening period.  I know that those involved need to sit down for a meeting.  What happens in these circumstances?  Is Dr. Ryan happy that boil water notices are issued as quickly as possible?  That is the fundamental point.  I am asking about the current outage as well as last month's outage.</p></speech>

It is only in recent years that we have been tracking the deterioration with Irish Water through sampling and measurement.  The number of giardia detections was one in 2015, one in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018, but there have been ten such detections so far this year.  There has been a deterioration in the infrastructure treating the plant.  We are now convinced that this is the right way to go.  We mentioned it in March.  We strongly recommended it in our October audit.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the recommendation that the plant should be shut down automatically.  When we came back, we found it was implemented on one of the lines only.  The audit finding was very much that the shutdown should apply to the entire plant.  It is clear that this was misunderstood.  This was remediated when we got back out there in October.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the lag time.  The current situation is evolving.  We are satisfied that we have been notified promptly.  We were involved in discussions yesterday on the implementation of the boil water notice.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the issue that arose in October.  Clearly, there was an operational difficulty that allowed a window of time to happen when remedial action could have been taken.  Alarms were not responded to.  It was not a normal or foreseen event.  The alarm is usually raised when there are operational or mechanical difficulties.  We are usually notified when there is an issue.  It is clear that there was a period of time the plant was operating even though alarms were ringing.</p><p>That said, once we are notified, we get involved in conversations with the HSE and Irish Water.  Public health is first and foremost in everybody's mind in that regard and, as such, the boil water notice was issued and precautionary measures, which I am sure will be addressed in detail by Irish Water, were taken, such as flushing out the system before the boil water notice is lifted.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's queries.</p></speech>

I welcome the comments of the officials and I am conscious of the role of the EPA.  I am tempted to say one does not miss the water until the well runs dry.  I am a former schoolteacher and recall a child being asked to make a sentence using the word "uisce" and coming up with "Uisce in&aacute;r saol: cosanta" or, in English, "Water in our environment: protect it".  That is the premise we must start from.  I was secretary of a group water scheme for 21 years and know the difficulties associated with large and small plants.  Information is critical.</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan referred to 99% or 99.6% of water being of perfect drinking quality after treatment, which is good news.  I am more concerned about whether the quality of water in our rivers and lakes is continuing to deteriorate, as I believe it is, and their role in that regard.  It has been suggested that flooding caused the problem in the Leixlip plant.  There has always been flooding.  When the officials from Irish Water appear before the committee, I will deal with a similar situation involving Irish Water in County Louth, where people have been on a boil water notice for 105 days.  Two reports issued by the EPA specifically deal with the Tallanstown group scheme.  I am sorry to widen the discussion, but this issue does not just affect the 600,000 people impacted by the problem in Leixlip.  It is just as important for the 600 people affected elsewhere or the 92,000 who were on boil water notices last year.  As the EPA officials pointed out, that figure increased from 21,000 the previous year.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the quality of drinking water.  Does the EPA have confidence that when it carries out an examination and reports to Irish Water and local authorities, those bodies take action on issues arising?  My experience is that one can tell the bodies what needs to be done, but no action is being taken.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  How effective is the reporting of those bodies to the EPA regarding its recommendations?</p> <p>  One may think I am naive but that is not the case.  I refer to two drinking water audit reports in my local authority area.  It is alarming that it took 12 days for a boil water notice to be issued when the water was known to be contaminated.  This issue is as important to the people I represent as the members who are concerned about the issues in Leixlip.   I ask the officials to address that point.  It goes back to the point raised by Senator Boyhan regarding action in terms of legal responsibility and the remedial action list.  I would like the committee to be provided with that information.  More important, I ask that the EPA officials meet representatives of each local authority and Irish Water twice a year to keep people informed.  I was not informed by the EPA or Irish Water that the two reports to which I referred were available.  They were not mentioned to me in my myriad communications on the matter or to any other public representative for County Louth.  I am not blaming the officials for that, but I want to know how effective are their recommendations regarding what action is needed in the interests of protecting public water supplies.</p></speech>

Our water quality in Ireland reports are produced on a three-yearly basis and we also produce an annual water indicators report.</p><p>We saw some improvements to about 2012 but they have been declining since.  We expect the next three-year report will be out within the next quarter or two.  We will have the overview then.  We did and still do assist the Department in its river basin management planning, which looks at that work, and we provide the evidence on which it develops the plans for all the stakeholders to implement.  There has been a decline in overall water quality in rivers and lakes over the last decade.</p><p> I refer to the question of our confidence in Irish Water following up on the actions we require of it.  In our audit reports, we set out our recommendations.  We give Irish Water a month to respond to us and we find that, as one would expect if there are number of recommendations, some of them will need to be dealt with immediately and some of them will take a certain amount of time and investment to be delivered.  It provides us with a response to the audit recommendations and then we track that every quarter and we get a response from Irish Water on all open cases once every quarter.  We track each of the individual actions that have been set out in our audit reports, and as they progress, if we find there is an unacceptable delay, we have the ability to go back out and issue a legal direction to it undertake to either provide us with the action plan for delivering on the action or to carry out the specific action within a specified time.  We actively track that and we actively ensure the actions we seek are being undertaken.  It is part of my work programme to do that on a continuous basis.</p></speech>

I have eight questions but first I want to put on the record that it is precisely on an occasion like this that the value of the Environmental Protection Agency is proven and I want to commend the witnesses on the audit reports, which are short, concise, clear and easy to understand for those of us who are not specialists.  It gives us a fully independent view of the facts, and that is enormously valuable, both to us on the committee and to the members of the public.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses take us through what happens after the EPA issued the March-April 2019 report in some detail in terms of its engagement with Irish Water or with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  Is there a mechanism for escalating that engagement if there is a feeling, as the months progress, that the recommendations are not being acted on in an appropriate timeframe?  I am particularly keen to know if at any stage the Department is involved in that process if the EPA feels Irish Water is not responding properly.</p> <p>  If the eight recommendations outlined in the March-April report had been fully implemented before October, would it be the EPA's view that the October incident and subsequent boil water notice would have been avoided?  That is an important question the public has a right to know the answer to.  There has also been quite a lot of public debate about whether this is an operational issue, a management issue or an investment issue.  I know it does not have to be one of those issues in particular or the other, but I would like to know, particularly with respect to the October event, now that the EPA has done that audit, whether it was primarily an operational issue or as Dr. Ryan seems to indicate in the opening remarks, might there be some investment upgrade issues there as well?</p> <p>  On the basis of the information we have about yesterday, there seems to be a different cause to what took place.  Maybe the witnesses could compare, in as simple and non-technical language as possible, the October event and the November event, albeit the EPA has not done an audit yet for what took place yesterday.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  One of the things I am confused about is that this plant has received considerable funding for significant upgrades.  It was upgraded in the 1990s and there was an additional upgrade in 2014 of about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million so there has been a little bit of a public debate about this being an old plant.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of this?  Is it that there is an older part and a newer part of the plant?  Where are the problems?  Again, I ask them to do so in as clear a manner as possible.</p> <p>  I am concerned by a bit in Dr. Ryan's opening statement.  It seems to be a little bit different from the version I have.  On page 6, it says: "the Leixlip Water Treatment plant is now operating satisfactorily."</p><p>However, the opening statement then goes on to say there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Dr. Ryan went on to say that there are upgrade works under way but when they are completed, if I understood him right, those works will not be sufficient to address the problem.  Can we have more information on that and what would be required in terms of works and their possible cost to ensure the public would have confidence that these kind of issues are not going to be repeated?</p></speech>

I am going to ask Dr. Minihan to address as many as she can.  We will then come back and pick up on any of the other overarching questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle Minihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#O00300"><p>If I might begin by addressing the Deputy's question about the follow-up on the March audit, the EPA did follow up on the audit.  We received a response from Irish Water on 3 May which set out the actions it had taken to address each of the recommendations in our March audit report.  As part of that, we are continuously tracking Irish Water's implementation of our audit recommendations via an open investigation file, which an inspector continuously monitors.  In that response, Irish Water committed to completing certain works by specified dates.  We tracked the progress of those works and we have been concerned with slippage identified by Irish Water.  For example, in the response of 3 May to the March audit, the filters were due to be upgraded by quarter 4 of 2019, the end of this year.  That has now slipped to quarter 2 of 2020.  We have continued to monitor and engage with Irish Water to address that slippage and engage continuously to see what the problems are around it.</p> <p>  If I could come back to the Deputy's question about how there seems to be a difference between the October event and that of yesterday, he is correct.  October's event was a blockage in a chemical dosing line which meant the water was not being treated correctly for a period.  There was also a period in which alarms were activated and not responded to.  I think the Deputy's question related to whether, if our audit recommendations from March had been put in place, the October event could have been avoided.  Our October audit report clearly called out that if the automatic shut-down had been put in place across the entire plant as was recommended in the March audit report, we believe the incident itself would have been avoided in October.  That action, the automatic shut-down of the plant, is the fail-safe which ensures that whatever happens, if an alarm is not responded to the plant is shut down and cannot produce water that is possibly unsafe or contaminated.</p></speech>

It has been expanded to provide water to other locations in recent years as it has been augmented.  I do not remember there ever being a boil water notice at that plant.  This is the first time and it has happened twice in a few weeks.  What is different about Leixlip in terms of the Liffey is that while Poulaphouca is supplied closer to the source, Leixlip takes its intake further downstream.  Upstream to that there are sewage treatments plants and pumping stations.  We have become accustomed to keeping an eye on the river and if there is a grey look about it we would be concerned.  Was there an issue in respect of the intake?  One reason that was given was the very heavy fall of rain, which is not unique as I think we will all accept.  What is the nature of this discolouring?  Is it internal or external?</p><p>Is it correct that there are three production lines, one of which is old and two of which are new?  Was the plant designed to allow them to be separated, or can that be done?  Why is the output of the entire plant, both the new and the old sections, contaminated?</p><p> Finally, I refer to the spillage upstream at Osberstown wastewater treatment plant in March.  It might have been caused by one of the pumping stations.  Are there holding tanks at the pumping stations in case of failures, as opposed to at the treatment plant?  The volume of that spillage, 12,300 cu. m, translates to something in the region of 600 lorry-loads.  It was huge.  What is the additional dosage when that happens, and what is the communication between the two plants like? </p></speech>

I will divide them if the Chairman does not mind.  It has been reported to us that the heavy rainfall has caused a turbidity issue with the water from which the plant has been abstracting during this incident.  We have not carried out our audit yet, but we will be going to the site in the next couple of days to fully assess the issues.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council will be able to provide chapter and verse on the plant itself.  Perhaps Dr. Minihan can provide a precis.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that the Paterson Candy plant was completed in 1974 and upgraded in the 1990s.  The Mahon and McPhillips plant was completed in 1988.  They make up what is referred to as the "old plant" at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The new plant, which is referred to by Irish Water as the "AECOM plant", was completed in 2014.  That is the distinction between the old plant and new plant.  The Deputy asked if it was possible to separate output from the old and new plants.  Separate streams come out, but the treated water is combined into one flow of treated water as it leaves the plant.  One of the questions discussed at the time of the first boil water notices was whether we could definitively tell where water from the PCI plant was going.  Because that water is all blended, with water from the old plant and the new plant leaving Leixlip and feeding the network as a single flow of water, it is not possible to do that.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that a sewer is a pipe of a certain diameter and it can fill up.  If there is no separation between rainwater and the sewage flowing through the pipe, capacity can be exceeded and there can be a combined sewer overflow.  In many cases, this overflow reaches rivers and waterways.  It tends to be more diluted than raw sewage because of water flowing through the pipe.  Part of our March audit examined these issues.  Our audit report included a specific recommendation for Irish Water to draw up a documented protocol for communication between Osberstown and Leixlip wastewater treatment plants so that operators would be alerted if there was an issue.  That is what happened.  My understanding is that the protocol is now in place if overflows occur.  It is absolutely true that if water is taken from a lowland location at the back end of a catchment close to the sea, it is more likely to contain material from agriculture, industry and towns and villages.</p></speech>

Now it is my turn.  I will begin with the deficit we now have.  Witnesses have described it as effectively constituting an ongoing deficit.  Even with the completion of the upgrade works, there will still be a deficit.  In Dr. Minihan's view, are the current outages a hangover from the previous round of outages?</p></speech>

A plan is in place to replace each of the 12 filters but they can only be replaced two at a time if we are to allow the plant to continue to produce water.  The timeline for their refurbishment has slipped to quarter 2 of 2020 and there will be a treatment deficit until their refurbishment, in terms of the quality of raw water extracted from the River Liffey as compared to the requirements.  Our audit report included the recommendation to install ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant as this would provide assurance for a water supply that serves over 600,000 people.</p></speech>

He said no legal enforcement may be required.  He went into the history of it a bit and said he had doubts about the powers in respect of taking such action.  I am a bit concerned by this.  Dr. Ryan is telling us that he has doubts about the EPA's powers to take a prosecution.  In the case of the Leixlip plant, he said no legal prosecution has ever taken place on this particular issue.  That is a major concern to me and to the public.  Can he clarify whether I misunderstand or am misquoting from what Dr. Ryan said?  If he has such doubts, can he share them with the committee today?</p></speech>

That is our primary focus.  Whatever powers and authority we have, we deploy to that end and we will continue to do that in the current situation.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement powers under the drinking water regulations are limited but we engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the legislation governing drinking water.  The EPA would welcome the strengthening of its enforcement powers in this regard.</p></speech>

I want to focus on what will happen now because I am conscious we are asking these questions while people do not have access to safe drinking water.  What, if anything, would the EPA do differently in the process?  Dr. Ryan mentioned his disappointment at the initial audit and recommendations not being implemented.  The EPA will do another audit in a few days when this issue has been addressed.  What will the EPA do differently to ensure any further recommendations it makes, even if they are the same as those that were made in March and October, will be implemented?  Is it the EPA's job to do that?</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Minihan in particular about filter replacement and ultraviolet, UV, treatment of the water plant.   As an expert in this field, what timeline does she envisage there should be for the installation of UV treatment of a plant such as this one?  My main concern is that if this issue is rectified in the next few days, given that this is early in the winter and with winter storms approaching and more heavy rainfall, we could be back here discussing this issue in two or three weeks.  Confidence in the quality of our water supply has taken a hammering in recent days.  We want to ensure people realise their drinking water supply is safe and can be used.  From the EPA's quasi-independent perspective of the process - it is not Fingal County Council, Irish Water or the Department - what should that timeline be?</p> <p>  What is the nature of the report the Minister apparently has asked the EPA to do separately?  I note from the Department's opening statement that the Minister has instructed the EPA to give him a special report on what has happened.  What will be in that report and will it be made public?</p></speech>

To be clear on the next steps, this is an ongoing issue and there is a boil water notice in place.  When we carry out another audit, it will be directly focused on getting the evidence to facilitate the lifting of that boil water notice.  That is the next immediate action from us.  We will do that, as I said in my statement, at a particular point.  The plant has to come back up to operating at what Irish Water would characterise as a satisfactory performance.  Our job will be to verify that performance.</p></speech>

What is that?</p></speech>

We will look at the results of sampling and we will take a considered view.  The open issues from the audits in March and October will be keenly tracked by my team to ensure their implementation.  That is an ongoing process.</p> <p>  Regarding the installation of ultraviolet treatment of the plant, I am not sure how much we can say about timelines at this stage.  </p></speech>

The reason for that is that the size of the UV facility that will be required at Leixlip is significant.  As it is a significant piece of infrastructure and investment, it will need time to be physically be put on site, installed and verified to enure it is operating.  That is because the volume of water treatment at Leixlip is so significant.</p></speech>

We have an evolving situation and it will probably expand a little.</p><p>The Minister has requested that we bring to his attention the issues generally concerning water quality in Ireland and the rate of pace of infrastructural development.  We will also take the opportunity to bring to his attention any deficiencies we see in terms of enforcement powers, as we have been doing with the Department for some time.</p></speech>

To go back to what happened between March and October, in the regular engagement with Irish Water is there any engagement with or notification of the Department in particular, for example, if a concern arises over slippage of the original deadlines that are given in the Irish Water report?  Is the Department informed throughout the process or does it learn with the rest of us when a boil water notice is issued?</p> <p>  In terms of slippage, I think I am correct in saying five of the eight recommendations were not implemented between March and October.  How many of those were subject to slippage and could the witnesses elaborate a little more on that?</p> <p>  I am also keen to understand if the problems we are talking about are confined to the older part of the plant, notwithstanding the fact that the supply is all ultimately mixed, or if there are problems with the plant that was upgraded in the 1990s and the new plant in 2014?  I would welcome if the witnesses could separate out that.</p> <p>  I would welcome a little more information from Dr. Ryan on the previous question I asked on whether, even if all the works that are currently within the capital programme are completed, there still are additional difficulties he would like to see addressed.  Is that the ultraviolet filter or are other works required?</p> <p>  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but while the EPA did not recommend the ultraviolet filter in the March report, it recommended it in the October report.  Is there a reason for that?  Is it something the EPA had raised previously with Irish Water and Fingal County Council?  I would welcome a bit more information on that too.</p></speech>

At the end of each quarter, we publish our remedial action list that sets out the priority supplies we have identified for action and investment by Irish Water.  That sets out the completion dates by which the works on those supplies will be completed.  We then engage with the Department regularly post the publication of our remedial action list.  It is available on our website each quarter and we provide regular updates as part of that to identify where there is slippage.  There is ongoing and regular engagement with the Department.</p></speech>

His question was manifold.  Some of the recommendations relate specifically to the old plant but a number relate to the plant as a whole.  The key recommendation that Irish Water should ensure that there is automatic switchover between the duty and standby polyelectrolyte dosing pumps had not happened.  Another was that operators respond to the alarms.  As we noted earlier, the automatic shut-off in the event of operators failing to respond to alarms was implemented only in the new plant, which was where the March issue arose, and not extended to all the plant.  Our recommendation clearly called out the need for it to be across the plant.  However, as Dr. Ryan indicated, we do not believe that was deliberate but rather was a misinterpretation.</p> <p>  The other actions relate to the plant as a whole and have seen slippage.  Our audit report of October asked Irish Water to reconsider the dates by which those works would be undertaken and, as we have already indicated, a response is awaited on that.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan outlined that the EPA has legal power but it needs to be strengthened.  Has the EPA reviewed all of the audits across the country, or will it do so?</p><p>It is clear that in the case of Leixlip, but also that of County Louth, the actions recommended, not just in one report but two, have not been implemented.  Will the witnesses undertake to review those reports with a view to putting them on the remedial action list, if necessary?</p><p> Dr. Minihan said the remedial action list is published on the website.  We have a communication problem here.  The witnesses may say we should be able to look at the website but all public representatives, at national, regional and county levels, need to be supplied with the reports and met twice per year.  Will they commit to this?  Publishing on the website is not sufficient.  Irish Water does not inform anybody about what is in the reports.  It is said that it is up to us to have the competence to read them but if the witnesses asked everybody in this room about them, they would note that nobody was aware of the remedial action list until this morning, although it is available on the website.</p></speech>

It clearly has not done so.  Even the National Transport Authority fines bus companies if they do not meet the demands and requirements of their contracts.

It has to gather a certain amount of information to be able to have an informed discussion with us and the HSE, and in order that we can fully understand the risk and consider what actions need to be taken to mitigate the risk and to address what has happened at the plant.</p></speech>

A certain amount of cryptosporidium will be in the water, having come from the plant, because it is not possible to get rid of it all.  Is the EPA satisfied with the range of levels of contamination that has been set?</p> <p>  Does the EPA do any testing of the water that comes into the plant before it is treated?  I ask because one of the largest treatment plants in the country is upstream of the Osberstown treatment plant, which might have an impact.</p> <p>  Am I correct that the plant in Leixlip is self-regulatory?  I mean that Irish Water controls the plant and the EPA does not post people there on a permanent basis.  Is the EPA happy with that or does it believe it should have someone on-site at all times?</p></speech>

At our licensed facilities, we do not have people on-site all the time.  We do not generally consider it to be appropriate.

We are not happy with the levels but we recognise that it occurs where raw water is abstracted from a source such as the River Liffey that has the potential to be contaminated with cryptosporidium, giardia or other parasites.  That is why our other report recommended the need for ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant.  Ultraviolet disinfection will deactivate the cryptosporidium or render them harmless, meaning they will not be able to cause people to become ill.  The recommendation was made in our audit report of 30 October.</p></speech>

Such low-level detections, amounting to one cyst in approximately 1,300 l of water, have been the subject of ongoing consultation between Irish Water and the HSE in respect of the risk to public health.  Enhanced sampling of treated water has been put in place at Leixlip water treatment plant as a result of the detections.</p></speech>

I raised this in the D&aacute;il just before the original boil notice was lifted.  The Minister seemed to be aware that certain things that were meant to have been done last September were not done.  He said he was waiting for the report and that we would then know if certain things were done.  Was that spoken about in the past few months?

The plant returned to production yesterday evening, as I understand, under the proviso that the boil water notice would be put in place to protect public health.  There is regular sampling at Leixlip and that sampling equipment or rig is required to run for 24 hours.  That went on yesterday and that sample will be available today.  We will get through approximately 13,000 l of water.  That sample will need to go to the laboratory and results will be awaited.</p> <p>  Following the return to production of the plant, given the raw water turbidity and the fact that there was a lot of rainfall yesterday and on Saturday, there will be a period of time for the filters to return to normal operating conditions.  In our engagement with Irish Water and the HSE, we have stated that we intend to audit that plant.  We would see that the time to audit that plant is when it has returned to normal operating conditions.  We will await confirmation from Irish Water and Fingal County Council as to when that will happen.  Irish Water are better positioned to answer the question about when the sample results will be available.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Michael O&rsquo;Leary, head of asset operations, and Katherine Walshe, head of environmental regulation.  I thank the Chairman, Deputy Rock, and the committee members for the opportunity to address them.</p> <p>  I apologise to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by both the previous and the current boil water notices.  I welcome the opportunity to explain to the committee how the events happened, what actions we have taken and how we, along with our colleagues in Fingal County Council, intend to mitigate the risk of such events happening in future.  As the committee heard from the EPA, there are two plants in Leixlip, an old plant and a new plant.  As discussed, we have had problems with the old plant and are currently upgrading it.  It is where the problem occurred at the weekend.  The prolonged heavy rain on Saturday night presented issues with turbidity, or cloudiness, and the old plant could not treat the water to the required standard.  In fairness to the plant operators, on this occasion they reacted quickly.  They saw the alarms, kicked in and shut down the plant, preventing untreated water from entering the system.  They spent most of Sunday and Monday morning trying to return the old plant to service, using a wastewater discharge, which allows the plant to be run but to waste rather than into the system.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, this was not successful and our reservoirs throughout the city were running low.  We had to make the decision that rather than have water restrictions, where people would not have had water for flushing toilets, showering or washing, we would reintroduce the water with whose treatment we were not happy, while at the same time issuing a boil water notice.  It was a conscious decision taken over the weekend, and it is important to emphasise the difference between the incident in question and the previous incident.  The Fingal County Council operators acted correctly and Irish Water took a decision to introduce the water I have described because the only other option was to introduce water restrictions.</p> <p>  To end the current boil water notice, as was discussed with the EPA, satisfactory water quality tests will be needed.  The first sample was taken today and we will continue in that regard during the week.  On EPA confirmation that the plant is operating satisfactorily, unfortunately the plant is still not delivering the levels of treated water we would like.  It is still delivering cloudiness outside the limits set by the EPA and us, which is unfortunate but we are working as hard as possible to correct the problem.  It is not a plant failure or the result of a particular incident rather it concerns the filter beds we are currently trying to refurbish.  As soon as we are happy that the water entering the system is of good quality, we can start the clock and flush the slug of water through the system.  That is the current position.</p><p>Irish Water has a comprehensive compliance monitoring programme in place for every public water supply in the country to ensure that drinking water quality is adequately monitored and complies with legislation.</p><p> Since Irish Water was established in 2014, we have significantly improved water quality monitoring on public drinking water supplies.  More rigorous sampling regimes have been put in place, for example the number of tests for cryptosporidium and giardia doubled from approximately 800 in 2014 to more than 1,500 in 2018.  </p><p> The EPA and HSE, who have responsibility for regulating drinking water quality and protecting public health respectively, now have a single point of contact for all water quality issues nationally.  Water quality risks and failures are identified sooner, corrective action can be taken quickly, and the risk to public health from poor water quality has been reduced significantly.  Of course, we have more work to do in this area. </p><p> The quality of public drinking water in Ireland remains high with microbiological compliance at 99.87% and chemical compliance at 99.63%, as outlined in the 2018 EPA drinking water quality report. </p><p> All drinking water must be treated before being consumed to remove biological and chemical contaminants that can be harmful to human health.  Bacteria from animal or human waste and parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia are commonly found in open water bodies such as the River Liffey.  These organisms can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans. </p><p> Following consultation with the HSE, a boil water notice is imposed where water treatment may be inadequate to eliminate the risk of illness from microbiological contamination.  There are currently 17 boil water notices in place nationally impacting on approximately 14,000 people.  The largest is on Lough Talt in Sligo, affecting 12,500 people, where there is a risk of cryptosporidium contamination.  The majority of the other boil water notices relate to areas where treated water requires additional disinfection contact time, a problem identified through Irish Water&rsquo;s national disinfection programme.  Due to work under way by Irish Water, four of the 17 notices are on track to be lifted this year, with most of the others, including Lough Talt, on track to be lifted in 2020. </p><p> The greater Dublin area, GDA, drinking water supply serves all of Dublin and parts of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Drinking water in the GDA is supplied from a number of sources, predominantly the River Liffey, which accounts for 85% of the supply to Dublin, and the River Vartry.  Water is produced in Dublin on a 24-hour basis and the total water production capacity is 612 megalitres per day, which can reduce to 580 megalitres due to weather, drought or algal blooms, for example.  Demand for water in the GDA varies but the average daily demand is 570 megalitres per day, increasing to 600 megalitres per day at times of high demand.  Headroom or spare capacity in available water in Dublin is, therefore, between 10 and 40 megalitres per day.  That is important in the context of the old plant, which is having problems and which produces in the region of 20% of Dublin's water supply.</p><p> Leixlip water treatment plant, WTP, is the second largest water treatment plant in Ireland; the largest is at Ballymore Eustace.  Leixlip WTP supplies treated drinking water to more than 600,000 people in Dublin, Kildare and Meath, approximately one third of the greater Dublin area, including healthcare facilities, industry and many large commercial customers.  Leixlip WTP is operated by Fingal County Council under a service level agreement with Irish Water. </p><p> Leixlip WTP currently produces 195 megalitres per day of treated drinking water, with a maximum production of 210 megalitres per day.  Due to the phased expansion of Leixlip WTP since it first opened in 1967, current operations on the site are carried out across a number of plants known as the old plant, built by PCI in the 1970s and upgraded by McMahon Philips in the 1990s, and the new plant, built by AECOM in 2014.  These are separate plants and there is not a continuous upgrade process on the old plant.  The old plant produces two thirds of the water at Leixlip.</p><p> In 2019, there have been ten low level detections of giardia and one detection of cryptosporidium in treated water at Leixlip.  These test results were reported to the EPA and the HSE and not deemed to be an immediate risk to public health.  Given the detections, in consultation with HSE, Irish Water doubled its monitoring programme for cryptosporidium and giardia at the plant in 2019.  </p><p> We have also taken special interest in the operation of the filter beds in the old plant because if the filter beds are not meeting the levels required and there are instances of giardia, there are increased concerns.  We are currently upgrading the filter beds in the old plant and ideally we would take the plant out of service for a six-month or 12-month period to complete all the works and bring it back into service thereafter.</p><p>Ideally we would take this plant out of service for a period of six to 12 months, complete all the works and then bring it back into service.  However, because it supplies 20% of Dublin's water and because we cannot switch it off as we do not have any backup supplies, we have to do this work on an ongoing basis.  The plant needs to remain operational at all times.  This is akin to trying to change the tyres on a car while it is moving down the road.  It is a very difficult process and has led to some delays, which the EPA highlighted.</p><p> In March 2019, there was a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the new plant.  An on-site alarm was triggered but was not responded to.  The incident was reported at the time to the EPA and the HSE, which did not consider the failure to be a risk to public health.  Water produced remained safe.  The EPA conducted an audit of the new plant on 22 March.  Following recommendations made by the EPA in its March audit, the automatic shutdown requested by it was completed in the new plant.  A contract was issued to install automatic shutdown at the old plant but this work had not been completed when the incident occurred on 22 October.</p><p> On Monday 21 October, a mechanical failure occurred on a piece of equipment at the old plant at Leixlip.  I will describe the events in more detail.  At 3.15 p.m. a blockage occurred in a chemical delivery line leading to a failure of a pressure-release valve.  No pump alarm activated as the failure point was downstream of the pumps.  At 5 p.m., turbidity levels in filtered water started to increase as a result of the delivery line failure.  Turbidity is cloudiness in water due to suspended particles.  At 6.16 p.m., increasing turbidity in filtered water triggered an on-site alarm and sent an SMS text alert to the operators.  The alarm was not responded to and turbidity continued to rise.  At 7.07 p.m. an on-site high-turbidity alarm was activated on the clarified water.  The alarm was not responded to and turbidity continued to rise.  At 9.15 p.m., an off-site plant manager who had logged on remotely to the Leixlip plant noticed the activation of turbidity alarms and the lack of response on site.  The alarm was investigated and a contractor was called to clear the pipe blockage and carry out temporary repairs.  From 10.15 p.m. to 11.30 p.m., the repair was completed. A decision was taken to shut down the old plant temporarily to allow the treatment process to stabilise.  Between 11.30 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, the old plant was gradually brought back into operation.  The automatic plant shutdown did not happen when the alarms were not responded to because we had not yet put this facility in place.</p><p> The new plant at Leixlip continued to produce drinking water that met all drinking water quality standards while the incident was ongoing at the old plant.  However as the drinking water produced at both plants is mixed when it enters the network, all areas supplied by the Leixlip plant were subject to the boil water notice.  Irish Water was first notified of the incident at the old plant by Fingal County Council at 9.45 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  We immediately contacted the HSE and EPA.  We were in discussions with them throughout the day sharing data, reviewing the plant performance data and determining the level of risk to public health arising from the incident.  Following the consultation, a decision was taken at 4.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 October to impose a boil water notice on customers supplied by Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The Irish Water crisis management team, which was on standby, formally convened at 5 p.m. and the notification of customers began immediately.  Irish Water's foremost priority throughout the period of the boil water notice was to protect public health and to advise all customers as quickly as possible.  The first task of the team was to issue widespread communications with immediate effect.  Given the number and geographic spread of customers affected, multiple communication channels were used, with emphasis on mass communication and prioritising proactive contact with vulnerable customers and large water users.  </p><p> A press release with detailed advice and information and a map of the affected area was issued to national media in time for the 6 p.m. news on Tuesday, 22 October.  This information was posted on our website and on social media channels and briefed to our customer contact centre.  We directly contacted our registered vulnerable customers and an email went to elected representatives in the affected areas.  We contacted large commercial and industrial customers and worked with stakeholders to identify critical users such as hospitals, schools, nursing homes and cr&egrave;ches.  Engagement with customers, stakeholders and media continued through Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  A more detailed interactive map of the areas affected was posted on the website and shared widely.  Further details of customer communications are provided in the appendix to my written statement.  I thank the media, elected representatives, local authorities, business and industry groups, Departments and all who extensively and proactively shared our advice to customers while the boil water notice was in place.</p><p> Irish Water's website experienced difficulty on Tuesday, 22 October due to very high volumes of traffic to the site.  Our IT teams worked throughout Tuesday evening to rectify the situation and, by Wednesday morning, the website was fully operational.</p><p>Our IT teams worked throughout Tuesday evening to rectify the situation and by Wednesday morning the website was fully operational.  This was clearly not satisfactory and we are working to ensure that the site can cope with high volumes in future.  During this more recent boil water notice, it has been able to handle the increased volumes.</p><p> On the lifting of the boil water notice, on Wednesday, 23 October Irish Water sought to identify clear criteria for lifting the boil water notice as quickly as possible while still ensuring no risk to public health.  Lifting criteria agreed with the HSE and the EPA were as follows: satisfactory sample results for giardia and cryptosporidium; a satisfactory EPA audit of the old plant; and confirmation that all remaining at-risk water had passed through or was removed from the network.  The result of the first sample covering the period of the incident was available on the morning of 24 October and water quality was satisfactory.  Results of the second and third drinking water quality samples taken on 22 and 23 October were returned on Friday, 25 October and these samples were also satisfactory.  The EPA inspectors carried out an audit of the Leixlip plant on Thursday, 24 October, accompanied by the HSE, Irish Water and Fingal County Council.  Initial feedback from the EPA inspectors at the site indicated they were satisfied from a technical perspective that the boil water notice could be lifted.  The final audit report from the EPA was issued on 30 October.  On the network flushing side, Irish Water carried out extensive network modelling to work out how much of the water produced at Leixlip on 21 and 22 October was still in the network.  Proactive flushing was carried out by Fingal County Council on Friday, 25 October to remove any remaining at-risk water from the extremities of the network.  Irish Water continued discussions with the HSE and the EPA during Friday, 25 October to ensure all criteria agreed were met to allow the boil water notice to be lifted.  The HSE confirmed at 4.30 p.m. that it was satisfied that the boil water notice could be lifted and this was communicated immediately and as widely as possible to all customers and stakeholders through all available communication channels.</p><p> The following immediate actions have been taken.  Throughout the incident, Irish Water and senior Fingal County Council staff have been in contact with each other.  The discussions are ongoing and we are trying to prevent the last and current incidents from happening again.  The Leixlip water treatment plant is already staffed on a 24-hour basis and Irish Water has requested that Fingal County Council increase staffing at the plant to ensure an appropriate level of vigilance and eliminate the risk of an alarm not being responded to in future.  Irish Water will work with Fingal County Council to agree more on-site presence by Irish Water staff at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  Irish Water is looking at all potential enhancements to operations that will further safeguard water quality at Leixlip water treatment plant and all other large plants nationally.  Automatic shut-off at the old plant is now operational.  It is worth highlighting that automatic shut-off should be the option of last resort in a plant with 24-hour staffing as alarms should be responded to and a shut-off takes the plant completely out of production.  Shutting down and restarting a water treatment plant brings its own risks and given Dublin&rsquo;s lack of headroom, this could also present supply challenges which we are experiencing at the moment.  Irish Water is in the process of bringing all critical alarms nationally into our national operations centre.  For this to be beneficial, however, Irish Water needs to be able to contact plant operators directly when an alarm is triggered.  This is not part of the current working arrangements.  Irish Water is carrying out a review of the filter upgrade programme under way at the old plant to expedite its completion, bearing in mind the current water supply headroom challenges.</p><p> The recent incident at Leixlip caused significant disruption to customers and is not acceptable to Irish Water.  That goes for the current incident as well.  Our priority is to provide a safe, secure drinking water supply and we accept responsibility for this incident.  We will continue to notify the EPA and HSE of any reportable incidents as soon as we are aware of them.  We are working with Fingal County Council to take all necessary steps to reduce the risk of an incident like this happening again.</p><p> Irish Water is preparing a detailed written response to the issues raised by the EPA following its recent audit.  At the time of the incident auto shut-off had been installed at the new plant and was in the process of being installed at the old plant.  It should be reiterated that auto shut-off is an option of last resort.  A plant of this size cannot be reliant on the sole response of individuals.  The incident highlights the fact that we must use all available technology to prevent a failure like this happening in future.  Under the current working arrangements this is not possible.  Filter beds in the old plant are being upgraded.</p><p>This work started in 2018 and will be completed by the second quarter of next year.  Any acceleration of this work must be balanced with the need to maintain sufficient water supply to the greater Dublin area.  </p><p> Irish Water is fully committed to the Workplace Relations Commission process, initiated by the Minister and now under way, to replace the current service level agreements, SLAs, with local authorities with arrangements which will provide Irish Water with the necessary full control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk and provide a single identity for customer-facing services.  Completing that process is likely to take some time and we believe that several operational issues must be addressed in the interim, under the current SLA, to reduce current risks to the provision of safe and reliable water services to our customers.  I thank the committee members for their time.  I will take any questions they wish to raise with me or my colleagues. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#CC00200"><p>I would like to thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to today's meeting.  I am joined by Mr. David Flynn, the water advisory unit's principal adviser.  We are meeting in the light of a series of very significant and serious incidents in our water supply system.  These boil water notices are a major disruption for people and businesses across a large part of our capital city and surrounding areas in Kildare and Meath.</p> <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has expressed his deep concern regarding these incidents, particularly in light of the audit of the Leixlip facility carried out by the EPA following the first boil water notice.  The lessons of the audit in March 2019 do not appear to have been learned.  The cause of this weekend's incident is now under investigation by Irish Water's process engineers and Fingal County Council.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council must fully co-operate and collaborate to deal comprehensively with the issues at Leixlip.</p> <p>  It is a matter for the EPA and the HSE as regulators and for Irish Water as the water utility, working with the local authority, to ensure that national standards are complied with.  The priority in such an event is always to ensure that people's health is protected.  Irish Water, the HSE and the EPA are all working together in their respective roles to ensure that notices are lifted as soon as water supplies are verified as safe to drink.</p> <p>  However, given the scale of the first boil water notice, the Minister has requested the EPA to provide a report on that incident directly to him once it has finished its own investigations.  This report will outline the conclusions of the agency's investigation and any findings that may require a broader policy response.  The Minister will consider this report once he has received it.</p> <p> The Minister has also spoken directly with the managing director of Irish Water, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and the director general of the EPA to better understand how this situation is arising and to ensure that water quality issues are properly dealt with.  The Minister will also meet the managing director of Irish Water and the CEO of Fingal County Council once he has received the EPA report to review any lessons learned from the incident.</p> <p>  Overall, the EPA reports that the quality of drinking water in Ireland&rsquo;s public water supply remains high, as we have heard today.  Our supply is safe but it is not yet sufficiently secure.  There are risks to the quality and quantity of water supplied.  These risks are associated with the nature and age of our infrastructure, as well as with the approach taken to the operation of our water supplies.  Both our water and our wastewater systems require substantial and sustained investment in order to bring the systems up to the quality and resilience standards required of a modern service, to provide for population growth and to build resilience in the face of climate change.  To support these aims, the Government has approved the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024.  This comprises &euro;6.1 billion of investment in infrastructure and assets and &euro;4.9 billion in operating costs.</p> <p>  Also critical to this improvement programme is the reform of water service delivery.  Operating through service level agreements with 31 local authorities, Irish Water has responsibility for public water services but lacks direct or operational control for services on the ground.  Without predetermining the outcome of investigations into the exact operational issues at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant, it is clear that there is a critical gap in control between Irish Water's legal responsibility for providing water services and local authorities' operational responsibility on the ground.  This is not satisfactory and is no longer fit for purpose.</p> <p>  The Minister is therefore seeking an agreement that would replace the current service level agreements for the provision of water services with arrangements which provide Irish Water with the necessary control of operations, accountability and capacity to manage risk; ensure that Irish Water is not left without an appropriate skilled workforce to carry out its statutory functions and that local authorities are not left with stranded costs; and address workers' concerns about the future deployment of the current local authority water staff.</p> <p>  There has been engagement on these issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, most recently last Thursday.</p><p>However, in the light of this most recent incident it is important that all parties now engage with these issues with renewed determination.  This is a challenging and complex process.  However, the objective is to deliver a single national publicly owned utility that operates to the highest standards nationwide and that the full benefits of the one utility model are realised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms AnnMarie Farrelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#DD00200"><p>I thank the committee for allowing me to address it.  I am joined today by John Daly, director of services.  Leixlip water treatment plant was initially constructed in 1967 and has been upgraded and expanded six times, most recently in 2014 when the capacity of the plant was extended from 168 million l to 207 million l per day.  The treatment plant is a conventional plant for the treatment of river water, which involves coagulation, settlement, filtration, chlorination and fluoridation.  It is made up of two sections which we refer to as the old and the new and the incident on 21 October occurred in the older installation.</p> <p>  Fingal County Council currently operates Leixlip water treatment under a service level agreement with Irish Water.  Prior to the recent incidents, there has been no general boil water notice due to a failure of the Leixlip water treatment plant.  Fingal County Council staff supported Irish Water and the EPA during the period of the first boil water notice, which assisted in the notice being lifted as early as possible.  We are working with Irish Water to do likewise in respect of the current incident.  The EPA audit report of 28 October describes the causes of the incident which occurred on 21 October.</p> <p>  From our analysis, the accumulation of debris commenced at approximately 3 p.m.  Early indications of deterioration in water quality were identifiable between 5 p.m. and 5.30 p.m.  By 6.15 p.m., the water quality was outside the normal operating limits for acceptable water quality and reached a critical level by 7.50 p.m.  When the incident was identified at 9 p.m., prompt action was taken and the repair was effected by 11.30 p.m.  Shut down of the system occurred at approximately 10.15 p.m.  The EPA requirement for an automatic shutdown of the plant or individual elements of the plant or both was in place in the new section of the facility before the incident and was planned for the old section.  Automatic shutdown has now been implemented throughout both treatment plants.  This is a significant intervention, which will assist greatly in preventing any such future incidents.  I am referring to the incident on 21 October. </p> <p>  In addition to the automation, Fingal County Council is in the process of further strengthening, monitoring and control at the plant since the incident, pending implementation of Irish Water's national control centre as follows: the supervised control and data acquisition, SCADA, computerised control system is being upgraded this week to require regular activation of operational controls by the duty operator to demonstrate response to all alarms; the critical alarms system will be upgraded to provide for automatic alerts in order that the on-call duty manager is notified quickly; the introduction of additional systematic monitoring and review of the SCADA system over the 24-hour period is being implemented and enhanced arrangements for plant supervision by the on-call duty manager are being implemented to support operations over the 24-hour period.  In addition, critical incidents will be notified to Irish Water immediately and in this regard, the out-of-hours protocol with Irish Water has been reviewed, which will enhance the communications of incidents.  The additional requirement to investigate the lining of the alum tank, which was the initial cause of the incident on 21 October, will be carried out by Fingal County Council as soon as possible and within a six-week period.  This will require the tanks to be drawn down in sequence and examined.  Following assessment, any capital investment will be identified to Irish Water for action.  The matter of the failure to respond to alarms is the subject of an ongoing internal investigation.</p> <p>  It should be noted, however, that Fingal County Council views the optimal solution as being the implementation of the Irish Water's national control centre and we welcome the EPA recommendation that Leixlip be connected to the centre without delay.  The completion of the new plant facilitated the implementation of a range of refurbishments and improvements to the older plant, which could not be progressed until the new plant was commissioned.</p><p>The following works were identified: upgrade of controls and a new SCADA system, which is now complete; rehabilitation of the filter channel, which is now complete; repairs and replacement of electrical equipment, which has commenced and is ongoing and automated chlorine dosing, which is now complete.  Other works identified were automated back wash sequencing, which is now in place; PH correction, which currently is in design phase; replacement of valves and deep pipework, which is complete; and rehabilitation of sand filters, of which four out of 15 such filters have been refurbished.  Progress on these items is jointly monitored by Irish Water and Fingal County Council staff.  We note the recommendation by the EPA for a system-wide risk assessment of the plant.  Fingal County Council will assist Irish Water in a rapid review and the identification and implementation of any necessary works.  Fingal County Council acknowledges the disruption due to the issue of a boil water notice and offers apologies to all those affected by the issuing of the boil water notice on 22 October and the second notice, which is currently in place.  We remain committed to performing our duties under the service level agreement with Irish Water to ensure a continued safe water supply.</p></speech>

Several members have indicated they wish to put questions.  Before that, however, can Mr. Gleeson tell us whether he has a sense of when this boil water notice will be lifted?  At the opening of his statement he said something to the effect that the results of the latest tests had come back and the torpidity level still is not satisfactory.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Gleeson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#EE00300"><p>When I left the crisis management centre this morning that was the information I had, the levels were still above where we would like them to be.  We are waiting for the plant to improve.  We will carry out testing and hopefully the torpidity levels in the raw water will drop in the meantime and the plant will start to produce clear water.  It is operating correctly.  There are no identifiable failures within the plant at the moment.  It is simply that the filter beds are not operating as we would like them to.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#EE00500"><p>The context of this meeting was to review the October incident, if we can call it that, and now we are in the middle of a November incident.  To follow the Chairman's question, I would like Irish Water, the Department and Fingal County Council to give us a clearer view as to what the estimated time should be.  Are two or three tests needed before we get the all-clear from the Health Service Executive, HSE?  When can the more than 615,000 consumers expect to have clean drinking water again?  That is the question that those watching us here want answered.  How do we try to ensure that incidents like this do not happen again?  We will not get 100% assurance but as best as possible.  The whole of my area in Fingal is affected.  People are very angry and concerned and the October incident, which appears to have been a monumental failure in process, has created a real difficulty in respect of confidence in the robustness and safety of our water supply.  We do not want that to be the case.  We need to find out what we will do now and how quickly.</p> <p>  I welcome aspects of the statements that have been made, particularly by Irish Water and Fingal County Council, about things that have been done very quickly but one striking point in the EPA report is that the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday 22 October.  In that period two alarms showed up in the control room in Leixlip, one at 6.16 p.m. and one at 7.07 p.m. and when they were not responded to and contaminated water was still going into the system a text message was sent to the operator and that was ignored.  For anyone reading the report or watching this meeting that is absolutely inexcusable.  How many other times have alarms been ignored?</p><p>I am sure the witnesses know when they have been ignored.  I know of a couple of instances in the past in my area.  I will not go into specifics as it is unfair to do so.  How many other incidents have occurred?  What happens when alarms are actually ignored?</p><p> In his opening statement, Mr. Gleeson stated: &ldquo;Irish Water is in the process of bringing all critical alarms nationally into our national operations management centre.&rdquo;  I welcome the fact that the chief executive of Fingal County Council has also stated that the council wants that to happen without delay.  Mr. Gleeson also stated: &ldquo;For this to be beneficial, however, Irish Water needs to be able to contact plant operators directly when an alarm is triggered.&rdquo;  If an alarm is triggered, be it in Ballymore Eustace, Leixlip, Galway or any other plant, is it the case that Irish Water cannot contact them directly?  The weakest link in the chain seems to be around when an alarm has been triggered because of contaminated water and that public safety could be at risk.  Thankfully, both of the recent shutdowns have been precautionary.  I want to assure people about public safety with regard to water supply.  What happens if an alarm were to go off tomorrow and was not responded to?</p><p> I congratulate Ms Farrelly on her appointment and I know this is her first time before the committee.  These are serious issues, however.  It clearly is an absolute breakdown in process and procedure.  I can only go from the report of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and trust what it has said.  People want to get this fixed.  What steps will be taken between now and then?  Irish Water referred to the filter bed replacement which has gone to the second quarter in 2020.  Will Irish Water speak about the UV treatment?  Additional technologies were looked for in March and, specifically, in October.  What will that entail in terms of capital investment and time required to put that in place?</p><p> Going back to our current crisis, we need to get a handle on communications as to when Irish Water estimates water supply will be back.  It is a big issue for the infirm, the sick and the elderly.</p></speech>

We have listed several actions.  However, direct control and our ability to directly communicate with staff is not in the current way of working.  It is subject to the Workplace Relations Commission, meaning I am limited to that process.  In certain areas, we need to look at improving ways of working under the current service level agreements, SLAs.</p></speech>

The water quality had deteriorated by 6.15 p.m. and reached critical level at 7.50 p.m.  It was identified at 9 o&rsquo;clock.</p> <p>  That said, there was a failure in our monitoring system on that day.  That is subject to investigation and includes a disciplinary process which is under way.</p> <p>  In reaction to that, I can strengthen the systems that are there.  That strengthening has already happened which is evidenced in terms of the prompt reaction taken on Sunday to this current incident.  This includes a level of automation.  Alerts are sent automatically to the on-call duty manager, for example.  It also includes increased requirements from the on-call duty manager.  I want to introduce increased out-of-hours site visits.</p><p>The SCADA, supervisory control and data acquisition system, which helped us identify the problem from 21 October, can be monitored remotely or on-site.  Increased monitoring and reviewing of that system is important to understand if it is working well or if there is a problem we can address.  It is not just a reliance on alarms.  It is that plus regular auditing and review of what the reports tell us.  Bringing in these improvements is under way and will help prevent this type of incident happening again.</p><p> The overriding shutdown of the system, which is now in place, would have prevented the incident in any event.  Many improvements have been introduced in the past two weeks.  Some are ongoing over the next couple of days.  However, they will help to prevent this type of incident.</p><p> The ongoing incident is different as the committee has recognised.  That relates to the quality of the raw water.  We would be hopeful that the treatment will return to normal later this evening, provided there is no further deterioration in the raw water supply.  That then instigates a process, outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, earlier, which leaves it in a position to commence its audit.  There are several steps to go through once the water returns to normal.</p><p> We are not in a position to give a precise timeline for the next day or so.</p></speech>

I suspect we will be looking at something similar this time.  As Ms Farrelly said, the plant is still not operating properly.  The window for the slug of water to flush through the system has not started yet.  This is unfortunate and we are not happy about it but I have to be realistic about the situation.</p> <p>  I would be a hands-on managing director.  Often, when I had a problem plant, I would go along in the middle of the night, talk to the operators and understand what was happening.  Under the current working arrangements, I cannot do that.  I cannot visit that site without an invitation and without permission.  To me, that does not seem realistic.</p></speech>

Within the 30-day period in which we have to respond to the audit, we will carry out an assessment.  We will discuss with the EPA the merits, or not, of having UV treatment there.</p> <p>  The location of the Leixlip plant, as has been referred to earlier, is downstream at the bottom of the catchment.  Accordingly, UV is probably a requirement but we need to carry out the assessment.  It is a major investment and we would need to be 100% sure that it is required.  That assessment will be carried out.</p> <p>  In terms of the level of investment itself, one is looking at tens of millions of euro, as well as considerable operational costs because of the power demands of the UV system.  When the assessment is complete, installing UV in a plant the size of Leixlip, with 190 Ml of water leaving the plant per day, will require planning permission and a procurement process.  The best-case scenario is two to three years at this point in time.</p> <p>  Even if we had UV in place yesterday, we would still be in the current situation of a boil water notice because the pre-treatments, such as the sedimentation tanks and the filtration, have to be working properly for UV to be effective.  UV is the final belt and braces in the treatment for cryptosporidium.</p></speech>

Deputy Breathnach is correct that any boil water notice is wrong.  This is the single largest boil water notice we have ever had.  It is six times greater than the total number of people affected by both boil water notices last year.  It is also important that part of this has happened in a plant which in recent times has had significant upgrades, such as a new plant in 2014.</p> <p>  I am concerned that it was stated that the November incident is not a plant failure.</p><p>I completely accept from all the information we have received that there were two very different sets of incidents in October and November.  If the witnesses are telling me that yesterday's event was not a plant failure, and given the fact that it is highly likely we will have a similar volume of rain in a short period of time at some point in the future, it seems that the plant ultimately is not designed right if it cannot cope with what was not the most exceptional of rain events.  I will come back to that.</p><p> I know that Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh has to come in and do the batting for the single utility, but on the basis of what Mr. Gleeson said, even if one had a single utility, that would not have made any difference to yesterday's incident because one is talking about the plant functioning properly.  While we are very keen to have discussions around the single utility, I do not see how people responding to text messages, the failure to put in the shut-down system or yesterday's events would in any way be affected by a single utility or not.  That is a separate issue.</p><p> I am still not clear on the alarm, so somebody needs to explain who the duty operator is.  I am not looking for the person's name, but is it a member of Fingal County Council staff or is it a private operator?  Was this individual asleep when he or she got the text message?</p></speech>

What I am saying is that we had an incident where we were told that an alarm system was not responded to over an extended period of time.  That had a negative impact on 615,000 people.  I would just like to know how that can happen.  That is an important question to ask.</p> <p>  We got an update on where the implementation of recommendations from the March EPA report are at.  I would like an explanation for the slippage that the EPA spoke about.  What was the reason for that slippage and in particular, is installing an emergency shutdown system a very complicated job?  Is there a reason that took longer than clearly the EPA thought should have happened from its report?  I know the witnesses will not have completed their formal response to the EPA's October report, but are they in a position to give us any indication of timelines for the implementation of those nine recommendations?  I know the witnesses have spoken about the UV system, but can the committee give us any more information in relation to that?  Obviously that is very important to us.</p> <p>  In light of what the witnesses said about yesterday's events, what additional work do they think is going to be required to reduce or possibly eliminate such an event occurring again?  I am accepting what they are saying that the plant operated properly yesterday in terms of the shutdown and the notifications, but for us to ensure that does not happen again, what additional works are required?</p> <p>  With respect to the Department, it was clear from what the EPA was saying earlier, and this also speaks to what Deputy Breathnach was saying in terms of his own experience in Louth, that it is giving the Department regular updates in terms of failure to implement the recommendations of its audit report and slippage in those.  The most recent one was in September.  What do people in the Department do when they get those reports?  Do they get involved, engage with Irish Water or engage with the relevant local authority?  At what point does this get brought to the attention of the Minister, given the scale of the issues that we are talking about?</p> <p>  In terms of the impact on families and businesses, is there going to be any compensation available?  For example, many businesses will have lost trade or incurred very significant costs as a result of not having access to properly treated water.  For example, no tankers have been provided to provide freshly treated water and people have had to buy significant volumes of expensive bottled water.  This applies not just to the 615,000 people but people generally affected by boil water notices.  Who foots the bill for the additional cost that is put on those businesses and householders?</p></speech>

We have a national body that deals nationally with the EPA, so these incidents are very quickly identified and addressed with the EPA and the HSE through our crisis management team.  We do this nationally and it works very effectively.  We were also able to talk to other plants such as Ballymore Eustace and Vartry and increase their production, so again, the national utility took that role on.  We looked at the network and how we could divert water from one network to another when we knew the Leixlip plant was not operating correctly.  There is huge value in the national utility and bringing in a single management system with single standards, single measurements of sampling and testing, and a single type of quality system will be hugely beneficial to a national water system.</p><p>As I have stated before, the plant is fully operational and provides 20% of the water supply in Dublin.  The filter bed upgrade, probably the most important piece of ongoing work, has proved difficult without impacting on production.  It has been a problem.</p><p> A system of automatic shutdown was implemented in the new plant.  Owing to a misunderstanding, our personnel felt they had satisfied the audit by implementing the system of automatic shutdown in the new plant and the secondary plant, which is more complicated and more difficult to prepare.  We had placed a purchase order and there was a contractor involved.  However, we had not done the work, which I agree is a failing of-----</p></speech>

If one looks at the nine recommendations made in the most recent Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, audit report, five of them use the term &ldquo;Irish Water and Fingal County Council should&rdquo;.  That can create a difficulty as in such situations one agency will ask if it was a direction for it or the other agency.  There are issues with this control and responsibility.</p> <p>  The EPA will provide the Department with regular updates at a monthly meeting.  We have quarterly output monitor group meetings which include us, Irish Water, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, NewERA and the EPA and at which we look at the overall outputs of Irish Water in terms of investment, leakage management, the urban wastewater treatment directives, challenges and the remedial action list.  At the last meeting of the output monitoring group I was at, the issue of Tallanstown came up.  It showed up as a spike as a significant boil water notice had arisen in the previous period.  Individual audit reports are not addressed to the Department but to the operator.  The March report was not particularly brought to our attention.  We were not particularly aware of a significant issue in Leixlip, save that it was mentioned on the website.  It was not addressed to the Department, stating we should be aware of it and that, therefore, we needed to talk to somebody about it.  The seriousness of the incident meant that the Minister felt he needed to ask the EPA if there were other actions that needed to be taken or if there were policy impacts.  The next time we meet we will have had the experience of dealing with this incident and it will need to be discussed because, as has been pointed out, it is completely out of scale with anything else we have experienced before.</p></speech>

We are not measuring continuously for the bugs.  We are measuring the beds to see what level of particles is getting through.  If larger particles are getting through, then there is a chance that giardia or cryptosporidium can get through too.  It is precautionary.</p></speech>

Staleen in my constituency is a classic example.  There were major problems last year.  We eventually got to a solution.  While today's debate centres on Leixlip, it is symptomatic of other micro-problems across the country.  I will start with the issue of turbidity.  Heavy rain and flooding are common in Ireland.  The witnesses say it was exactly the same in Tallanstown, on a smaller scale.  The reality is that there are almost 100,000 people in addition to the 600,000 people impacted by the Leixlip plant who have boil water noices.  I think the figure was approximately 92,000.  If the flooding and heavy rain continues, as it does in this country, will it not become commonplace rather than exceptional in many of these schemes if the necessary equipment cannot be installed?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the gap in controllers.  There also seems to be a gap in the response.  We are here to discuss a nationwide issue.  It was clear in Tallanstown that there was a similar problem with a breakdown of some form of communication, of alarms or otherwise, and it was found by the EPA that it posed an unacceptable risk to public health and to consumers of that public water supply.  There was a 12 day gap where somebody did not issue a boil water notice, knowing that that water was in danger of contamination.  There were reports of people who were sick for a considerable period.  I asked this question this morning, when I did not get an answer, and will ask it here again.  I say that Tallanstown was a microcosm of Leixlip because it started with flooding, moved on to alarms not operating and then moved on to the issue of two audits in the scheme I am referring to, where the response to those audits was unacceptable.  Have we learned a lesson from that?  Will the witnesses, along with the EPA, be looking at the audits that have not been acted upon with a view to putting those on the remedial action list that the EPA referred to?</p> <p>  I have a number of comments about other issues.  The witnesses mentioned voluntary registration.  In my experience, in Louth, other than the odd text and email to public representatives, the public do not receive notification unless they have voluntarily registered.</p><p>When boil water notices go on for a long period of time, there is no excuse for people not to be informed, whether by the local authority or Irish Water, which has a list of domestic and non-domestic supplies.  I was involved in a group water scheme for 21 years.  The information is there but it needs to be transmitted to people when there is a boil water notice.</p><p> I understand the issue of tankers.  There is no excuse not to provide people with bottled water when there are boil water notices.  I want that addressed, whether for small schemes or large schemes covered by Leixlip.  I sent at least ten emails to Irish Water, which were responded to but in which there was not one mention of the EPA reports.  I ask for those reports to be made available, as they come about, to members of the local authorities and to D&aacute;il representatives.  There need to be regular meetings of public representatives, whether national or otherwise.  My blood has boiled over the past 105 days, as has that of the public, but I smile when I hear how alarms do not operate.  The Cavan Hill water scheme in Louth, which was one of the biggest in the country at the time, used fish to move from one tank to the other when there was contamination.  It is beyond me that the alarm systems, with all their modern technology, were not responded to.  Tallanstown was a microcosm of Leixlip because there was a breakdown in communication as to who was in charge of the plant.  I understand that people were on holidays at the time.  People are very concerned about the quality of water.</p><p> To what degree is the EPA monitoring the water at the extraction point, before it goes into treatment?  I can go on for a week about issues relating to the River Glyde supply, whether in the form of aluminium from the mine in Magheracloone, which was flagged to Irish Water, or pesticides.  What is the cause of the flooding in water, which has not been a problem heretofore?</p></speech>

There have been two boil water notices in quick succession, having been none previously, and people are really afraid, worrying whether it is safe to drink their water.  The tone of the witnesses needs to reflect the fact that there is real fear about the quality and safety of water.  More than one in ten people are affected so it is huge.</p> <p>  On the issue of cloudy water, how does rain get into the water treatment plant?  It comes in where there is not a combined sewer and surface water gets into the pumping stations, making the intake at Leixlip not as good as one would want and requiring a greater clean-up.  How wide is the risk assessment in the context of rainfall levels?</p><p>Does it look further upstream, at both the pumping stations?  Are there holding tanks there or not?  What happens to overflows when there is a lot of rain?</p><p> I live in Leixlip and have got my water there since the late 1970s, so this is highly unusual.  New developments now have separated systems so the phenomenon should be reducing, not growing.  There are more households using the system and, of course, there is a lot of industry, with one wet industry in particular that uses a dedicated pipe.  Does this get its supply wholly from Leixlip?  </p></speech>

The new plant at Leixlip is working okay and, even with higher turbidity in the river water, it can manage where the old plant could not.  This shows that the technology can manage the situation if it is put in correctly.  He asked about the response in respect of Tallanstown and he said information was the key.  That is correct.  As soon as we were aware of the issue at Tallanstown we contacted the EPA and the HSE and emergency sampling and testing took place.  It was deemed that there was no immediate risk and, after further consultation with the HSE and in light of the cryptosporidium risk, it was decided that a boil water notice should be imposed.  The notice was initially for some 2,000 people and this number was reduced by the number who found alternative supplies, leaving between 500 and 600 people.  We have carried out weekly cryptosporidium testing in the interim and, to date, samples have been clear.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about EPA reports.  We have written to every individual customer on the remedial action list.  We want to get the information out and we are fully transparent.  It is not in our interests to sit on information and as soon as we know something we are happy to liaise immediately with both the EPA and the HSE.</p> <p>  Bottled water is part of our response to all vulnerable customers.  An offer is made but very few take it up because boiling water makes it okay.  Deputy Breathnach mentioned technology and referred to the use of fish in tanks.  This used to have a benefit because, when river water was polluted, they would leave one tank to go to the fresher water.  It was also very good for school tours but technology has moved on and it is now possible to put in monitors and sensors of raw water, which we test as it comes into plants.  In Leixlip, we have continuous ammonia monitoring and any increases cause alarm bells to ring at the plant.</p></speech>

In the Leixlip audit for March there was a misunderstanding about the shutdown but all other open items are being acted upon.  They are just taking longer.  We can correct some of the items straight away but some, such as the UV issue in the report, require an analysis and a discussion with the EPA.  If the EPA makes a recommendation we take it on board.  Open items on an audit are not necessarily a bad thing.</p></speech>

We are bitterly disappointed with this and we fully understand the impact it has on customers, both domestic and non-domestic.  The raw water which is extracted comes from the full River Liffey catchment upstream.</p><p>We are not just looking at pump stations or combined sewers.  We are looking at everything that is in the catchment area, and all of that comes down as far as Leixlip.  It is not just the combined sewers, misconnections or issues such as that.  It is everything that is happening from the perspective of agriculture, pesticides and so on.  That is what comes down, and we do sample in that regard.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the risk assessment.  In its audit report the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, outlines risk assessment in the plan.  However, we are very much in the space of drinking water safety plans where we do a risk assessment from source to tap, as we call it.  We go right back into the catchment.  That risk assessment will be part and parcel of our assessment around the need or otherwise for UV.  The risk assessment has to take the catchment into account.  We will then know what we have to treat in the plant, but when it leaves the plant, we also have to take the network into account and see how it is behaving.</p><p> In terms of the wet industry the Deputy referred to, whereas they were always fed solely from Leixlip, they now receive water from Ballymore Eustace as well.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. O'Leary.  In terms of Leixlip, I am familiar with the area from Leixlip to Ballycoolin as I was involved in laying the pipework going out that way.  First, is there a problem with staff shortages in Leixlip?  I note Irish Water has job vacancies there at the moment.  Second, is a sand-type system used?  I presume there is UV, chlorination and all of that on it.  What was the problem with the alarms that they were not activated?  Generally, they are fairly foolproof.  Third, is there a problem downstream with torpidity?  Torpidity will change.  People need to understand, in fairness to Irish Water or any group supplying water, that the regulations have changed so much that when it goes to a certain specification, a boil water notice must be issued.  Are there problems with the sewerage systems belonging to Irish Water where overflows have occurred and pressure is being put on it?  That is in respect of the Leixlip set-up.</p> <p>  In terms of Irish Water's five-year framework, if one reads Michael Brennan's book, and I refer to Coffey Construction also, the money in that ran out over a month ago.  Is there a problem with the amount of funding Irish Water needs?  To put in the machinery the witnesses are talking about in Leixlip and other places throughout the country, it will need a good deal of funding.  Does Irish Water need more funding to get emergency works done?  It is fine for the EPA to do reports.  What people need to realise is that before Irish Water was established, a part of this country, namely, Roscommon was subject to a boil water notice for ten years.  Irish Water needs a lot of money.  Judging by the budgets I have seen, there are many areas across the country that need major works, but to be honest, Irish Water does not seem to have the budget required for that.</p><p> Will the delegates address the leak detection issue?</p><p> When the Leixlip plant is up and running again and the boil water notice has been withdrawn, will Irish Water have scoured all of the lines from the plant that supply water to the 600,000 people affected?</p><p> The next question is for Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh and the Irish Water representatives.  The level of funding for sewage treatment plants in smaller towns has been changed this year by the Department.  No funding is proposed for a plant in a small town where raw sewage might be flowing into a river because Irish Water does not have a scheme in it.  The delegates must realise that where I come from, a rural area, we look after our own water supply through a group water scheme.  There was a scheme for sewerage systems, but small towns and villages have been left in a position where raw sewage can flow into rivers.  There are communities that are willing to come together in that regard, but because there is no Irish Water scheme in a town, there is no funding in place.  We were told that Irish Water was coming up with such a scheme.  Is it coming up with one?</p></speech>

At Lough Talt in Sligo Irish Water was going through the imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI, process.  It is dragging on.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh should be very familiar with the national parks.  Is the process nearly complete for the people surrounding Lough Talt who have experienced a problem with the water supply for the past ten years?</p> <p>  Is Irish Water going to move forward in undertaking the Shannon job if there is a problem in Dublin?</p> <p>  On procurement, Irish Water is stopping smaller contractors from operating because of the way it is increasing its turnover figures.  If it keeps doing so, it will limit water works in Ireland to four or five contractors.  The smaller operators that once worked for the councils are becoming sub-contractors.</p></speech>

Ms Farrelly will take the question on staffing and alarms, while Mr. O'Leary will answer the balance.</p> <p>  On funding, we have a strategic funding plan which was agreed with the Government.  It is a &euro;6 billion plan, with a comprehensive list of projects and programmes.  It is a significant amount of money which will cover a lot of work.  There are probably areas that will not be covered under this five-year programme, but it is comprehensive.</p></speech>

We have modelled the water network from Leixlip.  At any point in time we know where the water at risk is, whether it be after 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours.  We were speaking about samples earlier.  If we know that the plant was stable, we would know where water would have passed through at the 72-hour mark.  To lift the initial boil water notice, we had to undertake some scouring at the extremities of the network to remove any remaining at-risk water.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Lough Talt.  I am happy to report that the IROPI process has been completed.  We received planning permission and the contractor is on site.  That contract is progressing.</p> <p>  On procurement, we have a number of frameworks in place and work closely with the industry.  We are not in the business of setting up monopolies for very large businesses.</p></speech>

We have skilled and experienced engineers who know the plant well.  They know what the differences are between the old and the new systems and in how the system must operate on a 24-hour basis to maintain the water supply produced at the plant.  There is a recruitment process under way to recruit a plant operator, but five of the six positions have been filled.  The recruitment process ended yesterday.</p><p>The vacancy will be filled quickly.  As the range of other skills required at the plant is available, there is no shortage right now.  It is difficult for every local authority to maintain experienced staff for Irish Water duties.  As staff retire, we are generally finding it more and more difficult to recruit and fill positions.  Right now the treatment plant is staffed satisfactorily.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be interested to know that the first proper and full imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI, effort is to be carried out there by an Irish authority from beginning to end.  The Deputy will be familiar with the issues from what has happened in other areas.</p> <p>  We are aware of the community group sewerage scheme issue.  It is more complex than the issue of group water schemes.  We have a poor level of experience of smaller community managed sewage treatment plants because of their complexity and requirements.  There is limited support available among the existing group.  If available, the rural multi-annual programme for connection to an existing Irish Water pipeline is something we said we would look at.  There is a review group for rural water services and we said we would look at it as an issue.  However, it is complex and it is unlikely to be an area where we will come forward immediately with answers.  It is something that is being looked at.</p></speech>

I welcome the contributions that have been made.  People understand how grave the issue is and it is not only an issue because it affects the greater Dublin area; it is of significance because of the size of the outage.</p> <p>  As I put most of my earlier questions to the Environmental Protection Agency, Irish Water and Fingal County Council, I want to turn to the officials from the Department.  What assurance has been given by the Department and the Minister that, should additional funding be required by Irish Water or Fingal County Council to implement the recommendations made, additional funding will be made available?  Can that commitment be given here?  I believe it would be useful post the resolution of the November incident.  The committee could reconvene with the agencies represented today for a special session to ensure we would be kept abreast of developments in the implementation of the recommendations made.  In that way we could ensure oversight by the committee in the sense of being hands on.  That is a proposal I am making formally.</p> <p>  In his statement Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said the Minister had spoken directly to the managing director of Irish Water, Fingal County Council and the general director of the Environmental Protection Agency.  When did that happen?  Was it a face to face meeting, or was it on the telephone?  I have a particular reason for asking that question.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh referenced how reform was critical to the improvement programme for water services delivery.  He said Irish Water had responsibility for public water services operated under service level agreements with the 31 local authorities but that the company lacked direct operational control of services.  He went on to say this was not satisfactory and that the set-up was no longer fit for purpose.  Who is responsible for changing it?  Who is responsible for changing the responsibilities Irish Water has and the relationship between Irish Water and the 31 local authorities?</p> <p>  What I have seen in the past week is a large degree of washing of hands of the issue by the Department and the Minister.</p><p>There has been a Pontius Pilate approach to this and it is not acceptable because at the end of the day the Minister is the line Minister and the Secretary General is the Accounting Officer.  When the Department makes such statements it is as if the Department is simply commentating on the issue.  The suggestion is that it is awful and not satisfactory and no longer fit for purpose.  The reason I bring the Minister into this is because the official mentioned it in his statement as well.  Who is responsible for changing it?</p></speech>

The first thing is to go back to the question of the alarm.  The EPA report in March indicated an issue with responding to the alarms.  I am interested to know how Irish Water and Fingal County Council responded.  What was done to try to ensure that that issue of non-response to the alarm that occurred in March, which was identified in the EPA report in April, did not recur?  There is obviously the issue of who did not respond to the alarm and why.  There is also the question of the management system in place.  Given that there had been an earlier incident I am interested to hear back on that matter.</p> <p>  The second question is for Irish Water.  It goes back to the question of the November incident and what works need to be done to ensure that the possibility of that type of incident is reduced as much as possible.  I understand from the last response that work is being done around the filtration system.  If it is decided to do the ultraviolet work and money is provided, would that reduce the likelihood of recurrence of the November incident or would further works be required to mitigate the effects?</p> <p>  My final question is for the Department officials.  I appreciate that the reports the Department received from the EPA right up to September did not specifically relate to this audit and the issue of slippage, as the EPA termed it, in implementation.  The references were more part of a general report.  The Department gets those general reports.  At what point does the Department start to red-flag stuff in a preventative way?  We have heard from other Deputies about boil water notices for over 100 consecutive days.  Is there a point at which the Department decides there is a problem it needs to get involved in?  If so, what does the Department do at that stage, other than receiving the information and being informed?</p> <p>  The Irish Water officials addressed a question on compensation for non-domestic customers.  Is compensation available for regular families?  The Irish Water officials seemed to indicate that if people request bottled water they will get it.  That is certainly news to me and probably to the vast majority of people who have been spending sums of money on this.  Is there a facility available for individuals and families who have spent significant sums of money on bottled water to recoup or to secure bottled water directly from Irish Water?</p></speech>

I guess the majority of it is down to Fingal County Council.  We indicated our dissatisfaction in March with the non-response.  One of my fundamental principles on this issue is that we cannot have a system relying on the actions of one operator.  We need to put in place better control systems and auto-shutdowns but more automation as well.  Our national control centre has secondary responsibility or an extra layer of responsibility.  We need systems and ways of working around that to make it effective.</p></speech>

There was a particular staff issue that gave rise to it.  That issue was dealt with in March.  There is always ongoing training and repeat training for staff members.  That is part of how we address it.  We were asked about what happens at the plant, understanding what happened the night before and what has been happening on an ongoing basis.  That is implemented by the management staff at the plant.</p><p>Again, shortcomings could then be addressed with the individual employees.</p><p> I have been discussing with Mr. Gleeson whether we should employ additional staff, especially for the out-of-hours times.  That process is ongoing and will take time to implement.  In the meantime, we need to strengthen our monitoring and controls.  That process is ongoing this week.  We have significantly enhanced those already.  It is work in progress and improvements are already in place, with more to happen.  We are open to every solution here.  If it requires more staff to be on site at all times, then this is something we can look at.</p><p> There is an issue in that the older plant probably produces more alarms than a more modern plant, which is a factor.  We need to understand and prioritise the alarms so they are reacted to in the right way.  It is a work in progress, but improvements can be made and have been made.  Whatever is needed will happen straight away.</p></speech>

Many of the questions have been asked.  I believe there is a huge communication problem.  A system where Irish Water does not know who is vulnerable or who qualifies to be vulnerable is a problem before we even start.  Irish Water does not know what the 31 local authorities are doing because every local authority is different and I believe it needs to put something in place.  It is crucial.  We all know vulnerable people.  Can I go into my local authority and say to a council worker that I know a vulnerable person who needs water?  What do I do to get it?  It is an issue when one loses contact with the person on the ground.  I am from Carlow and Carlow local authority was always the base.  Carlow County Council always fixed the pipes and did the work.  When a person rang the council, he or she knew who he or she was ringing.  The person knew the face.</p><p>Irish Water has been an operational company since it began in 2014.  The company's lo-call number is 1890 278 278.  I give it out all the time.  I have my own number, which I call and get through to the local call centre.  I have done this several times because I have done it for other people.  Then the local call centre has to get through to Irish Water.  Then Irish Water must get through to the local authority, whichever one it is.  Local authorities cannot touch a pipe without getting consent from Irish Water.  There is now a system whereby a person rings a number, gets through to a call centre, then the call is passed on to Irish Water and then to the particular local authority.  It is not working.  The reason it is not working is that there are too many numbers.  I am constantly highlighting water outages or whatever is happening.  I do not mind doing that because that is my role.  I will do that.  People, however, are finding it hard.  It is not like going in and speaking to someone face to face.  I do not think this system is working.  Is there any way that Irish Water could change that?  I believe that local authorities have lost all power.  I deal with Gr&aacute;inne in Carlow, who is excellent.  I must give her credit where credit is due, but I feel that there is a huge communication problem, which is getting bigger.  Irish Water needs to look at that.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on that.</p></speech>

That is effective for the entire country.  It is not localised and is not relying on individuals' knowledge and so on.  We have separate numbers for customers to dial in and we have numbers for elected representatives.  I am relatively new in the position, but reading into it there is a single point of contact.  For the customer it should be seamless.  They do not see those various points of connection.  The Senator understands them but the customer just rings up that number and reports a leak, and we take it from there.  To me, the system is working.</p></speech>

There may be things going on behind the scenes between Irish Water and the local authority but when the customer rings our call centre that call should then be actioned and our call centre should then get back to the customer.  If this is breaking down in any area I would be happy to hear from the Senator and we could investigate the particular issues.  With all these things, we always aim for continual improvement.  From our perspective the customer is centre stage and the call centre is there to serve the customer.</p></speech>

Irish Water will always have to go back to the local authority anyway.  Without a face that one can contact it becomes a problem.  Perhaps we could look at some other way.  I am aware that Irish Water has a Twitter hashtag and 1800 numbers, and I know the company is given media coverage, but Irish Water has been given a lot of funding over the years-----</p></speech>

The works required at Leixlip can be managed within that capital budget.  I am sure of that.  Regarding the Minister's liaison with various people, he was on the phone to senior executives in Irish Water almost immediately once he was notified of the incident on the Tuesday evening.  He spoke to the managing director in the following days.  Yesterday he spoke separately to Mr. Niall Gleeson, the chief executive of Fingal County Council and the director general of the EPA, and said he would be having a formal meeting with the managing director.</p></speech>

He gave the impression that this related to the Leixlip plant and the associated water difficulties.  I want to know if Leixlip and the boil water notice were discussed at that meeting.  Was that a regular meeting or a special meeting?  In response to a question raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Dara Calleary on 23 October, the Minister gave the impression that it was a special meeting specifically convened to deal with the first October incident.  Can Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh shed any light on that?  I know he is not the Minister and the Minister is not here.  I will ask himself when I have the opportunity.</p></speech>

I understand these committee hearings are attracting considerable interest on Oireachtas News, which is good because not everybody can come here.  I welcome our visitors to this meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The purpose of the meeting is to continue our deliberations on Traveller health.  We are meeting representatives of the Cork Traveller Visibility Group, the Health Service Executive and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  We all agree that health and ill health are key issues affecting Travellers who have significantly lower levels of life expectancy and higher rates of infant mortality when compared to the general population.</p><p>It is not just a small difference.  It is a very big difference, and that is why we are having these sessions.<br/><br/>The facts on the level and scale of ill-health among Travellers and the health inequalities experienced by Travellers, as presented to the committee by the submissions and the presentations, are stark in many ways and they speak for themselves.  We know from the very well respected - though in need of updating - All Ireland Traveller Health Study that Traveller men's life expectancy is 66 years of age.  Traveller men's lives are cut short by 15 years compared to the general population, which is a huge and serious gap.  The difference for Traveller women is 12 years.  Traveller mortality is three and a half times higher than for the general population.<br/><br/>At our last hearing, we heard that there was a recent health study done in east Limerick that bore out these statistics, and some things stand out.  One was that only 29 people in the local Traveller population were over 50 years of age and only three of those were over 65 years of age.  We have the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, which is still valid but needs to be updated.  We have some local statistics and recent statistics which bear out those trends and those disparities.  Traveller babies are almost four times more likely to die compared to babies in the general population.<br/><br/>These growth health inequalities facts and figures were clearly spelled out in general and in very personal terms, because when we have had speakers in here, people have spoken about statistics, trends and social determinants of health, but they have been speaking about their brothers, sisters, fathers, babies and their close family.  Again, we are reminded it is a small population of about 40,000 people, and when we look at the trends on health and mental health, people are talking about their own.  That has come across very strongly in the presentations we have had to date.<br/><br/>We heard from Kathleen Sherlock from the Minceir Whidden Society, Maria Joyce from the National Traveller Women's Forum, Nora Mooney from the Kilmallock Traveller group, and of course the veteran health campaigner, Missie Collins.  We also heard from Jim Walsh from the Department of Health who outlined the Government's official response to the health crisis among Travellers.  We heard the strong call for the health action plan to be published and for real and ongoing consultative measures of national and local level to established or even re-established.  That is why the committee is conducting its second hearing on health today.  As members know, we have had three hearings on mental health.  This one is on health in general terms.<br/><br/>I welcome everyone.  We are joined by Ms Breda O'Donoghue, the director of advocacy, and Ms Liz McGrath, the health team co-ordinator, Traveller Visibility Group; Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, head of operations, primary care, HSE, Concepta De Brun, HSE social inclusion unit, Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, co-ordinator of a Traveller health unit; and Dr. Mary Favier, president, and Dr. Tony Cox, medical director, the Irish College of General Practitioners.<br/><br/>Before we begin, we have to remind everybody about privilege.  In accordance with procedure, I am required to draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings will be given, and that they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity in such a way as that person might be identifiable.  Members are reminded the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of these Houses or an official either by name or in such a way then as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind everyone to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they can interfere with the sound and the recording system and affect the television coverage and web streaming.</p><p> I advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement made to the joint committee will be published on the website after this meeting so it will be on the record.  After the presentations, there will be questions from the members.  I call on Ms O'Donoghue to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I have been asked to discuss the key issues relating to Traveller health and its impact on our community.  When looking at the key issues impacting Traveller health and the community, we must first look at the root cause of these issues.  Putting another way, we must ask what is killing Travellers today.  There is one answer which is racism.  Over the past 50 plus years, specifically since the 1963 Commission on Itinerancy, Travellers have lived in a hostile environment, where our culture and identity was to be absorbed into the settled community and our very existence repeatedly seen and referenced as a problem.  While we understand that this commission's report is out of print and, as some of us would argue, is obsolete, its legacy has affected the lives of Travellers to this day.  We are seeing the product of a systemic cultural denial and discrimination in our public services from education to social welfare, private enterprises, employment opportunities, accommodation and media.  The effect of this historical assimilation programme on mental and physical health has impacted the Traveller community severely, leading to suicide and mental health being at crisis point, which has been rightly recognised as such by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly.</p> <p>  At the Traveller Visibility Group, TVG, our primary healthcare workers meet on a daily basis with Travellers living in Cork.  They see how a mistrust of public services, based on discriminatory attitudes and behaviours of staff, and how policies have deterred Travellers from using these services effectively.  Travellers feel they are constantly struggling and resisting discrimination in their daily lives, where they witness their children struggling in schools and have their own issues with employment opportunities and appropriate accommodation.</p> <p>  While the social determinants of health and their effect on the general Traveller community are all important factors, accommodation is widely acknowledged as the key issue causing health inequalities for Travellers.  As reflected in the social determinants of health, if one's living conditions are poor, this directly impacts on one's physical and mental health, education, employment and general well-being.  The vast majority of local authority halting sites are overcrowded, badly-managed, poorly serviced, under-funded and unhygienic.  Put simply, these halting sites are not fit for purpose and lead to illness, injury and stress caused by an overcrowded and high-risk living environment.  We note that in some cases these confined conditions can lead to community disputes around sharing very limited spaces and facilities.  As noted above, poor living conditions lead to poor health.  Cardiovascular, dietary and respiratory problems are common within the Traveller community and can be directly linked to poor living conditions.  </p> <p>  Suicide and mental health within the Traveller community is at crisis point.  This can again be linked to the poor living conditions and isolation felt as a result of the poor management of Traveller accommodation.  The situation is clear.  Travellers living conditions and the social determinants of health have worsened since the 1963 commission.  The lives of Travellers are directly impacted by an accommodation and a mental health crisis that directly impacts their physical health and many of these issues are caused by historic assimilation and discrimination.  We need to distance ourselves now from reports and recommendations and start a genuine programme of legislation by creating sanctions to ultimately fix the cultural denial and racism issues that impact so drastically on Travellers lives and their children's future.</p> <p>  In general, Travellers tend to use health services as a last resort, often ignoring ailments or health issues until they are at emergency point.  Prevention and early intervention are key to improving and addressing health inequalities and this is directly linked to improving relationships and communication between health services and the Traveller community.  The statistics featured in reports such as the All Ireland Traveller Health Study paint a clear yet stark picture that Travellers are dying younger than the settled community.</p><p>They are seven times more likely to commit suicide and 50 times more likely to finish school without a leaving certificate.</p><p> While this information may sound alarming today, the sad fact is that it is not shocking news within the Traveller community.  In fact, it is almost identical to the statistics in the last Traveller health study in 1987.  As Travellers, we can see this in front of our eyes every day.  We have a situation where many Travellers are not accessing health services, for various reasons.  However, it has been reported that when Travellers access these services, they often feel the services do not reflect the needs of the Traveller community.  One example is that written correspondence is often delivered to another person on a halting site or maybe not delivered at all.  Whether this is for genuine reasons or otherwise, the fact remains that most Travellers on halting sites miss very important appointments due to lack of postal delivery.</p><p> When using health services, Travellers have a fear of the response they will get when presenting with an issue, particularly around children's health, at accident and emergency units.  Many Travellers fear the hospital staff will make assumptions about an injury or illness that has occurred and fear blame for the situation.  There is an increasing fear of hospital staff contacting Tusla or other social welfare services because of assumptions that are made about the way Travellers treat their children.  While we appreciate and welcome the need to be vigilant for children's safety, time and again we see instances of Travellers being treated with distrust and suspicion within the health services, and this creates fear and mistrust among the Traveller community. </p><p> To look at health initiatives to support the Traveller community, there is clear evidence that Traveller-led health initiatives, organisations and peer-support workers build trust within the community and, from this, there is a willingness to engage more with public services.  The primary health care programme and the development workers in Traveller organisations play a vital role in assuring Traveller engagement with public services.  There is better uptake of health initiatives and services like screening and health checks when communicated by peers to the community.  When provided with supportive and accessible information, it has been noted that there is a higher uptake and use of such services.  For example, more Traveller women take part in cervical smear tests and breast checks than settled women, which is directly linked to the support of Traveller primary health care workers.</p><p> The strong relationship and knowledge sharing within the Traveller organisations is a huge support to the Traveller community on a local and national level.  The support and representation of national Traveller organisations in policy and advocacy work is hugely valuable, and continued investment and support is essential.  Training and capacity building within the Traveller community is vital to promoting health and well-being.  Currently, Travellers are more inclined to engage with health awareness programmes or other training when Traveller organisations are directly involved in delivering the training.  More support of such programmes is necessary and would have productive outcomes.</p><p> While we acknowledge that this peer support is vital, we need to see development within the public services to encourage Travellers to be able to use these services directly, with reduced or little support from Traveller organisations.  Traveller cultural awareness training should be funded properly and adapted to ensure that all public service staff, especially customer facing officers, are fully aware of Traveller culture and can engage with their customers in a culturally appropriate manner.  In order for Traveller culture to be understood and appreciated, Traveller cultural awareness training should be mandatory as part of public service staff induction training.  Refresher training for longer-term staff should take place on a regular basis in such services as health, education, social welfare and local authority services, which are the main areas affecting the social requirements of Traveller health and well-being.</p><p> It is not good enough for front-line public staff who work directly with Travellers to have no understanding or background knowledge of the Traveller community.  Travellers are part of Irish society and need to be treated as such, with the same understanding and nuance that would be afforded to any individual coming in, looking for assistance from a public service.</p><p> I have spoken to the committee today about the key issues affecting Traveller health and the community.  At its root is an historic policy that has been in play for over 50 years.  This needs to change and everybody has a responsibility to drive this change.  There is an institutional prejudice that has been passed down from a group of people who saw us as a problem, not a people.</p><p>We have moved a lot in some ways, in that Travellers are recognised as an ethnic group and not something to be absorbed into the general community as the 1963 commission hoped for.  While on paper we are recognised as an ethnic minority, the reality is the deep-rooted feelings of mistrust towards my community have not changed or moved on.  Until they do, then and only then will we start to see a positive change in the health status of the Traveller community.</p><p> For the past 20 or 30 years, Travellers have consulted with Government bodies on what can be done for the Traveller community.  We have sat on countless committees and boards to advise and assist.  While we must recognise there has been some positive change in this period, we must also agree the process is slow and, in some areas, ineffective.  The time for recommendations is over.  We need real support and resolute actions where the recommended budgets, guidelines and plans are fully realised and brought into everyday life.  There is no more we can do to assist in the societal change that is necessary to improve the lives of Travellers in Ireland.  We consult but who decides?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to the HSE to attend the committee meeting.  I am the assistant national director with responsibility for primary care services.  I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Concepta de Brun, the HSE regional social inclusion specialist and Ms Deirdre O'Reilly, the Traveller health co-ordinator for the Cork and Kerry community healthcare area.</p> <p>  The All Ireland Traveller Health Study in 2010 provided evidence of a widening gap in health status between the Traveller community and the general population.  It found that people from the Traveller community experience lower levels of life expectancy than the general population and higher levels of morbidity associated with chronic disease conditions and other causes.</p> <p>  The goals of the HSE are to promote health and well-being as part of everything we do in order that people will be healthier; to provide fair, equitable and timely access to safe quality health services that people need; and to foster a culture that is honest, compassionate, transparent and accountable.  The HSE is committed to ensuring that health services for people from the Traveller community are provided in accordance with these values and objectives.  The national Traveller health advisory forum, which was established in 2008, supports models of good practice in the delivery of health initiatives to the Traveller community at local, regional and national level.  It operates under the governance of the HSE social inclusion service, which is part of primary care and supports the delivery of actions in Government policies to improve access to health services and address health inequalities within the Traveller community. </p> <p> Each year, in the HSE approximately &euro;10 million is allocated through social inclusion services for Traveller health initiatives.  This funding supports staff working in Traveller primary healthcare projects and Traveller health units.  Additional funding is also provided through dormant accounts and mental health services.  The majority of HSE funding for Traveller health is used to support Traveller primary healthcare projects.  There are 27 such projects nationally, which are staffed by members of the Traveller community.  They adopt a peer-led approach, supporting members of the Traveller community to support others in achieving health outcomes.  The projects promote population health initiatives by providing information to families on vaccination and health screening programmes.  This approach has played a key role, as Ms O'Donoghue has pointed out, in improving vaccination rates in the Traveller community.  Traveller primary healthcare projects play an important health promotion role.  For example, they provide education on antenatal care, child development checks, smoking cessation, diabetes care and asthma medication management.  The positive impact of the work of the projects was highlighted in the All Ireland Traveller Health Study.</p> <p>  All Traveller primary healthcare projects fall under the remit of eight Traveller health units.</p><p>They are located in the nine community healthcare organisations and serve a Traveller population of approximately 36,000.  The Traveller health units are key bodies in delivering appropriate targeted services to members of the Traveller community, overseen by co-ordinators such as Ms O'Reilly.  Every Traveller health unit has an annual action plan relating to the local health needs of the Traveller community in that given area.  These plans contain actions relating to primary care, mental health, public health and health and well-being.  Traveller health units have established regional networks to share learning, ensure consistent practice, and optimise efficiency and value for money.  Arising from these networks, regional initiatives have made a positive impact on the healthcare needs of the Traveller community.</p><p> We have provided a great deal of information in our written submissions on the range of actions being undertaken in general by the HSE, specifically in the Cork-Kerry area, in partnership with the Traveller community and other organisations to support Traveller health.  The key aims of the work are to improve access, opportunities, participation rates and outcomes in the healthcare system, to reduce health inequalities experienced by Travellers, to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate, to support positive mental health initiatives and to reduce the rate of suicide and mental health problems.</p><p> I thank committee members for their attention and for their interest in the actions being undertaken to improve Traveller health outcomes.  I acknowledge and commend the commitment and motivation of staff working in the Traveller primary healthcare projects, the Traveller health units, primary care services and the wider health service.  Through them, we are committed to providing fair and equitable access to health services and to supporting improvements in health outcomes for the Traveller community.</p><p> Ms De Brun, Ms O'Reilly and I are free to take members' questions, if they have any.</p></speech>

The ICGP is tasked with providing education and training to the general practitioners, GPs, of the country.  We are a membership organisation that sets quality and standards.  Approximately 85% of GPs are members of the ICGP.</p> <p>  As has been well elaborated on at this meeting, a recent study has found that the Traveller community is affected by several significant social determinants.  As the ICGP, we want to concentrate on those that most impact on general health.  The life expectancy statistics show stark inequalities in health among the Traveller population compared to the general population.  Studies in maternal health, communicable diseases, addiction and mental health, including suicide, serve as clear indicators of the extent of this health inequity.</p> <p>  The high levels of mortality and morbidity among Travellers are well documented.  The life expectancy figures are most stark.  A male Traveller can expect to die 15 years sooner than a male in the general population, with a female Traveller 11.5 years earlier than her counterpart in the general population.  The infant mortality rate is 3.6 times higher for Traveller children than in the general population.  While there have been improvements among Traveller mothers attending antenatal services and having shared antenatal care between maternity hospitals and GPs, more than 2% of Traveller mothers still receive no antenatal care.</p> <p>  It is encouraging to know that many Travellers engage with primary healthcare services in particular, as evidenced by the 2010 All Ireland Traveller Health Study.  The study found that up to 91% of Travellers obtained their health information from GPs.  Travellers' own health beliefs may impact on access to health services, however.  For example, GPs treat appointments as the start of a process in treating their patients whereas Travellers may view the consultation as a single issue that should be dealt with in one visit.  These are matters of which we need to be aware.  In some cases, if symptoms do not improve, it can lead to a visit to a hospital emergency department rather than a return to the GP.</p> <p>  Health initiatives for the Traveller community must be informed by the principles of equality, human rights, social inclusion and respect for Traveller values, beliefs, culture and perceptions.  As with the general population, Travellers should have improved access to, participation rates in and outcomes from healthcare services.</p> <p>  The very high prevalence of suicide among Travellers is of particular concern.  Measures that would help include on-site sessional counselling and general practice, culturally appropriate awareness campaigns and outreach services signposted to primary care.</p><p>Targeted health initiatives and associated information materials for Travellers and healthcare providers should be culturally appropriate.  Any identified interventions should be designed to improve self-esteem among Travellers, reduce stigma and remove barriers to care.  Regardless of the health policy initiatives instigated for Travellers, the views of Travellers must be included when designing such interventions.  Traveller participation and co-operation in previous studies, research and information design have been key to their success.</p><p> While Travellers experience issues with access to GPs, the same is true for large sections of the population.  Clearly, access to GP services needs to be improved and some basic improvements could make large differences.  Practices that offer a combination of booked appointments and some same-day appointments would improve Travellers' access to GP services.  Cultural awareness training is appropriate for all practice staff and should be developed with input from the Traveller community.</p><p> The process of obtaining and retaining a medical card needs to be streamlined and simplified.  The health outcome differences between Travellers and the general population are avoidable and with appropriate resourcing and planning, these issues can, and should be, addressed urgently.  The Irish College of General Practitioners looks forward to playing a significant role in this area.</p><p> We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

It is encouraging to hear from her statement that the health differences between Travellers and the general population are avoidable if we take the right steps.  I call Senator Lynn Ruane, who will be followed by Deputies Corcoran-Kennedy and Joan Collins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#H00300"><p>I have a few questions which I hope the Chairman will afford me the time to get through.  My first set of questions are directed to the HSE.  It was mentioned that one of the key aims of the HSE is to deliver health services in a way that is culturally appropriate.  How is this implemented?  What training do HSE staff receive and who delivers that training?  Is the &euro;10 million annual funding to Traveller health initiatives sufficient given the health needs of the community?  Was an increase in funding sought under budget 2020 or in any of the last five budgets?  If so, what was the response from the Department of Health?  Ms McArdle described a Traveller health provision structure which is siloed from the rest of general service provision within the health service.  What are the documented experiences of Travellers accessing general health services or in other words, services that are not Traveller-specific?  Is there a long-term shift planned to mainstream Traveller healthcare within general services, perhaps as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms?</p> <p>  My next set of questions is to the ICGP.  We heard previously in our sessions on Traveller mental health that many Traveller patients have had their medical cards revoked.  If there is documented impact in this regard, what has been the impact thus far on Traveller patients?  I made the suggestion at a previous committee hearing that regardless of a Traveller's circumstances, until such time as we exit the current health crisis every Traveller should be given access to a medical card.  I would like to know if the witnesses agree with me in that regard.  Are the HSE and the ICGP doing enough in the face of the Traveller health crisis?  Is there prejudice when it comes to healthcare services and what is being done to root it out?</p> <p> My final questions are to the representatives of the Traveller Visibility Group, Ms Breda O'Donoghue and Ms Liz McGrath.  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that the main cause of poor health outcomes is substandard living conditions.  What type of engagement has the group had with local authorities in regard to raising the standards on that ground and has there been real dialogue between Traveller organisations and local authorities on how the issue can be addressed?  It was also mentioned that the uptake in cervical screening is higher among Traveller women than in the general population and that this is due to the Traveller-led nature of the health intervention.  Ms O'Donoghue also mentioned that the group is constantly consulted to give advice but that while there is consultation, when it shifts to Traveller-led services, it changes.</p><p>How can this model be developed for further inclusion and development within the HSE in respect of other forms of Traveller healthcare?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#J00200"><p>I will call the representatives of the HSE in the order in which questions were asked of them.  If the witnesses from the ICGP wish to respond, they may come in as well.  I will also give Ms O'Donoghue and Ms McGrath an opportunity to answer the questions put to them by Senator Ruane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#J00300"><p>I thank the Senator for her questions, the first of which related to culturally appropriate services.  There are two or three parts to our approach in this regard.  The Traveller primary care health projects are co-designed with Travellers as part of an approach to health services, or health service pathways, that is led by Travellers.  This is not a health service in itself; it is a location where Travellers can help other people within the community to access health services in their areas.  My colleague, Ms de Brun, will give further details on that in a moment.  The other role of the Traveller health units is to produce culturally appropriate materials that are co-designed with the Traveller community, are tailored to meet people's needs and have messages that are suited to the Traveller population.  This is not about setting up a separate health service; it is about ensuring the services we provide through the health services are as accessible as possible to the Traveller community.  The different Traveller health units take a prioritised approach.  They may prioritise particular actions, for example relating to chronic diseases or screening programmes, in different areas.  The HSE materials are designed to be appropriate to and supportive of the Traveller community.  I ask Ms de Brun to talk about cultural awareness training.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.350" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#J00500"><p>We will come back to that.</p></speech>

If one has a strong Traveller health unit, more of one's staff will be trained.  Our new health plan includes a commitment to improve our cultural awareness training.  We rely heavily on the peer support workers in the Traveller primary healthcare projects to provide culturally appropriate training.  All staff who attend and sit with Traveller health units have participated in cultural awareness training.  In addition, we culture-proof and literacy-proof anything we co-design or deliver alongside our cultural awareness training.  We do not develop any materials without working in partnership with the Traveller community.  All small local projects that are achieving or are doing very well are brought to the regional network and the learning is disseminated among the peer support workers in that network.  Models of good practice then come to the national Traveller health advisory forums.  One of the projects we are working on at the moment is the national mental health promotion training programme, which is a "train the trainer" programme.  Twenty trainers have been trained as part of the pilot and we are ready to try to roll it out.  The project was co-designed by members of the Traveller community and mental health staff.  I will set out where we are falling down with our work.  We probably need a much more robust framework to ensure culturally appropriate training is given to people beyond primary care and not just in the primary care and social inclusion services where the Travellers are located.  I accept we need to do more with other care directorates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#J00700"><p>I ask Ms McArdle to speak about budgets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#J00800"><p>We always want more money.  The &euro;10 million allocation for primary care services is going into the structure we have described.  Each year, including this year, we have applied for additional funding under social inclusion.  Each year, we receive small amounts of funding in addition to that &euro;10 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  We would welcome any increase in funding.  We know there has been a dedicated increase in funding for Traveller mental health initiatives.</p><p>However, the Traveller primary healthcare units model we have described has real potential to be used to assist the wider care group.  For instance, the same group of people is being asked to work on health promotion or mental health initiatives.  Additional investment in the area would help us to increase capacity, allow us to sustain the number of people working in the area and help us to grow and expand the work that is being done.  We would welcome any such increase.  We do a lot with what we have.  We outlined in our statement the wide range of initiatives being carried out through our projects and the Traveller healthcare units nationally.  That demonstrates very good progress and outcomes for the amount of money we have.  We acknowledge that we are not there yet; this is a journey.  We would welcome any further investment.</p><p> The Senator asked about a siloed approach.  It is important to state that the network or structure we have described is not about a replacement or siloed health service but, rather, about having a place where we can support people to access health services.  It is not a separate service.  The aim is to ensure that people from all communities, including the Traveller community, are enabled to access health services.  Our data show that the value of the Traveller networks and projects is that many people from the Traveller community rely on them as their first point of contact because they trust the information provided by their peers.  That is a very important part of health service delivery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#K00200"><p>On silos and a lack of proper access to health services, one of the big questions for me is how we address the historical marginalisation and racism that has impacted on the community.  I work in counties Cork and Kerry and have the privilege of working with some of the other delegates who are present.  Silos can occur and people can be left out or marginalised further.  If we wish to address the marginalisation of the community, we must take two approaches, namely, a targeted approach and a mainstream approach.  Those types of approaches run the risk of becoming worse or siloed unless there is genuine commitment to Traveller leadership, Traveller voice and community development through an empowering model.  Those of us in the HSE must listen when we are told that we are getting it wrong or that the Traveller community has an approach which it knows works within its community.  It is always very important to explore such options.  One can look at the issue through equality frameworks and analyse whether the targeted work we are doing is genuine or indirectly creating worse situations.  The latter is something we never want to happen.  It is a very good question.  In counties Cork and Kerry, we try to work from a community development approach.  We do not view the social determinants of health as aspects of health that are outside the control of the HSE but, rather, try to work closely and, it is to be hoped, respectfully with Traveller organisations in the area to see what we can do to address the health inequalities caused by discrimination, lack of education or poor accommodation.  We explore whether there is something we can do to influence these factors or ensure the voices of various groups are heard.  People have differing understandings of these matters.  It is a very good question.  There are many ways we can ensure that, rather than creating another silo, we genuinely address historical marginalisation.</p></speech>

As the Senator is probably aware, a Traveller health needs assessment was published in July of this year.  Some 99% of the Traveller community has registered with a GP and 98% has a medical card, which is encouraging.  However, it is not just about having a medical card; it is about accessing services and turning up for healthcare, preventative services and acute services.</p><p>In that same report, it is detailed that 83% access care with their GP even though 98% have the medical card, only 57% attend hospitals and less than 5% attend the mental health services.  Therefore, it is not just about having access to the medical card, but we would agree that all members of the Traveller community should have medical cards.  We have heard the shocking statistics about the mortality, life expectancy and suicide rates.  It is just shocking.  To think that group of patients in society would not have medical cards would be appalling and we would support all members of the Traveller community automatically having medical cards.  Those who do not have medical cards would not be turned away or refused access to services.  We all work in an out-of-hours service and we work in our practices and nobody is turned away because they do not have the means of paying for the service.  If somebody has a medical need, they will be seen.  That is my experience and that would be the experience of all my colleagues.  Medical card access is important but access to the services that are available is also important.<br/><br/>The Senator asked if we are doing enough in working with the HSE and in working to address prejudices.  I have a son who has started his four years of general practice training.  We have a core curriculum in the college, and within that core curriculum we have several learning outcomes that specifically address the problems of the Traveller community.  I brought that document in and I could read some of those outcomes to the Senator but we have several learning outcomes such as:</p><blockquote>Understand the consulting behaviours of specific marginal groups - homeless, travelers&rsquo; drug users, new communities etc...  Be aware of cultural diversity between the Irish settled community and those from other cultures...  Address prejudicial attitudes and discriminating behaviour that they and practice staff might have towards marginalized groups...  Be sensitive to the differing cultural needs of non-Irish patients and travellers.</blockquote><p>We have others as well.</p></speech>

For me, this is the same with teachers.  One can sit in a classroom and look at matters theoretically all day long but it does not mean a doctor or a teacher or anybody who has that level of understanding and empathy with the trauma of a particular community will be produced.  Should a core curriculum always be matched with GPs in training having to spend time in the communities in which they will serve?  Should they train directly with Traveller organisations and with the working class communities to understand the social context, rather than just learning in a classroom?</p></speech>

Hopefully, by being mentored by those of us who have been in practice for a long time and who have been working in the community with our patients, they will take on the objectives we have put down in our core curriculum.</p></speech>

It is about the promotion of it and the acceptance that it is working right now and protecting it.  We are looking at primary healthcare workers who are at the end of their rope.

The problem is that we do not have enough primary healthcare workers.  That is the biggest issue.</p></speech>

Like Dr. Favier said earlier, it is about helping and supporting Travellers not only to have a medical card but also to retain it.  Going back to the postal service, people on sites are not getting the notices that their medical card is up for appeal or renewal and then before they realise, their medical card is gone.  There is need for real support around that and maybe more long-term medical cards for Travellers.</p></speech>

I will follow on from Senator Ruane because it was something I was thinking about as well as regards mainstreaming cultural awareness training.  Dr. Favier mentioned in her presentation that it should be mainstreamed, which means it is not at the minute.  Perhaps we should think about making interdepartmental and cross-agency training available to everybody who encounters the Traveller community in their walk of life, whether they are teachers, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, doctors or whatever.  That might help to address that issue so that people would understand if, for instance, someone turns up for one meeting but does not appear again afterwards.  Would that kind of all-encompassing approach work?</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue referred to people missing appointments and losing important documents because their addresses are not fixed.  The housing issue is very complex, but if that could be sorted out, that would get to the root of it.  Everything else will flow if we can sort out the housing issue.  There seems to be a lot of money available for housing but in identifying need, has a proper analysis been conducted on the type of housing that is required?  I know Travellers who are settled.  They are in a house and they are very happy there.  I know other Travellers who are part of a group housing scheme, for example, and who like to move in the summer or whenever.  There are others for whom movement is what it is all about and they cannot think of staying in one place.  How do we identify how much housing is needed?  Has any work been done on that?  In respect of architects and people who design accommodation, has an analysis been conducted on whether there should be training for them as well?  I am thinking of when they are required to design group housing and how they would do that in order that it would fit into the landscape and so on.  Is that being done or should it be done?</p> <p>  On the HSE, it is great to hear the kind of connections it is making with people and that much of what the executive is doing is informed by consultation.  I also acknowledge the frustration of the witnesses that everybody is not aware of the type of information they need to deal effectively with members of the Travelling community.  How could that be improved within the HSE or do the witnesses see that deficiency in other organisations?</p></speech>

I mentioned the postal service and people not receiving their mail.  That is just one example.  Travellers live in the present.  Sometimes their personal appointments can be put on the back burner, especially in view of what is going on around them at the time.</p> <p>  Regarding accommodation, a member mentioned that there seems to be money around, and there always has been.  Fortunately, funding has never been a problem for us.  For the past 20-odd years, we, as a Traveller organisation, have made submissions to the five-year Traveller accommodation programmes in our local area.  We have always included a needs assessment for the area in those submissions.  One of those recommendations has been transient sites, which work very well in other countries.  I refer to Traveller needs.  Some Travellers are quite happy to be in a standard house, some are happy to be in a halting site while others are happy in a group housing scheme.  Approximately 95% of Travellers in Cork are in local authority housing or rented accommodation but that is not by choice.  We have argued for years in our submissions that the preferred choice of accommodation of Travellers is halting sites, transient sites or Traveller-specific group housing schemes.  Unfortunately, our submissions went to the wind at the best of times.  However, I have been delivering Traveller culture awareness training to student architects in University College Cork for the past five or six years, particularly addressing Traveller-specific accommodation.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  There are brilliant and workable Traveller-specific schemes throughout the country.  The fact that there are so few of them keeps us in crisis all the time, particularly where accommodation needs are concerned.</p></speech>

There is great potential for cultural awareness training on many issues, not just those concerning Travellers.  It would be appropriate in many different fora.  However, the best evidence would have to be applied.  That evidence shows that this training should always be provided using resources delivered by those who are affected, in this case Traveller groups themselves.  In any other niche type of education, the evidence always indicates that this is how the education is best provided, whether in the context of an undergraduate setting, GP training or in postgraduate education in which the ICGP is involved.</p> <p>  I also refer to the issue of accommodation and resources.  I have been involved in Traveller health for the best part of 20 years as a GP.  I can attest that accommodation issues have been front and centre in the past five to eight years.  It has so much to do with housing, but it is also about austerity in a wider context.  Resourcing issues are manifest in a lack of GPs, with new GPs leaving and not enough being trained.  As a result there is a shortage of appointments.  Vulnerable patients, who are more likely to need walk-in services or may default from an appointment and need to be offered another one in a timely fashion, can no longer be accommodated.  Patients wait a week to get an appointment with me.  There is very little flexibility because of a shortage of GPs and a shortage of training.  Other austerity measures, for example, concerning medical cards have disproportionately affected Travellers.  The validation of medical card lists is done in a broad sweep.  A cardholder can receive paperwork with which to check his or her medical card even though it was renewed and a new plastic card issued only three months previously.  This disproportionately affects Travellers who do not receive the correspondence.</p></speech>

We spend substantial time chasing and renewing them.  There are disproportionate effects and the effect on accommodation is highly pertinent because it brings significant health risks.  Some 80% of Travellers live in non-winter-proofed accommodation, leading to more condensation and respiratory illnesses.  It also contributes to the infant mortality rate and to later presentations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  Travellers in such accommodation live in fuel poverty and spend disproportionate amounts trying to heat inappropriate accommodation, which has a knock-on effect on presentations to general practice.  Unless we address these systemic and ingrained problems, everything will have a knock-on effect and this always means the most vulnerable in society, of which Travellers are part, are disproportionately affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#O00300"><p>My question is for the ICGP.  I was on the Sl&aacute;intecare committee and we discussed GP accessibility and the number of GPs relative to the population, which has been affected by austerity.  It means the most vulnerable people are left at the end of the queue.  My own partner had to wait a week and a half for an appointment in the primary healthcare unit in our area.  This affects certain people in the Traveller community even more.  Not only do letters go to different addresses but postmen sometimes do not go into a halting site.  What do Dr. Favier and Dr. Cox think is needed?  I have tabled questions on GP training and the numbers going through the colleges.  We can talk about services for the Traveller and Roma communities but we need to know what it will all cost.  Will this committee or this Parliament insist that the necessary money be given to provide these services?  Funding for services for the Traveller community has not increased for the past ten years.  We are hoping for crumbs off the table in the shape of the Dormant Accounts Fund to do work the witnesses do in the area of social inclusion.</p> <p>  This committee needs to identify the issues and address them with funding.  The all-Ireland Traveller health study found that 90.3% of children were reported as having problems, with asthma the most common condition.  What needs to be put in place to deal with that and how much will it cost?  Can the services be integrated into other services?  The HSE submission and questions from Pavee Point referred to jobs in primary healthcare projects.  Members of the Traveller community work between six and 12 hours a week and do not have pensions.  We will have to examine how many nurses will be needed to play the critical role between the community and the primary care units, and how much will be needed to fund them.  It could mean that more than &euro;10 million will be needed.  It is not good enough to have studies, programmes and assessments without getting down to the nitty-gritty and match the needs with money.  The responsibility lies with Departments and other bodies.</p></speech>

On the role of support workers, we recognise they are part-time and that there is a barrier to sustaining and retaining people long term in those roles and attracting new people to the role of project workers with respect to the lack of a career structure.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Ms De Brun who will outline the new initiatives being taken to develop a career structure and support people in their education and development in order that we can embed this model in the way primary care services are delivered.</p></speech>

We would not be able to deliver the services without them.  The peer support model works.  However, as it has developed and grown since 1994, it has been stuck in a social protection, poverty culture.  I do not say that lightly.  A person would be reluctant to take up a full-time job if it would affect their medical card eligibility.  Recent increases in the minimum wage resulted in some workers not having their medical cards renewed because they were over the income threshold.  The option for them, therefore, was to reduce their hours and, thus, their income, to retain their medical card or to leave.  The infrastructure on which all the successful work has been done proves that it works but it needs investment in planning for the delivery of existing and future services.</p> <p>  Another element to the start of this investment has been our work in partnership with Pavee Point and Maynooth University to deliver pre-capacity training through 100 hours of education.  I understand the interviews for members of the Traveller community to participate in that course in the university are taking place today.  We are hopeful 15 members of the Traveller community will achieve a FETAC level 5 to level 6 standard in their first year and that this time next year, they will start a FETAC level 8 qualification course.  The HSE has committed to finding the people who complete that course meaningful grade 4 minimum salary posts.  We ask the committee to examine other Departments and statutory bodies following suit on this as a broader range of posts need to be made available.  While we started this process with Maynooth University in providing training in youth and community work through a five-year plan, a big picture approach needs to be taken under the public sector duty heading to ensure Travellers are employed across all Departments and statutory agencies.  </p> <p>  It is important all Departments participate in intercultural health and training.  The HSE is providing intercultural health, which the Deputy availed of with respect to the south east group.   While we offer it, it is not mandatory.  However, if one is in any way committed, one will do it.  </p> <p>  We have worked closely with the ICGP and the school of nursing and midwifery to ensure culturally appropriate training as well as racism and discrimination training are part of the core curriculum.  Those relationships in developing that work date back 20 years.  Professionals receive that accredited module when they come into the system but we need to examine if there is more we can do and more we can offer.  We are heavily reliant on Traveller and healthcare projects to deliver that training.</p></speech>

We have taken 194 young doctors into the four-year GP training programme.  We had aimed to take in more than 200 and the ultimate aim in the next one to two years is to take in up to 240 but even if we had 240 doctors in training, that would just about address the turnover.  GPs are getting a little older and it is becoming increasingly more challenging to encourage younger GPs to stay in general practice or to work in general practice full-time.  They do not seem to like the idea of working in isolated, single-handed practices.  Only 2% of them in a recent survey said that this is what they wanted to do.</p><p>They like to have a blended career where they work in hospitals and universities as well as in general practice.  That is a challenge to try to get the number in training up to where it needs to be.  We need approximately 5,000 GPs in the GMS.  We do not have that; we have approximately 3,500.  We have approximately 1,800 practice nurses but we need at least 4,000 and perhaps even 5,000 because a practice nurse is an essential part of the community care team and the practice team.</p><p> Reference was made to chronic disease management and asthma, in particular.  There is a programme of care for children aged zero to six but that is just a GP visit card that entitles them to the services of a doctor.  It does not entitle them to other services outside that.  A GP visit card is a bit of a joke in terms of accessing all the services that are needed and to which everyone should have access.  That is something we are concerned about.  We are trying to set up a practice nurse training programme to encourage more to come into the service and we are trying to establish that with an academic body in Dublin.  We approached Sl&aacute;intecare and the HSE for support on that.  We are trying to grow our GP numbers and practice nurse numbers because they are an essential part of the healthcare provision in the community.</p><p> As members will probably be aware, there will be a chronic disease management programme for the older age group starting next year.  There was a recent agreement in that regard.  That is due to launch early in the new year.  It is chronic disease management for respiratory disease in general, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  It will start with the over-75s and as the years go by, that will be extended to the lower age groups.  The next group will be those aged between 65 and 74 and so on.</p></speech>

It would be helpful for us to have a quantification of the resources for this group, as sought by Deputy Joan Collins.  Perhaps the ICGP could provide the information.  Are there any Travellers who are GPs or nurses and are there any measures in place to bridge that gap between people in the profession and those who aspire to get into those lines of work?</p></speech>

For historical and complicated reasons, Travellers tend to congregate and coalesce in their living circumstances in areas that are deprived.  That is usually to do with circumstances such as where halting sites are placed or allowed or where they have been illegal.  Areas of high urban deprivation have specific needs.  There is a very easy win in terms of providing cohorts of funding to those particular general practices.  There has been some move towards that in recent funding streams but it needs to be substantially higher.  Travellers are part of the population for GPs in areas of blanket deprivation, as opposed to pocket deprivation, and we need to have more GPs in those areas and they need to take more time.</p></speech>

It would allow flexibility of appointments and a little wriggle room.  It would allow staff to take more time to fill in the form for patients who do not have literacy skills.  There needs to be an understanding and awareness that one just needs to allow a little bit more slack.  That is not just the case for Traveller patients but for many patients who are challenged in those areas.  More funding would very quickly provide a win-win.</p></speech>

I do not know of any GPs or doctors.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to what was said about the price tag and the closing of the gap.  We have two full-time equivalent primary healthcare workers in Cork city, who work part time.  We have four workers who work part time.  It is not enough.  We are not reaching all of our community and we are not able to do enough for the community.  What we have is a good number of people that we have trained over the years who have done development courses but they do not have academic skills that would allow them to go for a job interview.  They have not been to UCC.</p><p>I would always be one to bat for experience.  I am referring to where somebody with lived experience of certain circumstances cannot work with people in such circumstances because he or she does not have an academic qualification.  For us, that is a major challenge at present.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#R00900"><p>The first question I have is to seek information.  Some like to go to support workers of their own sex when seeking advice and so on.  Are there many more women than men acting as Traveller-led support workers?  I suspect so.  Is it working better with women?  Do we need to ensure more men are engaged as support workers to get men to engage?  I do not know the answers; I am taking the questions out of the sky.  Obviously, we want to get all Travellers to engage with the health services.  Is there a disparity between the number of women engaging and the number of men engaging through Traveller-led services?  Is there a disparity between the number of women leading the services and the number of men leading them?  We need to examine this.  The delegates might tell me whether this is an issue.</p> <p>  I always believe in taking something positive from any meeting.  Many very interesting issues can be raised, and many good suggestions have been made.  I wish to focus on an issue that keeps coming up, namely, the bureaucracy encountered in gaining access to a medical card.  The medical card office is the most unforgiving in the country for anybody dealing with it.  It is utterly unforgiving.  If one does not answer a letter within a 28-day deadline, one must start all over again on the 29th day.  People lose heart as a consequence.  Those who are most remote from the system lose heart fastest.</p> <p>  I am interested in getting a little more feedback on the number of Travellers who are issued with letters but who do not act on them because they have moved on or who throw them aside because they are removed from the system.  Many people, including settled people, throw them aside also. The more removed a person is from the system, the more likely it is that the letter will be thrown aside as a bother and will be forgotten about.  In such circumstances, a person will go to the general practitioner only to be told the card has expired.  How significant is this issue?</p> <p>  I will go through all my questions.  The second issue I wish to raise concerns the statistics we have been given.  They indicate that 13% of Travellers finish secondary school and that 57% of male Travellers only get a primary education.  Ordinary literacy skills, such as reading and writing, are an issue.  We all come across this.  The older the cohort, the greater the issue.  It matters when trying to fill out a complicated medical card form and such documentation.  Is there information and evidence indicating people simply give up?</p> <p>  I do not believe this has just to do with ordinary literacy skills.  We often ignore what I call bureaucratic literacy skills.  This involves a higher level of skill.  I know a Department that made a very clever move in this regard.  Where a form was developed on one side of the Department, clerical officers or executive officers on the other side were asked whether they could fill it out without knowing what it was about.  If, with their bureaucratic literacy skills, they could not fill it out, it was no good giving it to a member of the ordinary public, or even a member of the public with third level education.</p><p>I wonder to what extent there is a problem with the two levels of literary skill.   I refer, in particular, to what I call the bureaucratic literary skill, that is, for form filling and so on.  I have been contacted by all sorts of people who find filling forms to be increasingly challenging.  To what extent is accessing documents a problem?  The volume of documentation required nowadays for the simplest tasks is frightening.  I spent a fair bit of time yesterday with somebody who wanted a supplementary grant for a house.  The person is a Traveller who was trying to provide information.  It seems that the system is more concerned with catching one person who might get something he or she should not get than the 1,000 people who might have got that to which they were perfectly entitled but just could not get the paperwork together.  Society seems to have become rigid in that regard.</p><p> I do not know how many people have studied the medical guidelines, although they may have done if they deal with medical cards.  There are two ways in which one can obtain a medical card, the first of which is according to strict financial guidelines.  I heard a case yesterday of a 65 year old who happens not to own their own house.  A Traveller could own a caravan, however, and would have no rent.  The guidelines, even for those over the age of 65 years, specify maximum weekly earnings of &euro;298.  Even on jobseeker's allowance, the basic rate is higher than that.  I am sure our guests will tell me that without means, one can obtain the card on a concession, but the guideline figures are very low.  The normal ways they help people are with mortgages; rent, although if one has a caravan, that does not count; and childcare, although in some cases the parents take care of the children and do not pay for commercial childcare.  The only other way of obtaining a medical card is in the form of a discretionary one, but the applicant will have to be good with a pen to know what is an eligible expense for a discretionary card.  I am highlighting the barriers.</p><p> When we take it all together, to what extent is the medical card challenge an issue?  One receives a nice little plastic card with a date on it.  If a credit card has a date, I know that it will be good until then.  In the case of a medical card, however, it might specify an expiry date of 2021 but halfway through 2019, I might be told I will be called for a random check.  How much of a help would it be if the cards were issued for five years and the expiry date was the expiry date, unless one could be proven to have defrauded on a massive scale one's entitlement to a medical card?  As the man says, the medical card is not worth all that much.</p><p> The issue of Traveller self-identification was raised.  The concept is nice but I can see the layers of bureaucracy that will apply.  There are two problems with self-identification, on which I would like our guests' views.  People do not necessarily want to self-identify.  Some do but others do not.  Some are proud but others are not.  Some feel cowed because of what life has taught them.  The other point is I can imagine the HSE adding another five pages to the forms to tie one up in that regard.</p><p> If our guests consider some of the issues I have raised to be valid, would it be worth our while asking the medical card section to appear before the committee and take a grilling on the issues?  That is my punchline.  Are our guests facing such issues and if so, should we present those issues to representatives of the medical card section?  I am sure our guests could raise other issues.</p></speech>

It would be a good idea to make such an invitation and the clerk to the committee and I have discussed it.  In the meantime, while we wait for the invitation to be made, could our guests comment on some of the barrier issues, such as to men accessing healthcare and the bureaucratic barrier we have discussed at length?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Favier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019110500002#S00300"><p>It is well established that all female patients consult their doctor more often than men, whether because of their own health issues or because they bring children and other family members to the doctor.</p><p>That is particularly true in the Traveller community because there are particular cultural barriers for Traveller men accessing the services.  It is an issue of which we must be aware.  Those barriers can range from sitting in the waiting room through to, for example, presenting to younger female doctors.  Those are cultural issues and it is for us, as GPs, to be aware of those issues, attempt to circumvent them and understand cultural issues around not wishing to present with mental health issues, for instance.  </p><p> We have recently rolled out a suicide prevention training programme that has involved almost 500 GPs and a particular part of that relates to the increased risk of suicide in the Traveller community and the issues for men presenting with mental health problems.</p><p> The access to services and educational opportunities for women in the Traveller community have come on extraordinarily in the past 20 years.  There has been a massive change and Traveller men are only starting to catch up from a health point of view, which is to be welcomed.</p><p> Bureaucracy issues fall disproportionately on the women because they often have to deal with trying to sort out all the medical cards and keep on the top of the paperwork and appointments.  As GPs, we would value clarification on the medical card issues because patients can present with a valid, brand new plastic card that is not valid.  Practices such as ours are long established and we know the patients well so there are many workarounds but in out-of-hours and GP on-call services, that is a fundamental problem.  Situations arise where there are tensions around patients presenting without cards, who has a card and who does not, and whether a card is valid.  It needs to be sorted out.</p><p> The bureaucracy issues apply on so many levels in respect of literacy.  There is a need for cultural awareness that form filling should not be done just for the sake of it.  The centralisation of services to what we call the offices off the M50 has proved problematic for patients and is challenging for GPs.  We meet significant literacy skill issues in the area of health bureaucracy.  There are problems that could be quickly solved, which would make everybody happier.</p></speech>

I am always cheered to hear anyone say that an issue would be easy to deal with and that will not only be a recommendation but an action for the committee.  I thank Dr. Favier.  Would anybody else like to comment on the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v?</p></speech>

I know of Traveller families whose first child turned 16 and, until then, had been part of the parents' application form.  It becomes a whole new ball game and application form at that stage.  Every document that is needed has to be copied.  It is a frightening and traumatic experience for some Travellers who have no literacy in their family.  It is a process that is repeated over and over again.</p> <p>  On the question about support work for Traveller women and men, the Traveller Visibility Group has a Traveller men's health development worker and he has a number of men's groups around the city.  There are not as many of those as there are Traveller women's groups but there are some and those men are looking for more information and development courses.  Men are still very much behind but, as Dr. Favier said, we are seeing them catch up a bit.</p></speech>

For every four workers, there is probably only one man and even that has only happened in the past five to six years.  We have begun to engage with men and get them in the door but we are way behind in comparison with the experience within primary healthcare projects for women Travellers.</p><p>One is in a situation where one is discussing sensitive information about people&rsquo;s personal lives.  One is not just going to go to anybody.  We have a situation where we are upskilling and engaging more young Traveller men.  We also need the older Traveller men in there but they are a little more difficult to reach.  We have not given up and we are trying.</p></speech>

Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Reilly has a good example of this in that it is not just gender that can be a barrier but age as well.  There is some good work happening in Kerry and in other projects where, having engaged older project workers, they are reaching out to older people and looking at the more specific issues to do with ill health in the older members of the Traveller community.</p></speech>

We have a mental health primary healthcare worker in Kerry.  It is still true, sadly, that members of the Traveller community do not reach the same age as my father did of 87.  The death rate is shocking.  In the Kerry project, they have started a small project with one community healthcare worker who is a woman.  She is doing community health in a slightly different way.  She visits the other people who deem themselves to be the older members of their community.  They share information and do many kinds of different things that might have happened in the club in the past.  Apparently, this has been quite successful for encouraging people who are not well to go to hospital.</p> <p>  Two male primary healthcare workers also work specifically with national organisations such as Pavee Point looking at the issues facing men&rsquo;s health, how best to respond to that and to support Traveller men.</p></speech>

The Traveller health units ensure all information is culturally appropriate, uses plain English and involves service users in the Traveller community in designing forms or information that will help people access health services.  This has been found to be successful.  We would again like to scale this up and use it in other parts of the health service to ensure people are enabled to access the range of health services.</p></speech>

I suspect it goes under the radar to a certain degree.  Where there is desperation and lack of hope, what usually follows is substance abuse.  I can say that from my own experience living in Clondalkin.</p></speech>

Taking a mental health promotion approach, the Small Changes - Big Difference programme has been a positive initiative in the Traveller community and through the Traveller health units to try to address both building awareness of substance abuse and misuse, and the causative relationship to mental health and to more serious addiction issues.  Through the national Traveller advisory forum, there was the development of culturally appropriate mental health materials to support positive mental health initiatives, which would include information on addiction and substance misuse.  Over the past two to three years there has been a positive uptake through the project on that and building awareness of the relationship between those behaviours and the impact then on health.  I ask Ms de Brun to provide more detail.</p></speech>

We do not have them to hand.  There is an ethnic identifier.  The centre can identify the number of Travellers attending its services, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  We rely on local relationships with the drugs task forces to deliver local needs approaches within the services.  For example, the drugs task force in Clondalkin has worked very closely with Travellers there to develop a culturally appropriate response to counselling.  We hope we will get the money to fund that soon.  The background to that is that it is counselling for people who are affected by alcohol and substance misuse in particular.  That model represents a local response.  We would like to see other Traveller health units engage with their drugs task forces and that moneys for addiction services would be invested in a similar way but we are not there yet.</p></speech>

At least 50% of Traveller men in our area, Cork city, have turned to alcohol and substance misuse.  We have made direct links between that and the loss of Traveller culture.  Travellers no longer living on halting sites or within the extended families, Travellers who have ended up in homeless services and felt very isolated, and Travellers who are using our service are telling us that their culture has gone and they have nothing to cling on to.  All their norms and traditions are gone and substance abuse is making up for that.</p> <p>  We have a brilliant Traveller counselling service.  Thomas McCann is a Traveller man who runs a counselling service.  Is that the answer?  Travellers in general do not use services.  I do not know if it is right to provide more services until we know what types of services are needed.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to read through the documentation prior the meeting.  I was held up at a meeting in my constituency.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  The ongoing engagement is really important.</p> <p>  We have touched on health literacy, something that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills has examined in terms of educational outcomes for vulnerable groups.  Representatives of the Traveller community took part in that.  In about three weeks time we will also look at issues relating to literacy.</p><p>We will include health literacy in that, as opposed to just literacy.  That is really important. It was really positive to see from the submissions that the Traveller community has workers working so well within the community.  They said it was hard to recruit the Traveller health workers although they seem to be doing a really good job.  It was very interesting to see that number of Traveller women going for BreastCheck and the test for cervical cancer is far higher than the number in the settled community.  Are there lessons to be learned from that about how it was possible to encourage women to go for these important tests that we all need to do?  Are there lessons to be applied to other aspects of Traveller health to encourage them to get involved?  I take the point that there was more success in respect of Traveller women's health and those lessons need to be applied to the men.  </p></speech>

The majority of the workers are on between eight and 12 hours, to retain their medical cards.  We take a very proactive approach to health literacy.  Most of the work that we do with the Traveller primary healthcare projects is literacy proofed.  We work very closely to try to get where possible accreditation through the FETAC system.  Much of what we do is rooted in education.  We need to be sure that we have the right people at the table when we are developing programmes in partnership with each other.  We also call in experts.  When we worked with the Asthma Society of Ireland we would have had doctors and nurses and specialists in diabetes at the table.  We would not have gone off to do it ourselves.</p> <p>  If there was to be investment in this model because it works, the question would be whether services would need to be enhanced in primary care as well as improving the terms and conditions for the workers and if investment needed for men's health as well because only one-fifth or fewer of those workers are men.  It is then a matter of considering the work coming through on mental health, health and well-being and other care groups and how to enhance that work by expanding that model.    </p></speech>

Our statistics in the Traveller population are second to none and we are beavering away at the men's screening programme where we have overachieved on our targets this year but we still have more work to do with the Traveller men.  That peer support model could easily be replicated for regeneration board areas of deprivation in all urban and rural areas.  The peer support model works.  Where there are poor health outcomes for other economically disadvantaged groups the learning that the Traveller community has could easily be shared.</p></speech>

Accessing addiction services is then very challenging and difficult.  The Traveller community and the community in general are resistant to accessing addiction services.  As a GP on the ground, I would appeal for more access to addiction services.  I really feel that is a challenge and there is a gap there.</p></speech>

Several meetings are clashing.</p> <p>  It is great that there is such good feedback on the model.  While we all need to ensure there is awareness and information, funding will be the biggest issue.  There is a good model that the witnesses know they can work with and pass on to other counties, but where will the funding come from?  Have the witnesses been in talks with the HSE or other agencies?  Funding is crucial.  Do the witnesses have proposals for this?  Have they talked to other agencies about rolling it out across the country?</p></speech>

The 27 primary Traveller primary healthcare projects are in every county.  There is a Traveller health unit across every part of the CHOs.  They were developed initially for primary healthcare, incorporating things like health promotion and accessing GP services.  In more recent years we have moved towards looking at specific targeted approaches.  For instance, on the basis of the all-Ireland health survey, there have been targeted approaches to identify the chronic health conditions driving morbidity and lowering life expectancy.  Even more recently we have looked at mental health.</p> <p>  The challenge is that we are still looking at the same cohort of staff within those projects.  The ask for us is investment.  Every year we make applications to the Government for expansion of those services.  We have seen investment in mental health services for members of the Traveller community, but it is only the start.  There is need for further investment to ensure that the good models that work in primary care can be expanded across other care groups to ensure that the different members of the Traveller community - not just the women who are supporting their children's health particularly, but also men and older people in all age groups - are attracted to working within and providing supports for the community.</p></speech>

Many areas are looking for funding and cannot get it even with the existing model.  There are different types of models and some areas have more funding than others.  It is like everything: funding will go to one area quicker than to another.  In my area funding is crucial.  Mental health is a major issue as are life expectancy and homelessness - an area I address all the time.  We need more funding in these areas; we need more information and awareness.  When fighting a case for someone who is homeless, I find there are no extra services for them.  We are hitting our heads against a stone wall all the time.  I know there is a certain service, but not to the scale needed.  Overall, we need to look at funding.  We need to look at all the areas that need to be addressed.  It is good that it is working in certain areas.  I think it is all down to funding, awareness and information.</p></speech>

We are very limited in our project.  We work with KPIs.  We are very conscious that our funding has to go in certain directions all the time.  We no longer feel that is working.  We need to be able to branch out into different areas.  What we are doing with the primary healthcare programme is great and the care-support workers are brilliant.  However, the problem is with what they are limited in doing.  That is the challenge for us at the moment.</p></speech>

One question, which is for the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE, in particular, is whether you think there is prejudice among HSE staff and GPs towards Travellers.  What is your honest opinion on that?  What happens when that arises?  Are the appropriate measures, such as disciplinary action and so on, followed through?</p> <p>  The second question is a very practical one.  We had the Department of Health in two weeks ago, and it said it was down to the HSE to publish the health action plan.  Is that the HSE's understanding of that?  When is that going to come out?</p> <p>  Do you accept there is a Traveller health crisis?  When would you expect Traveller health and the general population's health to be one and the same?  Will it be in two years, five years, ten years or 20 years?  I do not mind who answers those questions and in what order, but I would like to hear from you all.</p></speech>

At a local level, if that comes back to a public health nurse or people say it is there, there are good local working relationships and generally people will share that experience and it can be addressed at a local level.  The training programmes are the key, both in educating our healthcare professionals and in maintaining and ensuring that people are regularly getting cultural awareness training.  In terms of data around specific incidence of prejudice, I do not have that data.  It is certainly something we can look at.</p></speech>

There is legislation to protect against discrimination, and that certainly would be enforced.  We would support service users, or any member of the population who experiences prejudice or discrimination in the way they access services, to ensure it is brought to our attention.  I do not have that data, but we can certainly find out for the committee if that would be of use.  The training approach would be the known way.</p></speech>

We know there is a gap, and we know what we need to do to address it.  Changes that look at population change, or demographic change, take a longer period of time than three to five years.  We are talking about a generation.  However, we know specifically the things that need to happen like uptake in engagement with primary care services in terms of managing chronic disease, engaging with the mental health service to be aware of the services that are available and, at the individual level, supporting each individual to access the health services that are needed.  After that, what that means for the population, trends and data will tell us, but I suppose the specific focus at the moment is that members of the Traveller community, children, adults and older people, know the services are available to them and that they are enabled and facilitated to access those services.</p></speech>

It is well established that they experience it in all aspects of society, particularly in institutions and in the delivery of care.  I am sure it is also their experience in general practice.</p><p>I would like to think that from a general practice point of view, because we tend to be embedded in communities, we know people for extended periods of time.  We know their histories and we know their context and, therefore it is less likely to be an issue, but I cannot say that it does not happen.  We need to accept reality and focus on ways that we can potentially change it.  In terms of ways we can change it, the committee spoke about the health action plan.  We would ask from a general practice point of view that it would be integrated clearly into a primary care and general practice setting and that we would not have this silo, with a glossy brochure, and where implementation would not just be integrated-----</p></speech>

Our first challenge is to make sure they do not get worse.  There has been such a structural undermining of some of the systemic supports, whether it is in the number of primary care workers in the Traveller area, whether it is the medical card issue or whether it is the accommodation crisis.  There are statistically more Travellers who are homeless.  The number is huge.  They all impact in the broadest sense on health outcomes.  That is the most important one.  I imagine it could be 25 years.  Again, I do not have a crystal ball, but it will be incremental, and there has to be an integrated approach.</p></speech>

I am speaking as a Traveller woman who has experienced those prejudices.  I work in a Traveller organisation and I deal with the community on a daily basis and people tell us that they experience those prejudices.</p> <p>  On the national plan, we have concerns that it does not seem to have a pathway and a structure at the moment.  We also think that it can only work if it is in partnership with the likes of the Traveller organisations, the HSE and primary healthcare.</p></speech>

While the facts and figures are stark, there were also very practical ideas and proposals put forward from both sides today, and we would hope to capture that in the report.</p> <p>  Thank you so much for your time this morning.  I hope you feel it was well spent.  We intend it to be and to act on it in big and small ways.</p></speech>

I have noticed when one is talking about disadvantaged groups that they are often patronised as if they did not have the same latent intelligence that the rest of society has.  In certain ways, I have often noticed that they would buy and sell the whole lot of us who are good at pushing pens.  Therefore that real partnership is vital because no one knows it like the Traveller community.  Nobody has actually walked the walk.</p><p>The big challenge for us, as settled people, is to ensure that everybody is treated equally and has an equal input, rather than an agency saying that it consulted and heard what people said in a box-ticking exercise.  It must be a real partnership.  My experience would tell me that is often not the case.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.</p> <p>  The committee will invite representatives of the HSE and Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection back before the committee under the heading of a different module to talk about the whole issue of medical cards, which came up frequently here and seems to be a practical barrier and one we might be able to do something about.  Is that approved?  Approved.  I thank the members of the committee and our guests for their time and energy.</p></speech>
