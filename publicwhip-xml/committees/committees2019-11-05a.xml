    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#F00200"><p>I  thank the committee for inviting the EPA to assist, as appropriate, on the issues affecting the quality of water in Ireland, boil water notices nationally, and the recent boil water notice for parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath, noting that there is now another evolving situation at the plant in question.</p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues from the EPA's office of environmental enforcement, Dr. Michelle Minihan and Mr. Andy Fanning, who is a programme manager in the area.</p> <p>  The EPA is the drinking water quality regulator for public water supplies and works to ensure that drinking water supplied by Irish Water meets the standards of the drinking water regulations so that public water supplies are safe to drink.  Local authorities are the regulators with responsibility for the drinking water quality of private water supplies, if I may make that distinction.  </p> <p>  As the utility supplying public water, Irish Water is responsible for ensuring that public water supplies meet the standards of the drinking water regulations.  Other suppliers including group water schemes and private suppliers are similarly responsible for the drinking water they provide.</p> <p>  The EPA's primary focus is to oversee Irish Water's response to drinking water quality failures.  However the agency also requires Irish Water to take actions to prevent drinking water quality failures from happening in the first place and is working to ensure that investment is prioritised for those water supplies that pose the greatest risk to public health.</p> <p>  Irish Water must notify the EPA of any drinking water quality failures and the agency then oversees Irish Water&rsquo;s investigation and their actions in response to the failure.  As part of the agency's role in drinking water quality investigations, it may audit drinking water supplies and treatment processes, issue legal directions, take legal prosecutions in certain circumstances, or place a water supply on its remedial action list.  The remedial action list was first prepared by the agency in January 2008 and is a dynamic list of public water supplies that the agency has identified as at risk and as priorities for remedial action by Irish Water.</p> <p>  I will briefly address some of the issues affecting the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  In its most recent report on the quality of public drinking water supplied by Irish Water published in September this year, the EPA found that the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards and 99.6% compliance with chemical parameters in 2018.  While this indicates that the majority of public water supplies are safe, further measures are necessary to improve the security of our supplies and avoid long-term boil water notices into the future.  The 2018 report set out a series of issues affecting the quality of the drinking water supplied by Irish Water that require action, namely, ensuring adequate disinfection of treated water, reducing the presence of trihalomethanes, THMs, in treated water, replacing of lead water mains and household pipes, eradicating persistent pesticide failures above the limit set out in the drinking water regulations, and establishing drinking water safety plans for supplies.  These issues have been recognised for a number of years and the EPA has recommended that Irish Water take a strategic national approach to them to prevent further drinking water quality failures.  The report also highlighted that cryptosporidium detections have increased in the past three years.  It was detected in 25 public water supplies in 2018, up from 17 in 2017 and 12 in 2016.</p><p>Cryptosporidium is a parasite found in human or animal waste and, if present in drinking water, can cause persistent diarrhoea.  Illness is often more severe in small children and elderly people and can be very serious in people who are immunocompromised.  If cryptosporidium might be present in a supply, appropriate treatment processes, referred to as a "barrier", must be put in place.  These barriers also serve to address certain other parasites, including giardia, which can give rise to similar illnesses, if consumed.</p><p> Adequate treatment is required at all water supplies where cryptosporidium has been identified as a risk.  It is not enough to have a barrier in place; it must also be properly operated and maintained.  At the end of 2018, the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list, RAL, included 15 supplies with inadequate treatment for cryptosporidium.  The EPA will continue to monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s progress towards ensuring that all supplies have an adequate barrier to cryptosporidium.</p><p> The issuing of a boil water notice is not a statutory function of the EPA but is done by Irish Water or a private water supplier in consultation and agreement with the HSE.  As the environmental regulator of Irish Water, the EPA emphasises that there is a need for boil water notices and other water restrictions, in certain circumstances, to protect human health.  During 2018, 44 boil water notices were in place in 14 counties, affecting more than 97,000 people.  This is an increase compared to 2017, during which 42 boil notices were in place, affecting more than 21,000 people.  The main reason for the increase in the number of people affected is that 65,000 people were on a boil water notice for three days in early 2018 when a disinfection failure occurred at the Vartry reservoir supply.  More than 13,500 people were also affected by 12 precautionary boil water notices issued due to Storm Emma in March 2018.</p><p> It should be noted that a long-term boil water notice is one that is in place on a supply for longer than 30 days.  Of the 44 boil water notices in place during 2018, 26 were short-term notices and were lifted within one month.  Five were long-term notices that were in place for longer than one year.</p><p> I want to turn now to the recent boil water notice affecting parts of counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  In addressing this, I acknowledge this is an evolving situation and, if the Chairman allows, I will say a few further words on the current issues at the conclusion of my statement.</p><p> Irish Water informed the EPA at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October of a mechanical failure at Leixlip water treatment plant, which had occurred on Monday, 21 October.  The EPA participated in a meeting between HSE and Irish Water on the afternoon of Tuesday, 22 October to assess the risk this incident posed to consumers.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council, following consultation and agreement with the HSE, issued a boil water notice.  The boil water notice was a preventative measure and was necessary to ensure that public health was protected and consumers were not at risk from cryptosporidium or giardia, the microscopic parasites that can cause illness.</p><p> On Thursday, 24 October, EPA inspectors conducted an audit at Leixlip water treatment plant.  The purpose of the audit was to establish the full facts of the incident and the corrective actions taken.  It was also to verify the performance of Leixlip water treatment plant and to assist in gathering the information to facilitate the lifting of the boil water notice.  EPA inspectors also reviewed the recommendations of the agency's previous audit of 22 March 2019 and assessed the implementation of the actions taken to address those recommendations.</p><p>In the audit, the EPA inspectors found the incident began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October, and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October, when remedial works restored the affected production line.  The water treatment plant appears to have operated satisfactorily between 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October and the current issue emerging.  There was sampling of treated water for cryptosporidium and giardia in the critical period before, during and after this incident.  These samples indicated that the quality of water supplied following restoration of the production line was satisfactory.  A blockage in the coagulant dosing line resulted in operational difficulties with the water treatment processes and gave rise to elevated turbidity levels in treated water.  The elevated turbidity levels in treated water indicated a significant risk to the safety of the water supply because the treatment barrier for the removal of cryptosporidium and giardia was compromised and there was a risk of breakthrough of microscopic parasites into the water supply.  There was a failure to respond to multiple alarms that activated in response to the elevated turbidity.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council implemented automatic plant shutdown for the whole plant when turbidity alarms were not responded to within 15 minutes on 24 October 2019, the day of the audit.</p><p> While the Leixlip water treatment plant was resorted to a satisfactorily operating status following the incident, the level of treatment at this plant is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water, as further evidenced by the emerging situation.  In particular, there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Filter upgrade works are under way to reduce this deficit but will not be sufficient to confirm adequate treatment.  In its October audit report, the EPA recommended that ultraviolet disinfection be considered by Irish Water as an additional treatment barrier to inactivate cryptosporidium and giardia at the Leixlip water treatment plant.  As an ultimate failsafe, ultraviolet disinfection will inactivate any cryptosporidium and giardia parasite in the water supply to ensure the protection of public health.</p><p> The boil water notice in question was lifted by Irish Water at 4.30 p.m. following meetings on the afternoon of Friday, 25 October, between the HSE and Irish Water and between the HSE, Irish Water and the EPA.  During an audit of the Leixlip water treatment plant in March 2019, the EPA highlighted the risk of this type of incident occurring, following a mechanical failure of a chemical dosing pump at the plant, and recommended that plant operators respond immediately to any alarm generated, and that if an operator failed to respond to an alarm, that Irish Water should ensure the plant automatically shuts down to prevent inadequately treated water being supplied to consumers.  In May, in response to that audit, Irish Water confirmed the plant would automatically shut down when an operator failed to respond to an alarm.  The EPA audit on 24 October found the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented on one production line at the Leixlip water treatment plant in April 2019 and was only implemented on the remaining two production lines at the plant on the day of the audit.  The EPA's report following the audit on Thursday, 24 October, was published on 30 October on the EPA's website.</p><p> As committee members are aware, there is an emerging issue at the water treatment plant in Leixlip and I will take this opportunity to advise the committee on the EPA's engagement on the issue at this point.  Yesterday morning, 4 October, Irish Water advised the EPA there were operational issues at the plant over the weekend.  On Sunday, 3 November, two out of three of the production lines at the Leixlip plant were shut down from 1 p.m. due to high turbidity levels in the raw water entering the plant, attributed to the very high rainfall experienced on Saturday, 2 November.</p><p>This shutdown had depleted the reserves of treated water in the reservoirs and distribution network served by Leixlip.  Due to ongoing heavy rainfall yesterday, there continue to be issues with the quality of raw water entering the plant.  The increase in turbidity in the filtered water gives rise to a risk of breakthrough of the parasites cryptosporidium and giardia into the water entering the distribution system.</p><p> A meeting was held yesterday afternoon between Irish Water, Fingal County Council, the HSE and the EPA.  Following the meeting, Irish Water, in consultation with the HSE and having assessed the risk to public health, decided that a precautionary boil water notice was needed.  The Leixlip plant returned to water production from all of its production lines yesterday evening to ensure the continuity of the water supply.  Of course, it is vital that the supply be returned to safe production as soon as possible.  The EPA will play its role in verifying that the plant is operating safely, which will include an audit of the plant.  The appropriate time to audit will be when Irish Water and Fingal County Council are satisfied that the plant has returned to satisfactory performance.  The EPA's role will be to verify that performance before the boil water notice can be lifted.</p><p> I assure the committee that the agency will continue to provide regulatory oversight.  We are happy to answer whatever questions arise from our statement.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that we are meeting in the midst of what is happening.  When we scheduled this meeting, it was intended to review the previous boil water notice in the areas in question and the broader issue of water quality.  I thank the EPA officials for attending during what is a busy time for them and the witnesses who will appear before us later.  However, it is important that we scrutinise the issue and get answers today.  With that in mind, our first questioner will be Senator Boyhan.  Due to time constraints, I will keep members' contributions to three minutes apiece.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#J00300"><p>I will be well able to do this in three minutes.</p> <p>  I thank the EPA, Fingal County Council and Irish Water for attending.  Their presence is important.  I will stick to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, which we had the advantage of having supplied to us earlier.  I will take him through three or four points.</p> <p>  This is a critical public health issue for people in areas served by this water supply.  More important, it is an issue of public confidence in the water supply chain and all those involved therein.  That is why we must deal with it.  I do not want to speculate or comment on press coverage; rather, I will deal with the facts that Dr. Ryan has just put on the record.  I draw his attention to page 2 of his statement, where he referred to auditing drinking waters and treatment processes and the EPA's capacity to issue legal directions and take legal prosecutions.  What directions has it made and what prosecutions has it taken in respect of the Leixlip plant?  He also referred to the EPA's remedial action list.  How is that progressing?  Will he make a copy available to the committee?  It is important that we fully understand it and see who has designated responsibility for the relevant actions.  He might also provide something charting the progress that has been made and the key people responsible for delivering the actions on the list.</p> <p>  Page 3 mentions replacing lead water mains and household pipes.  It is not a major issue for discussion today, but by raising it, Dr. Ryan has put it into this meeting's domain.  He might provide us at some future date with a progress report on the EPA's planned works for the changeover from lead water pipes.</p> <p>  Mention was made of cryptosporidium and related issues.  I would hate to think there was cryptosporidium in any water supply.  Dr. Ryan discussed the parasites that humans and animals can acquire from water.  Can Dr. Ryan tell us that there is no cryptosporidium in any water supply?  What affected water supplies does the EPA know of?</p><p>On the UV system, I am very familiar with it.  I know from work I have done in relation to it how successful it is.  In his opening statement, Dr. Ryan referenced a recommendation that an UV system be put in place.  Did that happen?  What was set in train?  The EPA made the recommendation in regard to the UV system and the likely success of it in killing off cryptosporidium and other parasites, etc.  Was there follow-up in regard to that recommendation?  There is no point in making recommendations if they are not followed up.  I ask Dr. Ryan to update the committee in that regard.</p><p> I thank the witnesses.  They have been very helpful.  If they cannot address any of the issues I have raised today, I ask that they would keep the committee apprised in regard to those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan.  I appreciate his assistance in keeping the proceedings on schedule.  I invite Dr. Ryan to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00300"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his questions.  On what legal action we have taken against Irish Water in regard to the Leixlip plant and the current incident, our primary focus is that the plant is back in operation and producing safe drinking water.  This is where all our focus and attention is at the moment.  This is evidenced by us auditing the plant, issuing our report, issuing the recommendations and working with the stakeholders to ensure that the boil water notice could be appropriately lifted.  There has not been a specific legal enforcement measure taken against the plant in regard to the incident.  We would have to give careful consideration to whether that is appropriate or if we have the powers to do that.  As I said, our primary focus is to ensure that the plant is back in operation and producing safe water for consumers.</p> <p>  On the remedial action list, we can make it available to the committee.  We track and keep it up-to-date.  It is very much part of our discussions with Irish Water.  It is focused around directing investment in putting in place appropriate infrastructure in priority areas to ensure that drinking water quality is improved.  It is important to mention that our reports in 2018 and previously show that the overall general quality of drinking water is very high, although, unfortunately, we have this very significant issue in front of us at the moment.  We will make the remedial action list and the current situation in that regard available to the committee following this meeting.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of lead.  We mentioned it as one of the priorities that we are tracking with Irish Water.  We will also provide follow-up on that to the committee in due course.  </p> <p>  With regard to the number of supplies that are currently at risk from cryptosporidium, we will make that list available as well.  Approximately 16 supplies on the remedial action list specifically reference a problem with cryptosporidium.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the installation of a UV system.  We have only just issued that recommendation to Irish Water.  We have given it one month to respond to that recommendation.  We understand that it would be a significant piece of infrastructure to install but we will await the response from Irish Water in that regard.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan has indicated that he would like to come back in, but I propose to call members in the order in which they indicated, following which those who wish to come back in for a second round may do so.  I have indicated the time constraints that we are all under such that we will all have to play to the same rules today.  I call Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#K00500"><p>I thank Dr. Ryan for his presentation.  To put this in context, we are asking questions today on behalf of not only the 615,000 people who are affected by a second boil water notice in two weeks, which are the most significant ever in this country to my collection, but many thousands of other people.  The witnesses are here to answer the public through our questions.</p> <p>  I have read the audit report of 24 October.  Like Senator Boyhan, I would like to touch on the recommendation regarding UV treatment.</p><p>According to the EPA audit report, "the level of treatment at this plant [Leixlip] is not sufficient to manage the risk posed by the River Liffey source water".  Dr. Ryan made that point again earlier.  Was the March 2019 audit the first time the EPA made this point, or does it go way back to the 2008 report?  While I acknowledge Dr. Ryan's clear statement that "the overall quality of drinking water remains high, with 99.9% compliance with microbiological standards", these two significant outages have significantly rocked people's confidence in the water supply.  All witnesses must realise how angry, upset and concerned people are about this.  I will deal with more of that when representatives of the Department, Irish Water and Fingal County Council are in attendance.</p><p> Dr. Ryan has mentioned a recommendation that was made recently.  As far as I can see, it was made in March of this year.  Was that the first time UV treatment was recommended?  I am particularly concerned about the automatic shutdown now in place in Leixlip.  It is to be welcomed.  An automatic shutdown was recommended in March.  According to Dr. Ryan's opening statement, in May of this year, the EPA received a response from Irish Water to the effect that "the automatic plant shutdown arrangement was implemented".  He is now saying that it was partially implemented only.  I ask him to comment on that.  I know it is in place now.  That is important.</p><p> As someone who is eminently qualified in this area and is certainly better qualified than me, will he explain what happens with the lag time when an issue is found?  I invite any of his colleagues who wish to come in on this matter to do so.  A couple of weeks ago, there was an outage following an incident that began at 3 p.m. on Monday, 21 October and ended at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 October.  It ran for 18 hours, in effect.  The plant was shut down at 10.15 p.m. on the Monday night.  Many people have told me that there is serious concern about contaminants getting into the system in the intervening period.  I know that those involved need to sit down for a meeting.  What happens in these circumstances?  Is Dr. Ryan happy that boil water notices are issued as quickly as possible?  That is the fundamental point.  I am asking about the current outage as well as last month's outage.</p></speech>

It is only in recent years that we have been tracking the deterioration with Irish Water through sampling and measurement.  The number of giardia detections was one in 2015, one in 2016, two in 2017 and one in 2018, but there have been ten such detections so far this year.  There has been a deterioration in the infrastructure treating the plant.  We are now convinced that this is the right way to go.  We mentioned it in March.  We strongly recommended it in our October audit.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the recommendation that the plant should be shut down automatically.  When we came back, we found it was implemented on one of the lines only.  The audit finding was very much that the shutdown should apply to the entire plant.  It is clear that this was misunderstood.  This was remediated when we got back out there in October.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the lag time.  The current situation is evolving.  We are satisfied that we have been notified promptly.  We were involved in discussions yesterday on the implementation of the boil water notice.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the issue that arose in October.  Clearly, there was an operational difficulty that allowed a window of time to happen when remedial action could have been taken.  Alarms were not responded to.  It was not a normal or foreseen event.  The alarm is usually raised when there are operational or mechanical difficulties.  We are usually notified when there is an issue.  It is clear that there was a period of time the plant was operating even though alarms were ringing.</p><p>That said, once we are notified, we get involved in conversations with the HSE and Irish Water.  Public health is first and foremost in everybody's mind in that regard and, as such, the boil water notice was issued and precautionary measures, which I am sure will be addressed in detail by Irish Water, were taken, such as flushing out the system before the boil water notice is lifted.  I hope that addresses the Deputy's queries.</p></speech>

I welcome the comments of the officials and I am conscious of the role of the EPA.  I am tempted to say one does not miss the water until the well runs dry.  I am a former schoolteacher and recall a child being asked to make a sentence using the word "uisce" and coming up with "Uisce in&aacute;r saol: cosanta" or, in English, "Water in our environment: protect it".  That is the premise we must start from.  I was secretary of a group water scheme for 21 years and know the difficulties associated with large and small plants.  Information is critical.</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan referred to 99% or 99.6% of water being of perfect drinking quality after treatment, which is good news.  I am more concerned about whether the quality of water in our rivers and lakes is continuing to deteriorate, as I believe it is, and their role in that regard.  It has been suggested that flooding caused the problem in the Leixlip plant.  There has always been flooding.  When the officials from Irish Water appear before the committee, I will deal with a similar situation involving Irish Water in County Louth, where people have been on a boil water notice for 105 days.  Two reports issued by the EPA specifically deal with the Tallanstown group scheme.  I am sorry to widen the discussion, but this issue does not just affect the 600,000 people impacted by the problem in Leixlip.  It is just as important for the 600 people affected elsewhere or the 92,000 who were on boil water notices last year.  As the EPA officials pointed out, that figure increased from 21,000 the previous year.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the quality of drinking water.  Does the EPA have confidence that when it carries out an examination and reports to Irish Water and local authorities, those bodies take action on issues arising?  My experience is that one can tell the bodies what needs to be done, but no action is being taken.  I will deal with that at a later stage.  How effective is the reporting of those bodies to the EPA regarding its recommendations?</p> <p>  One may think I am naive but that is not the case.  I refer to two drinking water audit reports in my local authority area.  It is alarming that it took 12 days for a boil water notice to be issued when the water was known to be contaminated.  This issue is as important to the people I represent as the members who are concerned about the issues in Leixlip.   I ask the officials to address that point.  It goes back to the point raised by Senator Boyhan regarding action in terms of legal responsibility and the remedial action list.  I would like the committee to be provided with that information.  More important, I ask that the EPA officials meet representatives of each local authority and Irish Water twice a year to keep people informed.  I was not informed by the EPA or Irish Water that the two reports to which I referred were available.  They were not mentioned to me in my myriad communications on the matter or to any other public representative for County Louth.  I am not blaming the officials for that, but I want to know how effective are their recommendations regarding what action is needed in the interests of protecting public water supplies.</p></speech>

Our water quality in Ireland reports are produced on a three-yearly basis and we also produce an annual water indicators report.</p><p>We saw some improvements to about 2012 but they have been declining since.  We expect the next three-year report will be out within the next quarter or two.  We will have the overview then.  We did and still do assist the Department in its river basin management planning, which looks at that work, and we provide the evidence on which it develops the plans for all the stakeholders to implement.  There has been a decline in overall water quality in rivers and lakes over the last decade.</p><p> I refer to the question of our confidence in Irish Water following up on the actions we require of it.  In our audit reports, we set out our recommendations.  We give Irish Water a month to respond to us and we find that, as one would expect if there are number of recommendations, some of them will need to be dealt with immediately and some of them will take a certain amount of time and investment to be delivered.  It provides us with a response to the audit recommendations and then we track that every quarter and we get a response from Irish Water on all open cases once every quarter.  We track each of the individual actions that have been set out in our audit reports, and as they progress, if we find there is an unacceptable delay, we have the ability to go back out and issue a legal direction to it undertake to either provide us with the action plan for delivering on the action or to carry out the specific action within a specified time.  We actively track that and we actively ensure the actions we seek are being undertaken.  It is part of my work programme to do that on a continuous basis.</p></speech>

I have eight questions but first I want to put on the record that it is precisely on an occasion like this that the value of the Environmental Protection Agency is proven and I want to commend the witnesses on the audit reports, which are short, concise, clear and easy to understand for those of us who are not specialists.  It gives us a fully independent view of the facts, and that is enormously valuable, both to us on the committee and to the members of the public.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses take us through what happens after the EPA issued the March-April 2019 report in some detail in terms of its engagement with Irish Water or with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government?  Is there a mechanism for escalating that engagement if there is a feeling, as the months progress, that the recommendations are not being acted on in an appropriate timeframe?  I am particularly keen to know if at any stage the Department is involved in that process if the EPA feels Irish Water is not responding properly.</p> <p>  If the eight recommendations outlined in the March-April report had been fully implemented before October, would it be the EPA's view that the October incident and subsequent boil water notice would have been avoided?  That is an important question the public has a right to know the answer to.  There has also been quite a lot of public debate about whether this is an operational issue, a management issue or an investment issue.  I know it does not have to be one of those issues in particular or the other, but I would like to know, particularly with respect to the October event, now that the EPA has done that audit, whether it was primarily an operational issue or as Dr. Ryan seems to indicate in the opening remarks, might there be some investment upgrade issues there as well?</p> <p>  On the basis of the information we have about yesterday, there seems to be a different cause to what took place.  Maybe the witnesses could compare, in as simple and non-technical language as possible, the October event and the November event, albeit the EPA has not done an audit yet for what took place yesterday.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of that?  One of the things I am confused about is that this plant has received considerable funding for significant upgrades.  It was upgraded in the 1990s and there was an additional upgrade in 2014 of about &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million so there has been a little bit of a public debate about this being an old plant.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of this?  Is it that there is an older part and a newer part of the plant?  Where are the problems?  Again, I ask them to do so in as clear a manner as possible.</p> <p>  I am concerned by a bit in Dr. Ryan's opening statement.  It seems to be a little bit different from the version I have.  On page 6, it says: "the Leixlip Water Treatment plant is now operating satisfactorily."</p><p>However, the opening statement then goes on to say there is a deficit for treatment of parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia.  Dr. Ryan went on to say that there are upgrade works under way but when they are completed, if I understood him right, those works will not be sufficient to address the problem.  Can we have more information on that and what would be required in terms of works and their possible cost to ensure the public would have confidence that these kind of issues are not going to be repeated?</p></speech>

I am going to ask Dr. Minihan to address as many as she can.  We will then come back and pick up on any of the other overarching questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-05a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle Minihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019110500002#O00300"><p>If I might begin by addressing the Deputy's question about the follow-up on the March audit, the EPA did follow up on the audit.  We received a response from Irish Water on 3 May which set out the actions it had taken to address each of the recommendations in our March audit report.  As part of that, we are continuously tracking Irish Water's implementation of our audit recommendations via an open investigation file, which an inspector continuously monitors.  In that response, Irish Water committed to completing certain works by specified dates.  We tracked the progress of those works and we have been concerned with slippage identified by Irish Water.  For example, in the response of 3 May to the March audit, the filters were due to be upgraded by quarter 4 of 2019, the end of this year.  That has now slipped to quarter 2 of 2020.  We have continued to monitor and engage with Irish Water to address that slippage and engage continuously to see what the problems are around it.</p> <p>  If I could come back to the Deputy's question about how there seems to be a difference between the October event and that of yesterday, he is correct.  October's event was a blockage in a chemical dosing line which meant the water was not being treated correctly for a period.  There was also a period in which alarms were activated and not responded to.  I think the Deputy's question related to whether, if our audit recommendations from March had been put in place, the October event could have been avoided.  Our October audit report clearly called out that if the automatic shut-down had been put in place across the entire plant as was recommended in the March audit report, we believe the incident itself would have been avoided in October.  That action, the automatic shut-down of the plant, is the fail-safe which ensures that whatever happens, if an alarm is not responded to the plant is shut down and cannot produce water that is possibly unsafe or contaminated.</p></speech>

It has been expanded to provide water to other locations in recent years as it has been augmented.  I do not remember there ever being a boil water notice at that plant.  This is the first time and it has happened twice in a few weeks.  What is different about Leixlip in terms of the Liffey is that while Poulaphouca is supplied closer to the source, Leixlip takes its intake further downstream.  Upstream to that there are sewage treatments plants and pumping stations.  We have become accustomed to keeping an eye on the river and if there is a grey look about it we would be concerned.  Was there an issue in respect of the intake?  One reason that was given was the very heavy fall of rain, which is not unique as I think we will all accept.  What is the nature of this discolouring?  Is it internal or external?</p><p>Is it correct that there are three production lines, one of which is old and two of which are new?  Was the plant designed to allow them to be separated, or can that be done?  Why is the output of the entire plant, both the new and the old sections, contaminated?</p><p> Finally, I refer to the spillage upstream at Osberstown wastewater treatment plant in March.  It might have been caused by one of the pumping stations.  Are there holding tanks at the pumping stations in case of failures, as opposed to at the treatment plant?  The volume of that spillage, 12,300 cu. m, translates to something in the region of 600 lorry-loads.  It was huge.  What is the additional dosage when that happens, and what is the communication between the two plants like? </p></speech>

I will divide them if the Chairman does not mind.  It has been reported to us that the heavy rainfall has caused a turbidity issue with the water from which the plant has been abstracting during this incident.  We have not carried out our audit yet, but we will be going to the site in the next couple of days to fully assess the issues.  Irish Water and Fingal County Council will be able to provide chapter and verse on the plant itself.  Perhaps Dr. Minihan can provide a precis.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that the Paterson Candy plant was completed in 1974 and upgraded in the 1990s.  The Mahon and McPhillips plant was completed in 1988.  They make up what is referred to as the "old plant" at Leixlip wastewater treatment plant.  The new plant, which is referred to by Irish Water as the "AECOM plant", was completed in 2014.  That is the distinction between the old plant and new plant.  The Deputy asked if it was possible to separate output from the old and new plants.  Separate streams come out, but the treated water is combined into one flow of treated water as it leaves the plant.  One of the questions discussed at the time of the first boil water notices was whether we could definitively tell where water from the PCI plant was going.  Because that water is all blended, with water from the old plant and the new plant leaving Leixlip and feeding the network as a single flow of water, it is not possible to do that.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that a sewer is a pipe of a certain diameter and it can fill up.  If there is no separation between rainwater and the sewage flowing through the pipe, capacity can be exceeded and there can be a combined sewer overflow.  In many cases, this overflow reaches rivers and waterways.  It tends to be more diluted than raw sewage because of water flowing through the pipe.  Part of our March audit examined these issues.  Our audit report included a specific recommendation for Irish Water to draw up a documented protocol for communication between Osberstown and Leixlip wastewater treatment plants so that operators would be alerted if there was an issue.  That is what happened.  My understanding is that the protocol is now in place if overflows occur.  It is absolutely true that if water is taken from a lowland location at the back end of a catchment close to the sea, it is more likely to contain material from agriculture, industry and towns and villages.</p></speech>

Now it is my turn.  I will begin with the deficit we now have.  Witnesses have described it as effectively constituting an ongoing deficit.  Even with the completion of the upgrade works, there will still be a deficit.  In Dr. Minihan's view, are the current outages a hangover from the previous round of outages?</p></speech>

A plan is in place to replace each of the 12 filters but they can only be replaced two at a time if we are to allow the plant to continue to produce water.  The timeline for their refurbishment has slipped to quarter 2 of 2020 and there will be a treatment deficit until their refurbishment, in terms of the quality of raw water extracted from the River Liffey as compared to the requirements.  Our audit report included the recommendation to install ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant as this would provide assurance for a water supply that serves over 600,000 people.</p></speech>

He said no legal enforcement may be required.  He went into the history of it a bit and said he had doubts about the powers in respect of taking such action.  I am a bit concerned by this.  Dr. Ryan is telling us that he has doubts about the EPA's powers to take a prosecution.  In the case of the Leixlip plant, he said no legal prosecution has ever taken place on this particular issue.  That is a major concern to me and to the public.  Can he clarify whether I misunderstand or am misquoting from what Dr. Ryan said?  If he has such doubts, can he share them with the committee today?</p></speech>

That is our primary focus.  Whatever powers and authority we have, we deploy to that end and we will continue to do that in the current situation.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement powers under the drinking water regulations are limited but we engage with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the legislation governing drinking water.  The EPA would welcome the strengthening of its enforcement powers in this regard.</p></speech>

I want to focus on what will happen now because I am conscious we are asking these questions while people do not have access to safe drinking water.  What, if anything, would the EPA do differently in the process?  Dr. Ryan mentioned his disappointment at the initial audit and recommendations not being implemented.  The EPA will do another audit in a few days when this issue has been addressed.  What will the EPA do differently to ensure any further recommendations it makes, even if they are the same as those that were made in March and October, will be implemented?  Is it the EPA's job to do that?</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Minihan in particular about filter replacement and ultraviolet, UV, treatment of the water plant.   As an expert in this field, what timeline does she envisage there should be for the installation of UV treatment of a plant such as this one?  My main concern is that if this issue is rectified in the next few days, given that this is early in the winter and with winter storms approaching and more heavy rainfall, we could be back here discussing this issue in two or three weeks.  Confidence in the quality of our water supply has taken a hammering in recent days.  We want to ensure people realise their drinking water supply is safe and can be used.  From the EPA's quasi-independent perspective of the process - it is not Fingal County Council, Irish Water or the Department - what should that timeline be?</p> <p>  What is the nature of the report the Minister apparently has asked the EPA to do separately?  I note from the Department's opening statement that the Minister has instructed the EPA to give him a special report on what has happened.  What will be in that report and will it be made public?</p></speech>

To be clear on the next steps, this is an ongoing issue and there is a boil water notice in place.  When we carry out another audit, it will be directly focused on getting the evidence to facilitate the lifting of that boil water notice.  That is the next immediate action from us.  We will do that, as I said in my statement, at a particular point.  The plant has to come back up to operating at what Irish Water would characterise as a satisfactory performance.  Our job will be to verify that performance.</p></speech>

What is that?</p></speech>

We will look at the results of sampling and we will take a considered view.  The open issues from the audits in March and October will be keenly tracked by my team to ensure their implementation.  That is an ongoing process.</p> <p>  Regarding the installation of ultraviolet treatment of the plant, I am not sure how much we can say about timelines at this stage.  </p></speech>

The reason for that is that the size of the UV facility that will be required at Leixlip is significant.  As it is a significant piece of infrastructure and investment, it will need time to be physically be put on site, installed and verified to enure it is operating.  That is because the volume of water treatment at Leixlip is so significant.</p></speech>

We have an evolving situation and it will probably expand a little.</p><p>The Minister has requested that we bring to his attention the issues generally concerning water quality in Ireland and the rate of pace of infrastructural development.  We will also take the opportunity to bring to his attention any deficiencies we see in terms of enforcement powers, as we have been doing with the Department for some time.</p></speech>

To go back to what happened between March and October, in the regular engagement with Irish Water is there any engagement with or notification of the Department in particular, for example, if a concern arises over slippage of the original deadlines that are given in the Irish Water report?  Is the Department informed throughout the process or does it learn with the rest of us when a boil water notice is issued?</p> <p>  In terms of slippage, I think I am correct in saying five of the eight recommendations were not implemented between March and October.  How many of those were subject to slippage and could the witnesses elaborate a little more on that?</p> <p>  I am also keen to understand if the problems we are talking about are confined to the older part of the plant, notwithstanding the fact that the supply is all ultimately mixed, or if there are problems with the plant that was upgraded in the 1990s and the new plant in 2014?  I would welcome if the witnesses could separate out that.</p> <p>  I would welcome a little more information from Dr. Ryan on the previous question I asked on whether, even if all the works that are currently within the capital programme are completed, there still are additional difficulties he would like to see addressed.  Is that the ultraviolet filter or are other works required?</p> <p>  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but while the EPA did not recommend the ultraviolet filter in the March report, it recommended it in the October report.  Is there a reason for that?  Is it something the EPA had raised previously with Irish Water and Fingal County Council?  I would welcome a bit more information on that too.</p></speech>

At the end of each quarter, we publish our remedial action list that sets out the priority supplies we have identified for action and investment by Irish Water.  That sets out the completion dates by which the works on those supplies will be completed.  We then engage with the Department regularly post the publication of our remedial action list.  It is available on our website each quarter and we provide regular updates as part of that to identify where there is slippage.  There is ongoing and regular engagement with the Department.</p></speech>

His question was manifold.  Some of the recommendations relate specifically to the old plant but a number relate to the plant as a whole.  The key recommendation that Irish Water should ensure that there is automatic switchover between the duty and standby polyelectrolyte dosing pumps had not happened.  Another was that operators respond to the alarms.  As we noted earlier, the automatic shut-off in the event of operators failing to respond to alarms was implemented only in the new plant, which was where the March issue arose, and not extended to all the plant.  Our recommendation clearly called out the need for it to be across the plant.  However, as Dr. Ryan indicated, we do not believe that was deliberate but rather was a misinterpretation.</p> <p>  The other actions relate to the plant as a whole and have seen slippage.  Our audit report of October asked Irish Water to reconsider the dates by which those works would be undertaken and, as we have already indicated, a response is awaited on that.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan outlined that the EPA has legal power but it needs to be strengthened.  Has the EPA reviewed all of the audits across the country, or will it do so?</p><p>It is clear that in the case of Leixlip, but also that of County Louth, the actions recommended, not just in one report but two, have not been implemented.  Will the witnesses undertake to review those reports with a view to putting them on the remedial action list, if necessary?</p><p> Dr. Minihan said the remedial action list is published on the website.  We have a communication problem here.  The witnesses may say we should be able to look at the website but all public representatives, at national, regional and county levels, need to be supplied with the reports and met twice per year.  Will they commit to this?  Publishing on the website is not sufficient.  Irish Water does not inform anybody about what is in the reports.  It is said that it is up to us to have the competence to read them but if the witnesses asked everybody in this room about them, they would note that nobody was aware of the remedial action list until this morning, although it is available on the website.</p></speech>

It clearly has not done so.  Even the National Transport Authority fines bus companies if they do not meet the demands and requirements of their contracts.

It has to gather a certain amount of information to be able to have an informed discussion with us and the HSE, and in order that we can fully understand the risk and consider what actions need to be taken to mitigate the risk and to address what has happened at the plant.</p></speech>

A certain amount of cryptosporidium will be in the water, having come from the plant, because it is not possible to get rid of it all.  Is the EPA satisfied with the range of levels of contamination that has been set?</p> <p>  Does the EPA do any testing of the water that comes into the plant before it is treated?  I ask because one of the largest treatment plants in the country is upstream of the Osberstown treatment plant, which might have an impact.</p> <p>  Am I correct that the plant in Leixlip is self-regulatory?  I mean that Irish Water controls the plant and the EPA does not post people there on a permanent basis.  Is the EPA happy with that or does it believe it should have someone on-site at all times?</p></speech>

At our licensed facilities, we do not have people on-site all the time.  We do not generally consider it to be appropriate.  In a risk-based approach, it would not be the appropriate use of resources.  We regulate and audit when it is necessary to audit.  We are on-site when issues arise.</p></speech>

We are not happy with the levels but we recognise that it occurs where raw water is abstracted from a source such as the River Liffey that has the potential to be contaminated with cryptosporidium, giardia or other parasites.  That is why our other report recommended the need for ultraviolet disinfection at Leixlip water treatment plant.  Ultraviolet disinfection will deactivate the cryptosporidium or render them harmless, meaning they will not be able to cause people to become ill.  The recommendation was made in our audit report of 30 October.</p></speech>

In 2019, however, there has been a significant increase in those detections in the treated water.  Such low-level detections, amounting to one cyst in approximately 1,300 l of water, have been the subject of ongoing consultation between Irish Water and the HSE in respect of the risk to public health.  Enhanced sampling of treated water has been put in place at Leixlip water treatment plant as a result of the detections.</p></speech>

A related issue on this water line occurred in Kilcloon last year when there was an excess of chlorine and an EPA report followed that.  Are our guests confident that issue in the Boyne water network has been followed up and dealt with?</p> <p>   I am not sure they can comment on another issue of interest to me.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il just before the original boil notice was lifted.  The Minister seemed to be aware that certain things that were meant to have been done last September were not done.  He said he was waiting for the report and that we would then know if certain things were done.  Was that spoken about in the past few months?  Was there an awareness of failings in the system among the interested parties?</p></speech>

I live in Kilcloon, County Meath, so I was keenly watching that incident.  We carried out an audit in response to the incident of chlorine overdosing there.  Actions were taken to address the findings of that audit and the recommendations have been addressed.  We will provide a written update to the Deputy on that as a matter of course.</p></speech>

I thank our guests, and our upcoming guests, for their forbearance and time.

My understanding is that a clock normally starts for testing that is carried out by the regulatory authority, in this case the HSE.  Am I correct?  Has that clock started yet and is there a timeline for restoration or a standing down of the boil water notice?</p></speech>

The plant returned to production yesterday evening, as I understand, under the proviso that the boil water notice would be put in place to protect public health.  There is regular sampling at Leixlip and that sampling equipment or rig is required to run for 24 hours.  That went on yesterday and that sample will be available today.  We will get through approximately 13,000 l of water.  That sample will need to go to the laboratory and results will be awaited.</p> <p>  Following the return to production of the plant, given the raw water turbidity and the fact that there was a lot of rainfall yesterday and on Saturday, there will be a period of time for the filters to return to normal operating conditions.  In our engagement with Irish Water and the HSE, we have stated that we intend to audit that plant.  We would see that the time to audit that plant is when it has returned to normal operating conditions.  We will await confirmation from Irish Water and Fingal County Council as to when that will happen.  Irish Water are better positioned to answer the question about when the sample results will be available.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses very much for their time today.  I echo what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said in his opening remarks, namely, that the EPA has clearly shown its value as an organisation in terms of its annual reports to the committee and also in terms of its audit.  I thank the EPA for its diligent work.  I appreciate the time the witnesses have given to us today.  We will suspend briefly before our next session.</p></speech>
