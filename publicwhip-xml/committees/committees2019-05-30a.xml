    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#A00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit, and Mr. Ronan McCabe, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering, Jonathan O'Brien and O'Connell.</p> <p>  The first item is the minutes of the meeting of 16 May.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  On matters arising, everything that we might want to discuss will come up during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2187 and 2190 from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General at the Department of Finance, are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We note and publish them.</p> <p>  Category B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up responses to previous meetings.  We will note and publish these.  Held over from the last meeting is the minute from the Minister for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform, regarding our periodic report No. 4.  I propose we hold it over until the end of our discussion on correspondence.  I want to clear that document but we will go through the other items of correspondence first.</p> <p>  No. 2160 from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, provides information requested by the committee on the leaking roof in Schull Garda station.</p><p>The OPW states that there was no obligation on the construction company to fix the roof as the six-year liability period had elapsed.  I propose we forward a copy of this correspondence to the person who raised the matter with us.  We will note and publish this.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. 2161 B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities, which was undertaken by Mazars.  We will note and publish this but we will also discuss it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00200"><p>As the Chairman will know, I have been looking for this for a couple of years.  I would like to point out that it has taken two years for the HEA to produce this report.  I would like an explanation of the second paragraph of Mr. O'Toole's letter, which states:</p><blockquote>The Board of the HEA has determined that the recommendations contained in the report would apply, as appropriate, to all institutions. [That is fair enough.] It has also determined its preference, that similar reviews in the future should, in the first instance, be carried out by the governing body of the institution concerned unless there is a specific reason not to.</blockquote> <p>I take from this that Mr. O'Toole means that the institution should carry out reviews before the HEA does and that we should not be asking questions about it.  I would like that clarified but I take it that is what he is saying.</p><p>This report is not acceptable.  It is too generic, it lacks specifics, and there are issues around roles as regards how it was carried out, which I might talk about in private session at some point.  There are no details in respect of positions, roles and responsibilities within the organisations or companies.  While I do not necessarily expect names to be mentioned, I do expect titles, roles, and responsibilities to be referenced.  The report is too vague.  There are no figures of substance in it.  Granted, I have only just had a chance to read this report because it only came in yesterday evening and these are my initial views on it, but it is not what I was expecting.  It does not assuage the concerns of the committee.  I am not even sure that all of the companies referred to in our discussions with the HEA and the college are covered.  There is a huge volume of detail missing.</p><p>As we only got this report last night, I propose to put into writing some of my issues, requests, concerns, and questions for consideration at a meeting so that we could write back to the HEA in the coming weeks.  I suggest that we put this on hold to give us time to consider it further, given we only got it at 6 o'clock yesterday evening.  The report is very disappointing and it does not deal with the issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00300"><p>I support that.  I have also raised the issue of IMERC, which is mentioned in the report, in that regard.  I certainly support the Deputy's proposal to come back to this document.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00400"><p>I support what has been said.  I will add a few observations to what the Deputy has said.  We will write back to the HEA seeking further specifics on the matter.  People can send information to the secretariat in the meantime.  We will hold the item over for discussion at our next meeting after the June bank holiday weekend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00500"><p>I agree with Deputy Kelly.  It is a response to our query but it is not an answer.  As Deputy Kelly has said, it does not remotely give the sort of detail required for us to say that we have no concerns regarding governance.  Unfortunately, it does not provide any of the specifics that would give us that sort of peace of mind.  I agree 100% with Deputy Kelly's proposal.  I look forward to his analysis, and that of other members, when we have time to go through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00600"><p>That is good.  I agree with what is being said, but I took a little while to read the report and I want to put some remarks on the record.  In the first paragraph the report reads: "This review was also informed by a recommendation of the D&aacute;il's Committee of Public Accounts ... in July 2017 [when we said that we were] not satisfied that there was sufficient clarity [in] relation to relationships with CIT's Maritime College and other corporate entities".  To a large extent this report has flowed from our work and our recommendations.  It was not necessarily going to be initiated in the first instance.</p> <p>  I want to make one or two observations.  I know the Deputy accepts this.  Based on the information available, there were eight Cork Institute of Technology employees working in a company called GAC Training and Service Solutions Designated Activity Company, GTSS, and there was one more CIT employee working in a company called SEFtec NMCI Offshore Training Designated Activity Company, SNO.  The report goes on to say that the conflict of interests register in respect of CIT had only been completed in respect of one case.  It recommends that this should be done immediately.  It provides the pay grades of the people working in the National Maritime College of Ireland.  Nine people are mentioned, one of whom was receiving a salary of more than &euro;40,000 from the subsidiary.  One person working for SNO was in receipt of payment of more than &euro;50,000 and was an employee of CIT at the same time.  The point the Deputy raises is very well founded.  The committee was right to pursue this matter but we have not got all of the information we require yet.  Those points can be taken on board.  There is agreement that it is, as Deputy MacSharry put it, a response but not a full answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00700"><p>No, and I do not want to be giving us even more work, but I believe we need to make this same request regarding campus companies of all third level institutions.  I have concerns about a number of them with regard to governance, the crossover between staff, ownership, equity, salaries, money, and the potential - although everything may be great - for such companies then to win internal tenders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00800"><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for a general comment on whether subsidiaries and joint ventures are common throughout the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00900"><p>They are very common.  When we reported on the University of Limerick there were questions around subsidiaries.  We have been examining subsidiaries.  They are all required to operate to the code of practice for the governance of institutes of technology, or universities as the case may be.  The same standards and governance expectations apply.  I would prefer not to respond specifically to the report on CIT as I have not had an opportunity to study or examine it in detail.  We will be examining the implications and looking for similar concerns in other institutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01000"><p>As Deputy MacSharry has suggested, we will have to write to the HEA and ask for a report on each body under its remit and separately to the universities.  We may not need the same level of detail but we should at least get the corporate structure, the breakdown, and details of compliance with procedures in the legislation under which the college or university, as the case may be, was established.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01100"><p>Perhaps we should decide how we are going to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01200"><p>We will come back to it next week.</p></speech>

We will be better informed.</p></speech>

The Deputy can see what we are thinking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01500"><p>We should use this as the basis.  Let us do this right, and we can then follow through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01600"><p>I wish to indicate a particular interest in that.  I am usually at every meeting but I have a particular difficulty with the meeting on our return as it clashes with a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands.  I ask the Chair to consider that and to discuss this item when I am here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01700"><p>We will be happy to do that because if we send off correspondence in the meantime, we will still be waiting on the reply.  We have touched on the issue and we now know it is a broader issue.  We will come back to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01800"><p>I will point out that subsidiaries are all listed in the notes to the financial statements.  There is considerable information there.</p><p>The interest of the institution in the spin-out companies should also be noted.  There is an indication of the scale of operation available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00200"><p>No. 2170 is next from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the sums involved in potential claims or claims lodged in respect of an outbreak of tuberculosis within the Irish Prison Service.  The agency has not attached confidentiality clauses to any settlement.  Mr Breen states that the figures provided are commercially sensitive and requests that we do not publish them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00300"><p>We may not publish them, but an article dealing with the matter was published in a newspaper today.  When taken together with No. 2174, it is obvious that the State Claims Agency is indicating-----</p></speech>

No. 2174, dated 21 May, is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the lessons for the Irish Prison Service to ensure issues as the outbreak of tuberculosis will be prevented.  We will discuss the two letters together as they deal with the same topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00500"><p>The State Claims Agency seems to be taking a whole-of-prison approach.  It is welcome that it has indicated what are the lessons.  However, it was quite a sizeable outbreak.  It is a very serious illness and a very expensive lesson.  Large sums have been paid out in settlements.  Obviously, people suffered significant damage.  We should put this matter back to the appearance of representatives of the State Claims Agency before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00600"><p>They will appear before the committee.</p></speech>

We have set aside the issue of the contingent liability in regard to the HSE, but this is a significant issue, as is the matter in respect of the Air Corps.  We must examine further the role of the agency in pre-empting matters such as this and what other illnesses they are screening for in addition to looking at the lessons that can be drawn from this kind of experience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00800"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  I am concerned most by the letter from Mr. O'Driscoll on this issue.  It states that following the outbreak of tuberculosis in 2011 in the Irish Prison Service it was recognised that a whole-of-prison approach to TB control was required.  It further states that the tuberculosis management policy was completed on 3 January 2019.  It took eight years from the outbreak being notified in 2011 for the Department and the Prison Service to come out with a management policy for TB, which they only completed earlier this year.  That they were writing a policy eight years after the event shows there was no learning of sufficient quality in the intervening period.  That is utterly unacceptable and it leaves the State and the taxpayer wide open.  It is clear that the line Departments, such as the Department of Justice and Equality in this case, the HSE, the Air Corps and other agencies do not seem to learn but, rather, just pass the bill on to the State Claims Agency to be paid by the taxpayer.  That must be addressed when the agency representatives come before the committee.  The outbreak occurred in 2011 and a management policy for TB in the Prison Service was compiled eight years later.  That speaks volumes as to how seriously the Department took the matter.  We will note and publish that correspondence.  I agree with the points made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We should follow up on how the State Claims Agency deals with that particular aspect because it must be wider than taking a whole-of-prison approach.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, a patient with TB was hospitalised in Galway in a way that exposed other patients.  The matter was covered in the media.  The same issue occurred again.  Several people contracted latent TB.  The matter is factual and has been documented.  The handling of the issue and the exposure to the disease left a lot to be desired.  Naturally, people are now seeking due redress through the legal process.  This occurred this year in a hospital.  There are policies on the ground, such as those referred to in regard to the Prison Service, but the operation of those policies is the next question.</p></speech>

Risk management must also be considered.  Prevention is better than cure.  We will take these matters up with the representatives of the State Claims Agency when they appear before the committee in five weeks to deal with its annual report.</p> <p>  No. 2173 is from Mr. Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner.  It is a request that the record be corrected in respect of a comment he made at our meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May.  We will note and publish this.</p></speech>

This is not a minor matter.  Obviously, the record of committee proceedings must be correct, but I am sure he was advised and he gave a categoric response as a consequence of that.  This is not without consequence for the individual in question.  I am not happy that correcting the record is sufficient in this case.  I would like to know who briefed and advised the Commissioner on this matter.  It is a serious stuff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C01800"><p>I will not get into the details of the matter, but in order that people know what is under discussion, at the meeting Deputy Cullinane asked the Commissioner in respect of a particular case about which he had read in the media.  He asked:</p><blockquote>Does that mean the Garda has conducted an examination of the case?  Has Mr. Harris examined the claims made by the individual in question?</blockquote> <p>Mr. Harris responded, &quot;That is also the subject of a public complaint to GSOC.&quot;  In the correspondence, Mr. Harris clarifies that no public complaint has been made to GSOC.  As Deputy Murphy points out, it is right to correct the record, but we need to write to the Commissioner and seek an explanation of the circumstances in which incorrect information was given to the committee, such as what notes or briefing were given or where the gap was in the information.  As the Deputy stated, it is a serious issue.  That is the essence of her point.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>We have dealt with No. 2174 from the Department and Equality in regard to tuberculosis.  We note and publish it.</p><p>No. 2175, dated 17 May 2019, is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  He provides a further update for the committee in respect of the property transfer from religious congregations and contributions towards the cost incurred by the State in responding to the residential institutional child abuse issue.  We will note and publish this.  Deputies may wish to comment on it.</p><p>We are making good progress, at long last.  This committee is driving this matter because Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is responding to us and meeting the congregation.  It has been 15 years but we will keep at it until the matter has concluded, as long as we are here.  I welcome the progress but it is long overdue.</p></speech>

It arose from this committee and the questions we asked.  It was brought to my attention by the story of Lenaboy, the former industrial school in Galway.  It has still not been finalised but Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is keeping his word and keeping us updated.  There was a narrative that St. Anne's, Lenaboy, was given as a gift to the city but it was given as part of the redress scheme.  Unfortunately, it remains empty.  It was given over, theoretically, in 2009 but because they held onto it for so long, I have no idea of what the cost of bringing it up to par will be.  What the council will get as redress has to be seriously questioned, as has the security issue.</p></speech>

On page 3 of the correspondence it states that there has been further dialogue with the congregation of Christian Brothers on the proposed transfer of playing fields.  That does not tell us anything, other than that the two sides are talking to each other.  We need to get details of when it is likely to come to a conclusion.  The cash contributions are incredibly important.  They go directly to Caranua, which is there to assist people who have been damaged in these institutions.  Some &euro;6.4 million in cash contributions is required to achieve the maximum amount of &euro;110 million, which is set down in statute.  Some of it will come in as a consequence of these transactions but the speed at which they come is an issue.  We are not here to supervise the Department of Education and Skills as it is not our function, but that is essentially what we are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#D00400"><p>That is correct.  It is an example of members' commitment to their public duty that they want to see this matter through.  We could have easily declined to insist on quarterly reports and allowed the matter to just hang there.  We will publish the letter.  There have been improvements in a number of areas.  The Christian Brothers have recently contributed &euro;2 million but they still owe &euro;6.4 million to bring the balance up and Caranua is waiting for that cash, which we are told will come in the months after the sale of the lands in Clonkeen, Dublin.  It is all contingent on that.  It is a progress report and we will keep at it by asking Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to use the Committee of Public Accounts in his negotiations with the various organisations.  He is under pressure to bring the matter to a conclusion.  We should not have to supervise this and some might say it is not within our remit but we are happy to do it anyway, in the interests of the public.</p> <p>  The next item is from from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, dated 10 May 2019, providing information requested by the committee on proposed legislation regarding the court poor box.  A reparation fund is to be established which will be used to provide additional funding for services for victims of crimes and compensation payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Moneys must be paid to the reparation fund unless provided for by law.  There was a practice that a judge could direct a defendant to make a contribution to a third party charity or organisation but it all has to go through the reparation fund, other than compensation as directed by a judge under the legislation.  That is good to hear.</p> <p>  The next item is from Ms Mary Donohoe, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, dated 22 May 2019 providing follow-up information requested by the committee relating to 12 items.  It is very thorough correspondence and it is good to put it on the public record.  I will highlight some key points, while other members may want to make additional points.  We asked about the EPA data relating to testing water supplies for illicit or illegal drugs.  The agency confirms there is an issue but nothing on the scale of London or Amsterdam because we do not source most of our water from rivers in the cities.  The vast majority of urban wastewater discharges are located in coastal or estuary areas, with none of it located downstream from any of these plants.  The agency is doing a study on it but it will be nothing like on the scale we have seen in other European cities.  There is a detailed report on landfill sites licensed by the EPA, unlicensed sites, historical land sites, private landfills, illegal landfills and a lot of great information that will be of interest to people.  There is a lot of information on the radon strategy and details of costs that we had requested and there is information on the river basin catchment areas.</p> <p>  The EPA also gives information on the emissions trading scheme, which is interesting.  It states that overall emissions of greenhouse gases from Irish power generation and industrial companies in the EU decreased by 4.8% in 2017 and a further 8% in 2018.  The decrease in emissions is due to a significant drop in power generation emissions of 13.9% as a result of the ESB Moneypoint coal-fired plant being offline.  That happened by accident and the EPA is taking credit for the place being closed but it is a fact that emissions are down.  Conversely, greenhouse gas emissions from the main industrial sources increased in 2018 from 2017, with the cement industry recording a 4.7% increase, dairy a 3.6% increase and the pharmagen industry an 8.8% increase.  The EPA states that this is on account of economic growth and that a wide group of industries contributed to the increase.  Emissions from aviation showed a 6.8% increase in 2018, arising from flights in and out of Ireland but also flights anywhere in the EU where the aircraft carrier has an operating licence from the Irish Aviation Authority, including Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  It means that emissions from Ryanair flights across Europe are booked in Ireland so it is important that people understand it is not all as simple as it seems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#D00600"><p>That is why I am putting it on the public record.  The public might not appreciate the significant nuances around this.  We also asked about enforcement.  Up to 2018, all operators were fully compliant with their obligations but in 2018, two operators failed to comply with their obligations to surrender emissions trading allowances to cover their emissions for 2017.  The two operators were St. James's Hospital and Vodafone.  The EPA proceeded with enforcement action under EU regulations which resulted in a penalty for St. James's Hospital of &euro;210,000 and the agency is working with St. James's Hospital on a payment plan.  It is extraordinary that our health services are involved in non-compliance with EU emissions trading regulations.  The penalty for Vodafone was &euro;51,000, which has been paid in full.</p> <p>  The final point was on a question I asked about whether people applying for planning permission had to apply for a waste licence first.</p><p>It says that people can do either but the EPA is required in cases involving an environment impact assessment or an environmental impact assessment report to ensure that the grant of planning permission has been made before they grant the licence.  We will note and publish that comprehensive reply and I thank the EPA.  It is an example of an organisation which comes before the committee with good information and which comes back with a comprehensive reply when asked for information.  We would like all other State organisations to follow suit and to do so in a timely manner, as the EPA has done.  We will note and publish that.  </p><p> No. 2185 B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 22 May 2019, provides comparative information requested by the committee regarding the cost of accommodating individuals in direct provision centres and in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.  We will note and publish this.  It relates to how much money someone residing in a nursing home can retain for personal use and a comparison with how much a person living in direct provision has for personal use.  I think it is approximately &euro;30 in both cases.  </p><p> No. 2186 B is from Mr. Mark O'Mahony, commissioner, the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 22 May 2019, provides clarification requested by the committee in relation to the bimonthly progress update which we considered at our last meeting on 16 May 2019.  I did not understand its contents.  The commission is saying that when it came before the committee last year, the number of cases on hand had a total quantum of &euro;1.7 billion.  I emphasise, that is not necessarily &euro;1.7 billion due in tax, some of it might have been paid and there might be refunds due.  Cases with a value of &euro;2.1 billion were lodged with the Tax Appeals Commission in the last week of December last year, which means it now has &euro;3.7 billion worth of cases on their books.  That is a phenomenal figure.  Two of the big ones have &euro;1.6 billion are before the courts so the commission is precluded from dealing with them until those cases have concluded.  It is an example of the complex cases arising in the commission.  We will note and publish that letter and it is good to get clarification.  </p><p> No. 2188 B is from Ms Dee Forbes, director general, RT&Eacute;, dated 24 May 2019, in response to our request for further information regarding the review of employment contracts.  Ms Forbes reiterates that the review of the 433 contractors providing services to RT&Eacute; concluded that the majority of those reviewed were appropriately engaged and classified as freelancers or contractors.  It also concluded that the cases of 157 individuals were in need of further review.  Ms Forbes advises that RT&Eacute; has commenced discussions with individual contractors and that this process will continue into the second half of 2019.  She states that RT&Eacute; cannot accept that anybody should be described as being on a "bogus self-employment" contract - a remark to that effect might have been made - and that RT&Eacute; has at all times acted in good faith with respect to this matter.  We will continue to monitor this issue and will request a further update at the end of July.</p></speech>

In other words, there is a question of whether the decision will be backdated, because there will be issues arising with pensions and so on.  We should seek clarification on that.</p></speech>

Our position is this is a policy area and an ongoing project.  No. 2171 C from an individual dated 15 May 2019 also requests the committee to undertake a detailed scrutiny of the proposed BusConnects project.  I propose we forward these items to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for whatever action it deems appropriate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2167 C from an individual dated 13 May 2019 relates to decisions related to a tourism project made by Cork County Council.  The correspondence is addressed to Cork county councillors and while the individual seems to be requesting that the Committee of Public Accounts reviews an alleged loss of public money, the local authority matters raised are not with the remit of the committee.  We will advise to the correspondent that the matter could be brought to the attention of the local authority audit service and note the item.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2169 C is from the clerk to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, dated 14 May 2019 advising the committee that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the Public Service Performance Report 2018.  We note this item.  The report has already been published.  We have seen copies of that report in recent weeks.</p> <p>  No. 2172 C from Professor Kerstin Mey, vice president, academic affairs and student engagement, University of Limerick, dated 30 April 2019 providing information requested by me as Chairman regarding grade recheck and grade appeal processes.  It was a matter I raised on behalf of a constituent and which arose out of our meeting on the regrading in the University of Limerick.  I propose we note the item and write to the correspondent that the information supplied by the university is all we have been able to extract.  It goes back to 2011 and there is no mechanism to regrade those exam papers at this stage.  </p> <p>  No. 2182 C is from an individual dated 17 May 2019 in relation to an alternative site for the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We will take that correspondence on board when we do our periodic report on that matter and note the item.</p> <p>  No. 2184 C is from Deputy David Cullinane dated 20 May 2019 in relation to Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s evidence to the committee regarding a particular case within an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As mentioned earlier, the Commissioner has corrected the record and we note that.  As we already have dealt with that particular issue, we will ask the secretariat to let the Deputy know we have dealt with it.</p> <p>  No 2177 C is from Mr. Allen Morgan, dated 16 May 2019 inquiring about his attendance at a private meeting of the committee in relation to the management of State-owned property by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We had previously advised that this item is on our work programme but due to other pressing business, we have not been in a position to schedule a meeting.  He wrote following the committee's discussion of the Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street.  We discussed that and other matters relating to the OPW in detail.  We have written our periodic report and made our conclusions on the matter.  Mr. Morgan has information on other projects, including Thornton Hall and the property in Fairgreen in Galway, Nos. 91 to 93 Merrion Square, a Mullingar site and Batty Langley Lodge, in relation to overspending.  That goes back over a long period.  He is asking if we will invite him into a meeting and to conclude one way or another as he has other things to move on to.  We can thank him for his input.  We have taken everything he said on board and have considered it as part of our periodic report.  We will return to the OPW again in the autumn.  The information he supplied will help us in our work when we return to the OPW on the next occasion.  I do not think that there is time between now and the recess for a meeting on this issue.  He has asked us to let him know if we are not proceeding and I think we should.  That is my suggestion.</p></speech>

This man has made considerable effort to inform us.  He has gone to great trouble and gone out on a limb.  That is important.  He is asking us to make a quick decision which is difficult for us in our work programme.  He did ask to meet us and I believe we did agree to do so in theory.  Perhaps I am wrong.  The issues he is raising are not merely historic.  He is raising processes and he is also talking about the inadequate, according to him, financial model under which the Office of Public Work operates.  I am no expert.  I can only read it and note the concerns.  I will be guided by the committee but we should listen to him and take it from there.</p></speech>

We have gone through an awful lot in relation to the OPW, I understand that, but as Deputy Connolly noted, there are issues involved which are ongoing.  If the modelling by which the OPW does its work continues, it could have similar problems into the future.  That is a real issue and concern.  There must be some forum on this.  Much work was done.</p><p>He is raising valid issues and I would hate to be left in a situation in years to come whereby, because of what he is raising and the modelling not changing, further issues arise.  Given the volume of effort he has made - he has gone out on a limb - there has to be some process by which we at least give him an outlet to air the matter.  Then we can make decisions and move on, or not.</p></speech>

We will check that directly with him.  If his preference is to have a private meeting, we will have it some afternoon.  There will be some afternoon when we will be finished to 3.30 p.m. or some such time.</p></speech>

There is no point in meeting and not doing anything about it afterwards.  We have to timetable in such a way that we meet the individual and then follow up, but we need to know what the follow-up is likely to be.  Could we get any correspondence we have on this in advance of the meeting?  There are matters concerning the OPW in regard to some of the work, for example, on historical buildings where the contingency is set at a certain level.  The position is not realistic.  It is very hard to see how a Department can budget for works if there are flaws.  There are a number of issues that merit full understanding, not just a meeting for us to gain an understanding.  It is a matter of our gaining an understanding in order to do something.  That is what we have got to decide.</p></speech>

Will we contact Mr. Morgan directly with a view to setting up a meeting?  It will be on a Thursday afternoon.  We can determine whether he wants a public or private meeting.  It he wants a private meeting, we will go private.  If he wants a public meeting, we will have it in public.  It will be on a Thursday afternoon.  That would probably be the best.</p></speech>

If there are ten of us or three of us, the meeting can proceed.  That is why I am suggesting a Thursday.  I thank Mr. Morgan for his continued communication with the committee on this issue.  Obviously, he has a lot of experience.</p><p>The next correspondence is No. 2178 C, from the European Lotto Betting Association, which is requesting a meeting with the committee.  This matter is not within our remit.  The licence was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Perhaps it is a justice issue.  I believe it is about gambling.  We will write back.  It is certainly not within our remit to hear the association's views.  It has probably written to every Deputy and its representatives are probably meeting Deputies individually.  We will let them proceed as they are doing on that matter.</p><p>No. 2180C is from Deputy Niall Collins on behalf of an individual.  It concerns a donation to the Irish Cancer Society in Kerry.  This matter is not within the remit of the committee and I propose that we advise the Deputy accordingly.</p><p><b></b>No. 2189C, from Ms Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is a response to a request from the committee on foot of correspondence from an individual alleging a waste of public moneys by the authority.  The authority provides a comprehensive response to the remarks.  I propose to send the response to the correspondent.  It concerns the production of CDs for the visually impaired.  We dealt with this previously.</p><p>The final correspondence, No. 2151B, will take a few minutes to deal with but I want to try to clear the decks on it.  We will move fairly quickly.  It is the minute from the Minister for Finance.  It concerns our periodic report for the May-July period.  We can move quite quickly on this.  It would be remiss of us, in view of the time, our issuing of our report and the time it took the Department of Finance to report back to us, not to move expeditiously.  Members need not take out the previous report.  It had 29 recommendations, I believe.  I will make a fleeting reference to those we need to think about and then make an observation.</p><p>The first recommendation was for the Department of Finance and concerned a target for presenting the annual financial statements by all organisations.  The recommendation is accepted and the Department will draft a new circular, which will be incorporated.</p><p>The next recommendation is that Departments should ensure circulars are fully complied with.  That is in regard to the timeline for accounts.  The first recommendation concerned presenting for audit and the second concerned laying before the Oireachtas after audit.  It is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation was to the Higher Education Authority to ensure boards or bodies under its remit have the range of competencies necessary to carry out their functions.  We mentioned the finance area.  The recommendation is accepted by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills.  The boards are now being requested to ensure they have a balance of skills and experience.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, it is a requirement that the boards agree with the HSE the competence required of external board members.  That is important and that is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation states, &quot;The Committee recommends that where a public body is not totally satisfied that it can conduct an internal investigation objectively, it should recuse itself or, in the case of a protected disclosure, use the services available under the Office of Government Procurement's Framework Agreement for the Receipt and Investigation of Protected Disclosures.&quot;  That is accepted.  The framework is in place.  It is a multi-sector framework.  The recommendation is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform consider measures to prevent unnecessary expenditure resulting from public bodies competing against each other in the purchase of buildings.  That happened in Cork in respect of two institutions.  The Department has noted the recommendation.  It is stated each organisation has a right to bid for a property if it comes on the market but the officials are saying they are trying to co-ordinate.  They see the merit but cannot prevent organisations from looking at property.</p></speech>

Part of this process is that we do not necessarily accept or agree with every response we get from the Minister.  That is his response and it is not as strong as we would have liked.  He says he is captured by the legislation and cannot prevent them, but we are saying some mechanism is required in the Department for a level of liaison.  It is about protecting taxpayers' money.  We will draft a letter accordingly.  We might have one or two more observations.</p></speech>

In Galway, the Corrib Great Southern Hotel is owned by the State.  Beside it is the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, which is struggling for accommodation.  The State sells the hotel and it ends up in liquidation.  It is in private hands again and the State is seeking to buy it back.  They are beside each other.  It could not be a more acute picture of idiocy and madness.  The hotel remains empty to this day.  It was owned by the State and is located beside an institution that is struggling.  Is it not a bigger issue regarding acquiring public buildings and Departments talking to each other?  The hotel should not have been sold in the first instance.  It should have been acquired by the Department of Education and Skills.  This is happening throughout the country.</p></speech>

In every town and city in Ireland there are various approved housing bodies funded by the State competing with each other to buy sites so they can build their houses and units.  They are driving up the prices.  It is happening everywhere now.  Approved housing bodies and local authorities are often competing against each other.  I saw it happen recently.  That is a big point to which we will return.  What we have touched on is the tip of the iceberg.  That is all we can say at present.  We can come back to it.  We will draft a response to that particular recommendation.</p><p>The next recommendation is: &quot;There is a lack of transparency in relation to the companies which have an association with the Higher Education Institutes.&quot;  It states the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to accounts and financial statements and the Minister is aware of all the reports.  Our earlier discussion dealt with that point and we will follow it up on that basis.</p><p>The next item is a recommendation relating to the Office of Government Procurement &quot;to ensure that they have the necessary controls in place to allow themselves sufficient time to develop specifications ...&quot;.  This followed the roll-over of an ICT contract in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was caught as it did not have time.  The Minister accepts what we said.  The next recommendation is on the same point.  There is the broader issue and the specific issue.  It states that the Department of Justice and Equality is informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the recommendation is accepted.  It also states that in 2019 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a planned update of the Garda procurement guidelines and will run training courses on this.  It states it is also governed by future planning in &quot;A Policing Service for the Future&quot; and these issues are included in it.  We note that.</p><p>The next recommendation was on prepayments and procurement guidelines.  That involved making advance payments where there are ICT contracts.  We are told it is the industry norm but there can be a risk to the taxpayer.  The financial status of the companies should be checked.  The Department accepts the recommendation.  We will keep an eye on that.</p><p>The next recommendation was that &quot;the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform uses a more nuanced approach to recruitment expenditure planning to ensure that initial headline savings do not result in additional costs in the long term&quot;.  We are saying that due to the public sector employment embargo there is a lack of skilled resources in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department notes that recommendation.  It likes it, but it is subject to Exchequer pay ceilings.  That is probably the answer we expected.</p><p>In Recommendation A.11 the committee &quot;recommends that the Commissioner takes the necessary steps to ensure that the governance structures and systems in place within AGS are understood by all and supported at the highest levels&quot;.  This is accepted and the recommendation will be taken forward as part of the Policing and Community Safety Bill, replacing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  That will come before the Oireachtas in due course.</p><p>The next recommendation is important.  People will be interested in the fair deal issue.  We had an issue regarding the nursing homes and we had asked if there was value for money.  The Department of Health commenced a value for money report.  It has noted our Recommendation A.12.  A number of the recommendations flow together.  It states that the Department of Health is currently undertaking a value for money review of nursing home care costs - a comparison of private and public sector care costs.  Members will be surprised to hear the following:</p><blockquote>A number of critical technical issues has arisen which has delayed the work of the Steering Committee and Review Committee.  Following legal advice the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was not in a position to provide the detailed data requested by the Department, given data protection concerns.  Subsequent to this, the Department's legal advisors and the NTPF's legal team agreed an approach that would allow the provision of high level aggregated data, consistent with legal obligations.</blockquote> <p>Clearly, the information that is required to examine the value for money is within a State organisation but data protection is preventing the National Treatment Purchase Fund giving granular information to the Department team to provide a good report and recommendations.  This is dreadful.</p><p>It goes on to say that the most cited reason for cost differential is that public nursing homes have a much greater cohort of high dependence residents.  The Department will do a sample to determine if the resources provided are aligned with care needs.  It will only do a sample.  Then it says that this will extend the timeline further.  It will take time to complete the value for money report, &quot;but without this data the VFM Review would have to rely on hypotheses to explain a significant element of the cost differential.  To proceed without the data may have significantly undermined any conclusions and/or findings reached by the VFM&quot;.  Essentially, it is saying that this is being said but it has no evidence to support that hearsay.  Despite what has been said by successive Ministers about the higher dependency it is saying it has no data or evidence anywhere to support that statement.  It is what everybody thinks, but one cannot do a report on that basis.</p><p>It states that due to the body of work required to acquire sufficient data, a revised completion date at the end of 2019 is now proposed.  However, it is already acknowledging that it will not have the necessary granular data to carry out a detailed report due to the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am putting this on the public record because many people are asking when we will get the report on this issue.  Many self-employed people who have assets want to see this report.</p></speech>

I ask the Members of the Oireachtas to follow up on this matter through mechanisms other than this committee because we will be told it is not the business of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is, because it affects costs.  I outlined it to put it on the record.  That was the value for money report.  We also spoke about a separate report.  The committee recommended that the National Treatment Purchase Fund review its pricing mechanism.  This response to the committee was probably drafted several weeks ago but it states that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and aims to discuss the draft report in the early part of this year.  Once complete, the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department for consideration and for publication later in 2019.</p> <p>  There are two different reports.  One is the value for money report and the other is the pricing report.  We have seen neither yet and members can see some of the complications.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private voluntary nursing homes is ongoing.</p><p>That was one of the committee's recommendations last autumn and the Department is now saying that report is almost concluded.  The pricing report, how much the nursing home has been paid, is a different issue from the value of money between public and private.  It appears to me there are two, separate and independent mechanisms.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Chairman is familiar with the single assessment tool which the HSE uses for home care assessment.  It was run as a pilot project.  It takes at least two to three hours to administer it through a questionnaire from a computer.  One's dependency is being assessed on a computer with a single assessment tool.  It is time consuming.  I am only giving an example and I know I am discussing minutiae here.  The HSE is delaying things.  The HSE is meeting people and doing a single assessment tool assessment on them with a computer and a standardised questionnaire.</p> <p>  Clinical judgment, whereby a doctor and a nurse will say a patient needs this or that, seems to have gone out the window.  We are back to a computer and special assessment tool.  I can give two specific examples of results from that process for people who were looking for home care in Galway.  One person was in their early 60s and suffered from early-onset dementia and has qualified for ten hours' home help as a result of that single assessment tool.  </p> <p>  I have lost the Chairman's attention and I understand that.  I am talking about minutiae but it is difficult to look at that single assessment tool because it raises all sorts of other issues as to what is happening with our health system and our approach to looking after our people.  I would not like a member of my family or a colleague to be assessed by a computer using that single assessment tool.  I would like to rely on somebody's clinical judgment and expertise as a nurse or doctor.  That is a separate point and is impertinent of me.</p></speech>

I am aware of organisations that are struggling with the obligations imposed on them by GDPR and finding the correct approach to take.  It has certainly made administration of personal data much more complicated and there is a higher risk for organisations.  I cannot comment on specifics because I have not looked at the nature of the data they are looking for and, obviously, it would be for the Data Protection Commissioner to issue a judgment on a matter such as that.</p> <p>  To complicate matters further, I have said previously that I am doing a special report on the costs of nursing home care.  I am expecting to put a draft to the relevant organisations shortly and I aim to finish it over the summer.  There may be a plethora of reports in this area.</p> <p>  It is complicated and I am trying to create a framework into which all of these individual pieces will fit so that there is a structure that will help to approach the issues that are raised.

We will say that is moving.  Many people are inquiring about that value for money report and it is useful to put out information when we have it.</p> <p>  The next recommendation was that the HSE take steps to develop a protocol to ensure that all residents of nursing homes can avail of medical services when residing in nursing homes.  That recommendation is noted.  This is about the issue of transport to appointments and the Department of Health states that there is no statutory requirement on the HSE to provide transport.  It provides some ambulance services on a discretionary basis.  It is not a core health service and is not covered by the basket of services in the medical card or the nursing home support scheme.  The Department also goes on to state that the nursing home support scheme covers some living expenses.  Residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home.  In recognition of this, anybody in receipt of financial support can retain 20% of their income.  The Department is actually saying that, if a patient needs transport to a medical appointment, he or she can use that 20%.  That is dreadful but it is what the Department says.</p> <p>  The next recommendation was that the Government develops a clear, multi-annual plan to meet the commitment to contribute 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development assistance by 2030.  This is accepted by the Government and there is a plan in place to do all that.</p> <p>  The next item relates to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is about passports and the difficulties the Department had last year.  We asked the Department to publicise the fact that passport renewal application is the fastest way of doing it.  The Department accepts this recommendation and, in line with our recommendation, it has been extremely active in publicising this.  I think the Department appreciated the input from Members of the Oireachtas on the passport service when we had Department representatives before the committee early last summer.  That is good.  </p> <p>  There was a further recommendation that the Department hire more staff for this year.  It accepts that recommendation and says additional full-time staff have already been recruited and the Department will continue to monitor operational requirements.  We will see how this year goes.  It has not reached the deluge yet.</p> <p>  The next item is the recommendation that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade values the rental and leasing of property abroad versus purchasing of same.  It accepts the recommendation.  It will continue to do that and will continue, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to examine the benefits of each in order to decide which is most suitable.  That is fair enough.</p> <p>  The next item is the international election observation roster.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts the recommendation to have the necessary procedures in place to establish a panel in adequate time.  The Department will, in 2019, undertake a review of the operation including the optimal panel duration.  The Department has said it is actually acting on that.</p> <p>  The next item brings us to the Department of Finance.  We mentioned the Tax Appeals Commission earlier.  This recommendation is that adequate, evidence-based planning takes place in advance of the establishment of any new public body.  The point is, essentially, that the Tax Appeals Commission was set up without a proper plan and without knowing the extent of its workforce.  The Department looked at the number of appeals that were there but, when a new office is set up, it attracts appeals.  I do not think that was taken into account.  The Department accepts the point and, in future, bodies will take it into account.  The committee's point is well made.</p> <p>  The next one was the workload and operations review of the Tax Appeals Commission and that its recommendations are implemented on a timely basis.  That recommendation is accepted and the Department and Tax Appeals Commission are in frequent contact, as mentioned earlier in correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is the amount of tax under appeal at any time and that the committee recommends measurable targets be set for the Tax Appeals Commission.  That is accepted by the Tax Appeals Commission and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and they are working on the procurement of a new IT system to help facilitate the management of cases.</p> <p>  The next item is about outstanding taxes and is a recommendation to the Minister for Finance.  The committee recommends that Revenue reviews its approach to the collection of outstanding taxes with a view to identifying initiatives such as increasing the number of taxpayers in phased payment method arrangements in order to accelerate the receipt of collectable taxes.  Revenue accepts this and says that it has updated statistics.  It has improved and a new debt management service application was due to commence last month.  I am hoping that will prove beneficial.</p> <p>  The next item is about cases of tax defaulters that are published.  It became very clear to us, to remind people, that 289 tax settlements, totalling &euro;53 million were published in 2017 and 91, which is 30%, had unpaid amounts of &euro;25 million.</p><p>In other words, when they publish the tax defaulters showing the amount due, does it show whether it was ever collected or not? The committee recommends that in addition to publishing the tax settlement amounts, Revenue would consider publishing details of the amounts subsequently paid and outstanding balances and it does not accept this.  This is an issue on which people may have a view.  The Department accepts that Revenue is very strict but that legislation does not provide for this measure specifically and if it is to be done, it requires legislation.  If legislation is to be changed then all aspects must be taken into account such as taxpayer confidentiality, the balance of the good versus the bad and the fairness of it.  I believe that as we have already agreed in legislation to publish the person's name and the amount, it would not be a major step to publish the same person's name, the original amount and the amount ultimately collected.  That could be an amendment to the Finance Bill if anybody wants one.  It is a legislative matter.</p></speech>

I will think about it, seeing as I raised it.</p> <p>  Ireland's national debt stood at approximately &euro;198.7 billion at the end of 2017.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#J01000"><p>When one takes personal debt into account, Ireland is next to Japan in the world figures.</p> <p>  I will now turn to recommendation A.26.  The committee recommended that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, publishes a list of housing completions on at least a quarterly basis.  The idea is that the statistical information gathering is not last century but is prior to the last century.  The Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform is informed that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is part of the NTMA, accepts the recommendation.  It has published housing completions for the year end 2018 and a report was published in February.</p> <p>  The committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance to public bodies to ensure the short-term benefits of leasing of properties are not given undue emphasis when compared with those that outright acquisition may offer.  Again, this recommendation is noted and the Department gives the various factors it takes into account in that regard.  The committee will keep that matter under consideration.</p> <p>  The committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carries out a review of public bodies whose claims are not managed by the State Claims Agency, with a view to extending the remit of the State Claims Agency to such bodies.  The response says that the committee will be aware that it is a matter for the relevant Minister to consider which agencies will come in under that.  The Department does not comment "Yes" or "No".  It says that it is a matter for each Minister.  The committee approached this due to what came to light during our report, which is that all the voluntary hospitals and section 38 organisations - that receive some &euro;4 billion in taxpayers' money - come in under the State Claims Agency.  The committee had pointed out that local authorities are similar in their scale of activity and we asked why they do not also come in under the State Claims Agency in order to have one management structure for all the claims.  We are aware that Irish Public Bodies Insurance is the body the county councils have set among themselves to monitor those claims.  There is, however, very little public transparency in that regard.  It is a private company.  The freedom of information issue has been before the courts.  The committee will come back to this issue because there is a lack of transparency for the public on that.  We can revisit this recommendation again when representatives of the State Claims Agency are before the committee.</p> <p>  The Committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Development Finance Agency should carry out a review of the impact of significant events, such as the collapse of Carillion, on public private partnerships, in order to document what lessons can be learned.  The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform accepts this recommendation.  In addition, the response says that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs an interdepartmental steering committee on public private partnership, PPP, projects and that the building of the schools will go ahead.  The public private partnership issue is on the agenda of this committee and we have taken the decision that we can never sign off on any Department accounts in which there is a significant PPP contract because if we do not get the information, we cannot have sight of what it is we are discussing and we cannot express an opinion on whether the contract is good, bad or indifferent with regard to value for money.  When a contract has been signed and is up and running, such as with the motorways, then commercial confidentiality has to cease after a certain period of time.  It cannot continue for the 25 years to the end of the project.  That is an issue we will come back to.</p> <p>  I wanted to get it off those items off the agenda for now.  It is a big item of correspondence.  Is there any other business before we suspend today to allow or witnesses to come in?</p> <p>  On statements and accounts received since the last meeting, we note the clear audited opinion of the Western Development Commission.</p></speech>

It goes back to when the committee took a position on the establishment of a committee of inspection for the liquidation.  To date that has been, effectively, ignored by the Department of Finance.  I accept that people may not have had time to read it yet, and while it was commissioned by a third party, Professor Gurdgiev's report very much supports that proposal.  The report indicates that without such a committee of inspection, it is not possible for us to really be sure of value for money in that process.  The periodic report is as per other periodic reports.  One is heading for &euro;306 million in expenditure in this regard.  The level of transparency around the liquidation would not be remotely like that for a standard liquidation.  There is an awful lot of stuff that is not there at all.  Professor Gurdgiev's report makes recommendations and suggestions on how we might go about that, which is very much in keeping with our own position on this over the past couple of years.</p><p>We could usefully do the State some service by inviting Professor Constantin Gurdgiev to come in here and tease out some of his proposals and hope that the Department of Finance, which has not acted heretofore to establish a committee of inspection to give the appropriate oversight to this liquidation, may yet do so. </p><p>   There is an ongoing case where the applicant is just seeking the same thing we are and the State is defending the case.  I am sure we will raise the issue with departmental officials when they come in.  We came across correspondence, which I shared, where the Office of the Chief State Solicitor offered the Committee of Public Accounts an olive branch, apart from that.  One of my questions when the officials come in is: how much money has been spent so far on defending the case?  Why can heads not be cracked together, make the appropriate improvements, get rid of this unnecessary case that is before the courts and give the public the level of oversight that they require?  This is the most expensive liquidation in the history of the State and is probably comparable with the largest in Europe, and oversight is non-existent.</p></speech>

Given the cost that the public have paid for the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, there is a public obligation to make sure that we have some oversight of the assets that were liquidated.  It would be helpful to have these experts before the committee.  I support the idea that there should have been a committee of inspection.  The problem is that while this court case delays oversight, the liquidations are continuing and it will become almost a moot point if we do not have some change at this stage.  This would be a very helpful way to move it on.  I concur that this should not be playing out in the courts and that the Committee of Public Accounts should routinely have oversight.</p></speech>

In addition the financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as part 2 of the finance accounts.  The accounts for 2017 were certified by me on 28 June 2018.  I can inform the committee that the accounts for 2018 are expected to be certified in or around the same timeframe this year.</p> <p>  Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of the public services is designed to summarise the transactions on the Central Fund recorded in the finance accounts in a more accessible format and to highlight relevant trends in such transactions.  In addition, because the finance accounts do not include any kind of statement of financial position, the chapter provides an overview of key Exchequer assets and liabilities at the year end.  Exchequer receipts in 2017 totalled &euro;58.4 billion, representing an increase of &euro;3.3 billion, or 6%, compared with 2016.  Issues from the Central Fund in 2017 amounted to &euro;56.5 billion, which was a year-on-year increase of &euro;395 million, or just under 1%.  The surplus of receipts relative to issues for the year was &euro;1.9 billion.  The gross national debt stood at just under &euro;199 billion at the end of 2017.  This was marginally higher than at the end of 2016.  The cost of servicing the national debt fell from &euro;6.8 billion in 2016 to &euro;6.2 billion in 2017.  That was a drop of 9% year on year.  This reflects the impact of the refinancing of debt by the National Treasury Management Agency.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that in 2017 the Department of Finance commenced publication of an annual report on public debt in Ireland.  This provides useful information and commentary on the composition and evolution of Irish Government debt, on measures of debt sustainability, and on progress towards achievement of debt targets.  As a consequence, I have reduced my own reporting on the public debt, which was intended to address the previous information gap.</p> <p>  Turning to the special report, in addition to many other responsibilities, the Department of Finance represents Ireland&rsquo;s interest in the EU budgetary process and EU policy formulation.  Schedules to the finance accounts show payments from the Exchequer to the EU and receipts into the Exchequer from the EU.  However, this is only a partial view of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions from the EU, which flow through many sets of financial statements.  In fact, there is no single source that gives a complete overview of such transactions.  Against the background of Brexit, negotiations for a new EU multi-annual financial framework and European Parliament elections, I felt it might be useful to provide such an overview.  This resulted in the special report before the committee today.</p> <p>  As the figure which can now be brought on screen indicates, financially Ireland was a net beneficiary of the EU up to 2014.  Since then, Ireland has received marginally less than it has contributed.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU budget is linked substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s economic activity levels, with elements related to VAT collected, customs duties imposed in Ireland, and gross national income levels.  The Irish contribution in 2017 totalled &euro;2 billion.  The Department of Finance has projected that the contribution is likely to increase significantly in future years.  Ireland received a total of &euro;1.8 billion in EU funding in 2017.  Over 80% of the amount received was in respect of agriculture and rural development.  As members are aware, this funding makes a significant contribution to the viability of farming in Ireland.  Approximately 90% of EU funding received in 2017 was administered through central government Departments.  The remaining 10% went directly from the EU to public bodies, bodies in the private sector in Ireland or was spent on EU bodies operating in Ireland.  I recommended that there should be annual reporting on a consolidated basis of Ireland&rsquo;s EU transactions, but the Accounting Officer was not convinced of the need for this.</p> <p>  The 2017 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records gross expenditure of &euro;34 million.  There was a net underspend of &euro;7.2 million, relative to the Estimate, which was for surrender at the year end.  The appropriation account presents expenditure under three expenditure programmes.  These relate to the costs incurred in 2017 in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent &euro;18.9 million, banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent &euro;8.1 million, and provision of shared services, on which the Department spent &euro;7.1 million.</p><p>The expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation account does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.</p><p> The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann each year with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Chapter 22 is my report for 2017.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the council&rsquo;s financial statements for 2017 when it incurred expenditure of &euro;607,000.</p></speech>

The items on today&rsquo;s agenda are chapters 1 and 22 from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017, the appropriation accounts 2017 - Vote 7, the finance accounts 2017, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.</p> <p>  The Estimate for the Department of Finance for 2017 was set at &euro;40.8 million, that is, &euro;39.5 million net of appropriations-in-aid available and the capital carryover of &euro;200,000.  The net outturn for 2017 was &euro;32.5 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;7.2 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in a pay bill underspend of approximately &euro;600,000.  The 2017 pay bill estimate was based on a headcount of 329 staff and, by comparison, the average number of staff during 2017 was 307.  At the end of 2017, staff numbers stood at 310.  Some &euro;2.8 million of underspend occurred on non-pay administration expenses, &euro;2.2 million of which was due to capital projects not proceeding during the year.  There was also an underspend of approximately &euro;3.6 million on programme related costs arising from lower legal and consultancy costs of &euro;3 million during the year, mainly in regard to the shareholding and financial advisory division of the Department, savings of &euro;500,000 in regard to the disabled drivers fuel grant scheme, given a total of 13,321 claimants received an average grant of &euro;704 in 2017, and some &euro;93,000 that was returned to the Exchequer relating to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.</p> <p>  In terms of the Exchequer financial outturn, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2017, at &euro;50.7 billion, were up &euro;2.9 billion, or 6%, year on year and &euro;100 million, or 0.2%, above profile.  In regard to income tax, which is the largest tax head, the performance in 2017 was solid, with receipts finishing the year 1.2%, or &euro;236 million, below profile.  However, this represents an annual increase of 4.4%, or &euro;840 million.  Corporation tax receipts in 2017 of &euro;8.2 billion were &euro;500 million, or 6.3%, above the budget forecast for that year.  VAT returns saw a strong 7.1% annual increase in 2017 and were broadly in line with profile in that they were under by 0.5%, or &euro;72 million.  Total VAT collected during 2017 was &euro;13.3 billion.  The major consumption tax heading, excises, was just below profile by 1%, or &euro;60 million, and &euro;5.9 billion was collected.  This represented a 3.7%, or &euro;214 million, year-on-year increase.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at a gross &euro;58.5 billion, was &euro;29 million above profile.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to provide independent assessments of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary plans and projections and to inform public discussion of economic and fiscal matters.  A joint memorandum of understanding exists between the council and the Department underpinning the endorsement process of the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by the Department upon which the budget and stability programme updates are based.  The council is funded from the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The funding ceiling for 2017 was &euro;800,000.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report presents an overview of the transactions, contributions, receipts and financial corrections relating to Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU during 2017.  I welcome this report, which makes an important contribution to helping to improve understanding of how the EU budget works.  My Department has engaged with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on an ongoing basis over the past year or so on various issues related to the report, including the single recommendation that there should be annual reporting on a consolidated basis of all contributions and receipts from the EU.  As stated in the correspondence over that time, I remain open to having a further discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General on this issue and, in that regard, I have started an internal scoping exercise on how we might make progress towards greater consolidation.  In due course, should we decide to report on a consolidated basis, all relevant Departments would need to be involved to assess fully the implications of the preparation of such a report.</p> <p>  I turn now to some departmental performance outputs in recent years.  The Department completed its Statement of Strategy 2017-2020 and we continue to work towards achieving two broad goals: a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances, and a balanced and equitable economy, enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well-regulated financial sector.  The successful initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June 2017 was the second biggest in the world at the time and raised &euro;3.4 billion for the taxpayer.  This has created a strong platform for the State to recover all of the money it has invested in AIB over time.  In December 2017, Ireland repaid its remaining programme related loans to the IMF, together with the bilateral loans from Sweden and Denmark, early and in full.  The Department published an action plan in 2017 under the Government&rsquo;s strategy for international financial services.  In 2017, 2,000 jobs were created under the strategy.</p> <p>  Climate change has been identified by the Department as a risk to the sustainability of the public finances and the health of the wider economy.  In this regard, the Department supported the NTMA&rsquo;s launch of Ireland&rsquo;s first sovereign green bond on 10 October 2018.  A rainy day fund has been established to protect against severe economic shocks.  It will be seeded with an initial &euro;1.5 billion contribution from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The Government announced it is setting aside some of the historically high levels of corporation tax, with a contribution of &euro;500 million per annum being provided for this year.</p> <p>  Since 2015, modest and sustainable annual increases in expenditure have been implemented.  This approach, underpinned by growing and broad-based tax revenues, is targeted at delivering ongoing, sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  I am encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 6.7% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland remains one of the fastest growing economies in the EU and the recovery in the economy is seen most clearly in the labour market.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment, which has fallen from a peak of over 16% in 2012 to a rate of 4.6% in the last quarter.</p> <p>  The prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position, most notably through the improvement in competitiveness and growth in employment.  As a result, Ireland continues to maintain its A grade rating with each of the three major credit rating agencies.  However, we are now at or about what is termed full employment, and the economy is likely to be at, or close to, capacity.  With uncertainty in the global economic and trade environment and the reality of Brexit, we face a different set of challenges in managing economic and fiscal policy in the coming years.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union will impose significant costs on the Irish economy.  The question of how costly depends on the exact form that exit takes, whether orderly or disorderly.  While the ratification of the withdrawal agreement remains the Government&rsquo;s preferred outcome, it is not possible to assign an exact probability to the different forms of UK exit at present.  In recognition of this, the broad strategy has been to assume an orderly exit, but simultaneously to plan for a disorderly exit.  Brexit issues are mainstreamed into the Department&rsquo;s work in all areas, including economic analysis, financial services and taxation.</p> <p>  Before concluding, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention and welcome any follow-up questions.</p></speech>

I do not think there has ever been a state aid case across Europe where &euro;14.3 billion has been recovered.  This is one of the reasons that use of an escrow and having that negotiated between the State and the company and approved by the Commission became so important.  If one simply placed &euro;14.3 billion on deposit at negative interest rates rather than put it into a fund that will be managed by agreement across the parties, the State would be looking at very large cashflow losses in the short term.  This is an exceptional amount.  I do not think there has ever been anything of this level.  The reason that we use an escrow is that the money goes in, it is managed against an investment and whatever is left, whether there is an increase or a decrease, settles the full amount, rather than put all the risk on the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I would contrast that with the potential cashflow loss from a negative interest rate in a year, which could have been as much as &euro;60 million.  Those are the costs associated with it.</p></speech>

These costs run from 2014 onwards.  In terms of the Department's spend, we have spent about &euro;2.3 million on legal services, &euro;90,000 on translations because the documentation can be in French, and other expenditure of about &euro;65,000.  The predominant cost in the &euro;2.5 million figure is legal services.  The CSSO and Revenue have probably incurred expenses as well.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does a report twice a year.  It makes recommendations but they are mostly in the policy space so it would be more for Government rather than officials.  There are some recommendations that it makes, for instance, to improve the macroeconomic forecasts or to do this, that and the other, most of which would have been implemented.  I will try to track down which two have not been implemented and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It has been suggested that we are reliant on the significant revenues from corporation tax, which have been increasing over recent years.  It seems that we are particularly reliant on the moneys generated by the top ten corporates.  I note that the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners stated in an article that a number of companies move in and out of the top ten contributors to our corporate tax take.  He argued that this provides some level of security.  I would like to refer to the overruns in the Department of Health, our exposure to Brexit, our current expenditure path and our current growth rate.  Mr. Moran used a dangerous term in his opening statement when he said that "economic fundamentals are strong".  Many people have perished on that previously.</p></speech>

The Department has been told that there have been concerns about our concentration on corporation tax for several years.  We have not been behind the door about that.  The historic long-run average contribution of corporation tax to our overall tax take has been approximately 14%, but it is now up around 19%.  This has to be a cause of prudence and concern.  We have to watch it.  Some of the consequences of the global tax reform that has been happening have made Ireland a more attractive proposition for multinationals.  We have seen a strong performance from the global economy, which is continuing to grow.  Profitability has improved.  Other changes have also been going on.  That is why taking &euro;500 million out of that continued high performance and putting it into the rainy day fund is not a bad thing to do.  The last thing we want is for a big line of funding to disappear when we hit slightly bumpy waters.  We do not want to be totally reliant on it.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moran think this growth is sustainable, given the uncertainties associated with Brexit and our increased level of corporation tax?  I appreciate that some money is being put aside.</p></speech>

The numbers have to be taken over a four-year or five-year period.  There has been an average current expenditure increase of between 3% and 3.5%.  It has probably been slightly less in real terms.  That is below our trend growth rate, which is between 3% and 3.5% with inflation sitting on top of that.  We need to look at this in the round over a period of time.  It is absolutely the case that the last thing we want to do is see a situation in which this starts to spin out of control.  We have to be prudent about the taxes that are there.  They are not there simply to be spent, because they are vulnerable.  We need taxes we can rely on.  There was a time when domestic companies were in the top ten corporate taxpayers, but that is no longer the case.  They are all multinationals.  The top ten varies over time as new companies come in and as people use up capital allowances or losses that they might have had in the past.  The concentration of more than 40% of the corporation tax take across ten companies is not unusual from an international perspective.  While it is not unusual to have a high concentration across big companies, it is something we have to watch.</p></speech>

A couple of things arise as we head into 2020.  The prospect of a disorderly Brexit is one of those concerns.  There are simple costs associated with what Mr. McCarthy would refer to technically as the operation of the automatic stabilisers.  Unemployment would go up and tax receipts would fall as a result of a disorderly Brexit.  The cost could run to a couple of billion euro.  We need to have an eye on that.</p></speech>

We have estimated that over the medium term, a disorderly exit would take approximately five percentage points off the level of GDP.  After that decade, if there was no policy response, the deficit would be one percentage point worse than otherwise would be the case.  For regular people, this means the unemployment rate would be two percentage points higher than in our baseline scenario.  It would have an impact on growth, the public finances and the labour market, which is where people would feel it most.</p></speech>

At the moment, it is hard to say what the probability around Brexit is going to be.  In my view, we would have to be very cautious in an October budget if there was going to be a hard exit two weeks later.  We would have to act accordingly.  If a deal is eventually done and there is an orderly exit, another set of challenges arises.  We are at or about full employment.  Earnings in the economy are starting to tick up.  We are starting to see capacity pressures.  All of that would argue in favour of pumping less money into the economy, which involves containing expenditure increases and tax reductions.  A counter-cyclical budget is very much where we should be going.  I do not know whether Mr. McCarthy wants to add to or disagree with any of what I have said.</p></speech>

The answer is "everybody".  In the case of the omnibus Bill that went through, for instance, there was a massive amount of tax content in it, so the tax division was involved, and the economic division did the analysis.  Mr. Tobin and his colleagues work with the Central Bank on preparations for the financial sector.  Brexit is essentially integrated into everything we do.  We have a small co-ordination unit to bring it all together, but the entire Department is involved in the work.</p></speech>

We have heard about the mortgage tracker scandal and other issues in terms of how the banking sector has behaved.  Given that the State is still a key investor in the sector, will the witnesses explain the safeguards the Department employs in terms of its decision making?  I am talking about, for example, potentially recommending a discontinuation of loss relief in respect of corporation tax for the banking sector.  That represents a huge asset for taxation on the balance sheet and, in theory, makes our banking system more valuable for investment.  Given its status as key investor, for the State to get its money back out of the banking sector, it is in its interest that the banking sector be as valuable as it can be.</p><p>My second question relates to non-performing loans, NPLs, and the power of the Minister <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department in a situation where, say, the CEO from one of the main banks argues that the bank is under pressure from the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, to reduce its non-performing loans.  Where a lot of people are caught up in these NPLs and some of them have split mortgages, one bank may have a totally different interpretation from another bank as to what a non-performing loan is.  As a member of the finance committee, I saw on several occasions that witnesses from the main banks differed in their adjudication of what constituted a non-performing loan where people had signed agreements and got their mortgage split etc.  I am a little confused as to how the State manages the decision-making process in terms of safeguarding those competing interests.</p></speech>

We keep the banking policy entirely separate because, as the Deputy observes, one cannot have a shareholder who is looking to maximise value while at the same time making or influencing banking policy, deciding how one might look after consumers or any of those issues.  Deputy Burke is absolutely right on this point.  We have to manage that within the Department because we hold both the shares and the responsibility for the banking aspect.  At the end of the day, we have a responsibility to the taxpayer to try to get back the money we put into those banks, but we should not do so at the cost of the consumer.</p></speech>

How does the Department, representing the State as a key investor and shareholder, evaluate that and ensure it is holding the bank to account on that line?</p></speech>

The problem is that to take loss relief from one sector and make it available to everybody would not be sustainable in policy terms.  It is less to do with pressure from the banks to retain their loss relief.  What we have done is impose a bank levy of &euro;150 million to get something back by way of a contribution, and that is ongoing.</p></speech>

There is a Chinese wall between the two, for all the reasons Mr. Moran gave.  The banks operate on a commercial basis and their individual independence is protected by the relationship frameworks, which are legally binding documents.  The Department does not interfere in the commercial decision making of the individual banks.</p> <p>  In terms of the tracker mortgage investigation, it is probably the most complex investigation the Central Bank has ever undertaken.  There has been &euro;665 million of redress given out to customers to date.  Our focus is to try to ensure that what happened with tracker mortgages does not happen again.  One of the key ways in which the Minister and the Government are proposing to do that is through the Central Bank (amendment) Bill, which is being brought forward. The legislation will have three key elements, one of which is the introduction of a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, for senior managers in the banks that will allow us to pinpoint who is responsible for what function in advance in individual banks.  It can be argued that through the crisis, it was not clear exactly who was responsible for which particular part of the disastrous decision that led to X, Y or Z.  The SEAR is designed to overcome that.  There will also be new conduct standards for all financial services firms and enhancements to the fitness and probity regime and the enforcement regime.  There will, as a result, be a greater number of rules in place, which will, we hope, ensure that some of the activities we saw through the crisis, including in respect of tracker mortgages, will not happen again.</p></speech>

In many instances, I have seen loans that are put up for sale comprising mortgages which are up to date and which have never been in arrears or loans on rental properties that fell behind six years ago but which are up to date now.  I have seen how those loans were placed in a bundle and sold.  Some of these cases were extreme and the Department needs to be aware of how issues like this affect people.  Citizens of this State have to be protected too and they are being railroaded by some of these practices.</p></speech>

I would not disagree with anything the Deputy is saying.  Sometimes what happens is that loans are connected so that one could have a principal dwelling house, PDH, loan that is connected to a commercial loan.  In such circumstances, some of the issues that the Deputy mentions can arise.  The definition of what constitutes an NPL is set down by the European Banking Authority.  We have a European definition-----</p></speech>

The ratio at AIB is below 8%, at Bank of Ireland it is around 6% while at PTSB it is approximately 10%.  The concern of the ECB and the SSM would be that the banks need to be ready for the next potential downturn.  We cannot go into the next downturn, to which the Secretary General has alluded, with elevated levels of NPLs from the last crisis, a decade ago.  That will only exacerbate what we face into the next time.</p></speech>

This committee has offered to try to see if we can help.  The Chief State Solicitor's office, without checking with us, put it into a letter of correspondence to the applicant in the case to ask if the applicant would pull back if it let the Committee of Public Accounts do a bit of work.  All we want to do is save a little bit of money, get the appropriate oversight and, meanwhile, we have a case going on in the High Court where nobody is engaging with anybody.  We are heading for &euro;306 million in taxpayers' money for this liquidation.  I have a report in front of me today that was commissioned by a third party where Professor Constantin Gurdgiev effectively said that as a consequence of the failure to properly account, analyse, assess, challenge or monitor, or both, the costs of the interests of the Irish taxpayer and ultimately all creditors of IBRC have not been or are not being adequately protected.  That happens to be my uneducated, ordinary five-eight view, as articulated at this committee many times over the past two years, but he comes with a bit of credibility.  When we were last here we did have the relevant person, a former employee of KPMG apparently - not that that is an issue - and he was able to tell us that about two people were dedicated to this.</p><p>The other issue is that we are not even going to be able to adjudge at the very end, whenever the end is, on the performance, because part of the terms of reference, when one puts it all together, there was no valuation of the assets or expected recoverable value of the assets held at the time of liquidation, so that established no benchmark or key performance indicators for liquidation process performance.  We are all just going to arrive at the end and say we did a tremendous job, which we know cost &euro;306 million, because we will have nothing to compare it with and we will have added no oversight other than the glorified PowerPoint presentation that is rolled out, the most recent one being on 22 May, with headline issues, but it is not remotely the sort of detail that was available to me when I was voluntarily liquidating my own very modest business.  I did not have any creditors because I paid all the bills.  It is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

The big money is the &euro;306 million.  With the appropriate oversight, perhaps a committee of inspection would come out with a detailed report saying KPMG did the best possible job that could be done.  I always qualify my remarks about this matter by saying that, but perhaps it would not.  In any event, the people are entitled to it.  As things stand, I am not even sure there is anyone in the Department of Finance who has the level of detail available to him or her that an ordinary creditor or stakeholder would have, because KPMG pays itself from recoveries.  The rates of pay are the NAMA rates but I am not looking at the time sheets.  I do not know how many seniors, juniors or partners were involved.  I often heard it said that in accountancy firms, if a particular job is done people are told to put down this time for one liquidation and that time on another liquidation.  That is what committees of inspection are for, namely, to question and challenge those things and the need for stakeholders to be involved.  We do not have that.  The witnesses cannot in all fairness tell me that they are 100% confident we are getting value for money because they cannot possibly know that.</p></speech>

Why does somebody not discontinue the case or go to somebody to mediate and say, "Let us do a deal here"?  These people are not looking for compensation or money, to the best of my knowledge.  I have read the statement of claim for one of them.  I was not aware of the others.  Nobody I am aware of is looking to make money here.  They are looking for the same thing we are looking for - oversight.  Obviously, I can understand that the State cannot be a soft touch.  If somebody was looking to take action against the State for financial gain, of course, that is a matter for the courts to decide and we must issue a defence.  However, what we are fighting here is two people privately looking for the same thing that the Committee of Public Accounts is looking for, which is, oversight and transparency on the most expensive liquidation in the history State, at &euro;306 million.  To date, &euro;150 million has been paid in fees - for example, &euro;144.9 million to KPMG up to December 2018, &euro;35.8 million to A and L Goodbody, and &euro;20.2 million to Linklaters.  Maybe everything has been done right, but we would like to know.  We will not until it is all over.  I am concerned that the people are not getting value for money.  I am also concerned that two or three staff in the Department is not sufficient.</p></speech>

None of us, the Chairman included, is bound to support or repeat the mistakes of the past, but it is reasonable that we would learn from them.  I cannot imagine the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, saying to the Secretary General that he notes he has a proposal here for a committee of inspection, that he is sorry he is not agreeing to it and that the legislation was passed in the middle of the night in February 2013 or whenever.  The Minister would take the Secretary General's arm off and say that it is a great amendment Bill, that they should do that and let the committee of inspection in there and give the people the oversight they require, and that he amendment would also put to bed two court cases where other third parties are looking to achieve effectively the same as the Committee of Public Accounts.  Would Mr. Moran not recommend that to the Minister?</p></speech>

The special liquidation passed by the Oireachtas was a major issue.  The Department of Finance effectively stated that it would adopt a hands-on approach with this legislation and appoint a special liquidator, the Minister appointed him on 7 February 2013 and he commenced work a minute later.  That is fine.  However, the public probably would have expected that the level of scrutiny that a committee of inspection would provide in a normal liquidation would be provided by Department of Finance given that the Department did not prescribe a committee of inspection in the legislation.  It appears that the two staff members who are overseeing this would not equate to a normal committee of inspection.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran told us the Department had eight or nine staff when it started, but we are down to two staff now.  Given the scale of this issue, we would expect the same level of scrutiny in this case by the Department as if it was done through the Companies Act in respect of a committee of inspection in another circumstance.  We do not get the impression that there is a similar level of scrutiny here.  One may call it what one likes.  Maybe I am wrong, but it is just the feeling I am picking up.  Does Mr. Moran get my point?</p></speech>

The usual practice is to use the Companies Act.  We are aware the Oireachtas did something different here.  The Oireachtas was probably entitled to believe that, because of the special circumstance, we would have the normal level of scrutiny but we would not call it a committee of inspection.  I do not feel we have that.  That is my observation.  It is not a conclusion from me.  It is my observation at present.</p></speech>

I have a few further questions Mr. Moran might respond to as well.  Who were the auditors for IBRC before it was liquidated?  I am aware KPMG were the auditors of Irish Nationwide, which, obviously, makes up part of IBRC, but I cannot recall who were the auditors of IBRC.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran might give us some indication as well in this regard.  In the report on Vote 7, the Department refers to unsecured creditors payments but it would be quite useful for the committee to see a profile of what is happening in IBRC from the time of its liquidation.  It is quite difficult to get a handle on it.  The lack of any kind of transparency on this is a real cause of concern.  Obviously, that is why the committee of oversight is being sought.</p> <p>  I accept a committee of oversight is not in the legislation, which was rushed and, obviously, deficient.  If, for example, it was a question of a committee of oversight being put in place, and, obviously, the legislation would have to be amended to do that, would that make the court cases moot?  Would the Department agree that would be the case?</p></speech>

The Government provided &euro;1.2 billion to Irish Water in 2017.  There is the same issue here with oversight being one step removed because Irish Water was set up in the way it was.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a function in auditing and that is something that is under consideration.  I do not know if there is any advance on where that is at?</p></speech>

For the benefit of the committee the witnesses might outline the rationale for the various approaches adopted to funding Irish Water.  We all know that a lot of money is required.  Did Irish Water come to the Department?  What is the priority that is set up?  How does that work and how do we see that?</p></speech>

I agree that when one looks at the Byzantine funding of it through various channels such as the Vote, the local government fund, equity injections and loan financing, it is a strange structure.  That was recognised and water charges were abolished.  This has been tidied up since 1 January 2018 and all funding going to Irish Water will go through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That should give the clarity that the Deputy is looking for on where the money is coming from and what it is going there for.  That should be seen in the 2018 accounts for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  Irish Water's commercial borrowings are to be replaced by what we call a central funds stability scheme.  In other words, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will borrow on its behalf, rather than have it borrow commercially, to get that funding more cheaply.</p></speech>

Its lending is for more purposes than just for housing.  It is local authority lending and matters such as the land aggregation scheme and the purchasing of sites or the taking into control of sites under land aggregation has allowed some reduction and repayment to the Housing Finance Agency.  There was one transaction in 2017 where there was about &euro;470 million.

This year the rate of unemployment is 4.6% and it was higher than that in 2017.  Does the Department have an explanation of why it is below profile?  Does it understand the nature of the workforce, for example?  Is that impacting on the gig economy and the likes of part-time work?  Is there an analysis on that?</p></speech>

That arises for a range of factors.  It may well be because it is at entry level and people come in during the middle of the year and have tax credits available which have not been used in the course of the year.  The intensity in tax terms is much weaker.  When there is an adjustment in earnings we get a much stronger elasticity.  Mr. McCarthy is much better at describing elasticity for an increase in earnings, but if we see a 1% increase in employment, we will see approximately a 0.8% or 0.9% increase in tax.  If we see a 1% increase in earnings, we might get a 2.1% or 2.2% increase in taxes.  That has always been the way.  It is not a new phenomenon.</p></speech>

Income tax is a broad church.  We have labour related income taxes - PAYE, USC and so forth - but we also have taxes on income that are not generated from employment, including DIRT, life assurance exit tax, dividend withholding tax and so forth.  I cannot remember the details exactly because I tend to focus more on what is going on now, but in 2017 the shortfall on income tax was more related to those taxes rather than the labour taxes.</p></speech>

We saw that the Moneypoint power plant was part of the reason for the improvement in our emissions numbers last year.  That was because there was a breakdown at the plant.  Since our underlying figures on emissions are not improving, we cannot be sure that we can avoid exposure to greater fines.  The way to deal with this is to invest in public transport, retrofitting of housing and so forth.  Has the Department done a profile or cost-benefit analysis specifically on climate or is that simply looked at on the basis of each individual capital project?</p></speech>

The analysis of carbon investment is probably a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the point of view of the Department of Finance, the key issue will be pricing carbon.  This is the controversial and ongoing difficult issue of carbon taxation.  There is broad consensus that one of the biggest contributors to reduction of emissions is by pricing carbon and putting a cost on it, but that is not simple.  It is genuinely not simple.  It would have distributive effects.  It may affect those people on lower incomes more heavily and, therefore, we have to address those things.  There is an urban-rural question in terms of the impact on farming and so on.</p> <p>  As recently as Monday or Tuesday this week, we put out a public consultation document at the request of the Joint Committee on Climate Action around the phasing in of carbon taxation, the hypothecation of those revenues and what might be done to support climate change efforts.  Climate change is one of those issues.  It is seldom that a Secretary General of the Department of Finance comes before the committee to say that hypothecating revenues towards something is a good thing.  The underlying problem of the environment is one area where any revenues from a carbon tax should go towards carbon reduction.</p></speech>

There are no issues whatsoever identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important to put that on the record.  I thank Mr. Moran for that.  We have no issues.  I will now go into the substance and the Department's opening statement.  I am not sure whether it was with Mr. Moran himself but I raised a particular issue with the Department the last time it was before the committee.  I have great difficulty with something in the opening statement which reads:</p><blockquote>I am encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 6.7% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland remains one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.</blockquote> <p>I have great difficulty with that statement.  Reference is also made to our credit rating, which really reflects more on what suits the agencies who produce the ratings.  I put no emphasis on that whatsoever.  The reason I have great difficulty with this statement is that I have just checked and, as of yesterday, we had 10,378 people homeless, comprising 6,584 adults and 3,794 children.  I cannot square that figure with that paragraph.  Either I am ignorant or uneducated in these matters or the Department is taking a very narrow view of the economy and fiscal policy.  I cannot accept that we are the fastest growing country in Europe and that we are fundamentally sound when that is our position.  I will finish with this point and then I will ask some questions.  We are now in a situation in which accommodation meant for tourists, that is to say, hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, is used to house homeless people while the accommodation meant to house our people, that is to say, houses, is being used for tourism through Airbnb.  Does Mr. Moran accept that is the position?  I have great difficulty with this statement.</p></speech>

As I have already said, the economic fundamentals are strong.  I could live to regret that statement but I have included a very strong "however" a couple of paragraphs later when I state that we face new challenges.  Our role is to ensure, as far as we can, that the economy itself is stable, that public finances are stable and predictable, and that the revenue can be generated to address the real problems about which the Deputy is talking.  I do not disagree with her in any way.  As an Irish citizen, the idea of that homelessness is-----</p></speech>

There was no construction for five or six years.  All of these issues contributed to what the Deputy is describing.  It is, however, the performance of the economy that will generate the revenue to allow for spending on building the 10,000 social houses that are targeted.  That is what will provide the money for capital investment.</p></speech>

That is for another forum.  It is difficult to wade through all this information, although I know and appreciate all of the work that went into it.  It is premised on a completely wrong ideology, however.  How can any Department say we are sound when we have that level of homelessness and such a serious crisis in housing?  One simply cannot get a house to rent in Galway.  Policy is forcing the market up to unsustainable levels of rent.  We know that.  The very policy of the Government, including the housing assistance payment and the other payments, is forcing rents upwards unsustainably.  I would love it if the Department of Finance began to look at that.  Perhaps I am taking unfair advantage of Mr. Moran in this regard but I come from a city in which the housing crisis is worse than in Dublin, in which the health crisis is worse than anywhere, and where a hospital is falling apart but Mr Moran is telling me our economy is sound.  There is something wrong with that definition of an economy.</p> <p>  Moving on to specific questions, what is the second state aid case?  The first was that regarding Apple.</p></speech>

The value of a report over a set of accounts is that one can look at a longer time period.  The sums involved and the complexity is so great that something like the debt report was what I had in mind, or the special report we produced.  Repeating that on an annual basis, or something like it, could be useful.</p></speech>

I have no dispute with the Comptroller and Auditor General's view that this would be more informative, more transparent and so on.  There are also projects we are doing around the Government's balance sheet in trying to get a consolidated view of that and to move to bring on some of the assets that we do not currently see, and then do an intertemporal exercise with it as well.  There is a range of things we are doing.  Hopefully, when I am back next year, I can outline what progress we have made on that.</p></speech>

To take the people who will be doing this, the European team will be dealing with the MFF and the negotiation of that, and to do it is carving out time from other work they are doing.  For the accounting and corporate function, we have things like financial management and shared services going on.  We will address resources.  We have a challenge around staffing.

The bottom line is that the Civil Service is expanding.  Most of these people are not leaving the Civil Service.  They come in, they stay with the Department, we invest quite an amount of money in our skillset and they get promoted into the wider Civil Service.  Of that 20% average, only about 4% actually leave and go to the private sector and the rest go into the wider Civil Service.  As a management team, that is presenting us with an enormous challenge.</p></speech>

Again, the report was just noted.  It was the amendments that changed it.</p><p>I am not asking Mr. Moran to comment politically but that was the background.  That report was being noted before the D&aacute;il so there seems to be a certain lack of urgency - I would use the term "cognitive dissonance".  We are one of two countries to declare a climate emergency yet we are one of two countries that will miss their targets.  It was the amendments from the various parties that forced the D&aacute;il to do what it did and that is the position now it has been declared.  Where is the Department building that into its forecasts?  The biodiversity report contained an entire section on the financial implications of what is happening with the loss of biodiversity.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that if we do not deal with it, it will be worse.  I am paraphrasing the man.  Where is the Department building it in?  </p></speech>

I have already referred to it.  Pricing is a profoundly difficult issue - using the pricing of carbon through tax to create a set of incentives that encourage people to use less carbon-intensive fuels.  This in itself generates the revenues that allow us to do many other things referred to by Deputy Murphy.  It involves getting the balance of that right.  This is why we have a public consultation out.  There was a recommendation to the committee that we do so and we have done so.  We will move from there.</p> <p>  We also got the ESRI to do some more medium-term research for us.  Does Mr. John McCarthy want to give a sense of it?  </p></speech>

The report was published in March.  What we asked it to do and what it has done is look at the impact of that on the economy.  The impact is to reduce GDP by between a half and a percentage point.  We also wanted to find out what the impact would be on carbon emissions.  It is work in progress.  It does reduce carbon emissions but the amount would be insufficient to reach the various targets.  What we were concerned about is the distributional impact of that because different people will be affected in different ways.  We are working with the ESRI using the SWITCH model to try to model the impact on different deciles - different household segments - and we intend to publish that research.  As the Secretary General mentioned, the tax lever is the one lever that is available to the Department of Finance.  It might have been Deputy Connolly or Deputy Murphy who mentioned that it is much wider than tax and must be a whole-of-Government approach.</p></speech>

My question really concerned risk.  I will leave tax for another day and the debate on it.  I think it is foolish, will divide people and take the focus away from where we should be.  People have asked us to acknowledge and deal with climate change.  My question to the Department concerned where it was looking regarding that emergency and how it is building it into its forecasts.</p></speech>

I think the Chair of the Climate Change Advisory Committee, Professor John Fitzgerald, often refers to the point that to retrofit all the existing stock of houses will cost &euro;50 billion.  We must find the means by which we can do that over the next 20 to 30 years.  That will require a lot of private money but also public support.  As I understand it, over the next number of weeks, the Government is due to publish its strategy around the actions in the plans.  I hope that many of the answers to the questions posed by Deputy Connolly will be in that.</p></speech>

We saw the plenary summons at the time.  I think Mr. Tobin unfortunately said that we would have to ask them about their motivation.  I did not realise there was a second case.  We saw the plenary summons relating to the first case.  It was simply looking for accountability.  I am not sure if it was Mr. Moran or somebody else that was there who said that we should wait for the statement of claim.  It seems absurd that somebody would have to go to court to bring about accountability.  They were not looking for anything for themselves.  They were simply setting out what they thought were the necessary oversight mechanisms.  I will leave Mr. Moran with that.  I think the Department of Finance should look at the fact that a citizen had to go to court to get proper oversight mechanisms.</p></speech>

In recent years, the Oireachtas has set up its Parliamentary Budget Office, something we did not have before.  Can Mr. Moran talk to me about the relationship between the Department and that office?  The office is trying to assist the Oireachtas in terms of knowledge for budget planning but the budget comes from the Department.  Is there close co-operation or are the Department and the Parliamentary Budget Office at arm's length?</p></speech>

The population of people who produce a national budget is quite small so one is fishing in the same pond for staff.  They would be colleagues.  There would be that sort of connection.  The critical thing is that they provide more information to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that allows for proper challenge.  The contacts are largely informal.  I do not think there is a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and the office or between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the office.  There would be ongoing contact around information but not in a formal way.  It does add to the layers of accountability and improvements in accountability around budgeting in the same way as the IFAC is fundamental.</p></speech>

This has nothing to do with the Department but I find that they are a great help when it is not needed but once the game is on, they are up in the stand.

They are in a process involving the Public Appointments Service as I understand it.</p> <p>  On the EU report outlining Ireland's transactions with the EU, this country's contribution to EU resources is 0.85% of Irish GNI.  The figure for national income is different to the GNI figure and the GNP figure.  That includes the value of the multinational sector in Ireland.  We are getting a lot of extra corporation tax because the multinationals are based here on the one hand and we are paying a higher contribution to the EU because they are located here on the other.  We all know what the top multinationals are paying in corporation tax but does the Department have a figure for the additional amount we are paying in EU contributions each year as a result of them being based here?</p></speech>

We want data that are as recent as possible.  I know that the increase was not so big but it is at a much higher base now.  That is my question and the Department will come back to me with a response on that.</p> <p>  I see value in having consolidated reports because I suspect that the majority of Members of the D&aacute;il do not appreciate that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for example, is not accountable to the D&aacute;il for the spending of &euro;1.3 billion or whatever the figure happens to be.  We tripped upon it here with the Department and asked it about the EU funds.  The Secretary General, as the Accounting Officer, signs off on the report which is sent to the European Commission but not to the Oireachtas.  There is no mechanism in place.  There is nothing stopping the Oireachtas from examining the accounts and we discussed it when we came across it but there is no formal mechanism in the Oireachtas to examine all of this money coming in from the EU.  That is why there would be a benefit to having a report.  This is relevant, for example, in the context of what happened in the Brexit debate.  People were able to make all sorts of crazy statements about how much Britain would save by not having to contribute to the EU.  I am not saying that such a debate could happen in Ireland but people can make outlandish statements in this country and if the Department does not have proper figures, it cannot reject those statements.  In that sense, the Department has a duty to compile those figures.  The witnesses spoke about the risks in the Department.  There is a risk that a Brexit-like debate could happen in Ireland, which could be damaging.  All it takes is for someone in the Department to put a report together each year, including all of the important figures, so that it could respond quickly to such a debate, were it to raise its head in Ireland.  One does not know what way political debates will go.  One would hope that facts would win out at the end of the day but in the absence of a consolidated, factual report, the job is made more difficult.</p> <p>  I note from paragraph 2.3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that in 1985, the UK correction lowered the contribution made by the EU by way of a rebate, which is replaced by an additional contribution by other member states.  I think that was when Mrs. Thatcher got her money back.  Am I right?</p></speech>

The mechanism reduced the UK's contribution by &euro;4.9 billion in 2017, while Ireland's contribution increased by &euro;135 million.  Has the Department worked out the figures in terms of risks to the economy of the impact of contributions to and moneys received from the EU if Brexit happens?  If the UK is gone and its contributions are gone, others will be required to make higher contributions.  The &euro;135 million will not exist any more because the UK will not be making any contribution.  On the other hand, because the UK is not contributing, Ireland might have to pay more to fund the CAP and everything else.  I presume the Department has done a paper on that.  How stands that?</p></speech>

They make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and television coverage and web streaming will be adversely affected.</p><p>We are awaiting the arrival of one of the witnesses.  I am sure he will be here soon.  We will go ahead with the meeting, the purpose of which is to have an engagement on the current use of reduced timetables, to look at the impact on students and schools, and to look for recommendations regarding practice and monitoring because there is no current effective monitoring of the practice and it is difficult to obtain proper data for examination as to the impact of the timetables.  It will be a very useful and interesting session.  We have received submissions from certain other bodies and will hold another session on 13 June.  Thereafter, the committee will discuss what it has heard and make recommendations to the Minister and the Department.<br/><br/>Delegates have been grouped thematically.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Patrick Reilly, mental health worker at Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre; Ms  Lorraine Dempsey, information and policy officer of the Special Needs Parents Association, Mr. Adam Harris, who is yet to arrive, from AsIAm; Ms Maria Joyce, co-ordinator of the National Traveller Women's Forum; and Mr. Mark O'Connor, community engagement manager with Inclusion Ireland.  The committee will hear their submissions first.  We have had the opportunity to read the statements submitted before the meeting.  We are also joined by Mr. Kieran Golden, president of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals; Mr. Pat Goff, CEO of the Irish Primary Principals' Network; Ms Breda Corr, general secretary of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education; and Dr. Michael Redmond, director of research and development for the Joint Managerial Body secretariat of secondary schools.<br/><br/>I propose to take speakers from the group seated on the top tier first, followed by engagement with committee members, after which we will hear from the stakeholders seated on the bottom tier.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite witnesses to make a brief opening statement.  I ask them to stick to the maximum time of three minutes because there are several people to hear from and we want to afford members an opportunity to comment and ask questions.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Opening statements made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>If delegates wish to add to their submission at a later stage, they should send a written submission to the clerk to the committee who will ensure that it is circulated to all members.  We will take all such additional comments on board when we are considering our findings and recommendations.  I invite Mr. Reilly to make his opening presentation.</p></speech>

I am here to speak about the serious concerns of Pavee Point regarding the impact of the inappropriate use of reduced timetables on Traveller children and to make recommendations to the committee.  The overall shocking and poor educational outcomes for Travellers were recently discussed at the committee.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, 13% of Travellers complete secondary education compared with 92% of the settled population.  We are concerned that the use of reduced timetables will serve to further reinforce these negative outcomes.  Pavee Point has received several reports from Traveller parents about the inappropriate use of reduced timetables.  These reports indicate that reduced timetables are being used outside of their original purpose, mainly as a behavioural management tool.  However, other than the reports made to us, there is no official documentation available about their use.</p> <p>  It is clear that the use of reduced timetables is having a negative impact on the educational progression of Traveller children as well as a wider impact on their well-being.  Parents report worries over children falling behind in their education and being frustrated when they do not understand what is being taught.  Parents are not always equipped to support their children, but are expected to cover the hours when their children should be in school.</p> <p>  We have not received an adequate response on this issue from the Department of Education and Skills or Tusla.  The question arises as to who is responsible for monitoring the use of reduced timetables.  If responsibility lies with the individual school board of management, appropriate structures to ensure that the tool of reduced timetables is not used outside its remit need to be developed.</p> <p>  Pavee Point recommends that the use of reduced timetables be strictly monitored through a defined mechanism.  When reduced timetables are implemented, a notice should be sent to the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education.  The notice must include clear rationale for the reduced timetable's use, its duration, a plan to support the young person to return to the school timetable and the child's age and ethnicity.  The notice must be signed by the board of management and have parental consent.  Parents must also consent to the data being used to document the use of reduced timetables.</p> <p>  The inspectorate should identify a mechanism to capture the use of limited and reduced timetables when carrying out school inspections, undertake an audit of the application of limited or reduced timetables for Traveller children, and publish its report.  The Department of Education and Skills should issue a circular to schools advising that limited or reduced timetables may only be used in very limited and time-bound circumstances, publish disaggregated data on the basis of ethnicity in secondary schools to monitor participation and outcomes of Traveller and Roma students, put in place additional ring-fenced educational supports for Traveller pupils, and provide funding to independent Traveller organisations to advocate for Traveller education needs and address educational inequalities.  The Department of Justice and Equality should develop a robust implementation plan for the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy with clear targets, indicators, outcomes and budget lines, particularly to promote the inclusion of Travellers in education.  In addition, it should replicate the new Traveller education pilot project throughout the country and ensure it is adequately resourced and sustained into the future.</p></speech>

This is not the first time we have referenced the issue of restricted school timetables at the committee, but it is the first time that it is the sole focus of the meeting.  This will allow us to examine the issue and seek solutions.</p> <p>  The issue of reduced timetables was brought to the attention of the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE,  in previous years, but few data are available on the prevalence of the use of reduced timetables in our educational settings.  The latest figures from Tusla indicate that 117,000 post primary pupils have missed 20 or more school days in the past school year, but we have no idea how significant the figure is for reduced timetables or whether some schools are adopting this approach more frequently than others.  The evidence we have is primarily anecdotal and comes from parents who contact us when the situation is imposed on them by a school.  There are other situations involving a voluntary reduced timetable for the benefit of the pupil, and we do not take issue with such cases.</p> <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, does not proactively engage early on when children are on a restricted school timetable and restricted from accessing the school environment and curriculum by the school, but it will take action against parents when they are deemed responsible for restricting access.</p><p>Tusla has indicated that there is no legislation to support the use of reduced timetables and that the constitutionality of imposing a reduced timetable is questionable.<br/><br/>The main reason we have encountered for the use of reduced timetables is a school stating that it does not have the resources required to support a child.Most often referenced is a lack of a special needs assistant, SNA, to cater for the child&rsquo;s needs.  A child&rsquo;s access to school is, therefore, limited by the availability of that support.  This view is often in contention with the opinion of the special educational needs organiser, SENO, when he or she is contacted by a parent.  The child is stuck in the middle of conflicting opinions and loses out educationally and socially.  A child&rsquo;s behaviour is typically the primary reason cited in these circumstances.  Whether an SNA is the most appropriate support for a child where behavioural management is required is an ongoing question.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, has stated that reduced timetables should not be used as a behavioural management technique or as a method of <i>de facto</i>suspension or expulsion.<br/><br/>Article 24(2)(a), (b) and (d) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, stipulate that children with disabilities are not excluded from free and compulsory primary education on the basis of disability.  The article goes on to recommend that &quot;Persons with disabilities receive the support required, within the general education system, to facilitate their effective education&quot;.  Article 30(5)(d) of the UNCRPD also provides that all states parties, including Ireland since we have now ratified the convention, should &quot;ensure that children with disabilities have equal access with other children to participation in play, recreation and leisure and sporting activities, including those activities in the school system&quot;.  The cost of reduced timetables to parents, as well as the emotional cost, is of particular concern.  The risks involved include threats to employment.  This is rarely a consideration when the school imposes reduced timetables but it is a reality for some families.  The use of reduced timetables should be a last resort which is time bound, reported to the Department and monitored.  The use of reduced timetables should trigger a multi-agency response.  That should involve a holistic review of and response to the impact and risks associated with a reduced timetable for the child and family.<br/><br/>The key points we would like to get across to the committee are included in our written submission.  One of those is that a child has a constitutional right to an education, regardless of where that education takes place.  We propose that a supplemental scheme be put in place to support a child's education when he or she is on a reduced school timetable.  The parents of a child in that situation do not qualify for home tuition payments.  The lack of educational provision would put the child at a further educational disadvantage when he or she tries to reintegrate into a full school day.  <br/><br/>We are not targeting schools for blame in situations where the use of reduced timetables is a last resort.  The Department must, however, step up and support our schools appropriately.  As we do every year when we present to this committee, we have to raise the issue of the lack of therapeutic interventions and the very long waiting list for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and children's disability network teams.  This time last year, I mentioned to the committee that the last children's disability network team to be formed was in 2014.  We are still in that situation today.  </p></speech>

There are no clear policies or guidelines on how the practice of reduced timetables is deployed in Ireland.  We also do not know how the use of such reduced timetables impacts on Traveller pupils or on children from other groups.  This has become a major concern.  We have raised these concerns with the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy, NTRIS, steering committee and also directly with the Department of Education and Skills.  No data or collated information is available on the practice of reduced timetables in schools.  I will now outline some concerns raised by local Traveller organisations.</p> <p>  Traveller organisations have witnessed a major regression in Traveller education since the cuts to educational supports for Travellers during the recession.  The issue of Traveller children on reduced hours has almost reached the point where it has become policy rather than an exceptional measure for a child with particular needs.  It is resorted to far too easily and not as a last option.  Evidence needs to be documented of the efforts made by schools to deal with a situation before putting reduced timetables in place and a range of safeguards are needed once that process is implemented.  </p> <p>  Instead of placing Traveller children on reduced hours, we believe that schools need to look at the root causes of Traveller children's unhappiness in a system that does not recognise, value or celebrate their unique culture and identity.  Reduced timetables have been implemented while young Travellers are placed on waiting lists for psychological assessments.  As waiting times can be lengthy, Traveller children can then be on reduced timetables for prolonged periods without any additional supports.  The schools have given limited resources as the reason for this practice when challenged by Traveller organisations.  Reduced hours in school is often the complete opposite of what students need, however.  In fact, what is needed is an increase in supports.  </p> <p>  Challenging reduced timetables can often elicit a response involving a reference to poor attendance.  This point appears to be contradictory.  Local Traveller organisations are trying to support the young Travellers' attendance, achievement and attainment in education.  It can be difficult to do that if reducing hours is seen as a direct response to addressing poor attendance.  Such practices only add to the problem because the absence of children from school leaves them further behind academically and adds to resistance in respect of attendance.  The children should be provided with extra one-to-one support, resource hours and some system that takes into account the child&rsquo;s additional needs.  Reduced timetables for Traveller children in primary school have a double negative impact.  They are losing out on an education in primary school but are then expected to go into post-primary education and deal with increased subjects and multiple teachers during a much longer day.</p> <p>  It is a given that these children will fall out of the system.  We see this as another form of segregated provision, albeit by a different name.  Travellers appear to be placed in this situation disproportionately to the wider community.  Regarding positive implementation of reduced timetables in individual cases, we can see how reduced timetables might support a young student with an illness or a medical condition.  That could mean the difference between receiving an education or not.  For Traveller children, however, this system is being put in place without reason or logic.  Reduced hours are also being used to manage behaviour and that is feeding into low expectations.  </p> <p>   Our recommendations include a proposal that an independent investigation be undertaken by the Ombudsman for Children.  A clear picture of the nature and extent of the use of reduced timetables is needed urgently, including the reasons for and the consequences of the system in use.  We also recommend that the Department of Education and Skills develop clear guidelines and protocols regarding this practice.  The guidelines on the rationale for and appropriate use of reduced timetables should be developed in consultation with schools, parents and stakeholders.  They should have a human rights and equality ethos and be given a statutory basis.  The guidelines must also contain a clear outline of a complaints process if a parent is dissatisfied with the practice of reduced timetable as it relates to their child. </p></speech>

The segregated data on Traveller pupils is important in this regard.  There is also a role for the Department of Education and Skills, the education welfare service, Tusla and the inspectorate.  The broader recommendations regarding supporting the inclusion, participation and attainment levels of Traveller pupils are also of key relevance.  Supports need to be provided to Traveller organisations and parents in addressing that situation.</p></speech>

Evidence from our work suggests that the use of reduced timetables is a relatively common but hidden practice that impacts negatively on the education and well-being of children with disabilities and their families.  In 2018, Inclusion Ireland published a discussion paper entitled "Shining a light on seclusion and restraint in schools in Ireland".  One parent described her child missing a combined 100 school days in the same school year while another parent described waiting in the school car park as the phone would start ringing to collect her child as early as 9.10 a.m.</p> <p>  Some years ago Inclusion Ireland conducted a survey of parents who had a child on a reduced timetable.  Almost two thirds of the children were in school for less than three hours per day, with a very worrying 12% only receiving one hour of school per day or less.  A significant majority, 59%, of these children were on a reduced timetable for more than 12 weeks and this included some of the children who were in school for less than one hour per day.  Several parents disclosed how they were forced to accept their child being put onto a reduced timetable or the school would move to expel the child.  Other parents spoke of not agreeing to a reduced timetable and the school calling them as early as 9.10 a.m. at the slightest hint of an incident.  When the parent arrived at the school, everything seemed to be fine with the child.  Very few of the parents were aware of any assistance they could avail of when their child was placed on a reduced timetable.  I refer to a section 29 appeal under the Education Act or the services of an education welfare officer.  </p> <p>  Through our casework, parents tell us of the stress, shame and distress the child feels in this situation.  We also hear about the great financial burden placed on parents by having to give up work and apply for a social welfare allowance such as carer's allowance.</p><p>Schools often cite a lack of resources or a child&rsquo;s inability to cope with a full school day when suspending a child in this manner.  Many teachers, however, have no specialist training nor are they required to have specialist training to teach children with disabilities.  There is poor access to therapeutic services, including speech and language therapy.  These therapies can assist children to address their sensory and communication needs in a more appropriate manner than through some of the behaviour that may lead to a reduced timetable.  Possibly the most critical factor is the failure to commence parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, or EPSEN Act, that would benefit children with disabilities.  It is shameful that parts of the Act have still not been commenced despite being passed by this House 15 years ago.</p><p> I have outlined some of the problems and causes and will now recommend a few possible solutions.  These hidden suspensions via a reduced timetable must be ceased.  All children with a disability or learning need must have access to an appropriately trained teacher.  Teachers should have access to more robust undergraduate training in the area of special education needs and those who are working in the area of special education could also avail of significant continuous professional development.  The HSE must be funded to recruit additional therapists as a matter of urgency to address the long waiting lists that have been mentioned.  Children and schools should be able to access therapy on a universal basis through the new National Council for Special Education school inclusion model being piloted.  Following a successful pilot stage, the model should be resourced and rolled out nationally.  Schools must be directed to collect data and report on children who are suspended via a reduced timetable.  The Oireachtas must review the Education Act 1998 regulations to allow for an independent appeal relating to reduced timetables before the cumulative 20 day period.  The Department of Education and Skills must be asked to produce a plan to commence the 15 year old EPSEN Act.  This will ensure children with disabilities are appropriately supported in school through assessments, appropriate supports and individual education plans.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I have another meeting to attend so I will have to leave shortly and may miss the second half of the meeting.</p> <p>  A number of groups are represented, namely, Travellers and children with special needs.  That is where the problem lies.  I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il last November and subsequently when groups representing Travellers appeared before the committee.  It is wrong to say there is no clear policy on this.  The Constitution guarantees the right to free primary education for every child.  That is a clear policy and we have to start from the position that it must be implemented by the Government.  I do not always agree with the Minister but in response to questions I have asked in the D&aacute;il, he was clear that the policy could not be clearer and that this practice is not acceptable.  Unfortunately, that message has not got out to schools.  The Minister has made it absolutely clear that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend for the full day unless exempted from doing so for exceptional circumstances such as medical reasons.  There are no ifs or buts.  This is not acceptable and the practice that has been highlighted has to end.  The Minister needs to state this more clearly and in a manner other than in written answers in the D&aacute;il, although that is also a very clear way of setting out the position, in fairness to him.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that when this happens it is a suspension and should be followed up.  Parents need to be empowered to know that the procedure is set out in section 29 of the Education Act 1998.  Colleagues have asked me what the position is a number of times recently and it is very clear.  When parents are asked to collect children early, they should ask for a statement from the school in writing.  Schools will be reluctant to give one in writing because they have no grounds to make such a request.  I would certainly ask for that if I were the parent in such a situation.  A more drastic action, which parents might have to consider, is to ignore the call but that would be difficult to do because there may be a medical issue.</p> <p>  I take issue with the idea that there is no clear policy.  We cannot accept that position because children are entitled to go to school.  This issue is clearly one for children with disabilities and children of Traveller ethnicity.  I do not have much more to say but I hope that what we are hearing today will spur action that will help bring to an end these silent suspensions.  They have to end.  The Minister stated in November 2018 and again more recently in reply to a question I asked in the D&aacute;il that he is engaging with Tusla on this issue.  The relevant section of Tusla probably needs to be merged into the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  I have no further questions.  That is my position and the position of my party.  It also seems to be the Government's position.  Schools need to get the message.  They obviously need support and services but the fundamental right to education is provided for in the Constitution.  It is the only right in the Constitution that costs money and it is very clearly set down.</p></speech>

Both he and the previous Minister should have issued a direction to all schools that this practice simply cannot happen.  There is a lack of oversight and children are being placed on reduced timetables behind closed doors.  These children are being denied their constitutional right to education.  We need immediate clarity from the Minister in the form of a directive to schools stating that this practice cannot continue.</p> <p>  When students are put on a reduced timetable, how are the teachers selected and what training do they have in teaching children with a disability or behavioural difficulties?  Are there cases where teachers are not present and the burden is placed on special needs assistants?</p> <p>  With regard to the monitoring, assessment and oversight that are required, during a whole school evaluation of management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, or an incidental drive-by inspection, do inspectors ever ask whether there are children on a reduced timetable and if they can see how that is being managed?  If that is not the case, these questions must be added to the list to ensure inspectors know when they visit schools that this needs to be checked immediately.  Apart from finding out what is happening in CSPE, English, history, Irish or physical education, are inspectors asking if there are children on a reduced timetable?  I suspect not but I want the matter clarified.</p> <p>  Has the Department of Education and Skills issued guidelines on this issue?  In studies or research that have been done, what is the maximum number of weeks that a child has been deprived of education?  Can a child remain on a reduced timetable indefinitely?</p> <p>  When schools decide to put a child on a reduced timetable, how do they decide what subjects the child should be exposed to?  I presume they are completely excluded from PE, art, music and any other subject that has a social element.  They will not get access to physical education despite the childhood obesity crisis, or access to art, music or woodwork because schools will definitely not want to let these children into woodwork class.  Is that what is happening?  What we are doing is appalling from the perspective of the full development and well-being of our children.</p> <p>  Are children on a reduced timetable completely excluded at break time?  If they are in school between 9 a.m. and 12 noon, do they not go on a break with the other children between 11 a.m. and 11.15 a.m.?  If not, has the impact of this been examined?</p> <p>  Have the views of teachers been established through anonymous surveys?  Is there a question on this in the surveys of students and teachers that are conducted as part of a WSE-MLL?  Teachers should be surveyed on whether a reduced timetable operates in their schools and, if so, how they think it is working for the benefit of the students.  These questions need to be included.  I do not believe reduced timetables should ever be used.  That is the issue but if they are continuing, they need to be tackled straight away.  To be clear, I am completely against reduced timetables.</p> <p>  Has the Department done any research?  The Minister says reduced timetables should not be used but he has not issued a directive to schools to make sure they are not used.  What alternatives are available for children?  Have these been considered?  What do other countries do when an issue arises with behavioural difficulties?  Surely they do not remove a child's access to education or to specific subjects.</p> <p>  What percentage of students who have been put on reduced timetables return to the full timetable?</p><p>Is it just a way of eventually getting them out of the school because it becomes so difficult for parents in full-time employment to manage the phone calls to come and get the child?  It also makes the children feel so much less part of the school community that they move away.  Do we know whether those on a reduced timetable get counselling, even from the guidance counsellor?  It is just wrong on so many levels.  What we should get from shining a light on this today is that the Minister will write to schools to put an end to it and research will done on putting in place proper alternatives to give support to children with disabilities and children who enter school already having a feeling of alienation and segregation, which is made worse by putting them in a room on their own without proper educational supports.  The answer to how it is monitored or assessed seems to be that it is not.  What can we do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.716" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019053000002#E00200"><p>Deputy Thomas Byrne said two groups are involved but it is also being used on children who are not from a Traveller background and who do not have a diagnosis of special educational needs.  There is a cohort of students for whom the reason is explicitly behavioural.  There is no special educational support or special needs assistants, SNAs, for them.  Suspension or a reduced timetable is seen as a behavioural tool for them.</p> <p>  There seem to be a lot of issues but one of the main ones is the lack of data, which has been mentioned.  Who makes the decision that it is to the benefit of the child?  In all of the reports I have seen I have never read about a case conference.  A parent has never told me there had been a series of meetings where the student had been placed at the centre of the conversation, whether care workers, schools, youth clubs, educational support workers or Traveller advocates were involved.  Somebody makes an assessment but on what is it based?  How is it suggested this is to the benefit of the child?  There might be extreme anxiety or a situation where a child might need to go home early on a particular day, but not as an indefinite action.  Who is entitled to make this decision?  Is it fair to say all parents agree to it?  Do they agree to it because of the power imbalance and fear of losing the child's school place?  The fact it is not reported to Tusla seems like a real manipulation.  If the child was outright suspended it would be reported to Tusla.  We see that some schools suspend more children than others, but a reduced timetable does not have to be reported.  This is why we cannot collect the data.  In some situations there seems to be a concerted effort to hide the fact that reduced timetables are being used as a way to mark the child as having attended in the morning and then ringing someone to come to get the child.  This means no mechanism is kicked off.</p> <p>  We need to look at how schools are supported.  While it is completely different from the education system, I worked as a community worker for a long time and supported women suffering from addiction.  Many organisations and bodies were involved in supporting them and their children in school.  We never made decisions on their lives without interacting with all of the other services involved in the child's care, whether dealing with behavioural issues or the support they received in the community.  We made a full holistic needs assessment based on everything about the child's life and not just on whether it will make the classroom life a bit easier.  Sometimes the benefit to the student is used in a way to make parents feel they are taking responsibility but the benefit is not measured.</p> <p>  We have had numerous reports on the misuse of resource hours.  Children are put on reduced timetables while SNAs are writing to us in bundles about being asked to wash teachers' cars.  Why are additional resource hours not being used to support the more vulnerable groups that need assistance in the school system?  Mr. O'Connor stated two thirds of the people surveyed receive fewer than three hours of education a day.  If we measure this over a lifetime, how many years of education do people miss?  Have they reached the educational age of 12 when they move on from primary school?  Issues with Traveller children and behavioural issues mostly happen in secondary school.  How do we move forward?  How do we enforce the collection and reporting of data?  How do we create a system whereby all of the bodies involved in a child's life and care make that decision and that there is real consent on a child going or not going to school?</p></speech>

Based on the contributions we have heard so far, and I am conscious we are hearing only half of the story, it clearly indicates that we have a serious problem.  Deputy Byrne said the policy of the Minister is very clear on what should happen, but the reality of what is happening is quite different.  Based on the contributions I have heard so far, there seem to be very few guidelines on how schools are meant to act on reduced timetables.  We do not seem to know the scale of the problem, which is difficult to understand.  I am conscious that fingers are being pointed at schools and that we have not heard all of the contributions.  We need to hear their side of the story on whether they have the infrastructure and machinery available to deal with the situation properly.  This is where the Department comes in, to make sure schools in all sectors are properly resourced to deal with situations such as this.  It is important that we do not lose sight of this point.</p> <p>  From the contributions we have heard so far, this seems to be a serious problem.  There seems to be confusion as to when reduced hours are implemented, why they are being implemented, how long they are implemented for, what happens when a child is on reduced hours, who looks after the child and what is that person meant to be doing.  From the contributions we have heard so far, there seem to be very few guidelines and little direction.  I look forward to hearing the perspective and opinions of teachers and schools so that, I hope, at the end of all this we can put our heads together and get a clear direction on how we tackle the issue to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p></speech>

However, it has been unsettling to listen to the witnesses speak about their experiences and those of the people they represent.  As Deputy Byrne said, the policy is clear but in reality it is not happening.  The absence of guidelines from the Department and the absence of monitoring by the Department and Tusla are concerning.  We have to accept the reality that reduced timetables are in place.  We will have an opportunity to hear more from the perspective of boards of management and teachers.  Apart from the educational development of young people, social development is very important so that in schools we have the holistic development of children with their peers.  When we set the terms of reference for this we said we would look at the impact of reduced timetables not only on students but on the whole school environment, and this is important to note.</p> <p>  If I were to put a question to the witnesses it would be on what other interventions they would like to see used or would suggest be utilised instead of a reduced timetable, particularly with regard to behaviour management issues.</p><p>Is there empirical evidence to back up the anecdotal evidence presented to us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019053000002#F00200"><p>To be clear, there are guidelines.  The National Educational Welfare Board published a book on developing a code of discipline in schools.  It is very clear on a child being denied any part of the school day.  It is regarded as a suspension.  These are suspensions that go on for a period.  The same guideline will refer to rolling suspensions or inappropriate use suspensions.  The guideline has not been applied in the manner I describe but it is quite clear.</p> <p>  Before he left, Deputy Thomas Byrne stated that parents often ignore the call.  I know of one parent who phoned me and who had ignored the call.  That parent was reported to Tusla for not picking up the child.  It was deemed to be a welfare issue affecting the child.</p> <p>  With regard to teaching, there is possibly a systemic training issue.  A recent survey by the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland indicates 5% of respondents had a postgraduate qualification in special education.  Only 22% had attended continuing professional development, CPD, seminars in special education in recent years.  That is a bit of an issue.  The Teaching Council is quite clear that a qualified teacher is qualified to teach all children and does not need any additional qualification.</p> <p>  I am not aware of the inspectors asking the questions that were mentioned.  Perhaps they do.  I am aware of a child who was on a reduced timetable of only three days per week because the school was allocated an SNA for only three days.  There was part access to an SNA.  The child did not have toileting or behavioural issues; it was purely a matter of resources.  By the time the child came to us, he or she had missed out.  The child's case was referred to us in April and he or she had been on the reduced timetable since September.  This was a significant period.  It just took a meeting with the school to say this was not right and had to change.  It changed.</p> <p>  There are absolutely no data.  There are data collated on suspensions and expulsions but none on what I am referring to.  The guidelines are very clear.  These are suspensions but there are no data collected so we do not know the full extent.  We can base our view only on what we hear in our case work and the survey we carried out.  We had 101 respondents to a short survey we carried out in respect of a different submission.  Each had short school days.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane referred to the benefit of inclusion.  The evidence base is very clear.  The best way to include a child is to have him or her in the school as much as possible.  We had a call this week from a parent in circumstances where the school proposed a shortened school day.  There was no striking out on the part of the child but he was becoming agitated and crying at a certain point in the day.  He was in an autism class and was not allowed to go out and play with his peers in the mainstream classes.  He wanted to go out and mess with the big bunch.  The parent said there were no physical issues that would prevent him from doing so.  He quite liked the company of other children but, because he was not allowed out, he resorted to crying and so forth.  That is the reason for the proposal for a short day.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked what can be done for schools.  In the vast majority of cases, schools are trying their best and, more than likely, are doing what they are doing as a last resort.  We have spoken about the outside stuff, including the therapeutic supports and mental health supports.  NEPS assessments point to approximately two in 100 children.  If there is a third child in a school who could benefit, he or she may be in a bit of difficulty.  Through our casework, we have been made aware of these issues.  One family spoke to me about a psychologist and speech and language therapist who came in from St. John of God, carried out a full assessment and presented a behavioural plan that would work really well for the young chap in question.  It was not implemented, however, and the short school day continued.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's comments, we have spoken about all the supports.  They would be really helpful for schools and pupils.  Actions taken should not be hidden.  If a school is going to suspend a child, it should be done in the official manner.  At least at that point, the pupil or parent has recourse through section 29 of the Education Act.  The data should be collected in order that we know the scale of the problem.  I have already said that perhaps something around the EPSEN Act is required.  The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland has been very vocal and asked that the Act be implemented and that the staff be given the training and resources.  It said it would be only too delighted to get involved.</p> <p>  With regard to empirical evidence, I am only aware of an internal survey we carried out.  I am not aware of any robust research in the area.  That is all I wanted to say.</p></speech>

I might be able to answer some of them.  She asked what other countries do.  The educational system of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, is managed by borough as opposed to central Government.  Each borough has a standard policy for reduced school days, with a very basic, step-by-step approach to how the decision is made, the factors taken into account, and the process by which it is monitored.  It is essentially what we are looking for in an Irish context.</p> <p>  Interestingly enough, only a few weeks ago a former Minister for education came to Ireland from New Brunswick in Canada and met our Minister, Deputy Joe McHugh, at the behest of the NCSE.  New Brunswick has a fully inclusive education system.  It does not have special schools and special classes but it still grapples with the issue of restricted school timetables, which I found very interesting.  One reason cited is the lack of investment in its inclusive special education system over the past couple of years, when the former Minister was not in power.  It is very interesting that a very different educational system, which involves full inclusion, also experiences our issue.  That system has wraparound supports in the schools.  We have not heard from fellow witnesses from the school side but I would hazard a fairly concrete guess, on the basis of anecdotal evidence, that where there is a lack of capacity in the schools with the additional supports, there is probably more use of reduced school timetables, particularly in schools dealing with students who exhibit challenging behaviour, whether it is due to socio-economic circumstances or arising from a disability or another factor.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Loughlin asked what interventions could be used.  I will not reiterate the point on the lack of support to schools, which I am sure colleagues are going to start screaming about.  While the Minister has made a directive of sorts and has indicated his views in parliamentary questions, schools are just not listening.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne indicated, that might be slightly unfair on schools that are constantly repeating, along with organisations representing people with disabilities, that a lack of appropriate supports and investment in schools is causing an issue.  It is our children who are ultimately being affected by this.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked about the scale of the matter.  We do not know and need to find this out in order to address the matter.</p> <p>  There was a question about what a restricted school timetable looks like.  There are a few aspects.  We take no issue with some of them.  For example, every junior infant in most schools has a reduced timetable.  They are in for short days for the first two weeks while they settle in.  Children with additional needs might have further restrictions.  They might be in for ten minutes on the first day, 20 on the next, half an hour on the next and so on.  We do not take issue with that because it may be part of the child's transition plan for entering the new school setting.</p><p>However, how does it appear where a parent does not agree with it and where it is more punitive in nature?  The child does not arrive in the middle of the day.  He or she usually arrives at 9 a.m. and is taken home at 9.30 a.m. or he or she comes in for whatever hours the school has dictated that he or she  be there and then is taken home.  As a result, the child does not come in for segments of the school day by choice as to what subjects he or she might like.</p><p> On the other side of it - and, again, we do not take issue with this but we would like far more supports for these children - are the children who are on reduced school timetables but it is voluntary and due to major mental health issues such as anxiety.  In dealing with those children, there is a reduced timetable where they would select, perhaps, one subject one day per week or it might be two or three days per week and they would come in just for that subject.  It is voluntary and planned, and is in the best interest of the child.  My concern is that those children do not have any other educational supports for the other days and, with regard to the home tuition scheme, we would like to see something for those pupils whether it is voluntary or involuntary to fulfil what is a constitutional obligation of the State.  While we might argue about whether there are concrete guidelines, there is still a constitutional obligation not to fail these children.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin asked about teachers' backgrounds and training.  We have repeatedly addressed the issue of core teacher training in respect of special educational needs.  Restricted school timetables are not something only seen in mainstream schools.  They are also in special schools.  Special schools are deemed to be the most specialist educational settings.  A child might start off in mainstream school and end up in a special school.  However, where a child ends up on a restricted school timetable in a special school and that is not successful and leads to suspension and possibly expulsion, that child has nowhere else to go because he or she has already gone the route of speciality.  Again, special schools would cite the lack of wraparound supports for those schools being able to deal with a child's difficulties and being able to support and reintegrate the child successfully back into the school.</p><p> We are repeating many of the same themes that go beyond restricted timetables, but they play a large part in this phenomenon.  We still do not know, bar anecdotally, how big it is.</p></speech>

What is also clear is the State's failure to ensure that every Traveller has the right to equality of education in terms of access to, participation in and outcomes from it.  There is a policy on suspensions but reduced timetables are being used as another form of suspension without calling it a suspension, as has been said, to ensure the school does not have to deal with the fallout from it.  There is a hidden practice of suspensions through reduced timetables which is significantly impacting on particular groups of children in the education system.  One of those groups is Traveller children.  Where there are behavioural issues they must be addressed, but let us be clear that it is not the behaviour of the child that is an issue in all instances.  There are low expectations feeding into that and some teachers have said that it is about low attainment levels and the child's struggle to engage in the class.  That should be further resourced.  It should not be reduced timetables which put the child further back in respect of attainment levels.  We see this practice in primary school in particular.</p> <p>  Reduced timetables should not happen in any shape or form, except for clear medical reasons with clear guidance and protocols on a statutory basis.  If there are issues and challenges the school must address them with the parents and whatever agencies and support services are available.  That is not happening.  There is no rationale for putting the majority of Traveller children who are on reduced timetables on such timetables.  It should not be happening.  We are hearing that it is the first port of call for some schools, although not all schools, with regard to Traveller children.</p> <p>  One of the case studies we provided in our submission was about a young Traveller girl in sixth year.  She was effectively the last man standing in terms of her cohort of four or five friends and relations who were Traveller children who had dropped out by that stage.  A request was made to the school to let her sit in with the third year canteen where there was a cousin and three other Traveller girls who were doing their junior certificate.  It was refused.  In the follow-up discussion with the mother and the principal the only alternative on the table was putting her on a reduced timetable, which the mother said was not an option.  She wanted to get her child to leaving certificate and the best opportunity for that was being in the classroom for the full day.  Subsequent to that, the four Traveller children who were in the junior certificate year and in the canteen the mother had asked the school to let her daughter sit with were put on reduced timetables.  There were no behavioural issues.  As there is one school in that same location that is putting excessive numbers of Traveller children on reduced timetables, the Traveller children in other schools are seeking to be transferred to it to get the shorter timetable.  That is also a product of the lack of expectations from the education system with regard to Traveller children.</p> <p>  There were questions about the lack of data and numbers and on how schools reached that decision.  In some ways we are equally at a loss on that.  The schools are saying that data are not being collected.  We have been told that the inspectorate does not ask about reduced timetables.  If the Minister is stating at national level that this practice is unacceptable but the schools are employing it to excess with particular groups of children without just cause or they are opting for that as the solution rather than working out the rest of the issue, that is incredibly unacceptable and must be addressed.  It must be stamped out.  Schools must be held to account where it is not being addressed.</p> <p>  As regards Traveller children being put on reduced timetables in primary school, those children will be lost to the system in terms of trying to then engage with a secondary school system where there is a history of educational disadvantage, marginalisation, discrimination and racism.  Those children will not get to junior certificate or leaving certificate.  We see that borne out across the board in the statistics.  It must be seriously addressed.</p> <p>  Section 29 on the procedure for suspensions is in place, but it puts the onus back on parents.  The onus should not be on parents.  Schools should be held to account in this regard.  In terms of assessing the scale of the current situation with reduced timetables it is important that an independent investigation is undertaken by the Ombudsman for Children that looks at the numbers, the scale of it, the reasons for it and the consequences for the children who are put on those timetables.</p> <p>  Yes, resources are needed.  There have been widespread cuts in resources, particularly in Traveller education.  We have seen the consequences of that, as the committee heard in the earlier meeting in March.  Currently, albeit anecdotally, the transfer rate of Traveller children from primary to secondary is only 80%.  That is unacceptable and must be addressed.  Resources must also be provided to support the families and the local Traveller organisations in trying to stamp this out, while also engaging with schools to do it.</p></speech>

That confusion is already adding to the stress of the parents and children because there is no clear rationale for their use.</p><p>Senator Ruane spoke about data.  I would like to hear from others on this issue.  To my knowledge this is collected in primary schools and published but not so in secondary schools.  It makes sense for it to be collected and published in secondary schools when this is already happening in primary schools.</p><p> Deputy Martin asked who decides children's school subjects and why these are chosen.

The NAPD is very grateful for the opportunity to make a submission to the Joint Committee for Education and Skills on the use of reduced timetables in schools.  Members of our executive were invited to forward comments on areas they regarded as relevant to this particular submission.  I am also speaking in my own capacity as a principal of a community school.  I was in school yesterday and I will be in school first thing in the morning.</p> <p>  School timetables are first and foremost about ensuring that our students access the curriculum as prescribed by the Department of Education and Skills.  The primary goal of our timetables is to meet the needs of all our students - I am stressing all of our students.  Effective timetabling is all about supporting all of our students to reach their full potential.  Effective, clever and strategic timetabling can facilitate our students to access the additional resources that are provided to us by the Department through the allocations model.  In many schools they have very effective and creative use of team teaching which can meet the needs of all of the students in the classroom.  Again, effective timetabling can also be used to reduce and minimise possible disciplinary challenges as well.  </p> <p>  However, in exceptional circumstances, consideration may have to be given to reduced timetables to help with a variety of challenges.  These range from students with serious and significant medical issues, or a student who is reintegrating or coming back to us after a long period of absence.  I have sat opposite students with serious issues around mental health, and to ask such students to come into school for a full day would have been very difficult for them.  One does everything one can to help a student and their parents to get that student back into school in a meaningful way.  There are times as well where behavioural issues are so significant that it is not just impacting on the rights of the child, but on the rights of the other students in that classroom as well.</p> <p>  Reduced timetables should only be considered and agreed in consultation with school management, the students themselves, the parents and guardians, and very much in consultation also with external agencies.  The external agencies I am specifically referring to are those that advocate for their students such as the education welfare officer; Tusla; the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS; special educational needs organisers, SENOs, under the National Council for Special Education, NCSE; and, if a school is fortunate enough to be one of the 75 schools involved, the national behaviour support service, NBSS, supporting behaviour for learning, which is a wonderful resource for school, or, equally, if a school is fortunate to access the services of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.</p> <p>  There are times that a reduced timetable may be used, and the goal of the timetable should always be about the child and getting them back into school.  As to management of reduced timetable, it is on a continuum and it is the last option, where everything else has been considered and all other resources have been used.  I fully agree with Mr. Reilly that real conditions and parameters are needed around the use of a timetable.  Specifically, there is a start and end date; reviewing on a daily basis through use of things like report cards; and, regular meetings with the parents.  Then one decides what is best for the individual child and where we are going with this.  This is very much at the end of the continuum.</p> <p>  I am very conscious as a school principal that the impact of disengagement from school is catastrophic for our young people.  Once a child is marginalised, it has significant impacts, not just on their individual well-being, but on their life chances, not just for that child but very often for their whole family as well.</p> <p>  The idea of reducing a timetable should only be used in very exceptional circumstances and in the best interests of the child.  It should clearly indicate a plan that will point to a transition for that young person back into school or, where appropriate, a lateral movement to another placement that will serve the very real specific needs of that individual child.</p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to speak here and I will answer any questions later on.</p></speech>

I also speak as a principal who operated reduced timetables and I hold up my hand and say that.  I will not repeat much of what Mr. Golden has said, because he could have been looking at my script as to the content of his.</p> <p>  IPPN are in favour of reduced timetables but only in very limited circumstances, be that medical or as part of an overall plan for a particular pupil and if it is of benefit to the pupil, who has to be at the centre of it.  Points were raised earlier about parental consent.  Every teacher and principal I know would say straight out that where the home and the school are working together, there are better outcomes.  If there is not agreement there, this cannot happen.</p> <p>  The second point relates to the Constitution; why are principals and schools operating a system that is, in theory, against the Constitution?  By and large, principals are fairly law-abiding in how they go about their work.  They are faced with a dilemma on a daily basis, which is part of the problem we have.  The dilemma is to balance the rights of that individual pupil and rights of the other pupils in the class.  This is one of the constants we have.  Some children do not operate well in a system.  That is just a fact of life for those particular pupils.  Yet, we insist on shoehorning them into the systems we have in schools, simply because that is the system that we are operating.  </p> <p>  As to supports, as was mentioned earlier, as a school principal, part of the problem we have is that we cannot wait two years to get therapeutic supports.  Sometimes we have special needs assistants, SNAs, who will support those pupils, but the SNA may not be the right person.  We do not have the behavioural backup.</p> <p>  There is a new model being proposed by the NCSE which we look forward to, where there are going to be regional support teams.  That might help but it will not be the be all and end all.  From an IPPN point of view, the reduced timetable has to be for a very specific purpose and timeframe.  </p> <p>  The other issue raised is that this is silent suspension.  In my own time in school - and I have been 32 years as a school leader - it would have been easier for me at times to suspend a pupil than to use a reduced timetable.  It is not that it is an either-or situation in the sense that putting a child on a reduced timetable was an easy way out.  In fact sometimes it was a harder way out in that with the suspension, one followed one's guidelines.  The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, guidelines were mentioned earlier and were like a bible for every school principal dealing with these issues.  If most school principals could avoid suspension, they would do so at all costs, for the good and self-esteem of the pupil.  These are some of the issues I have.</p> <p>  As to there being no official recognition of the extent of the problem, that is because nobody is asking.  With the primary online database, POD, it is very easy to create an extra field and put this into it.  We make returns to Tusla every year, and it would be very easy to create an extra field if we wanted.</p><p>I am not sure that the Department wants to get the figures on this.  It is a dilemma that schools and principals are faced with.</p></speech>

I should almost get air miles.  My submission to today's meeting says that this must be couched in two things.  First is the code of behaviour, which was mentioned by Mr. Goff and others.  Those guidelines recognise that every school has its own unique character.  Special education and special schools would look at those in that fashion.  They are not the first port of call.  Second is the Education Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, as well as the right of the other children to be educated, as Mr. Goff noted.  We have received legal advice on that some time ago and there is no provision in law or Department of Education and Skills circulars for the use of the reduced timetable or the reduced day.  For some pupils, the school day is too long.  The shortened school day could be for medical communications or behavioural difficulties and may be necessary temporarily.  When someone calls me about this I will ask what else they tried, and they will tell me they tried everything.  They do not want to suspend the child but to keep him or her in school for some part of the day.  There are also health and safety concerns which we will discuss.  People want a positive school experience.  Sometimes pupils need one-to-one support, which was alluded to earlier, which may not be in the school's resources.  The last reason for use of a shortened school day would be for medical reasons, and there being no access to a school nurse would be an important factor.  Crucially, the decision to use a shortened school day should be focused on the well-being of the student concerned, should be discussed and agreed in advance with parents and the multi-disciplinary team, if there is one, and should see a decrease in occurrences of undesirable behaviour where that is the cause.  If it does not, then other options must be examined.  It should only be used in exceptional circumstances and include a timeline and plan for increasing the time in the school and for the pupil eventually to attend for the full school day.  It should be constantly monitored and reviewed.  This is the advice that comes from our own group of principals.  I have always advised that the reduced school day should only be for a short period and that everything else should be tried and documented.  Sometimes the reduced school day for pupils with special educational needs is the only option they have to get their constitutional rights.</p> <p>  I always try to come with some solutions.  The same solutions have probably been repeated for several years.  I return to whole-school training in the areas of positive behaviour support.  This should be used for all school staff, including bus escorts.  There ought to be an annual training fund for schools so that they can access that as it is a very expensive form of training which is quite hard to get.  I note that the new school inclusion model, which is in some of the area in which Deputy O'Loughlin and I are based, includes a new national training system for special needs assistants, SNAs, which I welcome as we have sought that for a long time.</p> <p>  I also recommend that we finally implement as absolute policy the recommendation of the NCSE policy advice where there is a reduced pupil-teacher ratio for children with special serious medical needs.  Substitute cover for special education is another issue which arises.  The first day of absence is never covered and it is very difficult for schools to break up a class of children with special education needs.  I also mentioned posts of responsibility.  We welcome the appointment of administrative deputy principals for schools with 15 class teachers, but we think an examination of the needs of these schools should allow consideration for further school management supports. My submission also refers to the new school inclusion model which refers to a new national nursing support and increased access to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  At last, after many years where we, the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, and other education partners looked for the guidelines on challenging behaviour, an expert group is in existence which is working on those.  They should be published for the next school year.  That is very important.</p> <p>  Some school buildings are unsuitable for purpose, particularly for special schools.  Members of the committee will have seen this for themselves.  They cater for pupils between four and 18 years.  However, the needs of a child at 4 years are completely different from those of someone aged 18.  That should be considered when applications are made to improve school buildings.</p> <p>  Last night I was at a garden party at the Phoenix Park school which has made a sanctuary nurture garden.  It is a school for pupils with severe emotional and behavioural difficulties.  They remarked on the difference the garden had made, for which they had not received any funding.  It was all from sponsorship, fundraising and other sources.  That is a serious concern.  We do need other things apart from teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.</p></speech>

Schools are probably the most complex structured and heavily regulated institutions in the State.  Within that a secondary school timetable has to answer the questions of who teaches what to whom, and when and where for hundreds of students at any given time.  School timetables end up like a locked-in jigsaw.  Secondary schools have limited flexibility to design a bespoke timetable for any particular student who needs a range of so-called practical subjects, for example, where these happen to run concurrently.</p> <p>  We should at this point distinguish between a reduced curriculum and a reduced timetable or school day, as these are not always the same thing.  A student can be studying a reduced number of subjects but still have other learning opportunities that provide for a full day every day, and the new junior cycle framework allows for this.</p> <p>  Schools do not take the decision to reduce a student&rsquo;s timetable unilaterally or lightly.  In my experience, these decisions are taken in consultation with parents or guardians and the professional services, where they can get them.  For every student who has a reduced timetable developed for him or her, there can be a long back story of efforts, interventions, creative solution seeking, professional engagement and encouragement provided by his or her school.  This approach is almost always a last resort.  The consequences of reducing the school day can be to reduce the breadth of the curriculum and interrupt continuity of tuition in some subjects.  Therefore, decisions to reduce a timetable are often taken as a trade-off.  It can be unrealistic and unfair to force an adolescent into the straitjacket of a full-on timetable and socially intensive school day when she or he is clearly not able for it for a period of time.</p> <p>  A concern arises, however, where a reduced timetable may be put in place instead of a more effective strategy.  Why would a school contemplate this, even with the agreement of the parents?  The answer, as many people have observed this morning, lies in the failure of the State to provide a wrap-around, professionalised therapeutic, psychiatric and behavioural therapy service to students.  It is virtually impossible to get timely and recurring access to an occupational or speech and language therapist or a specialist in emotional and behavioural support.  School principals find themselves landed in the roles of counsellor, psychotherapist, behaviour management specialist, family mediator and decision-maker well beyond their fields of expertise or qualification.</p> <p>  The promised NCSE framework for supporting students with additional care needs is being trialled but it cannot come soon enough.  Meanwhile, many principals have a sense of being abandoned to care for students in crisis and still ensure that the educational experience and outcomes of the majority in our overcrowded classrooms are protected.  There now exists an opportunity to resource properly the NCSE strategy for supporting students which will eliminate in most cases the need to reduce a student&rsquo;s school day.</p></speech>

I recognise that much of the issue is caused by schools being under-resourced or because the proper supports that ensure children have the well-rounded education they deserve are not in place due to a lack of investment.</p> <p>  Who decides which subjects a child has access to in his or her curriculum?  What are the criteria?  Is a child entitled to learn English and Irish but not other subjects?  I refer especially to second level with its broader curriculum, given that in primary school all the teachers have the same subject-related training whereas it differs in secondary school.  After it has been decided or, perhaps, agreed that a child has been put on a reduced timetable, are the parents given any information in that regard?  The teachers have spent time with the child, have taught him or her subjects and know how he or she is progressing.  What happens if a parent disagrees and does not want the child to be on a reduced timetable?  I ask because Mr. Goff and Mr. Golden will have experienced the issue as principals.  In that scenario, what would happen for the parents and the principal?</p> <p>  Is a clear plan for the transition back to a full timetable given to parents?  A plan could include details of how the transition will work and a roadmap to return the child to a full timetable.  Does the Department write to principals to ask whether they operate a reduced timetable, how many students are on it, how a decision is made, whether the parents have agreed and what supports are needed to help the child return to a full timetable?  I refer to an assessment of the supports and of how the timetable operates.  If my son or daughter was put on a reduced timetable and I was in full-time work, I would not be able to collect him or her from school.  Would he or she have to sit in the office with the secretary and wait to be collected?  If so, that is segregation because the rest of the school would see the child sitting in the office.  It cannot be good for the office staff either if there are behavioural difficulties and the child has to wait in the office for two or three hours.  Even the best-behaved students would misbehave if they were left for two hours in an office.  What would happen in that scenario?  I cannot believe that a school would call at 9.10 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. and say it is time for a child to go home.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, I have read the submissions and was present to hear our guests' responses to members' questions.</p> <p>  This is an important issue.  It has been hidden but we are shedding light on it.  People know a great deal about many educational issues but very few know about the issue of reduced timetables.  Do all our guests support the returning of data to the Department?  Mr. Goff stated it would be easy enough to put an extra field on the pod.  If it was a recommendation, would they support it?  One of the most important steps seems to be that the Department should know the extent of the matter.</p> <p>  Mr. Golden stated the use of reduced timetables should be by agreement with parents.  Is it always decided by agreement with parents?  Are there discussions with parents, or is it just the phone call which Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned?  As Ms Dempsey stated, sometimes parents understand and agree that a reduced timetable is appropriate for a child who might have particular health issues or where the parent recognises that attending school all day is a difficulty for the child.  Do our guests agree that reduced timetables should be used in consultation with parents at all times?  </p> <p>  My next question might be more appropriately directed at the Department rather than at our guests.  When a child is not given his or her constitutional right to attend school for education, what right does he or she have to an alternative outside the school?  It seems a corollary that if a child is not receiving his or her educational support in school, he or she should receive it elsewhere.</p> <p>  There seems to be a general agreement that a reduced timetable should be a last resort, that is, that it should be rare and used only where other interventions have been made.  According to the first contributions, however, it seems to be fairly widespread.  While there may be an ideal of how it should operate in schools, it seems there are schools where that is not the case and where children are regularly put on reduced timetables.  I would like there to be clear information about when and how it happens, who is consulted and whether the Department knows.  It should not be murky and hidden.  Rather, it should be clear and public, and there should be alternative support for the child.  </p> <p>  My first questions, about sharing data by agreement, are probably most suited to Mr. Goff and Mr. Golden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019053000002#K00300"><p>I am heartened by what our guests outlined is the procedure within their schools.  I appreciate Mr. Goff's and Mr. Golden's points and their experience, given that they have been school principals for a long period.  On the face of it, there seems to be a conflict, although that might be too strong a word, between their contributions and those we heard earlier.  I am heartened that when reduced timetables are implemented, it is a last resort, subject to agreement with the parents.  According to the first presentations, however, it seems that is not always the case.  Our guests might comment on that.</p> <p>  I stated earlier that the finger is being pointed in schools' direction, which is unfair.  We have learned in the meeting that schools do not have the necessary machinery or infrastructure to do the job properly.  The system is failing not just the parents and children involved but also the schools, teachers and principals.  The Department appears to be turning its back on the issue, given that it does not seem to want to know the scale of the problem, not to mention try to address the problem, which is worrying.  Based on what we have heard in the meeting, it is clear the finger is being pointed in the correct direction, namely, at the Department.  It is within the Department's gift to find a solution, which we all seek.  As Mr. Goff outlined, a simple measure such as a pod, returned every so often with information on the scale of the problem and on how it is being addressed, would be a natural first step.  As a committee, I am sure we will take that on board and include it as one of our recommendations.  </p> <p>  Our guests spoke of the impact of reduced timetables on the child, which is an important issue.  Children nowadays are under more pressure than ever.  Being segregated in any way would have a serious impact on the child's future well-being, which we must be conscious of.</p><p>I am heartened by the fact that it is a last resort and that, by and large, it is done in consultation with parents.</p><p> I thank our guests for their contributions.  I am a lot wiser that I was before the meeting.  We will have to follow the issue up with the Department to get some direction.  We need to find the extent of the problem and then to implement measures to address it.</p></speech>

There does not appear to be any disagreement regarding the collection of data in this area.  It is about how we do it.  We do not have a clear pattern of how it is being used because we cannot record it.  What are the interventions that happened before the point of last resort?  What did they look like for the child, the family?  Were they specific to an individual child or was there a blanket approach?  We are doing ourselves a disservice by not having information about, and knowledge of, what had been put in place up until that point.  Other schools may have been implementing different types of interventions which have worked.  Without being able to collect that information we are not going to be able to look at other practices or schools that do not have reduced timetables.  A child should never miss out on school but in cases of disability and special education, there may be medical reasons and different interventions from special educational needs assistants, SENOs.  A huge number of parents said they had no interaction with their SENOs.  What work is the SENO doing in the context of collecting the information relating to the families they support?</p> <p>  I am at a loss as to why there are no historical data on Traveller children or children from different socio-economic backgrounds in the context of special educational needs or long-term supports in school.  I wonder what the data on Traveller children would look like.  They are a particular cohort where special needs cut across every school.  I know of one kid in Tallaght who was given an iPad in school every morning and he sat in the classroom on his iPad.  There was a low expectation and an acceptance that the child might not continue, maybe because his siblings had not continued.  That was at primary level but I also know of a girl at secondary level whose teachers did not invest in her as she prepared for junior certificate because she was going to be married when she turned 16.  They assumed that one thing negated the other in this case, rather than accepting that she wanted to do her junior certificate and continue with her education.</p> <p>  How do we resource special education so as not to have reduced timetables and so that buildings are adequate and special assistants are in place?  What about the cohorts for whom we do not even have a medical background or a sociological analysis of why reduced timetables are being used?  We need to collect data on all schools for why reduced timetables are being used.  Teachers have to be accountable by showing what they have put in place, following which we would be able to see what is working and what is not.  I do not assume that teachers have not tried other methods but I wonder if they tried them in isolation or before they worked with the wider services.  Research by AsIAm found that some parents had no interaction with their school in giving consent.  Reduced timetables were as a result of the beginning of disciplinary procedures, and not just because of medical or other reasons.  This ties into the code of behaviour but also into questions of how we manage difficult behaviour, especially for children who have experienced huge trauma in their communities before they even enter the classroom.  We need to adapt teaching to deal with this because teaching can look a little different in those communities.  I left school very young and a reduced timetable was forced on me but I was at home doing drugs.  That was not the best thing for me and the school might have sat down with me and learned that I was really stressed and frustrated.  Do we try to do what is best for the student in the long term and when he or she re-enters the community?  Something might seem to be the best thing for a student in a certain situation but it might not be the best alternative.</p> <p>  We need to be able to give mechanisms to schools to show them what is and is not being done and what the outcomes are.  What are the steps to be taken, the outcomes and the follow-ups for children who have re-entered school?  It is only when we have the necessary knowledge that we will see the patterns and the solutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.744" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019053000002#L00300"><p>I completely accept the bona fides of everybody who is here and they have made an important contribution to the discussion.  I accept that, in some instances, a reduced timetable is better than expulsion or suspension.  Keeping a student within the school system is better than having him or her outside it, especially in the cases of illnesses.  As my colleagues stated, data collection is vital and it is important to quantify the needs in order to get the extra supports needed from the Department.  It is very difficult for teachers if there are extreme behavioural issues and we have to consider the impact on other children in the classroom.  We cannot ignore it and it is an issue for everybody - the whole school community, families and the community in general.  Extra supports should certainly be provided.  It is regrettable that there is no access to home tuition for children on reduced timetables for a certain time - it should never be for a prolonged period.  What are our guests' views on that?</p> <p>  Ms Corr referred to additional resources and training for schools.  Both are hugely important.  In a lot of cases, teachers and school staff are not equipped to deal with situations.  If more investment was put into training at that point, it would yield a better outcome for all of us.  Deputy Catherine Martin spoke about parents who were working and have to take their children from school.  Many parents may choose to stay at home while their children are young, hoping to get back into the workforce when the children go to school.  It is a reasonable expectation but, all of a sudden, it becomes very difficult for them to do this.</p><p>Similarly, if children who travel to school by bus have a reduced timetable, there may be no car at home or a parent may have to go to work in the car and it may be extremely difficult for the other parent to collect the child.  All of these issues have to be considered.  We are hearing conflicting things about guidelines, whether they should be more robust and whether they should be made in collaboration with parents and teachers or whether the school should make the decision.  It should be a collaboration in all cases but there should also be an appeals mechanism for parents.  If there is a single entity collecting the information and providing the guidelines, which more than likely would be the Department of Education and Skills, there should be a clear appeals mechanism for the parents.</p></speech>

Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked if we would support returning statistics.  We would support this, 100%.  Schools and principals feel they have nothing to hide.  We would rather be transparent and open about everything we do.  Deputies Catherine Martin and Jan O'Sullivan asked if it is always in agreement with parents.  I would be very surprised if a child was put on a reduced day at the first meeting the principal and teacher has had with the parent.  Normally we would have been working through an individual education plan, IEP, for that child.  As was pointed out earlier, if the reduced day is not a last resort, it should not be used.  I would say there would have been many meetings prior to a meeting to discuss reduced timetables.  The question then arises as to whether there is still conflict or whether a parent agrees with it.  Unfortunately in such cases, the only alternative for the school is a suspension.  That is possibly what would have happened if there was not a reduced timetable in that case.</p> <p>  I agree on home schooling but it also needs to be monitored.  We would not like to see home schooling take the place of school.</p></speech>

In a situation where, for example, I ring the Deputy and she either refuses to come or cannot come, in primary schools 60% of our principals are teaching principals so they do not have a choice; they have to teach a class anyway.  They have limited secretarial support.  The child would either have to continue in class or move to another class.  That is in respect of primary school.  On the decision as regards subjects on the reduced timetable, a lot will depend on the purpose of the reduced timetable.  Sometimes, break time in the yard is the trigger for some pupils.  We would be looking at that as part of their behaviour plan; if the trigger was taken out of the equation, maybe the afternoon would be different.  Those would be the various issues we would be dealing with.  It is a constant dilemma.</p></speech>

In the past five years in particular, we have become more and more accountable, which is a good thing.  Principals and schools are accountable.  Parents should not be under the illusion that some individual made a decision and that is it.  We are accountable to our boards of management.  I am accountable to the board of management in my school.  It is the old Donald Rumsfeld phrase, "compliance, compliance, compliance."  Schools are now very compliant places.  Parents are perfectly entitled to ask the question and appeal it.  They can ask for more detail.  Some points were well made by my colleagues here in that regard.  We are accountable for what we do, thankfully.  We do not have to make decisions in isolation.  That protects all of us.</p> <p>  I will bring some of the questions together, if that is okay, rather than trying to remember who asked which one.</p></speech>

This year alone, my school has had a whole-school evaluation - management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, incidentals and subject inspections recently, as well as a DEIS evaluation.  There are incidental inspections and special educational needs, SEN, evaluations.  Timetables are checked.  I refer to school timetables, not individual timetables.  Every child is entitled to 28 hours' tuition at second level.  An inspector will go through the timetable methodically and will check that the students are getting 28 hours' tuition.  The post-primary DEIS evaluation is very forensic.  They look for very specific data, including how many suspensions a school has had in the last four years in respect of male and female students; the number of expulsions of male and female pupils in the last four years; and the number of students, male and female, on reduced timetables.  For my own school, I was able to say that we had zero in the last four years.  Anecdotally, I will tell the committee why.  About six years ago I had a student going into the senior cycle who was extremely challenging.  I know exactly what Senator Ruane is talking about in terms of communities.  Our school is a sanctuary and a safe place for our kids.  It is an important place for them.  For a variety of reasons, this particular boy was extremely difficult.  We went through all the options of what kind of supports had been offered to him.  He had been referred to a student support team and had worked with a guidance counsellor, a learning support teacher and the educational welfare officer, EWO.  We had worked the parents on numerous occasions.  He had that one significant adult, which we all know about.  We had teachers trained up in the check and connect intervention model who met the student.  However, we were coming towards a point where he was getting extremely difficult for other kids as well.  The EWO persuaded us to try a reduced timetable.  It was an absolute disaster.  The student ended up being totally disengaged and disaffected with school and it was almost his pathway out of school.  We were almost formalising that and telling him his behaviour was too difficult.  Four weeks later, another student came into the office and asked to try the timetable the first boy had.  It is not necessarily the right way.  We have to ask ourselves what the behaviours of students are telling us and we must hear what they have to say.  I could not see a reduced timetable working at post-primary level, although I take the point about having a conversation with the pupil and finding out which teachers he or she gets on well with.  There are nine periods in a school day.  The student might tell us he likes Ms Ruane, she is sound, he does not like Ms Martin, and he likes Ms O'Sullivan.  He is with Ms Ruane for period 1, will not go to Ms Martin for period 2, and will be with Ms O'Sullivan for period 3.  Where will he go in period 2?  Coming back to compliance, the issue for us is safeguarding.  Who is going to mind that child for the 40 minutes?  We have a duty of care.  Am I going to ring his mum and ask her to come up for 40 minutes?  It is this issue around compliance and it is just not workable in terms of having a kid in for one class and out for another.  The other issue, then, is where we find the teacher.  All the teachers are timetabled.  The timetable is done by the end of June.  We cannot free somebody up to mind somebody, and the pupil deserves to be minded.  On home tuition, where does the parent get the right teacher to mind the child and give good quality learning and teaching at home or wherever it might take place?  I am not going to get on the soapbox about teacher supply but I think we know that.</p></speech>

In our schools we sit down and it is almost like an individual education plan in deciding the plan to go back to school.  It takes in what is to be done in week one, week two and week three, for example.  Sometimes this happens because of a suspension and the pupil is being reintroduced to school.  Sometimes a suspension is an alternative to getting extra resources.  Sometimes people will take action under section 29 to see what comes out of it.  We would certainly welcome data collection.  We are saying it is fairly widespread, but we must confirm this and where it happens.  It would be very useful to have the information as we would then all know where we stood.  I am glad to hear of the supports people are hearing about and the right supports should be available at the right time.  Sometimes the special needs assistant is seen as a support, but sometimes there must be behavioural support available or services such as occupational therapy.  I am really looking forward to seeing the school inclusion model.  I am very aware of what is being done as the personnel are located in the Kildare Education Centre.  It is interesting as they are helping teachers to help the students.  It is a very good model and I would love to see it rolled out throughout the country.  I am also dying to see more training provided for schools.  Some parents in our schools are aware that if there was a reduced timetable, they could move to a section 29 scenario.  Sometimes that is the way they go because they know that is from where additional resources will come.  That is not right as they should be given and people should not have to fight for them.</p></speech>

This was having gone through a sequence of interventions until the end, as the committee has heard.  I was never happy about them and parents were never happy either.  Although the students initially thought it was great, later they hated the reduced timetables.  It is very important to remember the student's perspective; although it sounds like a bit of a holiday or that there is daylight in their day, what do they do?  The answer very often was nothing and it led to their souls and spirits sinking.  Their engagement with life in general just dipped.  There is a recurring theme in this conversation that the reduced timetables are an answer to the question of a student's profound and enduring misbehaviour and the consequences for everybody else in a classroom.  From where does it come?  It is only now that we are beginning to really understand the insights into behaviour management.  When I was a principal in the 1990s, things were open and shut, but there was no National Behaviour Support Service, for example.  We were on our own and when that happens, we work out justice for the majority, rather than the individual, in spite of all of our best efforts.  Now things are much better, despite the increased pupil-teacher ratio, which has not improved since the cuts were made during the recession.</p> <p>  There is a worrying theme emerging in this conversation.  I was here before to speak about school costs and it was the same theme.  It concerns parent power.  The Constitution can state all it likes about parents being the primary educators of their children, but the power differential is palpable when a young mother is sitting in a principal's office.  It is more often than not the mother who is there.  It is something that really needs our serious attention.  What emerges very often when things go well for the family is that the principal has given power to the parent.  In other cases, the parent needs to claim it and is not in a position to do so.  That is something that is deep and profound and it results in bad outcomes for families, students, children and teenagers.  It is something that is worthy of greater attention.  It is easy to be a giant in a land of pygmies.  Certain teachers, school principals and boards can behave like giants when they do not have the constitutional or even moral authority to make life-impacting decisions on children and, by extension, their families without justification.  There is a justice and power element to be examined and we must drill a little further into it.</p></speech>

They are most welcome.  This committee holds the men and women of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force in the highest regard.  At every opportunity, it has highlighted the importance of setting out firm policies and actions for the retention of personnel in the Defence Forces to both the Minister of State with responsibility for defence matters and departmental officials.  Committee members look forward to hearing the presentation by RACO on these very important issues.</p><p>Members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off completely or switched to airplane, safe, or flight mode, depending on the device used.  It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode as it will still maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting and recording systems.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or an entity outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call on Commandant King to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am honoured to address the joint committee on behalf of the officers of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann to highlight the current retention crisis that affects all ranks of the organisation and sincerely thank the committee for its invitation.  It is heartening to note the interest of committee members in the welfare of Defence Forces personnel.  These loyal citizens now need their support more than ever.</p><p>I am joined today by Lt. Col. Derek Priestley, who is deputy general secretary of the association, and the president of RACO, Commandant Shane Keogh.</p><p> In discussing the retention crisis, I will also touch on a number of contributing factors, including the lack of viable or credible retention policies in the Department of Defence and the weakened industrial relations status of the Defence Forces representative associations.  Sadly, the Government has exploited this situation to the detriment of the well-being of the officers, soldiers, sailors and aircrew of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  The State has been left vulnerable as a result.  Although Richard Branson may not be viewed as an eminent military strategist, these words attributed to him are quite apt in this context: "Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don&rsquo;t want to."  In the Defence Forces, we train our people to the highest standards at no small cost to the Exchequer.  We align the qualifications achieved with best industry practice and academic accreditation, thereby satisfying the first criterion of Mr. Branson's statement.  We then fail miserably in fulfilling the second part of his maxim.</p><p> The dysfunctional cycle of turnover being suffered by the Defence Forces was identified by researchers from the University of Limerick in 2015 and 2017.  It has continued unabated.  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann is now at its lowest strength in decades.  In more than 20 years of service, I have certainly never seen morale as low as it is today.  This trend appears set to continue according to numerous employee engagement surveys of Defence Forces personnel and RACO's own recent research.  Some 3,200 personnel left the Defence Forces between 2014 and 2018.  That is an astonishing 34.7% of the average strength for those years.  Before people conclude that this is due to the early mandatory retirement ages for Defence Forces personnel, I should point out that 82% of these departures were premature voluntary retirements.  Numerous media publications reported recently that the unprecedented recruitment drive in 2017 yielded a single figure net increase in personnel and that &euro;15 million was spent on induction training that year.  It may shock the committee to learn that the Defence Forces attempted to induct a similar number of candidates through a highly visible and professional recruitment campaign last year and, frighteningly, there was actually a net loss of 120 personnel.  </p><p> In March this year, RACO reported to the Public Service Pay Commission that the turnover rate was a devastatingly high 8.1%.  That rate now stands at 9% overall, and it is 14% in the Naval Service.  In comparison, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence recently declared a retention crisis when the turnover rate in the UK armed forces reached 5%.  There were 256 discharges from the Defence Forces in the first four months of 2019.  This is by far the highest figure since the reorganisation of 2012.  An unprecedented 86 discharges took place in April 2019 alone.  The impact of operating with reduced numbers is already being felt across the Defence Forces.  The Army is struggling to fulfil its assigned tasks, domestically and internationally.  Ships are unable to go to sea and aircraft are not flying as a result of personnel shortages, yet the Department of Defence continues to prioritise costly recruitment policies over tangible retention initiatives.  This historically high turnover rate is leading to the creation of a crippling operational and training tempo for the remaining service personnel.  When will the Government shout stop?  Does it realise that defence capability is being ground into the dust?  Does it care?</p><p> Inadequate supervision and mentoring, combined with inadequate trained manning levels, leads to inevitable burnout.  That creates serious concerns for governance and the ability to manage risk and ensure the well-being of our personnel.  The climate survey and focus group reports conducted by the University of Limerick laid bare the mental health difficulties, increased stress and low morale being experienced by Defence Forces soldiers, sailors and aircrew.  Our people are double and treble jobbing in an effort to maintain operational output due to inadequate trained manning levels in units.</p><p> According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the personnel of the Defence Forces have been the lowest paid of any organisation in the public sector for many years.  This is ironic given that the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, has consistently reported that the Defence Forces is by far the most trusted public service organisation in the State, with a trust score of 82%.  Something does not add up.   Some 87% of all Defence Forces personnel earn well below the average public sector wage.  Senior Government officials have been heard to remark that someone needs to be the lowest paid.  The fact that the lowest paid public sector organisation in the State is also the most defenceless in terms of advocating for its rights is deeply unfair and disrespectful to the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, many of whom are forced to rely on social welfare to support their families.</p><p> Normal public service employment conditions do not apply to members of the Defence Forces.  Serving Defence Forces personnel forfeit normal employee status while remaining subject to military law at all times.  They have no right to strike and they can be called on 24-7, 365 days of the year.  Their unlimited liability contract requires them to face hardship and danger for the benefit of others.  The health and safety provisions of the EU working time directive do not apply to the Defence Forces and the State is in breach of this EU legislation.  Personnel are subject to mandatory early retirement and annual military standard medical and fitness testing.  While we voluntarily accept these unique constraints, we expect to be treated fairly in return.  The obligation on defence management, in recognition of these service restrictions and industrial relations limitations, should be to advocate on behalf of the personnel of the Defence Forces.  RACO members instead see an ongoing failure on the part of the Department of Defence to protect our weakened employee status and ensure that the personnel of the Defence Forces are not disadvantaged relative to other public service employees.  The Department&rsquo;s approach to representation has been divisive, dismissive and, sometimes, subversive.  This has led to an adversarial and dysfunctional industrial relations climate and that has been to the detriment of the well-being of the most loyal citizens of this State.  It is nothing short of shameful.  I am happy to elaborate further if required by the committee. </p><p> The Department of Defence has failed to prioritise retention in the Defence Forces.  This is the case even though it is evident that the continual recruitment campaigns are failing to address the ongoing reduction in overall strength, particularly where the underlying reasons for the continued exodus of personnel also remain unresolved.  Given that the Department of Defence saves millions of euro every year on the backs of its employees - &euro;26.5 million in 2016 - why does it not see fit to introduce retention initiatives?  This approach is in stark contrast to our near neighbours across the Irish Sea.  Respect and value for servicemen and women in the United Kingdom are enshrined in an armed forces covenant.  That covenant recognises the freedoms willingly given up by military personnel and their families and the restrictions and hazards they face but, in return, it pledges to support, protect and treat them fairly.  Let us not forget that soldiers are citizens too.  The State must reconsider how it values its Defence Forces and what exactly it expects of them.  Ireland spends a comparatively negligible 0.3% of GDP on defence, the lowest figure in the European Union and behind even Luxembourg and Malta.  This level of spending speaks volumes about how seriously this State views the security of its citizens and economy.</p><p> Initiatives to increase numbers have included reductions in the established benchmarks of entry standards, training standards and timelines.  The dilution of security clearance measures and the reduction in recruit and cadet basic training timelines have had the objective of reducing the time taken to increase the numbers.  These measures have had no medium or long-term impact other than to potentially expose the organisation to greater operational and organisational risk.  No amount of water will fill a leaky bucket.  In the face of strong objections from RACO, the Department enthusiastically dispensed with the internationally proven model of fixed period promotion for technical officers of the ordnance and engineer corps.  That change left these officers with no viable career paths and effectively showed them the door.  They are now faced with a choice of returning to line units or leaving the Defence Forces if they wish to advance their careers.  In either event, six years of full-time training at significant cost to the Exchequer, as well as several invaluable years spent learning the trade, are being lost.</p><p> The Department of Defence also removed retention initiatives for pilots.  That has left the Air Corps on its knees, with the shortfall in pilots now standing at more than 30% and counting.  Coupled with chronic shortages in aircraft technicians, this has threatened operational capability and impacted on service delivery.  Despite the unprecedented levels of induction training, officer instructors continue to be denied the specialised instructor allowance.  This allowance was taken from them under the Haddington Road agreement and has yet to be reinstated.  Non-commissioned officer, NCO, instructors continue to receive this payment, as is appropriate, but officers bear the ultimate responsibility.  The single biggest factor negatively affecting retention in the Defence Forces, however, and hence the future viability of the organisation, has been the removal of the supplementary pension from those who entered the organisation after 1 January 2013.</p><p>Government policy determines that all personnel are subject to early mandatory retirement ages, anywhere between their 54th or 60th birthday depending on the rank of officer.  Hence the vast majority of post-2013 single pension scheme officers will retire a full ten years before they can receive the State pension.  A recent RACO Am&aacute;rach research survey found that a shocking 79% of officers inducted since 2013 intend to leave the organisation well in advance of their mandatory retirement age.  The lack of an adequate pension provision for this cohort means that a significant majority feel that they have no future in the Defence Forces and will not stay long enough to develop and advance up the ranks and populate the chronic shortages at middle management level.  The unprecedented level of cadet inductions and associated unbearable burden it has placed on training capacity will all have been for nothing.  To his credit, the Minister of State has recognised this and has pledged to address it as a priority once pay issues have been resolved.</p><p> The 2015 White Paper on defence notes that the recruitment, training and development, and retention of suitable military personnel are essential factors in developing the military capabilities required to discharge the roles assigned by Government.  Despite this, no initiative or review has been initiated to address these issues.  The delay in commencing White Paper projects concerning the ongoing recruitment and retention issues is indicative of the current approach to personnel policy in the defence organisation.  The consequence to the organisation is the current manning level crisis and loss of corporate memory and military expertise on an alarming scale.</p><p> The Minister of State and his officials claim that this White Paper and the identified projects towards implementation are cognisant of the priority of demands.  Why then has the project team failed even to commence the most critical and pressing human resource projects which concern retention?  None of the projects completed to date is assessed to have any significant impact on the retention crisis.  The White Paper implementation approach has not yet yielded any tangible impact on the Defence Forces.  RACO views it as nothing more than a box-ticking exercise.</p><p> The cost benefit of retention is indisputable.  The unique demands of Defence Forces service require unique, specialist, in-house military training and the development of military specialist skills.  A direct entry civil engineer would have to undergo two years' military training and professional development in military engineering competencies before being available for operational tasking.  Similarly, the costs associated with developing the range of military competencies can amount to &euro;1.54 million for an ordnance bomb disposal officer at captain rank, or &euro;1.72 million for a captain pilot in the Air Corps.  The cost of training one officer cadet is estimated at more than &euro;100,000 per student.  At what point of dysfunction will management favour retention over the continual failing demands of recruitment?  We cannot go to market to replace a middle manager such as an experienced captain or sergeant.  We replace them with cadets and recruits.  At a turnover rate of 9%, the policy is destined to fail.</p><p> With this in mind, a comprehensive external review, similar in nature and scope to the 1990 Gleeson Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, or the recent Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland should now be considered by Government where management are unable or unwilling to address the underlying organisational issues.</p><p> The Defence Forces is surviving on the goodwill of its personnel, that willingness to go over and above the call of duty to achieve the mission or complete the task.  The inability of personnel to take to the streets in protest at their appalling service conditions has resulted in them voting with their feet and leaving the organisation.  It has been humbling, however, to witness the concerned efforts of veteran and family organisations in attempting to highlight the shameful treatment of service personnel.  Their efforts have not gone unnoticed, and it is hoped they will not be in vain.</p><p> It is no exaggeration to state that the Defence Forces are staring into the abyss.  The reported meagre recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission have the potential, if implemented, to act as a catalyst for further departures.  The Government should be encouraged to ensure that the loyalty displayed by thousands of soldiers, sailors and aircrew is reciprocated, that they are paid a living wage, and that their skills and experience are recognised for the indispensable and irreplaceable asset they truly are.  RACO strongly recommends the adoption of a specific Defence Forces standing independent pay review body to ensure military personnel are fairly treated.  Unnecessary suffering is the worst kind, and the Government has it within its power to remedy easily many of the retention difficulties being experienced by &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann and to begin to rehabilitate this proud and loyal organisation.  It is for the Government to decide whether we are finally going to take the security of our State seriously and allow our Defence Forces to do what they signed up for, namely, to strengthen the nation that they love and provide the security that allows our democracy and economy to flourish.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time and I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Commandant King has painted a very stark picture of the decimation, demoralisation and destruction of the Defence Forces under the tenure of the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe.  The common thread of defence policy in recent years has been his tenure in the Department of Defence and his refusal to budge on some of the key issues, as Commandant King has mentioned.  The points outlined in respect of the dysfunctional cycle of turnover, the premature voluntary retirements, the fact that the turnover rate is up this year on previous years, the total deficiencies around the capacity and strength, and the recommendation for an external organisational review demonstrate the difficulty RACO has as an organisation in addressing properly the issues with the Department of Defence.  It is shameful that a Department would treat a representative organisation with such disrespect and disregard.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Cathal Berry in the Visitors Gallery.  He has provided a very alarming but unsurprising account in recent days.  I thank him for his honesty and integrity in speaking out on behalf of the men and women of our Defence Forces, who are suffering daily.</p> <p>  Commandant King has highlighted the ongoing line and rhetoric from the Government that it will recruit its way out of this crisis, and one of the consistent responses from RACO and the other organisation in the Defence Forces is around retention initiatives.  Will Commandant King provide some detail about what retention issues he would bring in?  It is a fact that Ireland is breaching the working time directive on an ongoing basis when it comes to our Defence Forces.  How has RACO engaged with the Department on that?  The management of the Defence Forces have been brought kicking and screaming to court on the issue by the representative organisations.  Will Commandant King provide some insight into his engagement with them?  How does he envisage the future of representation of the Defence Forces and formalising it in a greater and substantive way?  Will he provide a bit of detail on the relationship of RACO with the Department of Defence?  One of the criticisms from Mr. Cathal Berry and others who have retired is that there is a serious issue in the Department of Defence and that is the net point that is coming up repeatedly.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Commandant King stated that the White Paper implementation approach has not yielded any tangible impact and "RACO views it as nothing more than a box-ticking exercise".  Is it a barrier to progress on some of the key issues?  Commandant King has mentioned the fall in the numbers in the Defence Forces, the difficulties around pay and conditions, and the fact that the turnover rate is rising and the Defence Forces cannot meet their White Paper target.  Will Commandant King provide some detail about the implications of this retention crisis for the viability of the Defence Forces and the security of the State?  For example, is the emergency ambulance service in Athlone under threat?  Will he provide some detail?  There is public alarm about what happened with the gorse fires and the response time to the fires in recent days.</p><p>We have also had the Department of Defence stating there are no problems with the strength of the Defence Forces.  It states the organisation is at 93%.  This level of inaccuracy and spin from a Department is very worrying.  How do the witnesses respond to its ongoing refusal to acknowledge the core crisis we have?  The witnesses have said there is a poor level of governance in the Department.  Will they outline their insight on this?</p></speech>

I have had discussions with constituents who work at Finner Camp.  What is meant by "strength in station", a phrase the witnesses used in their comments?  What is the number of officers stationed at Finner Camp?  Is it very low at present, as I have been led to believe?  Some colleagues of the witnesses have spoken to me about income and salaries.  Will the witnesses outline, or give an indication of, gross or weekly wages for ranks from three star private to colonel?  I would like an indication of the rates of pay.  It is important that people giving the service they do to the Defence Forces, which represent this country throughout the world, are well looked after.  What educational and training opportunities are available to officers in the Army?  It is vital that they have these given the work they do.  They have been wonderful ambassadors throughout the world in peacekeeping and other areas.  What are the criteria for promotional opportunities?  Will the witnesses outline these and give some details?  How do privates become officers?  Is this the route that is taken?  Is it the preferred option of RACO?  I ask the witnesses to outline some of these details.</p></speech>

I will start at the beginning and take the questions of Deputy Chambers first.  He asked what retention initiatives we would bring in.  We have been speaking about various retention initiatives with the Department of Defence and the official side in general for many years.  We feel we are not being heard.  We are fully aware that the Public Service Pay Commission is engaged in ongoing work.  It is a specific pay commission identified to address the appalling rates of pay in the Defence Forces.  The leaks that came out about what was proposed were extremely concerning.  Until we see the final document we cannot know for certain but what I will say is the reported 10% increase in military service allowance for the most junior private equates to less than &euro;1 a day gross and for a captain it equates to &euro;1.29 per day gross.  Such increases will not arrest the slide.  I call on the committee to influence, if possible, the Public Service Pay Commission to have another look at how it will fix the problems in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  Defence Forces members receive a unique set of allowances separate from the rest of the public sector.  These take into account members' unlimited liability, unwillingness to strike or withdraw labour, their posting 24-7, 365 days a year, their exposure to danger and the fact that they are not protected under the working time directive.  It is easy to separate these.  As well as the military service allowance, there is the potential to increase allowances such as the patrol duty allowance for the Naval Service.  As I said, the turnover rate in the Naval Service is 14%.  There is also the security allowance and the return of premium payments for Saturday and Sunday duties, which was taken away during the financial crash.  The crash is over.  There are other various allowances, all of which were included by RACO in our detailed submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.</p> <p>  With regard to what else we could talk about with regard to retention initiatives, it is not just about remuneration.  There are fundamental organisational structural issues within the Defence Forces, such as training establishments.  Before the reorganisation, we had 500 personnel training establishments that gave a small bit of fat when we wanted to do induction training and we did not count this figure in our overall strength.  This is no longer the case.  We could do with a junior officer overseas establishment because when people go overseas their job is not filled at home and someone has to double job.  It is the same for non-commissioned officers.  We could do with having a transparent and accurate posting and human resource management policy for officers and NCOs.  The most fundamental retention issue, and one we have been pursuing since 2011, although the Department has only started to speak to us about this in the past two years, is the working time directive, whose protections have been illegally denied to members of the Defence Forces.  These are the retention issues I will mention for now.</p> <p>  Something else I mentioned in my opening statement was the return of fixed period promotion.  It is a fallacy that we can recruit qualified highly specialised technical officers and non-commissioned officers and expect them to be up to speed immediately.  We spoke about the fact that it costs &euro;1.7 million for a pilot and &euro;1.5 million for an ordinance officer.  These are the people on whom the State depends for its security.  The fact that fixed period promotion was so enthusiastically removed by the Department of Defence beggars belief.  It galls and upsets me to see friends, colleagues and cadet classmates of mine whom I trained with, and who joined the ordnance corps with a view to adding value to the State, found they were unable to maintain a work-life balance and their service to the Defence Forces because of failed Department of Defence policies.</p> <p>  With regard to the future of representation, in the opening statement we mentioned that our representative status had been taken advantage of by the Department of Defence.  Its dismissive and divisive attitude to representation means we have effectively been neutered.  When we go into pay talks we are outside the room.  The decisions are already made and the deals have already been done.  In the UK, the armed forces do not go into public service pay talks.  It has a standing armed forces pay review body that recognises the unique nature of military service.  It recognises the civil liberties that are given up and the facts that members have unlimited liability, exposure to hazard and danger and can be posted anywhere at any time for any duration at short notice, away from their families and loved ones.  What the standing armed forces pay review body does is look at the pay and if there are gaps in the allowances and pay, it tweaks them immediately.  There have been more than 43 reports since the inception of the armed forces pay review body.  It is reactive and it works.  Having such a body would mean Defence Forces representative associations would not have to go into public service pay talks and act like unions because that is not in our ethos or culture.  We just want to be looked after by the State because we provide loyalty to the State.</p> <p>  We were asked why we described the White Paper as a box-ticking exercise.  The White Paper is from 2015 and we are now in 2019.  It includes 88 projects and actions.  Every time we look for a brief on the White Paper from the Department of Defence, we come away frustrated and none the wiser about what is going on.  It would be funny if it were not so serious.  Five items listed by the Department of Defence as being transitioned to normal business and completed as White Paper projects were read out in the D&aacute;il last year.</p><p>They were Civil Defence, an employment support scheme, Red Cross, a major emergency management framework and civilian employees but none of these has any tangible effect on the retention crisis in the Defence Forces.  That is why I say it is a White Paper box-ticking exercise.  We have asked several times for specific briefings on retention projects from the White Paper but we have been met with silence.</p><p> The strength figures were mentioned.  The D&aacute;il was told that the current strength of the Defence Forces stood at 93% and that may be the case on paper, and under the personnel management system.  It does not, however, take into account the fact that more than 500 personnel are on induction training at all times and are non-deployable.  They cannot be legally given a rifle and told to go on an operation or an exercise.  The figure does not account for the fact that there are more than 670 people overseas or that over 100 are on leave of absence at any given time.  It also fails to account for the fact that at least 100 are on long-term detachments and on career courses, etc., which means they are not available to their units.  These figures give a misleading representation of the current state of play in the Defence Forces.  It may be reported that officer strength is 92% or 93% but we have to remember that at least 300 of the officers have only been commissioned in the past three years, because of the unprecedented panic in the recruitment that has taken place in the cadet school, which is stressed to the point of breaking.  The figures paint an inaccurate picture of the strength of the Defence Forces.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the emergency air medical service.  It would be remiss of me to comment on operational issues as they are matters for general staff and military management but the Air Corps is under severe stress at the moment.  The current strength of pilots in the Air Corps stands at 70% and it is falling.  The air traffic control office stands at 66% while NCOs are at 50%.  It was reported recently that aircraft technicians in the helicopter wing of the Irish Air Corps were at 44%, with pilots at 59%.  The man on the street can tell members that the organisation is under pressure and the service it provides must also be under pressure and under strain.</p><p> Governance is a serious concern of ours.  Historically, governance at unit level was enshrined, particularly from the logistics side of the house, by a captain quartermaster, or a battalion or company quartermaster sergeant, with dedicated store staff who worked in the stream from the beginning of their careers.  We have spoken to subject matter experts around the country and we have spoken to logistics experts in the Defence Forces.  They have seen newly commissioned officers, such as second lieutenants who do not have the experience or the qualifications to fill the role of captain quartermaster, doing the job with no senior enlisted leadership, such as a company quartermaster sergeant or a battalion quartermaster sergeant, in the unit to mentor or supervise them.  It is rare to see the same officer or NCO in a logistics appointment for a full year.  We visited a unit in February this year and learned that there was one captain out of eight in the unit in the middle management ranks.  The logistics officer would normally be a captain of 15 years' experience but the job was being done by a second lieutenant.</p><p> Something has to give.  We are seeing little accidents, the nature of which I will not go into, and we expect more unless something changes.  It is due to a shortage of officers in the middle ranks.  The majority of officers who are leaving are, ironically, from middle and upper management and this means captains are promoted to commandant more quickly.  That may be a good thing but it is leaving gaps at the rank of captain.  We are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul and this is resulting in a loss of corporate knowledge of how the Defence Forces conduct their business.  A significant number of young officers are coming under high levels of stress due to the organisational need to put responsibilities they are not equipped to deal with on their young shoulders.  They do not have the mentoring or supervision to guide them or hold them by the hand.  The execution of lethal force is a serious matter and a second lieutenant doing a captain's job is dangerous.  I hope I have painted a clear enough picture for members.  Have I answered all the questions? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019053000002#F00300"><p>Deputy McLoughlin is correct that the officer strength in Finner Camp has consistently been low in the past number of years.  The last time I was there, there was one commandant out of five.  The "strength in station" is the strength available to a unit commander to exercise his operations or the unit's daily duties.  We see five officers out of 25 in some infantry battalions, we see a transport group with six out of 24 and we see an ordnance company, which is responsible for bomb disposal, at 16% of their officers.  The figures are stark.</p> <p>  We work hard on education and training.  We train for what we can predict and we educate for those things we cannot predict.  We provide good education and training opportunities for our personnel, whom we accredit accordingly.  We train people to the best of our ability and enable them to leave with good qualifications but we should be treating them as though we want them to stay, and we are not doing that.  I do not have the rates of pay for the Defence Forces to hand but a recruit starts on &euro;19,000 gross, graduating to &euro;29,000.  After 12 years, a private soldier will be on &euro;37,000.  Officers start at &euro;35,000, once commissioned, and that goes all the way up to &euro;65,000 or &euro;70,000 for the most senior commandant.  Some 87% of the Defence Forces are on below the average public sector wage.  There are opportunities for promotion and, ironically, shortages in middle management mean vacancies crop up on a regular basis.  In the Air Corps, we currently have more vacancies than we have people qualified, such is the level of brain drain in the Air Corps.  We cannot fill lieutenant colonel vacancies because we do not have people qualified to fill them.</p> <p>  There was a question about privates transitioning to commissioned life.  Privates get a 6% increase in an interview process to recognise previous military service and we welcome the fact that a private soldier or non-commissioned officer wants to become an officer.</p></speech>

They paint a bleak picture but they have spoken with a lot of honesty about the situation in the Defence Forces.  We all know the excellent work the Defence Forces do.  Where has it all gone wrong?  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, a former member of the Defence Forces, Ger Aherne, said the relationship between the Department and the Defence Forces was toxic and dysfunctional.  Can the witnesses elaborate on that?</p><p>Who in the hierarchy is fighting for members of the Defence Forces?  Are senior officers doing what they should be doing?  Is the Department fighting strongly enough for the members?  Is the Minister of State doing so at the Cabinet table?  Under previous Governments, there was a senior Minister for Defence but we now have a Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  Much of this is happening on that watch.  Do the witnesses have confidence that the Minster of State, the Department headed by its Secretary General, and the senior officers are fighting strongly enough to get for the ordinary members of the Defence Forces what they deserve, namely, fair play and fair pay?</p><p> D&uacute;n Ui Mhaoil&iacute;osa barracks is in Galway.  I meet many members of the Defence Forces.  Many have told me they are considering leaving to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many members are doing so.  They are trained and would make excellent members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a disgrace that that is happening.</p><p> Commandant King addressed the threat to the emergency aeromedical service, EAS, based in Athlone.  That issue was raised by my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers.  The EAS provides an excellent service.  I live in County Galway and see the helicopter two or three times a day as it flies between Athlone and University Hospital Galway.  I am sure it has saved many lives.  I visited a hospital in Roscommon.  If a patient there has a cardiac arrest or serious accident, the air ambulance is brought in straight away to bring the patient to University Hospital Galway.  It would be very serious if that service were to come under threat.</p><p> Is the Naval Service experiencing the same crisis?  Will boats be tied up in the docks in Galway, Cork or elsewhere because we do not have sufficient officers for them?  New naval vessels were recently purchased.  I ask the delegates to elaborate on that issue.</p><p> Unfortunately, some members of the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement, FIS.  How many receive it?  It is a disgrace that that is happening.  It is the only public sector organisation whose employees receive such a payment.  I never heard of a garda or civil servant getting it, but members of the Defence Forces are.</p><p> On the strength of the Defence Forces, Commandant King stated that RACO strongly recommends the adoption of a specific Defence Forces pay review body to ensure military personnel are fairly treated.  I ask him to elaborate on that.</p><p> Where has the relationship between the Department, the Minister of State with responsibility for defence and the organisation gone wrong?  It seems to have stemmed from issues at the top of the ladder.  Where do the witnesses consider the problem is?  How can it be fixed?</p></speech>

It gives me great pleasure to welcome a fellow Athlonian to the committee.  Many of the questions I wished to ask have been addressed.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  I very much admire the respect shown by the witnesses to the committee, the Department and the Minister of State under difficult circumstances.  The protests or parades by retired Sergeant Major Noel O'Callaghan have always had the themes of respect and loyalty.  Those values come out in every member of the Defence Forces, no matter what they do, and I wish to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  For fear that today's meeting might give a young person thinking of getting involved in or joining the Defence Forces the impression that it is all bleak, I would love for the witnesses to detail the positive side of the service in the Defence Forces, such as the benefits of overseas deployment, career enhancement, full-time education and other courses.  People may not be aware of those benefits. </p> <p>  How does the lack of corporate governance and the shortage of middle management of which the representatives have spoken affect the members and the levels of stress or risk that they are put under?  As Commandant King mentioned, it increases the chance of mistakes.  These are very serious situations and we cannot afford mistakes.</p> <p>  What are the implications of low numbers in the Defence Forces?  When the air ambulance was a pilot scheme I fought very hard for it to be maintained in Custume Barracks in Athlone and I would hate to see anything happen to it.  In light of the level of difficulties in respect of Air Corps pilots, what is the danger of that service ceasing?</p> <p>  On the White Paper on Defence, I was elected to the D&aacute;&iacute;l in a by-election in 2014 and attended the symposium in Farmleigh on the White Paper.  I was full of the joys of life having heard the role of the Defence Forces in the following ten years being talked up.  I felt very positive coming out Farmleigh that day thinking everything was going to be great.  It was never intended to be a box-ticking exercise but, rather, an attempt to do the right thing.  Has there been any tangible delivery from the White Paper?</p> <p>  If there were three things the committee could do or lobby for on behalf of RACO, what would they be?</p></speech>

I touched on that in my opening statement.  There is an obsession with control and micromanagement in the Department.  We are of the firm opinion that military advice is not heeded by it.  This makes it difficult to conduct our business in terms of the conciliation and arbitration process.  There is a significant communication difficulty in terms of receiving written communication and replies.  There is a difference of opinion regarding our members' right to representation under Defence Force Regulation S6.  On many occasions, the Department has sought to use that regulation to deny our legitimacy as a representative association.  If we cannot represent our members under Defence Forces regulations, what is the alternative?</p> <p>  Deputy Grealish asked whether senior officers are doing what they should be doing.  We are all leaders in the Defence Forces and it is incumbent on us to do the best we can with the resources we have.  That is our responsibility.  However, when a unit commander is given less than 50% of the resources required, it is impossible to do the job to the excellent level he or she was trained to do.</p> <p>  As serving members of the Defence Forces, my colleagues and I are apolitical.  It would not be right or proper for me to comment on the level of confidence in an official or elected representative.  However, I can say that there is an unprecedented retention crisis in the Defence Forces.  At the current turnover rate of 9% and the unprecedented and unsustainable levels of induction training, the Defence Forces will not reach the authorised strength of 9,500 personnel in all ranks until 2035.</p> <p>  It is apparent to me that the emergency aeromedical service is rightly recognised as an excellent and vital service for rural Ireland, the midlands and the rest of the country.  One must remember that it is staffed by one EAS crew on a 24-hour basis.  There are two 24-hour crews in the Air Corps, with the other being the Garda air support unit.</p><p>They are all that we can manage.  We would love to have ten emergency aeromedical service crews and ten Garda air support unit crews, but we just do not have the resources.  I think I have spelled out to the committee the retention difficulties in the helicopter wing of the Air Corps facility in Baldonnel and the implications of those difficulties for service delivery.  It is not for me to say whether that operation is under threat.</p><p> It says a lot that the Naval Service has a 14% turnover rate.  According to the UK Ministry of Defence, a turnover rate of 5% represents a crisis.  There are nine ships in the Naval Service at the moment, but the service has enough crew members for just seven of those ships.  Able seamen are at 50% strength in station in the Naval Service.  Able mechanics are at 46% strength in station, communications operatives are at 50% strength in station, and cooks are at 70% strength in station.  The diving section, which is rightly lauded for its bravery in the operations it conducts, is at 33% strength in station.  Lieutenant Naval Service marine engineering officers are vital for the safe operation of Naval Service patrol vessels.  In April 2019, the effective strength for these officers was 36%.  Obviously, these shortfalls have knock-on effects on morale, governance, mentoring and supervision within the Naval Service.  It is no wonder that the Naval Service has such a high turnover when its members are being asked to shoulder this burden every day.</p><p> I will explain how this has affected people on the ground, or on the waves as we would say.  It has an impact on operational capability in the maintenance of ships, boat cranes and armaments, etc.  Everybody relies on the Naval Service operations command's stated policy of two years in, two years out.  Families plan on that basis and lives are built around it in the Naval Service.  Personnel are now finding that they have to apply to come ashore after their two years are up.  As the available number of such reliefs is limited for obvious reasons, not all personnel are facilitated in coming ashore.  What does that say for morale?  What does it say for hope for the future?  What does it say for the maintenance of proper family life?  The implementation of the working time directive would focus minds in the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence as people reflect on how Naval Service operations can be safely operated.  I remind the committee that the Naval Service patrols an area 12 times the size of the country itself.  We are not resourcing this service properly.</p><p> I want to speak briefly about family income supplement, or the working family payment as it is now known.  We are not the competent authority when it comes to social welfare.  I think the Minister has reported that "only" 90 people in the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement.  One is too many.  The loyal servants of this State should not need to have their incomes supplemented by social welfare.  I cannot make that point more clearly.  There should not be any more talk about "only" 90 people needing this assistance.  The number of Defence Forces personnel who could be eligible for family income supplement or working family payment has not been reported.  Obviously, it depends on how many dependants one has.  According to an analysis that has been done of cases in which the member of the Defence Forces is the only earner in the family - the rate of postings away from home that military personnel have to deal with means they are often the only earners in the family - up to 1,700 people in the Defence Forces could be eligible for family income supplement or working family payment.  In many cases, their spouses cannot be earners because they are looking after the children and dependants.  As the Minister has rightly said, working family payment is a matter between the individual and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I cannot comment on the accuracy of the 90 figure that has been cited, but I can say that it should be zero.</p><p> Deputy Grealish asked how we envisage a Defence Forces pay review body would operate.  My colleague, Lieutenant Colonel Priestley, spoke at length on this issue at one of our conferences.  As he is an expert on the matter, I ask him to give the committee his perspective on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.789" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Priestley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019053000002#H00200"><p>I will respond to Deputy Grealish's question about whether we are being treated fairly by referring to my experience over the past five years as a full-time official with RACO.  When one goes into national pay talks and is left sitting in the corridor for three weeks, it is very hard for one to feel one is being treated fairly.  We want an opportunity to put forward the concerns of our members about pay or allowances.  An overwhelming percentage of the members of ICTU are in that environment.  We are meant to be in a parallel process, but the reality is that we are not.  At our first outing, we experienced being the last people to leave the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and turn off the lights without having received a fair hearing.  At our second outing, which was during Lansdowne Road 2, it was decided on the second day to allow the representative associations, including garda&iacute;, into the main room.  Our voice is not heard because we do not enjoy full status and we do not have industrial relations behind us.  As an association, we represent 1,200 people.  PDFORRA probably represents 7,000 people.  I am not quite sure what the figure for the Garda is.  The uniqueness of military service is not recognised in the context of our ability to come forward and speak.  I will clarify our experience of national pay talks.  It may appear on the face of it that we received fair treatment, but the reality was very different.  Although we were allowed into the main room the second time out, we were nobodies.  We accept that, by the way.  Officers are particularly accepting of the role they play in society and the duties they take on voluntarily.</p> <p>  We did some research in advance of one of our conferences in November 2017.  We looked at how other militaries are treated.  We identified a statutory pay review body in the UK that was specific to this sector.  It was one of eight such bodies that existed across the UK public sector.  We were interested to note that it is a full-time committee which sits annually and has access to the highest levels of Government, including the UK Ministry of Defence and its general staff, and of course all the members of the armed services in the UK.  The committee engages with all of these interests annually.  It also has access to relevant data.  The big thing we are talking about today is retention.  The committee knows where the pressure points exist in terms of recruitment and retention, which allows action to be taken when the figures fall below a certain level.  If recruitment and retention fail to such an extent that the UK armed forces loses 2% of their designed strength, there is an immediate move to address the situation.  We are talking about trained personnel, rather than new entrants, cadets or newly inducted people.  The committee recommended to the UK Government that allowances should be adjusted upwards or downwards depending on the specific circumstances.  Members might think this is a great deal for the representative associations on the basis that they get what they want, but all of this is done within the parameters of the UK Government's national pay policy.  At the end of the day, this is controlled by the UK Government, which is aware of the uniqueness of military service and the position of the armed forces.</p> <p>  We have targeted the idea of a pay review body as a way forward.  We are cognisant that we are speaking at a time when a report from the Public Service Pay Commission is pending.  As an association, we put a great effort into our first submission to the first report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  We were heartened that the Defence Forces, RACO and PDFORRA were mentioned throughout the report and that the commission was directed to examine the issue of recruitment and retention in the HSE and related areas as well as in the Defence Forces.  Two and a half years on, we are still waiting for the report of that examination to go to the Government.  We have no idea what would come out of such a report.  We are all aware of the leaks that have come with this process.  If what is being reported is true, we would be very disappointed, especially after all our effort.  We are absolutely in favour of a pay review body.  I am speaking on behalf of the membership when I say I do not think members feel they are being treated fairly.  I think we can prove that with the statistics that have frequently been mentioned by Commandant King.  There is an opportunity to do the right thing here.  We have been calling for this for two and a half years.  We are not critical of the Public Service Pay Commission, which has followed its terms of reference quite closely.  It is time for action on this side of the House.</p></speech>

We firmly believe that we serve the State and do so without fear or favour.  The Senator mentioned the positives and we do not want to be negative.  We love the Defence Forces and that is the reason we are in this job.</p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers mentioned Commandant Berry.  He left because he loved the Defence Forces and could not make a difference in the current climate.  Make no mistake, there are great positives in the Defence Forces.  I will ask the president of the association to talk about those positives in terms of what it means to be not only an officer but a member of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

At the outset, I thank the committee, on behalf of my members, as president of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, who are very appreciative of this opportunity to air some to their concerns, as there is much frustration at present.</p> <p>  On the question of positives, there undoubtedly are many positives associated with a career in the Defence Forces.  It plays out very well, because we are still effectively recruiting.  We are enticing people in because there are many things to focus on in the Defence Forces.  When one is inducted initially, we train one to become a soldier, sailor, airman or airwoman, but there are numerous opportunities thereafter to become an engineer, an air traffic controller, a member the special forces, a doctor or a lawyer.  That is to be and is encouraged and we facilitate such training internally because we are a micro-community.  We have to do everything ourselves.  When we deploy overseas, we have to provide all the services internally.  There is a need for all of that training.  Our training resources, however, are at capacity, which is something that must be realised.  </p> <p>  There are internal opportunities also in terms of overseas service.  It is an exciting job when one sells it to a civilian at the point of induction.</p> <p>  The issue is not the job, which is fantastic and which everybody in the Defence Forces loves.  That is shown through the University of Limerick, UL, research.  People want to stay in the Defence Forces, it is just that they feel that they cannot.  Recruitment is not the issue; it is retention.  We are harping back, unfortunately, on retention because that is the issue.  </p> <p>The members are extremely loyal to the State and will always remain loyal to the State and they want to stay.  We have to provide the environment to them in order that they can stay.</p></speech>

The Senator about three things as a wish list.  A number of things are required.</p> <p>  The first and the most short-term thing is that there is an ongoing Public Service Pay Commission and it has to deliver.  A 10% increase of military service allowance, MSA, will not do the trick and in fact we fear will act as a catalyst for future departures.  I ask members to look at the unique nature of military service and at our refusal to withdraw labour, and recognise the fact that we are loyal to the State and treat us fairly.  There is scope, without breaking any public service stability agreements, to look after the Defence Forces.  That is our first ask.</p> <p>  The second ask, which ties into the Public Service Pay Commission to one extent in that it is included in our submissions, is that there are various retention initiatives that could be reinstated or introduced in the Defence Forces, in terms of fixed-period promotion.  More crucially, for all post-2013 new entrants, I ask that the single pension scheme be looked at, and at the fact that a viable long-term career is not being provided for post-2013 new entrants.  The Am&aacute;rach research survey told us specifically that cadets are cognisant now of the fact this is no longer a long-term career in the Defence Forces.  We cannot go to market to recruit a captain or a sergeant.  They are deciding that they are going to join, get everything they can out of the Defence Forces in the short term, and come their mid to late 30s, it will be decision time.  If they know that they are going to be forcibly retired at the age of 54 for a captain, or 58 for a commandant, and have to wait ten years for the contributory State pension - the old-age pension as it was - why would they stay?  We have to incentivise people to stay in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The last two things are larger strategic issues.  We spoke about the Defence Forces pay review body.  Our place is not at pay talks.  We have learned that.  An independent standing Defence Forces pay review body, which constantly sits and examines the resources available to the Defence Forces as to accommodation, pay, allowances, remuneration, mobility and commuting distances etc., which compensates members for that and which looks after the State, is needed.  In the United Kingdom, the Armed Forces Covenant and the Ministry of Defence recognise the unique nature of UK military service and pledge to look after them and to treat their families and the service men and women fairly.  Could we see that from our own Department at the moment?</p> <p>  Finally, we have spoken of a root and branch review of Defence Forces remuneration and conditions of service.  The last review undertaken was in 1990.  If I can draw an analogy to 1990, when I was ten years of age, I am told that at the time, wives and partners were on the streets because the Defence Forces could not stick up for themselves.  Does that sound familiar?  </p> <p>  Let us please have another look at how we constitute our Defence Forces and at the relationship between military management, the Department of Defence, the representative associations, and the loyal men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  </p> <p>  These are the asks.  They may sound like a great number but they are within the gift of the Government to provide, if it is serious about treating the Defence Forces fairly.</p></speech>

One would not usually expect what he said from a former member.  I have met quite a number of members in recent years at RACO conferences I have attended or in my work as a defence spokesperson for my Party.  Each and every one has expressed a frustration that came out in the words that were issued by Cathal Berry during the week, when he talked about the Department's treating of members with contempt and of the Defence Forces being dismantled and demoralised.  This also came across in the comments of the witnesses today.  It is a frustration I can understand.  Commandant King stated:</p><blockquote>The Department&rsquo;s approach to representation has been divisive, dismissive and, sometimes, subversive.  This has led to an adversarial and dysfunctional industrial relations climate.</blockquote> <p>That is a very serious charge, which Commandant King has backed up in chapter and verse which is the key part, even in his last comment where he referred to the last review of pay conditions in the Defence Forces taking place in 1990.</p><p>One question he put to us earlier was to ask who was batting for the Defence Forces.  I know from attending this meeting that each and every one of us has the interests of the Defence Forces at heart, are trying to help and are batting for the Defence Forces.  I hope that we will be able to assist and that this appearance by the witnesses before the committee today will get the coverage it deserves and will add to the sense of crisis.  I have been talking to people concerned and some of the figures outlined by Commandant King are very stark.  He said that 87% of the Defence Forces earn well below the public sector wage.  In our briefing from the Department of Defence, we were given a different take on that.  Commandant King's comment on this take was something similar to his reference to this dismissive attitude, whereby somebody has to be the low-paid.  The Department of Defence in a briefing stated, with reference to the starting pay details, the pay compared with other jobs with similar entry-level criteria in the public service.</p><p>That fails to understand Commandant King's final point regarding the uniqueness of the Defence Forces.  It is quite clear and stark.  Personnel cannot do overtime, they are on 24-hour call and he listed the duties.  It is not a normal job and is not similar to any other job in the public service, albeit perhaps, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but garda&iacute; can do overtime.  That is key.  </p><p> In this day and age, the retirement age in a world where people are living longer and in the main, people are fitter, has increased.  I wish I was as fit as half of the officers who are retiring from the Defence Forces, aged 47 or 52 in this day and age.  Somebody needs to get real.</p><p> When there is a crisis, action is needed.  Commandant King mentioned the White Paper.  My big criticism of the White Paper was that there were no timelines.  Whatever about having 88 particular actions, unless one has timelines, it is difficult to manage so that feeds into the system.</p><p> It was mentioned how low the number of officers has fallen to in some sections of the Defence Forces.  The Department of Defence told us that there are 45 fewer officers in the Air Corps.  The establishment figure is 166 but there are only 141 in the Air Corps.  That is very stark.  We know the consequences of that.  I know from dealing with a number of personnel that the stress levels are increasing due to the double and treble jobbing of officers.  The briefing material also highlights that sick leave in the Defence Force is increasing.  If somebody is working two and three jobs, something has to give.  I am concerned that the officer level of the ordnance section is at 16% ----- </p></speech>

This section needs 100%, given how dangerous the role is.</p> <p>  Commandant King mentioned the Naval Service, which has similar low numbers.  If ships that were tied up because they did not have officers leave shore and drop anchor because some personnel have been sent to them to make up the numbers so that they can leave port, that suggests a crisis.  I do not believe it is taken seriously by the Department.  What can we do or the public do to impress on the Department and the Minister, who is the Taoiseach, albeit the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Kehoe, should know that this is at breaking point?  If it continues at the current rate, the Defence Forces will end up not being able to deliver on much of its work and duties as an aid to the civil power and in crisis management when there is a humanitarian disaster, floods, or fires as we have witnessed recently in County Donegal and elsewhere.  The Defence Forces do not have the personnel to help out, even though they want to.  Where is the point of no return?  There is a significant volume of information.  I compliment the witnesses on how well they have presented the issues and how stark they are.</p> <p>  I differ with them regarding the approach to trade union rights, but anything is better than the current situation where the representative associations cannot sit down and be heard and the information acted upon.  I would be more inclined that personnel should have full trade union rights, as has happened in other countries.</p> <p>  I asked a question at the conference that addressed the working time directive and where it was demonstrated how it worked in other countries.  Given the present crisis, could the directive be implemented in the Defence Forces or would we have to wait for full establishment numbers, given the shortfalls that have been highlighted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.798" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019053000002#K00400"><p>I address Commandant Keogh, Commandant King and Lieutenant Colonel Priestley by their rank because together they represent more than 60 years experience as leaders in the Defence Forces.  They come before us with no mean credentials.  It is an unique step they have taken to come here and I am delighted they are present.</p> <p>  I made a complaint some time ago when the Department of Defence sought the appointment of an additional assistant secretary general.  That appointment was specifically a "people's appointment".  I want to know who sets HR policy?  Is it the Department, the Minister, the Secretary General of the Department or the Defence Forces themselves?  Is it correct that no operational unit has been visited by the newly appointed assistant secretary general for people?  Is it correct that the UK Ministry of Defence report annually on the serviceable numbers they have, excluding those in training, and that they report to Parliament on that?  Is it true that the ordinance corps is still recovering from the removal of fixed promotion?  I would like to know whether RACO submitted a complaint to the oversight committee on public service pay, and if it has, whether it has had a response.  Why does the organisation think nurses, teachers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can make a submission to the oversight committee and seem to get an immediate response and a significant public response?</p> <p>  Commandant King adverted to the helicopter side of the Air Corps.  I recently learned only two helicopters are available - one is the AES in Athlone and the second is on standby  -and that because of the lack of technical support a number of our aircraft are grounded.  I do not ask him to confirm or deny this other than to give factual information with respect to the availability of fixed wing or helicopter appliances.  He will understand that Air Corps pilots are required to maintain their flying hours.  Are their flying hours being impeded as a result of the lack of aircraft?  I do not want him to go into the operational side.  Are pilots sitting on the ground with no aircraft to fly because of the lack of technical personnel?</p> <p>  An issue of deep concern to me, to which Commandant King adverted, is the fact that there is only one captain out of eight in Finner Camp.  Not long ago, one captain and a number of lieutenants ran a battalion, a second lieutenant was in charge of three platoons, and a second lieutenant acted as adjutant.  He referred to the experience required in those roles.  I am deeply concerned that a second lieutenant will find himself in serious trouble as a result of an accident through no fault of his or her own purely because of lack of experience.  I would like Commandant King to address the legal aspect of junior leaders undertaking roles that were designed for senior leaders.  The Defence Forces has a strong record of standing up to the plate when called on to do so, but are we asking people to take on roles that are way above their pay grade?  In taking on those roles, I am mindful of the annual appraisal of soldiers.  A second lieutenant is parachuted into a unit for a couple of weeks and he or she is asked to complete appraisals of soldiers he or she has never known.  Those appraisals may impact on the career of those soldiers over time.  It is only a matter of time before the Defence Forces finds themselves before a High Court judge explaining why some person was denied promotion or denied service overseas because of an appraisal by somebody who did not know him or her.</p><p> When the Department of Defence provides information on salaries and related matters, the words "excluding overseas service" are always included.  Is such service now to be factored into the income of soldiers, sailors and air crew?  In other words, will we be depending on United Nations service or service elsewhere to bolster salaries for our service personnel in order that they can survive?</p><p> Finally, as our guests may be aware, I am a veteran of two armies.  One of those armies will look after me until the day I die.  I have a badge to put on my collar and I can go to the UK and walk into any museum or public service area and be treated with the utmost respect.  For the rest of my life, I can turn to the armed forces charity, SSAFA, if I mind myself in trouble from a welfare perspective.  Here in this country, we do not provide the same level of respect and gratitude for service.  I am not asking our guests to comment to any great degree on that point, but I would be interested in their views.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the approach to representation.  I covered that in some detail earlier and the Deputy elaborated on and echoed my comments.  An issue that is worth highlighting is the attitude we meet and the dealings we sometimes have with our counterparts in the Department of Defence.  The Deputy spoke about retirement ages in a context where people are living longer.  That is essentially our problem with the single pension scheme, that we are forced to retire early without being provided for in retirement.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commenced a process in August 2016 to examine retirement ages, which involved asking all uniformed services as well as all other public sector bodies, including the Department of Defence, for their input.  It is worth noting that it was not military management but the Department that was surveyed.  The reason for this, as the then Minister outlined in 2017, was that the State pension age was going up from 65 to 66, and woe betide anybody who had to retire at 65 and wait a full year for their old age pension.  When it came to the question of retirement ages for military personnel, the Department of Defence declined to be included in the review, undertaking instead to conduct its own review.  That was in early 2017 and it is on the record.  Two years later, despite many requests for such a review of mandatory retirement ages, it has not commenced.  That says a great deal about the concern which has been expressed for military personnel by the Department.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how we can show that things are at breaking point.  Two years ago at our conference, Commandant Keogh, who was then RACO president, stated, to the great dismay of military management and, in particular, the Department of Defence, that we were in a state of crisis.  When we gave our first submission to the Public Service Pay Commission in early 2018, the turnover rate was approximately 7.5%.  When we finally got to submit an oral representation to the commission in March of this year, it had increased to 8.1%.  The turnover rate is now at 9% and I do not know what it will be six months from now.  It is not an exaggeration to say that there are soldiers, sailors and air crew in &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who are living on the bread line.  Having watched what the Public Service Pay Commission is doing, they have decided in their heads that they are going but are still looking for a reason to stay.  That is the loyalty they display towards &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  They do not want to leave but they might have to do so.  We have reached breaking point and are beyond it.  We must step back from the brink at this stage.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the health and safety provisions of the working time directive.  I spoke briefly about that, and it  is an extremely important point.  Lieutenant Colonel Priestley might elaborate on the health and safety aspect, the directive's potential as a retention tool and the difficulties the Deputy outlined.  The underlying problem is that the manning level shortages are so great that there is uncertainty as to how the working time provisions could even be introduced in the Defence Forces.  That should not be the main consideration but, in reality, it is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.801" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Priestley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019053000002#L00300"><p>The important point about the working time directive is its health and safety focus.  The Defence Forces are currently exempted from the provisions under section 3 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  It is a blanket exemption.  Various legal cases both at home and in Europe have resulted in a widespread recognition that something must be done in regard to the Organisation of Working Time Act, after which the provisions set out in the directive will then have to be reincorporated into Irish law.  As to what is required, it is about providing rest periods for personnel who currently have a 24-7 liability, as we outlined.  It is about being able to say in a working week how many hours personnel will work.  We need to be able to define the working day, the working week and the working month for Defence Forces members.  The provision in the Act that workers must have 11 hours off in a day does not necessarily sit well with military operations, so we are into the realm of exemptions and derogations and the question of what that means for Defence Forces personnel.  Since 2014 or thereabouts, we have been calling for some type of examination of the issue, but any progress  has been slow in coming.  There is a huge body of work involved.  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na representatives took five years to come up with an agreement for their members.  It is only recently that we have had serious discussions with the Department of Defence and military management as to how we might implement the directive within the Defence Forces.  It is an issue that is crying out to be tackled if we are to address all the difficulties we are facing in regard to health and safety, retention and so on.</p> <p>  We cannot delay any longer.  In response to the surveys that were conducted, 16% of Defence Forces members said they were stressed.  That cannot be a healthy situation.  We have ordnance officers who are doing seven 24-hour duties in a row.  They commence on a Friday at 11.30 a.m. and finish the following Friday at 11.30 p.m.  It is only quite a recent thing that they are not expected to come back to work on the Monday.  After meeting great resistance, we managed to push it back to Wednesday.  What kind of work-life balance can anybody have in those circumstances?  These are highly skilled and trained personnel who took a long time to develop their skills and are recognised internationally as world leaders in their trade.  Yet we wonder why they are running out the door.  I could give a long list of the jobs for which experienced ordnance officers have left the Defence Forces, but what is the point?  The only point that matters is they left, although the removal of fixed-period promotions, to which the Senator referred, certainly was a catalyst for many of them.  I spoke not long ago to a man who had left for a large organisation where he was still required to do 24-hour shifts but could not believe the amount of time he got off after doing those stints.  He was at a loss as to what to do with the time off he had.  One cannot blame people for leaving in that situation.</p> <p>  The review of the working time legislation is a significant body of work which has been delayed for far too long.  We have been trying to progress it and it is time now for it to be done.  Members who wish to be helpful should be mindful of the need for that legislative work.</p></speech>

I do not want to personalise our discussion by referring to any particular individual.  If the Senator says that the person in question has not visited the barracks, I will take his word for it.  I can say that we certainly have not had much contact with the assistant secretary general.  I had one meeting with him in the six months since I took over as general secretary.  I am not sure how many meetings Lieutenant Colonel Priestley had while in the role.</p></speech>

However, the key point, as the Senator identified, is that it reports on trained strength and does not include 500 recruits or cadets in the figures.</p><p>The Irish public are starting to realise that when the Defence Forces are described as having an establishment of 9,500 and a strength of 8,750, I am surmising that 500 or 600 cadets or recruits must be taken away from that.  There are also personnel overseas, on leave of absence, on secondment and on sick leave etc.  Therefore, we need to understand what strength at station is and we have painted a clear enough picture.</p><p> I am not personally aware of the specific number of helicopters available to the Air Corps.  If there are only two available to the Air Corps then that is a dire situation.  I am not qualified to comment on that as I do not have the figures to hand but what I can say is that Air Corps cadetships are now taking almost five years due to a lack of aircraft.</p><p> The Senator spoke about governance and I have covered governance and mentoring but I would like to paint another picture of governance and I ask Mr. Keogh to do that as president of RACO and to talk about supervision, mentoring, the work-life balance etc. that are affecting the line units in the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

Cathal Berry was mentioned earlier on and he had to leave because he could not do anything internally and that is a strange dichotomy.  What is happening on the ground is that there are many gaps at officer level for the reasons to which Mr. King has alluded.  The establishment for overseas personnel and the number of people in training are not catered for within the unit strengths so there are day to day gaps in every unit in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  The net effect of that is that those who remain there are carrying the extra burden.  They are well trained, they that take that task on well and the young officers out there are doing a fantastic job but they can only do so much.  One job can be done well and two jobs can be done but when one gets a third job and a fourth job, it is hard to keep up.  That leaves huge issues with governance and it leaves significant issues with risk.  The difficulty is that the risk lies on the shoulders of those young officers and the NCOs.  That frustration has come home to roost with the numbers leaving the Defence Forces.  I hope that can paint some picture of governance and risk at the unit level, which is what it is really about because they are at the true coalface of our organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor King" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019053000002#M00300"><p>To double up on the governance and risk issue and to also mention the importance of hanging on to suitably qualified and experienced personnel, the Air Corps sought to bring in an expert to talk to it about the difficulties it was undergoing in January 2017.  It brought in a gentleman who was a Queen's Counsel, Sir Charles Haddon-Cave.  He was the author of the report entitled &quot;The Loss of RAF Nimrod XV230&quot;, which was subtitled &quot;A Failure of Leadership, Culture and Priorities&quot;.  He appealed to Air Corps management and Defence Forces management to treasure and hold on to suitably qualified and experienced personnel, SQEPs, which is a recognised term in business, in order to retain critical capabilities, including specialised management functions associated with military aviation.<br/><br/>According to our Air Corps colleagues, unfortunately, experience takes years to build but can be lost instantly and when experienced personnel are leaving faster than they can be replaced, the burden of safe operations falls on fewer shoulders and this risks overtasking, burnout and overstretch.  Society expects military personnel to just get on with the job, to meet any demands and to achieve the mission and we really try to do that.  We have an ethos of meeting the demands and of not saying &quot;No&quot;, but without sufficient qualified and experienced personnel this leads to a potentially dangerous ethos of can-do, make-do, muddle through as referred to by Sir Charles Haddon-Cave.  I will leave it at that with the governance issues but members can see that we have been talking about this for a while.  The Air Corps brought this gentleman in in 2017.<br/><br/>A University of Limerick focus group report in 2017 stated &quot;Serious concerns from an organisational level are presented here&quot; and the Defence Forces are &quot;reaching a point of being hollowed out in terms of experienced human capital, that notwithstanding the increased recruitment of cadets it would take 10 plus years to replace the expertise that has been lost&quot;.  That was in 2017 and we are far worse now.  The report went on to state:</p><blockquote>Officers have expressed that management's focus on recruitment rather than retention is their primary source of stress.  This has led to having higher numbers of inexperienced members while those with sufficient experience and capability are leaving.  The workload is increasing and there are fewer members to do the work, so this has led to an inability to meet demand to the standard required.  Members are feeling overworked and Officers fear for the safety of their members and the capability of performing to the best possible standard.</blockquote> <p>That was in 2017.  Since the publication of this report, no new policy initiatives have been introduced by management to address the underlying issues identified by the University of Limerick researchers.<br/><br/>To go back to the Gleeson commission, I want to draw an analogy to the position in 1990.  The commission report stated at paragraph 3.7.10 that &quot;one factor which must be taken into account is a need to arrive at rates of pay which are sufficient to enable the Defence Forces to recruit and retain personnel of the proper quality&quot;.  It sounds like common sense and the report went on to state:</p><blockquote>To ignore identifiable problems of recruitment would be to run the risk that the Defence Forces would be unable to secure the services of sufficient numbers of suitable personnel.  To ignore clear evidence of retention difficulties would lead to out-flows of skilled personnel.  In either event, the capacity of the Defence Forces to carry out the tasks assigned to them could be undermined and the problems created would take many years to remedy.</blockquote> <p>This finding is particularly relevant as the retention of commissioned officers continues to be a major challenge for the Defence Forces.  That was in 1990, almost 30 years ago and here we are again.  The Senator asked about HR policy.  I will ask Mr. Priestley to tackle that one.</p></speech>

The only thing I can say about it is that in 2014 when I first came into this job I sought out a HR policy to read into and brief myself on, to sadly be told that none existed.</p> <p>  The Senator then linked to the White Paper.  It identified 27 projects that we feel have an industrial relations or human resources aspect to them.  When we go and seek information about that to see how it is progressing and how it is getting on, the information available to us to comment on, to get involved in or to influence is very limited.  The phrase "transitioned to normal business" was used earlier.  What does that mean?  What is the product?  What do we look to for guidance?  Where is the retention policy?  We simply do not know and we cannot comment any further.  That is the quick-fire answer to that.</p></speech>

We all know and recognise that.  Dublin Airport does not operate without its air traffic controllers who are highly skilled, highly qualified and expensively qualified personnel.  Air traffic control is at 66% for officers and 50% for non-commissioned officers.  They carry out the same function and they are all air traffic controllers.  In December 2016, the 24-hour air traffic control service in Baldonnel was reduced to an 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. service.  Since January 2018 it is back up to 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. but it is no longer a 24 hour service.  At night, a fireman sits in the tower.  There are no air traffic controllers at night.  The Garda air support unit depends on Dublin Airport to fly in and out and air traffic controllers are only on call at the weekends.  There is no dedicated air traffic control service at the weekends because of a lack of resources, not because of a lack of will.</p> <p>  Personnel do depend on UN service to supplement their incomes.  That is a fact.  Are there any other questions that I have missed?</p></speech>

The reality is we are the leaders of the organisation and have a responsibility to look after our troops.  That is from where the frustration stems.  People want to do their job properly.  They want to be able to sit down and produce an annual report knowing the individual very well.  Unfortunately, in some units that is not the case because the turnover rate is such that young officers go overseas to a different unit or a training institution before they have had an opportunity to build up an appropriate relationship with their subordinates.  I do not want to go too far into the operational sphere, but the reality is this impinges on the well-being of young officers.  We are putting all of this responsibility on their shoulders without giving them appropriate backup support.</p> <p>  The working time directive is law.  That we have an exemption under the 1997 Act does not give us a pass.  That has been established in the European courts.  We are in flagrant breach of the directive.  It is a requirement to implement it, not because soldiers need more time off but from a health and safety perspective.  We must give them an appropriate amount of time off, which they deserve because they are working hours that in many cases are not nine-to-five.  There are many 24-hour duties.  People could be on exercises for up to one week or even overseas for six months to one year.  It is not a standard employ.  We must come up with suitable solutions to maintain the health and safety benefits for all of our soldiers, sailors and air crew.</p></speech>

I am Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and not a member of this committee.  I commiserate with the Chairman on not being elected to the European Parliament on this occasion, but, frankly, its loss is Ireland's gain.  I commend him for being here after such a gruelling election campaign.</p> <p>  I welcome the delegation from RACO which includes its general secretary, Commandant Conor King, who has replaced Lieutenant Colonel Earn&aacute;n Naughton; its deputy general secretary, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Priestley; and its president, Commandant Shane Keogh.  I also welcome Cathal Berry who is in the Visitors Gallery and has made a great contribution by highlighting various issues.  This is a wonderful opportunity for them to highlight what is happening in the Defence Forces, given that the proceedings are being televised nationally and internationally.  I hope the Minister of State is watching very carefully.  I also know that officials in the Department are watching very carefully and analysing what the delegates are saying.  I ask them to please listen to the delegates' contributions and take action.  </p> <p>  I am here because the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, of which RACO, PDFORRA and the Garda representative associations are members, is a nominating body for Members on the Labour Panel in the Seanad.  I have been a Member of the Seanad for 17 years as a nominee of the organisation.  In those years I have never come across such discontent and concern among members of RACO and PDFORRA as I have seen in the past few years.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett who was an excellent Minister for Defence is here.  However, there is now no Minister for Defence in the Cabinet.  The Taoiseach has other national duties to perform and cannot give the time required to the Defence Forces.  The Minister of State does not have a vote at the Cabinet table.  Although he sits at the Cabinet table, he cannot get involved.  I had hoped Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett would make this point.  I hope Deputy Jack Chambers will take on the job of Minister for Defence in not too distant future and that the incoming Government will have a full-time Minister for Defence.  It is very important that there be a Minister for Defence.  </p> <p>  I commend the delegation on its contribution.  I will not go back over what has been said about the number of personnel.  The delegates made the case very well.  Is restoration of the 4th Western Brigade at Custume Barracks in Athlone a realistic proposition having regard to the fact that the Defence Forces are not at full strength?  In that context, on 4 April 2017 a motion was moved in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Lisa Chambers, the then Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on defence.  What are the chances of it happening?  I commend other spokespersons who have spoken about the issue.  </p> <p>  A total of &euro;3 billion is being dedicated to broadband provision.  There is no doubt that broadband is needed but it will not help to fly planes or protect our coastline or fisheries.  However, the Government has no difficulty in awarding a dodgy contract worth &euro;3 billion and neglecting the people who defend us.  If I had the choice of having broadband in my house or having the Army look after our interests, I know what I would vote for.</p></speech>

They could not but benefit from such a move, but that is a matter for the Government.  </p> <p>  Is restoration of the 4th Western Brigade a realistic proposition?  Yes, if it was to be done properly, but we need to be at full strength before it happens.  We require strength in the Defence Forces to carry out our assigned tasks.  That is part of the reason a root and branch review of what the Government wants us to do in the Defence Forces for the State should be conducted.  When it decides what it wants us to do, it should resource us properly and we will do it for it.  </p> <p>  To reply to the question as to whether restoration of the 4th Western Brigade is a realistic proposition, it is extremely difficult to recruit, attract and retain people west of the River Shannon because of the uncertainty; the long commuting distances involved; the frequency of posting - it is eight in five years for senior officers; and the distances from home.  The effects on work-life balance for officers in the former 4th Western Brigade who have not yet left are certainly stark.  There was a large outflow of personnel in 2012.  Well over 50% of the outflow were personnel from the former 4th Western Brigade because they did not see a future in commuting to the far reaches of the country.  We must do it properly.  I am not sure whether the reorganisation in 2012 was done properly.  I am not really qualified to comment any further.  Have I answered the Senator's question?</p></speech>

Some months ago the Chief of Staff appeared before us and was as forthcoming as it was possible for him to be.  Obviously, he did not enter into the political realm, something we fully understand, but he was very forthcoming.  As Commandant King is aware, the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whereas the Chief of Staff is not the Accounting Officer for the Defence Forces.  Has that matter ever been discussed?  Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask that question, but have the benefits that could accrue from the Chief of Staff being the Accounting Officer for the Defence Forces been discussed among Defence Forces personnel?  Commandant King is aware that Accounting Officers appear before committees.</p></speech>

When we requested him to attend, he readily agreed to accept our invitation.  I express our appreciation to him for his engagement with the committee.  All of my colleagues attended the meeting and engaged constructively with him.  He indicated to us that he would like to engage further in the future.  Have the benefits that could accrue from the Chief of Staff being the Accounting Officer for the Defence Forces been discussed within the Defence Forces?  I do not have a problem if Commandant King is uncomfortable dealing with that question.</p></speech>

There is no doubt the military authorities are uniquely placed to provide military advice to the Government.   If a military specific operational budget was to be allocated to the Chief of Staff, I would see that person as being the competent authority to decide how that money would be spent.  It would have to be done properly.  It would have to be resourced and a proper staff complement would be required to supplement the Accounting Officer.  I am not sure if comparable military organisations have their chief of defence as the Accounting Officer.  The Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the Accounting Officer and I am sure that gives him more freedom in how to allocate his resources, but again, that is a matter for the Government.  It was heartening to see the Chief of Staff before this Oireachtas committee.  I am not sure if the Chairman asked him if he wanted to be the Accounting Officer, and if so, I do not know what his response was.</p></speech>

We must acknowledge that at the PDFORRA conference he did something that I believe no previous Chief of Staff has done.  He stepped outside and placed his cards firmly on the table, and short of doing what Commandant Berry has done in placing his hat on the Taoiseach's table and saying, "I am out of here if you do not do something", I do not  know what more he can do.  Surely members of RACO would be better in the ICTU than out on their own sitting in the corridor?  I sat at pay talks and watched the association's members in the corridor.</p></speech>

It is not that long ago since we did a national tour of all the barracks and met our members during which this issue was raised as it is quite topical.  Very few of our members would welcome the opportunity to join ICTU.  There are good reasons for that.  I do not particularly want to go into many of them, but at the end of the day we recognise our role in society and the job we do, and we believe it would present many difficulties for us if we were to join ICTU.  Hence the reason we prefer the alternative of the notion of a pay review body unique to the Defence Forces.  We cannot say, on the one hand, we have a 24-7 liability and all the restrictions in the military service that we and the Senator well know and then believe we should be treated like every other normal employee.  We do not see ourselves as normal employees.  All we can do is reflect the honestly held view of our membership who do not see themselves joining ICTU any day soon.</p></speech>

We are not aware of the military management's views on that but we would not expect them to be too complimentary.  From RACO's perspective, we are not seeking to join the Irish Congress of Trade Unions because we believe it is not compatible with military service, but at the same time, if the State does not look after us and the welfare of its military personnel, there are not that many alternatives, so I can understand why other representative associations might be looking for other avenues.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the fond recollections he has of serving with two armed forces.  I compliment him on his service with both.  He has been a tireless and wonderful advocate for the Defence Forces.  It is very much appreciated by soldiers, sailors and air crew of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.  I am delighted that the UK armed forces are still looking after him.  He will always be welcome in any barracks in this State.  That is for sure.</p></speech>

I will take final brief supplementary questions from Deputy Jack Chambers and other colleagues.</p></speech>

It would be good to have regular formal engagement at this committee as an accountability structure for the Department on many of the issues Commandant King outlined to enable a proper public airing of them.  When we raise these issues on the floor of the D&aacute;il, sometimes the Minister of State just reads a departmental memo.  To provide some truth and context, perhaps it is important we have the witnesses here more regularly rather than hearing the nonsense from him.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of morale, how do the association's members feel when other front-line public servants such as the garda&iacute; got a &euro;55 million bounce and nurses got a &euro;35 million pay supplement while the members of RACO and PDFORRA are not even allowed attend oversight committees?  How do the members of RACO feel about being treated as the worst-paid public servants and about being put outside the room and denigrated in that way when others are getting their pay issues addressed?  Will Commandant King comment on the morale of the association's members in that respect and the choreography of it where some people can get some of their issues addressed because they can threaten with their right to strike and the fact that Defence Forces personnel cannot do that and this aspect has been used and abused on the pay issue?</p> <p>  With respect to the Air Corps, does Commandant King consider a single agency should be established?  Some of the previous functions provided by the Air Corps have been removed, undermined and split up.</p> <p>  What is Commandant King's view of the fact that all the military advice and the recommendations included in the pay commission were stripped out and removed by the Department of Defence?  How do the association's members feel about the fact that all the recommendations around pay were butchered by the Civil Service?  Also, the parent joint submission was further butchered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was confirmed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe.  That is the reason the alarming leaks are not so surprising when no case has been presented by the civil servants.</p></speech>

I have a final question.  The briefing from the Department indicates that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at the end of March was 8,847 whole-time equivalents.</p><p>The witnesses have remarked to us that in reality the strength is nearly 1,000 lower than that, taking into consideration duties and the training of others.  I ask them to go back over the figures to which they alluded in their earlier contribution.</p></speech>

Deputy Chambers asked how we feel about being excluded and about advantage being taken of our representative status.  It was described by someone earlier this week as &quot;gut wrenching&quot;.  There is a sense of betrayal which is visceral and I fully agree with that sentiment.  The fact is that we have sought to engage with the Lansdowne Road agreement oversight committee and have been blocked or ignored at every juncture.  Our claim has been in since October or November 2018.  It took 12 weeks to get an initial response to it.  There was a further communication from RACO, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and another few weeks passed with no answer.  Finally, we got a response from the Department but we were not satisfied with that.  We asked to go before the oversight committee only to be told, two months later, that the committee was not sitting for those few months.  This was despite the fact that we knew the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation was in with the committee on a daily basis agitating on behalf of its members.  Without being flippant, how does the Deputy think that feels?<br/><br/>On the question of how we feel about other unions and public service bodies agitating successfully for better pay for their members, it is very difficult to take.  We rely on the goodwill of the State and the Government to look after us and in return we provide unremitting loyalty to the State.  Some might call it blind loyalty but we just want it rewarded.  Reference was made to the advice from the Department and military management in relation to the Public Service Pay Commission.  I am painfully aware that the commission has yet to respond.  It would be difficult for me to cast aspersions on the independence of that body.  However, I can say that in future we would like an independent standing Defence Forces pay review body to look after the unique nature of military service and ensure that our loyalty is rewarded so that we do not have to rely on <i>ad hoc</i>public service pay commissions or public sector pay talks, where we have no say or no stake in the game.  <br/><br/>Was there another question? </p></speech>

When we talk to our Air Corps colleagues across the spectrum, they tell us that they want to do those roles.  They feel that they are capable of doing them.  They were very disappointed and upset when certain roles, particularly the search and rescue role, were taken away.  We are all familiar with the fact that &euro;500 million was the figure for the contract for the search and rescue service.  There is a sense in the Air Corps that it could have done a lot with that money rather than it being given to a private company.  However, as I said, that is a matter for the Government.  The professional officers who fly, the aero technicians, firefighters and air traffic controllers all felt that they were uniquely placed to provide that service.  The decision has had a lasting impact.  They would dearly love to do as much work as possible.  We saw with the recent forest fires that people travelled long distances on their weekend off to respond.  Members of the Air Corps, from the GOC down to the most junior apprentice, are dying to do those jobs so of course it has had an impact.  Air Corps members would love to be able to do all of those jobs.</p></speech>

He spoke about whole-time equivalents and what is reported to the D&aacute;il.  I will break it down into strength in station versus strength on paper.  Unprecedented numbers are currently engaged in induction training and they are being counted by official sources when they talk about Defence Forces operational strength.  Recruits and cadets are counted in that 8,800 odd figure to which the Deputy referred.  We must take 500 or 600 off that total.  We must take another 100 plus personnel off who are currently on leave of absence or special leave without pay or allowances.  Operationally, at a domestic level, we can take another 700 personnel who are overseas off the total.  If there are 700 personnel overseas, there are another 700 getting ready to go overseas as well who are not available to their units but we will not count that 700.  This is why the establishment figure is 9,500, the reported strength is 8,800 but the actual strength in station and available is closer to 7,500.</p></speech>

Not only that, the figures are artificially inflated by the number of junior, inexperienced personnel who have been taken in at the lower levels, including cadets and recruits.  I have very close experience of this, as a former operational commander of a mechanised company in the Defence Forces training centre.  We had an establishment for 140 private soldiers but had a strength of more than 190.  Where we fell down was that we had an establishment for 34 corporals but a strength of only seven.  We have all of these private soldiers who need mentoring, training and supervision but we have no qualified, non-commissioned officers or officers to train them.  That is why the figures are artificially inflated.</p></speech>

I cannot put my finger on anything, other than the fact that there was an ongoing discussion on that and the filling of vacancies was held up.  I do not know the answer.</p></speech>

They have painted a very bleak picture of the situation at all ranks in our Permanent Defence Forces.  They referred to very low morale and raised questions regarding the well-being of officers, soldiers, sailors and aircrews.  They also spoke about the loss of corporate knowledge, expertise and experience which is an enormous blow to our Permanent Defence Forces.  The Government will have to take action to deal with this unprecedented retention crisis to which the witnesses referred a number of times.  For the sake of the country, we cannot have a completely demoralised Defence Forces.  It is disappointing to learn about an obsession on the part of the Department with control and micromanagement.  We will put those issues to the Department and Minister of State in our next engagement.  We will follow that up.  I heard a former Army officer comment on broadcast media in recent days that when a memo goes to Government, there is very little input from the military side.  It is a Department of Defence memo rather than a major contribution being made by the military.  That comment was made by a retired senior officer and, if true, it is disappointing.  For the sake of our society, we need our Permanent Defence Forces to be properly and strongly resourced.  Often at this committee, we refer to the great service provided by our Permanent Defence Forces.  Given where I come from, I am very conscious of the subversion that existed on our island over a period of 30 years-----</p></speech>

I recall very well the enormous contribution of members of the Permanent Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Reserve Defence Force in dealing with the dangers that confronted our society.  Of course, the great work our Defence Forces have been doing for decades overseas has enhanced our international reputation.</p><p>It has also enhanced our international reputation as a country.  We are very proud of the women and men who have served on overseas missions, and peacekeeping missions in dangerous situations, over the decades as well and we compliment them on their considerable contribution to Ireland's international reputation.</p><p> Commandant King commented earlier that there is a "dilution of security clearance measures" in recruiting people.  That would have to raise alarm bells.  RACO is suggesting, if I am reading Commandant King's comments correctly, that adequate security precautions are not being taken now in the recruitment of some individuals in the Permanent Defence Forces.  I would sincerely hope that we are not going that road.  Commandant King also raised the problems that arise from inadequate training timelines.  Those all are issues that must be of concern to us, the Oireachtas and society.  All we can do is say that we would be glad to support the issues RACO has raised with us today and bring them directly to the Minister and to the Department.</p><p> As my colleagues, Deputy Jack Chambers and Senator Leyden, stated, as a committee we would be glad to continue to have engagement with the association and its fellow representative associations as well.  It is important that the association has the opportunity here to outline the issues of concern and that we have that engagement as well.  It would inform us better in raising parliamentary questions and in other D&aacute;il debates.</p><p> With the agreement of the committee, I will write to the Minister of State outlining a few issues Commandant King raised in regard to a defence pay review body.  With regard to pay, I presume the commandant would also include review of service, pay and conditions, the need to have adequate retention measures, and the need to deal with the pensions issue that he outlined as well.  We will raise those particular issues.  We will have engagement again with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, hopefully at an early date.  The Minister of State has been before us at this committee on a number of occasions over the past few months but Commandant King can take it that we will write to the Department raising the issues that I outlined and that we will have further direct engagement at committee level with the Minister of State as well.</p><p> If there are other issues that RACO wishes to bring to our attention, Commandant King can communicate them to the Clerk to the Committee.  All such correspondence is brought to all individual members.  It is a useful information process for us as well.</p><p> I thank Commandant King for his presentation and for his engagement, and thank my fellow committee members for their engagement on this important issue.  I wish to put on the record again our appreciation of the work that the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force do on a daily basis on behalf of us all.  It is work that we never hear about but that protects our society and our country.</p><p> The committee now stands adjourned until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 June 2019.

The Bill follows a review of the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC, which was sought by the Minister for Finance.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish the role and responsibilities of the chairperson of the commission.

I am principal officer in the business tax unit of the Department of Finance.  My unit also has responsibility for oversight and liaison with the TAC, a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  The proposed Bill has two Parts.  The purpose of the first Part is to make amendments to the legislation governing the Tax Appeals Commission, primarily to implement recommendations of an independent review carried out in 2018.  Commissioner Mark O&rsquo;Mahony and Commissioner Lorna Gallagher from the TAC have also accepted the committee&rsquo;s invitation to attend today.  </p> <p>  The second Part relates to the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations, via an amendment to part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.  I will refer to both Parts and my colleague, Mr. Oliver Gilvarry, principal officer in the markets and securities unit of the Department, is available to address any questions from committee members on this aspect of the Bill.</p> <p>  The TAC was established on 21 March 2016 under the Finance (Tax Appeals) Act 2015, taking over from the former Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  The commission was set up as an independent body with its own Vote and Accounting Officer with a view to providing increased transparency and an enhanced appeals mechanism for taxpayers.  Since its establishment, staffing at the commission has grown from two commissioners and four administrative staff to three commissioners and 13 administrative staff at various grades.  However, a number of factors have contributed to the development of a backlog of appeals within the commission.  </p> <p>  On establishment, the commission inherited 282 cases from the Office of the Appeal Commissioners but, during 2016, more than 2,700 additional legacy appeals were transferred from Revenue to the TAC.  Changes to the appeals process have also resulted in a significant increase in the number of new appeals arising, as all taxpayer appeals are now notified to the TAC in the first instance, rather than Revenue.  As a result, a backlog of appeals has developed, currently standing at approximately 3,650 appeals.  </p> <p>  On foot of the growing backlog and requests for significant additional resources, the Minister for Finance commissioned an independent review of the workload and operations of the commission in 2018.  The review was conducted by Ms Niamh O&rsquo;Donoghue, a former Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection.  This review examined the governance structures, workload and operations of the commission.  The resulting report was published on budget day in October 2018.  </p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has expressed his full support for the recommendations and work on implementation is ongoing both in the Department and the TAC.  The commission and Department of Finance are in regular contact about governance matters and corporate supports.  An administration working group has formalised discussions between the commissioners and Revenue regarding the administration of appeals.  The 2019 Estimates provided for a near doubling of the commission&rsquo;s budget to accommodate the recommended staff increases and improvements to ICT equipment.  </p> <p>  Recruitment of the recommended additional support staff is being undertaken by the TAC.  Following a competition conducted by the Public Appointments Service, the Minister has authorised the appointment of three additional temporary appeal commissioners, who it is hoped will take up their appointments shortly.</p><p>The proposed legislation undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny today will enable progression of another key recommendation of the O'Donoghue review, the appointment of a chairperson of the TAC.  As the legislation governing the TAC does not provide for the role and responsibilities of a chairperson, recruitment cannot commence until the legislation is amended.  The Bill will provide that a chairperson, who will also be an Appeal Commissioner, will be responsible for ensuring the efficient operation of the TAC and accountable to the Minister for Finance in this regard.  It is envisaged that the establishment of a commission chairperson will strengthen the body's governance and accountability while bringing the commission's structure into line with other similar bodies.</p><p> The legislation will also clarify some aspects of the existing appeals legislation in order to facilitate the tax appeals process.  It will clarify the requirements for both appellants and commissioners in respect of the case stated process, under which an appellant may appeal a decision of the TAC to the High Court.  Finally, in order to clarify a potential ambiguity, the legislation will make express provision for the TAC to enter into contract.</p><p> I will now move on to the second part of the Bill, which seeks to amend Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014 as part of the transposition of the EU prospectus regulations.  A prospectus is a document that issuers are required to publish when making a public offer of securities or seeking securities admission to trading on a regulated market in the European Union.  The prospectus provides key information about an investment and is intended to assist potential investors in making suitably informed investment decisions.  The current prospectus regulations have been in force in Ireland since 2005.  The regulations are an important part of the overall investor protection regime as they set out the minimum information and disclosure requirements that apply to offers of securities in Ireland and ensure that the information provided to prospective investors is accurate and not misleading through either the omission of key information or deliberate misstatement.  The regulations ensure the integrity and stability of the Irish market as a leading exchange in Europe for new securities listings.</p><p> In 2017, the EU agreed a new prospectus regulation that will have direct application in member states from 21 July 2019.  Within the EU regulation, there are specific member state discretions that must be implemented through national legislation.  To ensure the continued and effective operation of Ireland's prospectus regime after the 2017 regulation enters into force, it is essential that these discretions are fully transposed before that date.  It had originally been intended to complete the transposition through consolidated secondary legislation.  However, elements related to Irish prospectus law are also contained in Part 23 of the Companies Act 2014.  While the changes are predominantly technical in nature, legal advice received from the Attorney General has indicated that they can only be made through primary legislation.</p><p> These amendments will update references in Part 23 of the Companies Act to refer to the 2017 EU regulation and the relevant legal definitions.  They will also transpose provisions contained in Article 11 of the regulation that restrict the civil liability of certain persons involved in the security offering.  The EU regulation grants member states the power to exempt offers of securities up to a total consideration of &euro;8 million from the requirement to publish a prospectus.  Ireland currently has a threshold of &euro;5 million.  It is proposed to increase the threshold to &euro;8 million in line with other member states such as the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Finland and Italy, which will allow smaller firms easier and less costly access to capital markets funding and reduce their reliance on bank financing.  Given the increased exemption threshold and following consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, additional investor protection requirements will also be inserted into the local offer regime under Part 23.  As the EU regulation enters into direct force on 21 July 2019, the amendments to Part 23 must be enacted prior to that date to ensure there are no legislative gaps in Ireland's prospectus regime and to meet our European commitments to have the required legislation in place by that date.</p><p> This has been a relatively high-level overview of the provisions in the proposed legislation.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

Does Ms Donaghy's remit involve the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has a financial aspect to it that is perhaps within the Department of Finance?

I do not know when exactly the measure was brought in but during the downturn, when companies and sole traders got into difficulties, there was a clawback on the two weeks' pay per year from the Department.  The Government or the Department of Finance or Department of Social Protection, as it was known then, paid 70%.  The clawback was eroded, however, when it was reduced from 70% to 15% and it eventually disappeared altogether, with the result that the staff of any company or sole trader that closed down or downsized had to get two weeks' pay per year.  This was implemented a number of years ago but some of these companies and sole traders employed people prior to the introduction of the requirement to pay redundancy of two weeks' pay per year worked.  While this falls within the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Finance got rid of the 70% clawback.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for the current backlog is that legacy appeals were transferred when the Tax Appeals Commission was established.  Prior to 2016, the appeals function available to taxpayers was the Office of the Appeal Commissioners and while that was independent, it was still an organisation within the Revenue Commissioners.  This was then restructured in 2016 and the Tax Appeals Commission was created to improve transparency.  It was created as an independent body in its own right.  One of the reasons for the increases in staffing is that the commission is now an independent body in its own right and must look after many issues such as its own governance and administration.  In addition, at the time the TAC was formally created, as I said, more than 3,700 legacy appeals were transferred from Revenue to the TAC.  A large part of the backlog is due to that number of legacy appeals coming over to the TAC.</p></speech>

When the TAC was created, a large number of appeals came in.</p><p>There was also a change to the nature of the appeals process when the TAC was created.  Under the Office of the Appeal Commissioners, the first line of appeal was to Revenue, which acted as a filter for many basic appeals where there was a misstated number, a clerical error or something relatively uncontroversial.  Under the new system, the TAC is the first court of appeal and everything must be appealed to the commission within 30 days of a notice.  There has been a significant increase in the number of appeals coming in but many of them turn out to be minor issues that are resolved between the taxpayer and Revenue.  This has given rise to a backlog.  We carried out a review to point to where greater resources were needed and the purpose of this Bill is to assist in pulling in those resources.</p></speech>

Under the existing framework, the threshold was &euro;5 million and any issuance under that amount was not subject to the requirements of the prospectus framework as set out in Europe, though it was subject to Part 23 of the Companies Act, which deals with local offers and which gives certain protections.  The rationale for increasing it to &euro;8 million and allowing discretion at European level was to make it easier for smaller businesses to raise money.  Big corporates were able to access the markets but this left smaller entities relying on bank financing.  The increase gives smaller businesses a choice.  They do not have the same level of disclosure requirements as a company such as CRH but a company that has a track record of a number of years can issue debt securities or equity.  Balancing that is the fact that we have increased certain protections.  People who invest in these companies do not get the full framework of the prospectus regulation but they will get disclosure of a company's track record over recent years, and information as to whether someone was guaranteeing a product, at what level they were doing so and who he or she was.</p></speech>

It applies to big, complex businesses such as mineral extraction.  It seeks information as to what business a company is doing is different jurisdictions and what the risks might be from that.  Smaller businesses are more simplistic and there is likely to be just one line of business.  They are not likely to be operating across jurisdictions, within or without the European Union, and what they do tends to be bespoke.  It could be a fintech business or a manufacturing company.  The aim is to give it the option to issue debt securities or equity, rather than require it to go to a bank or a venture capitalist for financing.</p></speech>

This reflected the changing market.  Following the crisis, banks pulled back from the market and the capital markets union, CMU, project attempted to deepen Europe's capital markets by giving different options for companies.

That is offered in conjunction with investment advice or brokerage by an investment firm.  Part 23 basically sets out the requirements for the entity.  Germany has gone at this a bit differently, in that they say the threshold is &euro;5 million but one can go up as far as &euro;8 million with these protections.  What we have done is set it at &euro;8 million with these protections and disclosures that must be done.  If there is an intermediary in Ireland selling that security, whether it is a MiFID entity or an Investment Intermediaries Act authorised entity, there is a conduct of business rules requirement for which the Central Bank is the competent authority.  That is why we feel comfortable moving it up to &euro;8 million and made that recommendation.</p></speech>

The company is caught then and does not have a prospectus that allows it to offer security across the Union.  It is limited to the domestic framework.  The benefit of the prospectus regulation is that it does not matter where a company does its listing.  An Austrian company that does its prospectus in Ireland can list in an Irish, UK or German market, and sell and have no problems across the Union.  The prospectus is the prospectus.  The local offer framework limits the company.  Companies do not get that flexibility, so it is no use for a big Austrian-based multinational to say that if it only needs &euro;7 million, it will just do it in Ireland or Germany.  It is going to be caught because then it is just in that market where it will want more.  The other benefit of the prospectus regulation is that it is seen as the standard internationally.  Europe has this framework and, therefore, that is the framework.  If I am buying a security that is subject to a prospectus issued under the prospectus regulation, I have comfort with the framework Europe has put in place on that.</p></speech>

I would like to do a recap on tax appeals.  Before this we had the Office of the Appeals Commissioner.  Someone who appealed did so to the local Revenue office.  Was there a distinction in the types of appeals being heard?  What was the distinction that would lead to one appeal going to the Office of the Appeals Commissioner and one to Revenue?  Can the witnesses explain the old system?</p></speech>

What that meant was that if there was something straightforward at an early stage such as an error in a number or if someone said they were entitled to a particular credit in a PAYE assessment, they could be sorted out.</p></speech>

The inclination is to immediately appeal it to the Tax Appeals Commission and he or she may also contact Revenue if it is a straightforward error.  A volume of cases are always appealed and that would create an appeal that takes processing time.</p></speech>

The notice of appeal that we receive has details of the appellant's or taxpayer's complaint, so that goes to Revenue.  We see that where there are very simple differences between Revenue and the taxpayer and it is a straightforward error on one part or the other, it can very often be resolved without much further input from us.  There is a degree of drop-off at that early stage.</p></speech>

Not all of those cases will go to a hearing because the parties may settle.  On average, the figure is about 55 a year per commissioner.

How can we return to a waiting time of three months?  Mr. O'Mahony has told me that under the current system if the three commissioners hear about 150 cases each a year then the total is only about 400 cases a year.  How many additional cases will there be in the coming year?  A new system must be more efficient in terms of time than the old system but I am not convinced by the new system even though it has good architecture.  It will be great to get the new appeals commissioner and case workers this time next year.  How many additional cases are lodged per year?</p></speech>

The Department accepts that and we have all addressed that.  The Senator is right that the hearing time needs to be brought down.  Today is part of that process.</p> <p>  With regard to dealing with the level of appeals, not all appeals will require a hearing and not all will even be set a hearing date.  There is, perhaps, not a direct correlation between the number of appeals we receive every year and the number of hearings we are required to carry out.  In 2018 we doubled the number of cases we had closed.  In 2017 it was 700, while last year it was some 1,440.  We are getting there, but the Senator is absolutely right and that is why we are here today.  The waiting list needs to be brought down.

We have not yet reached full operational strength.  We are going to look at that when we have an idea of our workload and our proper level of resourcing.  The Senator is absolutely right that there needs to be targets and that we need to be held to a standard.  We are not, however, in a position to put a date on it yet.  The reality is that ultimately we will have a classification of appeals whereby, for example, a simple appeal should be closed off by the commission on average within X number of months, a medium complexity appeal within 2X months and a very complex appeal within two years - to pick a figure at random.  We accept that there have to be targets, which we are actively considering.</p></speech>

The primary purpose of having a chairman, particularly as the number of commissioners increases, is because it is important to have one identified head of the office who is responsible.  There are a number of different areas of responsibility for the commission currently under the Act but the purpose will be to focus these responsibilities in the chairman such as, for example, the putting of reports to the Minister.  The Tax Appeals Commission will remain a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  The body is statutorily independent in the exercise of its functions as an appeals body but nonetheless it is accountable to the Department in its expenditure and the delivery of its functions.  We have ongoing contact with the commissioners regarding its annual budget and annual spend, for example, and we have constant contact in relation to answering parliamentary questions.  This contact would continue throughout the year but the chairman, essentially, will be the one identifiable person who has the overall responsibility for ensuing the commission is meeting its requirements.</p></speech>

I presume that many tax appeals are made by corporate entities and businesses and so on.  Equally there are individuals and sole traders whose income tax is being appealed.  I am sure it must be a very stressful scenario for them as to whether they must pay an amount.  How does the issue of interest and penalties play out during this process? Is this all suspended during the appeal process?  Does a person pay the tax and then hope to get it back after appeal or is it in limbo?

If the person pays the tax then obviously there is no interest charged at the conclusion of the appeal if he or she is unsuccessful.  If the appeal is successful, however, then the Revenue Commissioners refunds the tax that has been paid.  If the person had not paid the tax then statutory interest is accrued if the appeal is ultimately found to be unsuccessful.</p></speech>

If it does not have it, the State is sitting on the guts of &euro;3.67 billion, which is potentially available or not available to the State.  It is a very significant amount of money given that we refer to other figures of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million of fiscal space here or there.  I thank Mr. O'Mahony for knowing that figure and for giving it to the committee.  Is there a split in terms of value, for example 80:20 of cases with very small value?

I am asking for the numerical amount of the highest claim, that is all.  It is just to give to people who may be looking in at these proceedings an idea.  Obviously, people appealing their property tax assessment or those who are appealing an ordinary tax assessment, either as an individual or as a couple in their personal circumstances, will not be appealing a &euro;1 billion assessment, but it is just to give a flavour of what is here.  Many people would not be familiar with the Tax Appeals Commission.</p> <p>  While the main thrust of this legislation is to appoint a chairman and to give the chairman a role, the Tax Appeals Commission has already been set up and has inherited legacy cases.  With throughput there are legacy cases, and new cases every year and the commission is also clearing cases.  Is there an in and out schedule of what is happening around that?  Will Mr. O'Mahony give us a slightly better picture of that? </p></speech>

We are, however, probably approaching the limits of our capacity within our existing resources.</p> <p>  Sanction has been granted by the Minister for a doubling of our staff numbers, and there will be such an increase, assuming the legislation under consideration today is passed.  There will be a doubling of the commissioner numbers as well.

Staff were tied up across the country in the Revenue Commissioners' local tax offices working on these cases.  These cases have effectively been shipped on to the Tax Appeals Commission.  There is a staffing problem here.  What was happening in reality was that an appeal was made, a telephone call was made by the tax agent or accountant representing the appellant, who probably knew who the inspector was and who had been dealing with him or her on a daily basis.  Discussions were ongoing on cases.  A lot of them were pulled out of the appeals process.  It was the way it worked.</p> <p>  The problem now is that everything has left the Revenue and the staff who were dealing with it at each individual district are no longer doing so, as the entire process has gone over to the Tax Appeals Commission.  My worry is that this will end up by becoming a slow, tedious process that is legal and not practical in nature.  I worry that we are creating something here that is unworkable and bureaucratic.  The previous system might be described as being inefficient.  How do we as a committee get reassurance that we do not suddenly have a situation developing where barristers or solicitors appearing before the Tax Appeals Commission becomes the norm for clients?  This should not be the case.  It may end up becoming another form of a court, as distinct from being something that will assist people getting cases heard.  One will have the hard cases but they will end up in the courts in any event.  My concern is that there will be unintended consequences in setting up new bodies in which the mechanisms are foolproof but are utterly bureaucratic and legal in nature and where we do not get the outcomes we seek.  I hope that will feed into the questioning.</p></speech>

First, we are conscious of that being a potential issue.  As already said by Mr. O'Mahony, it is not the case that every appeal that comes into the TAC goes to a hearing or is a very formal process.  One can see from its annual reports, for example the 2018-----</p></speech>

Everything is now being processed through the same filter and the commission has a backlog of one year already.  I have genuine concerns.</p></speech>

For example, of the 1,440 cases closed last year,  668 of those were settled and 223 were withdrawn.  A lot of them still settle, albeit they settle once they are first notified and then they settle.  Separate to that, we are concerned that we make this a system that works for taxpayers and in particular for the small taxpayer with the small issue.</p> <p>  This is part of the purpose we have with the administrative group I mentioned that we have set up with between the TAC and individuals in Revenue, who have a particular responsibility on their side for the appeals process.  We are looking at options within that to see how we can make taxpayers, particularly the small taxpayer who looks after his or her own affairs, more aware of their options to contact the Revenue Commissioners as a first port of call, if it is a query or incorrect number, so that it does not go to the TAC.  This is something of which we are actively aware and are actively trying to find ways to address.</p></speech>

We were able, for example, to group some similar appeals into one appeal etc.  We wrote out and some were not proceeding and some others had been resolved.  There were a number of reasons many of them fell away.  From the grouping of 1,157, Commissioner Kennedy then commenced a process of case management conferences, which is a small process where the parties can come in and a conversation can be had, fairly informally on some occasions, and an opportunity to resolve cases exists if people want to talk.  If people want to proceed, then they can.  We have now, at present, on the legacy side, 658 of those cases remaining as of 20 May 2019.</p> <p>  On the question of representation by barristers at the commission, this is a very broad brushstroke figure but I estimate that approximately 40% or above are not represented.

What I am trying to convey is the number of live hearings.  We have a statutory facility in the commission whereby we can dispose of cases that do not require a hearing, but we can provide for a paper-based hearing, of which many taxpayers avail.  It is very advantageous for advisers because they can simply tell their clients that they do not need to be present.  They can opt to avail of that facility, assuming that the case is suitable.  I will sit at my desk and give the case no less attention than I would any other.</p></speech>

We have a statutory entitlement to take a flexible approach in cases where we consider it is appropriate to do so.  Whereas some cases are contested significantly with appellants who are very heavily represented, many are not.  In those cases we try to be as co-operative as we can in terms of the hearing being, if not a positive experience, as such, one in which they believe they have been heard and listened to.  We want to convey the message that we are not a division of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is very important that taxpayers understand that if they come to the Tax Appeals Commission for a paper-based hearing, they will have an absolutely objective, expert review of their appeal, independent of any other State body.  That is the service we endeavour to deliver and hope to increase that understanding.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get my head around why it is taking so long to get to where we want to go, but it does look as if there is some light at the end of the tunnel, at least in dealing with legacy cases.  At the same time, 1,689 cases were submitted last year.  If the figures are all quite small, one can say that is fair enough, but if we are dealing with sums of over &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.67 billion, they are very large cases in which there is a great deal at stake for taxpayers and the State, depending on whether it has to give the money back.  Is there a figure for the success rate or otherwise?  One hears a figure of 30% for the number of appeals to An B&oacute;rd Pleann&aacute;la won or lost.

I am not trying to avoid the question, but a very simple appeal, if we were fully staffed and it is clear there has been a misunderstanding of something by Revenue, could be resolved within months.  There are certain time periods built into the legislation.  One of the first things we do when we notify Revenue of the receipt of an appeal, is we ask if it is valid and if it meets the statutory criteria to enable us to consider it.</p><p>Revenue has a 30-day period within which to object to the validity of the appeal.  With all the staff and all the budget in the world, there are 30 days that we cannot get around.  It is very difficult to say at this juncture what an average time should be or what a reasonable target would be.  I suspect ultimately there will be three different targets for simple, medium and highly complex appeals.  In terms of putting a number on it, I do not think we are quite in a position to do that yet.</p></speech>

On this prospective legislation, which we talked about earlier, why is it in this Bill?  It sounds strange that a Bill called the Tax Appeals (Amendment) Bill 2019 has a whole load of stuff in it that does not seem to have anything to do with tax appeals.  Is just going into this Bill for convenience?  Why is it not in a separate Bill?</p></speech>

This is as a consequence of European legislation as well.  The transposition date for the prospectus regulation is 21 July.  It was relatively late.  Our intention was to make these amendments via a secondary instrument because the requirements came through from EU legislation so the European Communities Act 1972 would apply.

There are a couple of answers.  If it is a stand-alone appeal and it sets a position in respect of a particular provision of legislation, it is conceivable that on consideration of that position, the Revenue Commissioners will take a particular view.  However, it is not a necessity.  Any appeal may be appealed by a party who has not been successful.  The short answer is that it depends.</p></speech>

We may inform them that the decision has been made.  At that juncture, we will invite them to make representations to us if they wish to proceed with their appeal or if they feel their appeal is significantly different from the appeal that has been determined.  They still have an opportunity to convey their position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>wishing to progress with the appeal or not.  We have a statutory facility that allows us to convey that information to similarly situated taxpayers who may be under appeal in the TAC.</p></speech>

The short answer is that it depends on a given case when the valuation date will crystallise.  I appreciate the Senator's point.

It is hoped we will see the increase in staff helping to reduce the backlogs and giving satisfaction to people one way or the other.  I do not doubt it is very stressful for anyone to put in a tax appeal.  It may have great impact on their lives, mental health and so on.  The fact that it is being tackled is good.  I hope the backlog will be reduced from 658 to zero sooner rather than later and that the commission will be able to manage cases more efficiently over time.

We are delighted to have him here again.  The committees undertake detailed work which does not lend itself to consideration in plenary sessions.  The committee Chairs know that while our work is intensive, our collective remit is extensive and our approach enables parliaments to engage with citizens in a more meaningful and direct manner.  In 2018, there were 626 committee meetings involving 2,179 witnesses overall.  A level of direct engagement with citizens and the nature and depth of our work on policy matters are among several aspects of the committee's work which makes it particularly rewarding and beneficial.  I hope that this engagement will again be of mutual benefit to my fellow chairpersons in the context of both policy matters and priorities for Oireachtas committees and the Government.</p> <p>  I propose that we now proceed directly to the substantive part of the meeting.  I ask the Taoiseach to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.1114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2019053000002#B00300"><p>I wish the members a good afternoon and thank the Chairman.  Accompanying me is the Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Martin Fraser.</p> <p>  In the programme for Government, we wanted to strengthen accountability through attendance at Oireachtas committees and I welcome this opportunity to hear the committee's issues of concern and discuss the Government's response.  For that reason, I will keep my opening statement relatively short.</p> <p>  Since this Government of Fine Gael and Independent Ministers came to office, 113 Acts of the Oireachtas have been passed.  Nine of these were originally published as Private Members' Bills.  A further 23 Government Bills are before the D&aacute;il and ten are before the Seanad.  We hope to have as many of these as possible concluded by the summer recess.  All this work benefits from the input of the committees.  I recognise the contributions of this committee's members' as Chairs and the contribution of members of their committees in scrutinising relevant legislation, dissecting the work of our agencies and advising on public policy.  This is our second meeting in this format and it is an opportunity to reflect on where we are as a country, and how we are doing in the round.</p> <p>  The country is nearing a position of full employment.  There are a record 2.3 million people at work and the unemployment rate is at its lowest in 14 years.  The economy is doing well and it is being managed well.  As a result, incomes and living standards are rising, and poverty and deprivation rates have been falling for four years, including a 30% reduction in child poverty.  We have balanced the books and moved into surplus, we are reducing the national debt and we will make our first deposit to the rainy day fund later this year.  However, we must not become complacent.  The country has been here previously and we are mindful of the risks to our economic welfare, no more so than in the context of the threat posed by Brexit.  Regardless of the form it takes, Brexit will have an adverse impact on Ireland and there will be a need for planning in respect of it on the part of the Government, businesses and citizens, as well as at EU level.  Given what is happening in London, the risk of a no-deal Brexit continues to be a significant possibility.  That risk is, if anything, increasing as each day passes.  We will remain vigilant and continue to work for the best possible outcome while preparing for all possibilities.</p> <p>  A detailed contingency plan published on 19 December, and updated in January, set out the Government's analysis of a no-deal Brexit.  The Brexit omnibus Act was signed into law by the President on St. Patrick's Day last.  This primary legislation crosses the remit of nine Ministers and comprises 15 Parts to help prepare Ireland for no deal.  It focuses on protecting our citizens, helping businesses, and securing jobs and ongoing access to essential services and products.  On 8 May, Ireland and the UK signed a memorandum of understanding on the common travel area.  This reaffirms our shared commitment to maintaining the common travel area in all circumstances.  Irish and British citizens will continue to be able to move freely to live, work, study and access welfare, pensions and public services in each other's country on a reciprocal basis.  They will also be able to vote in local and national parliamentary elections in the UK on the same basis as British citizens, while British citizens will be able do the same in Ireland.</p> <p>  At home, we are investing for the future.  With Project Ireland 2040, we are making massive investments in our public infrastructure, such as housing, transport, culture, sport, education and healthcare in all parts of the country.  At its core, Project Ireland 2040 is about balanced regional development.  We are planning for a country with a population of 6 million by the middle of the century, if not before.  We need to develop Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway into cities of real scale, growing twice as fast as the capital.  We need to develop other major urban centres, such as Sligo and Athlone, and along the M1 corridor, Dundalk and Drogheda, and Letterkenny-Derry.  We are also planning for a rural Ireland which continues to experience population and jobs growth with vibrant towns and villages at its core.  We expect the population of rural Ireland to increase by 200,000 by 2040.</p> <p>  The shovels are in the ground and Project Ireland 2040 is being implemented.  While, understandably, there has been much focus on one particular hospital, there are three new hospitals under construction, one of which, the national forensic mental health service hospital in Portrane, will be completed very soon.  Extensions are being built all over the country, including new wings or new ward blocks in Limerick, Waterford and Clonmel, to name but three.  The new runway at Dublin Airport is now under construction and the first technological university has been established.  There is an ambitious programme of school building projects in every county and major new road projects in the north west and south east, including the N4 to Sligo, and the design contracts for the M20.  The M7 upgrade and the Enniscorthy and New Ross bypasses will open later this year, with the Dunkettle and Ballyvourney-Macroom projects moving to construction.</p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 will enable every part of the country to grow and share in our national prosperity.  The first allocations have also been made from the four Project Ireland 2040 funds: 84 projects have been awarded &euro;86 million under the rural regeneration and development fund; 88 projects received approximately &euro;100 million under the urban regeneration and development fund; &euro;75 million was awarded to 27 projects through the disruptive technologies innovation fund; and &euro;77 million was awarded for seven projects in the first phase of the climate action fund.</p> <p>  We are also preparing for the world of the future with Future Jobs Ireland.  In the coming decades, artificial intelligence, AI, virtual reality-augmented reality, VR-AR, robotics and autonomous vehicles will change our world as much as the Internet and mobile phones did in the recent past.  We need to be ready to benefit from the new jobs and new wealth that will be created.</p> <p>  If we are to have the kind of economy and society that I believe we all want in 2025 &ndash; low-carbon, high-productivity, high-tech, family-friendly, globally-traded and competitive - we need to create the environment where that is possible now.  Every generation needs to shake up its enterprise and jobs model - otherwise it stagnates - and we are working to change the way we work.  Education is central to that.  For 2019, we allocated &euro;10.8 billion to the Department of Education and Skills.  This is the highest such allocation in our history.  It is a big number but in practical terms it means: 5,000 extra teachers hired in two years; the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever in primary schools; &euro;1.8 billion to assist children with special educational needs; more special needs assistants, SNAs, than ever before; new subjects such as physical education, PE, and computer science; more students attending higher education from non-traditional backgrounds; and new school buildings, extensions and refurbishments all over the country.  By the end of this year, we will have added 40,000 extra or replacement school places, and built 200 modern science laboratories and 48 new or upgraded PE halls, and replaced 600 prefabs.</p><p> Construction is now also well under way on new facilities at Grangegorman for Technological University, TU, Dublin.  I am very keen to see a new TU created next in the south east, in Munster or both.</p><p> Delivery of the national broadband plan represents a significant intervention by Government in promoting rural development.  A digital divide exists between urban and rural Ireland and that contributes to an economic and social divide.  We can close it now or we never will do so.  The plan aims to ensure that every home, school and business has access to high-speed broadband, almost all by means of fibre.  Earlier this month, we approved the appointment of a preferred bidder.  National Broadband Ireland, the preferred bidder, will supply broadband to the one quarter of Irish people and premises that currently cannot access high-speed broadband.  It guarantees a level playing field for 1.1 million people, 500,000 homes, 100,000 businesses and farms and 600 schools, getting the same speeds for approximately the same price.</p><p> Despite some real progress to date, I am fully aware that many problems persist in, for example, the areas of housing and homelessness, healthcare and climate change.  Last year, 18,000 new homes were built in Ireland.  That is the highest number in a decade.  We know from figures released by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in recent days that new home building is up another 25% this year so far.  We will certainly see between 22,000 and 25,000 new homes being built in Ireland this year.  This does not include student accommodation or vacant homes being brought back into use.  The construction industry and the social housing programme are being rebuilt bit by bit.  Last year, for example, 8,500 new homes were added to the social housing stock, which is a very significant number.  About half of those were built by councils or housing trusts and the other half were acquired from developers, leased or brought back into use having been vacant but we need to go higher than that again.  We are aiming for 10,000 this year and 11,000 or 12,000 the year after.  This is the largest social housing programme we have had in the State for decades but there are constraints and limitations such as the availability of construction workers and delays in planning, tendering and construction.  This, and nothing else, is holding us back from accelerating the social housing programme further.  In fact, the housing budget this year is &euro;2.6 billion, the biggest budget for housing ever.  It will rise again in 2020.</p><p> We are also spending &euro;146 million on homelessness services this year.  It is making a difference.  Last year, more than 5,000 adults and their dependants exited homelessness.  More people are being lifted out of homelessness than ever before but, unfortunately, we have yet to stem the tide of people becoming homeless for the first time or sometimes a second time.</p><p> In order to ensure a long-term supply of affordable rental homes in our cities, a different form of not-for-profit rental is required.  That is cost rental.  There are currently two cost rental projects being piloted - at Enniskerry Road in south Dublin and Emmet Road in Inchicore.  Cumulatively, these two projects will provide 380 cost rental homes.  If it works as a model, we can scale up across the State.</p><p> In healthcare, this year will see the highest ever level of health funding in the history of the State at approximately &euro;17 billion.  We also have a &euro;10 billion capital programme over the next ten years to renew our buildings, our equipment and our ICT.  As I mentioned, we have three hospitals under construction.  A fourth is on the way, with the national maternity hospital due to go to tender later this year.  While there has been an understandable focus on the national children's hospital, it is worth pointing out once again that it will take up less than 20% of the capital budget for health leaving 80% for all other projects across Ireland.  For example, 11 new primary care centres will open this year adding to the 125 that are already operational.</p><p> In 2014, we reversed the previous Government&rsquo;s policy on reducing hospital bed capacity.  While being a slow process, by the end of this year, the number of hospital beds will be back above 11,000 for the first time in ten years and while too high, the trolley count this year is lower than last year.  Waiting times for operations and procedures like cataracts, tonsillectomies, hip and knee replacements, angiograms and scopes are down by about half since the middle of 2017.</p><p> The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation team is up and running.  As we know, this is a ten-year all-party vision to introduce universal healthcare in Ireland, free or affordable healthcare for all, much speedier access to healthcare and a decisive shift towards prevention, primary care and community care, with much greater local and regional autonomy.</p><p> Following an open competition, Paul Reid has taken up his role as director general of the HSE.  A new HSE board is being established to strengthen the management, governance and accountability of the HSE.</p><p> An agreement has also been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on a major package of GP contractual reforms that will benefit patients, make general practice a more attractive career option for doctors and help bring about positive changes at primary care level.  It represents a 40% increase in funding for general practice over three to four years.  A new contract has also been agreed with staff nurses and midwives.  It now needs to be implemented.</p><p> As we know, climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today so the Government warmly welcomes the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action published in March.  The committee worked constructively over the past few months to achieve a broad consensus on what needs to be done.  The recommendations have informed the Government's climate plan, which is being finalised by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  It will align with other work we are doing to build a strong economy and a society in which nobody feels left out, one that has the family at its centre, with modern infrastructure in place in a country sure of its place in the world.  The plan will set out how we intend to meet our climate targets and a range of actions in energy, agriculture, transport and buildings, as well as in other sectors.  While it is not often commented upon, Ireland already performs well in some areas such as recycling, exceeding our EU targets.  We are now up to 30% in the context of renewable power.  We can also do well in respect of greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> Under our national development plan, we are investing approximately &euro;21.8 billion over the next ten years, some by way of the Exchequer but mainly through the semi-State organisations, which will bring renewable energy from 30% today to 70% by 2030.  There will also be investment in the installation of electric vehicle infrastructure, which will be led by the ESB, building insulation and the electrification of more of our railways.  Just this week, Irish Rail began procurement of 600 new electric or hybrid locomotives.  There are also more buses.  The first low-emission vehicles went into service in Dublin this month.  No high-emission buses will be purchased for our cities henceforth.</p><p> Regarding justice reform, the third report of the effectiveness and renewal group was published in February.  It shows the substantial progress that has been made throughout this transformation.  We are also working to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland in five areas: leadership and accountability; people; structures and operations; independent oversight; and partnerships.  We will strengthen the human rights compliant culture within the Garda; develop a new digital strategy; review Garda discipline; and continue workforce modernisation and civilianisation.  We also want to improve the working conditions of Garda personnel through the deployment of ICT to reduce paperwork and by resolving long-standing issues such as rostering, the uniform and wellness.</p><p> This is just a small part of the work Government is doing. We are on track but there is much more to do.</p><p> The chairmen of Oireachtas committees perform a significant role in our parliamentary democracy and they have had a very much enhanced role in this D&aacute;il.  They help us deal with some of the biggest challenges faced by our country.  I look forward to hearing their questions and engaging with them on the priorities of their respective committees.</p></speech>

Before we move on to the next part of the meeting, I will do a quick recap on the procedures that have been agreed.  We will take questions from chairpersons in groups of three.  That will operate under the D'Hondt model whereby they will each have one minute to ask a question and the Taoiseach will have approximately four minutes in which to reply.  There will be a second round of one-minute questions to the Taoiseach, with the same reply time afforded to him.  A note on the sequence of chairpersons and the questions being asked has been distributed; they should have a copy in front of them.  In the event that somebody is not present, I will move up from the names in the group below and, as a result, I might call people earlier than indicated.  I call Deputy Fleming, who is in the first group of chairpersons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.1117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2019053000002#C00300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for attending.  Much of the information he provided relates to issues I want to raise with him.  I want to make one or two positive suggestions.  The first concerns Project Ireland 2040, in respect of which there is a capital expenditure plan worth &euro;140 billion.  The level of the national debt was so severe a few years ago it led to our establishing the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The Taoiseach should now set up a national capital project agency - similar to the NTMA - to handle all the big projects and gather all the experts together within one agency.  The type of projects involved would be those costing more than &euro;20 million; school building projects can progress at their current level.</p><p>As the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am saying we have had mistakes with the national children's hospital, we might have mistakes with the broadband issue and there are more.  When running a major capital project it is not right to have every Secretary General be responsible for the capital investment in their own Department, with each of them making their own individual mistakes and no overall learning capacity.  I see merit in having one State agency.  It would build up tremendous expertise and knowledge about procurement.  Above all, it would free the line Departments to do their main work.  For example, with the national children's hospital the head of the HSE, the Secretary General of the Department and senior officials are spending much of their time dealing with a construction project when they should be dealing with health issues.  Having such an agency would free up their time.</p></speech>

He correctly mentioned Sl&aacute;intecare as being a ten-year vision for change and reorienting our health service towards primary care and spending public money for the public good, concentrating on need not the ability to pay.  To implement the reform programme, we need transitional funding to be allocated to reforming the health service, in particular in information and communication technology which is essential for underpinning the reform programme, in gathering data and giving real-time information on how we can assess the reform programme as it rolls out.  Will transitional funding be made available to Sl&aacute;intecare in this year's budget?  When will multi-annual budgeting be adopted to allow for long-term planning and certainty in the reform programme?</p></speech>

I wish to address some matters under the equality element of our responsibilities.  I commend the Department of the Taoiseach on its initiative of engagement with the Oireachtas disability group.  I commend in particular the work on the Taoiseach's behalf by Philip O'Callaghan.</p><p>I will understand if the Taoiseach is not able to give me the specifics on these matters, but I ask him to note them and if possible to write to me subsequently.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, was ratified in March 2018.  The ratification of the optional protocol is essential to the implementation of the hope and promise of the UNCRPD and the prospect of people with disabilities being able to secure access to their rights and needs.  When will the optional protocol be ratified?</p><p>The Report and Final Stages of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has not yet been scheduled.  When will that be done?</p><p>The <i>in loco parentis</i>rule needs to be repealed.  Parents looking after seriously ill and seriously disabled children need to have that certainty.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming's suggestion is one worth considering.  It is something we considered at the time of developing Project Ireland 2040 and decided not to go for it.  Australia has such a body, Infrastructure Australia, a government agency tasked with overseeing and driving all its major infrastructure projects.  It is an idea that is worth dusting down and looking at again.  I would throw in two caveats.  The roads programme, the schools programme and the Irish Water programme are all proceeding on time and on budget; so if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Capital projects are being delivered on time and within budget in plenty of areas.</p><p>I was Minister for Health when we agreed to go ahead with the national children's hospital.  We decided to set up a dedicated agency and board with expert staff to ensure it was done properly.  I wonder if we had taken the other route and allowed HSE estates to do the job, whether the job would have been done just as well or even better.  While the HSE comes in for considerable criticism when it comes to new hospitals, new hospital wings and primary care centres, it does them pretty well.  While it is not a bad idea, I am not sure if it is a panacea.</p><p>Deputy Harty asked about a transition fund.  We would agree that reforming the health service will cost money and that cannot come out of the day-to-day spend because that has to be spent anyway.  In the health service we need to invest to spend, or spend to save as some people say.  I would argue we have a transition fund already; we just do not tot it all up and call it a transition fund.  The &euro;80 million a year that is set aside for investment in ICT is a transition fund.  The capital budget, which is now about &euro;700 million a year for new buildings, is also transitional funding, as is the new money for general practice, particularly for the new treatments - the chronic disease funds.  To me all those things are transition.  We just do not tot them up and call it the Sl&aacute;intecare transitional fund.  We could do that but would that not be just an accounting exercise?  Obviously people can also bid for the &euro;20 million fund if they have particular ideas.  I would argue that we have it already; we just do not tot it up and account for it that way, but maybe we should.</p><p>I will need to come back to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in with answers to his questions.  I thank him for his kind words about Philip O'Callaghan.  We want to sign the optional protocol but we are not ready yet.  I will come back to the Deputy on the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p><p>I was across the <i>in loco parentis</i>rule about six months or a year ago but I am not up-to-date on it now.  I heard the comments made by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, in particular.  I have met constituents who have been affected by this.  It may be one of those things done with the best intentions but it has not passed the common sense test.  I will make sure we come back to the Deputy on all three of his questions.</p></speech>

Having been Minister for Health, the Taoiseach will be very familiar with the section 38 and section 39 organisations.  They expend about &euro;5 billion of taxpayers' money annually.  There is no public accountability because they are not directly accountable to the Oireachtas in any manner.  Where such organisations receive the majority of their funding from the taxpayers, there should be some accountability to the Oireachtas.  We need to ensure there is accountability.</p> <p>  The same applies to public private partnerships.  They talk about commercial sensitivity.  Some of these contracts run for 25 or 30 years.  It is not possible to wait for 30 years to examine whether a project was good or bad value for money.  There needs to be a mechanism for public scrutiny of some of these public private partnerships after a short period.  That will happen during the course of Project Ireland 2040.  It would create greater public confidence if people could see some transparency.</p></speech>

Many systems that have engaged in health reform have moved to multi-annual budgets to allow for a longer-term planning process.</p> <p>  I return to the procurement process for large infrastructural projects, which falls within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The national children's hospital has been the subject of many meetings of the health committee.  The existing procurement process was a two-stage process.  It gave weighting to cost at 75% and quality at 25%, which put an emphasis on the cheapest bid rather than an emphasis on quality.  What plans does the Government have to review that style of procurement process?</p></speech>

The matters I have highlighted are of particular importance and concern to the non-governmental organisation sector.  The Taoiseach mentioned being across the <i>in loco parentis </i>issue six months ago.  Nothing has happened in the period since.  I appeal to him to look at that very seriously.</p><p>It is imperative that we have the matter of the optional protocol ratified and see the passage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  The Bill has completed Committee Stage and awaits Report and Final Stages.  This is a critical element in the ultimate delivery of the hope and promise of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

I believe that as a principle multi-annual budgeting makes a good deal of sense.  It is something I would like to move to across Government and not only for health.  Again, a practical difficulty arises.  We actually set out the budget for each Department, and not only for next year.  We publish a table regularly - we will probably publish it as part of the summer economic statement in a few weeks time.  It sets out how much each Department is getting not only for this year but for the next two or three years.  These are called expenditure ceilings.  They get adjusted at budget time, generally upwards, but we do set out this information.  In health, in particular, extra money is factored in each year for demographic and other pressures.  Perhaps this is not done adequately, but it is there.</p> <p>  The difficulty we have with health is the consistent inability to stay within the budget ceilings.  We can have any budget we like, whether multi-annual, annual or half-annual, but if we are unable to stick within our budget ceilings then they are not of much value.  The temptation in a multi-annual budget system is always to take money for next year.  That can potentially make the problem worse.</p> <p>  We are proposing to change several things when it comes to procurement.  One may sound obvious but it is serious.  We should not proceed with a project until we know the full cost.  That sounds blindingly obvious; of course we should not proceed with a project until we know the full cost, but this can actually give rise to difficulties.  For example, I am a big supporter of projects like the M20 to link Cork and Limerick and a big fan of projects like MetroLink for Dublin.  However, we never actually know the full cost of anything until we go to market or to tender.  That is true whether we are building a small house or a massive project.  Enforcing that new policy will be difficult because we may find ourselves at a point where we have spent &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million getting to the point of tender only to find out the real cost.  Then, we have to decide that we are not going with it after all and then justify how we have spent &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million on a project that did not proceed.  That has happened before.  Thornton Hall is one example under a previous Administration.  There are other examples but it is not a perfect solution either.</p> <p>  The other thing is to look at the balance between cost and non-cost factors when it comes to how we weight a tender.  Part of the advice we have from our legal people and experts in the field is that we are far more likely to face a legal challenge if we do not go for the lowest-cost tender.  There have been challenges when we have not given the tender to the lowest bidder.  That is a risk and it can delay projects.  It is not simply a matter of cost and quality.  Submissions have to reach a minimum level of quality standards first and then there are cost and non-cost factors.  We run the risk - it is a real risk - that if we do not go for the cheapest tender then we could find ourselves challenged.  Maybe it is a risk that we should simply face, but it is a risk and we need to bear it in mind.</p> <p>  There is one thing I am keen to change.  I have the Attorney General looking at this for me.  I do not accept this cannot be done under European procurement law even though that is what some people say.  I believe we should have some weighting around past form.  I am not referring to any one company because I do not mean any one company.  There are several in several fields that have not done a good job in the past.  I do not like to see them getting public contracts again.  If a candidate was going for a job in any of our offices, we would look at the references of the candidate.  Any normal person going for a job anywhere gives references.  The employer rings up the former employer and asks whether the former employer was happy.  Is that not an obvious thing that we should have in our public procurement process?  We should have some sort of star rating based on the past form and performance of a contractor when it came to other public contracts.</p></speech>

At a recent committee meeting we had a detailed discussion on the importance of political research, the reasons behind voting and why people vote a given way.  One of the key points was that political scientists had committed funding from 2002 to 2007.  The project gave significant information on why people voted.  There were different reasons, including political views, political values and other reasons people chose to vote or not to vote.  Since then, the scientists have only received money on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis and cannot carry out the same level of detail in research work.  The question to us at the time was twofold.  The first part related to the establishment of the electoral commission and when that would happen.  In the absence of the commission, is there any possibility of securing defined funding on an annual basis to allow them to get ready for elections and to be ready to try to get research information that is vital for the Oireachtas in future?</p></speech>

There are some quick points I intend to address.  The first is the notion of the whole school community as well as parity of pay for teachers.  It is really important that those making up the heartbeat of the school - the secretaries and caretakers - are treated equally.  At the moment we know they are on poor pay and have uncertain short-term contracts.  They are not deemed to be public servants.  This certainly needs to be looked at as does the question of revised contracts for special needs assistants.</p><p>Educational inequality and disadvantage need to be addressed in terms of trying to raise the playing field at an educational level for those who are vulnerable, especially those with special needs.  Can the Taoiseach comment on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  It has been <i>in situ</i>for 15 years.  When will it be fully implemented?  My next question is about the delivering equality of opportunity in schools scheme.  While the scheme works for many schools, there are many disadvantaged children in non-DEIS schools.  We need to have extra funding for home school liaison resources, school meals, school books and extra programmes.</p></speech>

My question from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine relates to the future of the agriculture sector.  Obviously, the sector will face major challenges in the coming years.  Most likely, given the exit of Great Britain from the Union, there will be a deficit in the next Common Agricultural Policy.  My question is basically around the CAP.  What is being done at present to ensure that our European colleagues, who have been friendly in the past while, are coming on side with regard to extra funding that may be required to meet that deficit?  What is the status of negotiations at the moment?  What is the status of the rest of the negotiations on where we are going with CAP and the strategy around it?  Will the Taoiseach enlighten us on when we may see the draft strategy for Ireland's strategic planning for CAP in the next period?</p></speech>

I will have to check that out.  I will have a chat with the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, about that.  I do not see why we could not have a dedicated fund for that kind of research.</p><p>One always runs the risk of being accused that one is carrying out the research for the benefit of the Government.  I will not go over old ground in that regard.  We had commissioned some research and decided not to go ahead with it, but maybe there is a way to do it.  Given the very high number of spoiled ballots in elections gone by, a bit of research into that would be beneficial.  Also, there could be some research in respect of turnout.  A 50% turnout is not bad for local and European elections, but I would be interested to know why 50% did not vote.  It would be very useful to have that information.  I will speak to the Minister of State about whether that is something we can do.  It does not require the establishment of an electoral commission, although that would be the ideal vehicle for it.</p><p> Like the Deputy, the research I found most interesting on the day was the exit poll, which turned out to be wrong beyond the margin of error on many counts.  For the first day, RT&Eacute; and a lot of the media reported on the exit poll, not the election.  I saw Ms Saoirse McHugh, a really impressive young woman from Achill who had been elected by RED C that morning, interviewed on RT&Eacute; all morning.  She was not a runner-up.  One thing they do in the Netherlands, which might be something for us to consider, is to require media outlets when they report opinion polls not to report the medium, but to report the range.  Instead of saying that a party is at 32%, they should have to say that the party is actually at between 29% and 31%.  That would be more accurate for a start and would also be beneficial politically.  It is something that we need to give some thought to, particularly as there is a margin of error in all these things that causes people, both media and politicians, to jump to conclusions that are not actually based on the science.</p><p> Regarding the electoral commission, we need to do it.  It is long overdue.  It is still a project that is in gestation and, again, is under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, in the Customs House.  We have this bizarre situation where we are setting up referendum commissions all of the time.  Referendums have become a very frequent feature in Ireland and we are forever setting them up, closing them down, finding a judge and finding offices.  It is kind of crazy.  If we had a permanent electoral commission, so many of these things would be done much better, including the register.</p><p> I had a good discussion with Ms Nicola Sturgeon when she was in town in recent days.  The Scottish use STV for some of their elections as we do.  They do not use electronic voting, but they do use electronic counting.  They have machines that one just feeds the ballot papers into.  They are glass and one can see what is going on.  They are able to count their votes in a matter of hours whereas we could still be counting votes down in Cork City Hall in a few days' time.  While I would never go for electronic voting again, maybe we should think about electronic counting.  Perhaps we could borrow the machines from Scotland every now and then.</p><p> On the question of education, I am not sure if it is a rosy picture but I think it is a good picture.  If the Deputy looks at our international statistics, our Irish students perform pretty well in reading, maths and so many different areas.  Our teachers and our educators do a fabulous job.  On school secretaries and caretakers, that is one of those long-standing issues that I would love to see resolved, but anything we do would have to be prospective.  If they were taken on as public sector employees into the future, it would have to be prospective.  I do not think we could do anything retrospectively for lots of reasons.</p><p> I will have to come back to the Deputy on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  It is approximately 15 years since that legislation was passed and I would imagine large sections of it now are out of date and probably need to be updated in order for the legislation to be implemented.</p><p> Deputy Deering asked about the future of agriculture.  Crucial to that is the next CAP in the next five-year multi-annual financial framework, MFF.  It is something that I keep a close eye on because Ireland is a net contributor to the EU budget but most of what we get back is through CAP.  We want that to continue.  I am lobbying very hard and building alliances with France, Spain and countries in eastern Europe to try to defend the budget for CAP and ensure that it will be if not more than then ideally the same as it has been in the past.  That is going to be a real priority for us as we head into the talks on the MFF, which is Europe's next five-year budget.  The best way to achieve that is to make it part of environmental policy, to green the cap and to make it a common agricultural and environmental policy.  I am not a farmer, as the Deputy knows, but I have an interest in farming.  I was reading all about the detail of the GLAS scheme the other day.  Many people do not know this, but there are 60,000 farmers in Ireland who are beneficiaries of the GLAS scheme.  Part of what they do under that is plant trees - oak and ash, native trees.  They provide wild bird cover, for example.  They are already doing many things that make a lot of sense.  Maybe it should be mainstreamed as part of CAP that all farmers, or a greater number of them, should be part of GLAS.  If we want to get more money for farmers and for CAP, I think it is in that space that we can get it.  The other area is, perhaps, transition.  If there are farmers who want to move from some forms of farming to other forms that might be more environmentally sustainable, they would have to be incentivised to do that and it would have to be voluntary.  If we are looking to boost the budget so that there is more money for farmers and more money for the rural economy, the best way and the right way to do that, I think, is to make it an environmental policy as well as a food policy.</p></speech>

There were quite a few spoiled votes because of that.</p> <p>  Housing is a priority for the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It is disappointing to see that the homeless figures have increased again.  We are three years into this Government's term of office and into a continual rise in homelessness.  While there is a Government responsibility, it is a blight on all of us in the Oireachtas that there are more than 10,300 people homeless, nearly 3,800 of whom are children.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when he believes that trend will stop in its upward trajectory and start to reverse?</p></speech>

It is appalling that it has not been implemented within 15 years.  Given that we need to re-examine the matter, though, I call on the Taoiseach to make that a priority.  Without a shadow of a doubt, there must also be timelier assessments of children who need extra support and early intervention.  A range of supports within schools are also required.  More intervention is required in respect of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, which are based in the Department of Health but which have major implications in the context of education.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach mentioned capital spending.  Too often, there is a longer delay between announcements and school openings than should be the case.  Since I never miss an opportunity to mention specifics, I will refer to the new secondary school in the constituency of Kildare South that was announced last year.  Sites are still being considered and there has been no movement on the project.  St. Paul's in Monasterevin has been waiting 15 years.  It has 207 boys-----</p></speech>

Will the Taoiseach remind us of when that funding will be matched?  There was a commitment of a further &euro;50 million from the State's coffers.  What are the potential allocation dates for the money and how will it be allocated?  Will it be allocated on a <i>pro rata</i>basis in terms of those who have suffered the most in the past year or so or will it be allocated straight across the board?</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Casey that they are disappointing.  I am also loath to use that word because it is much more than "disappointing".  It is devastating that they continue to rise.  The number of families and children has gone down slightly and the number of singles has gone up, but overall it is an increase.</p><p>If I had been asked this time last year, I would have hoped that, by this time this year, we would see the number start to fall.  It has levelled off at around 10,000 per year but should be falling by now and falling much faster.  It is not.  A major part of the approach is providing more social housing, which we are doing as quickly as we can.  We will do more this year and next.</p><p> The other issue is that of tenants' rights.  With the co-operation of the Opposition parties, we enhanced tenants' rights in the past couple of weeks.  This means that if somebody is given notice to quit by his or her landlord, he or she has much more time to find alternative accommodation.  Both of those steps are going to make a difference in terms of exits from homelessness and preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place.  I would be more than disappointed and more than devastated if, by this time next year, the numbers did not fall substantially.</p><p> There are factors under our control, such as the provision of social housing and enhancing tenants' rights, and there are factors that are not under our control.  Nearly half of the cases of homelessness are caused by family breakdown.  It is impossible to predict how many families will break down in the next year.  Roughly 20% of people who are homeless are not from the EEA and are not entitled to housing.  They might not even be entitled to live here at all.  Again, it is impossible to predict those numbers for the year ahead.  What we can predict is the number of additional homes we will add to the social housing stock.  That will be at least 10,000 this year, which represents quite a major increase over the figure of a few years ago.</p><p> On the compensation package, we actually do not have the terms and conditions yet from the Commission.  I have not seen them.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Creed, has seen them.  I cannot answer the question just yet.  We will need to find Exchequer money to match the funding.  That is the way it works.  I do not know where it is going to come from yet but we will find it.  It will provide some income support for farmers.  We will try to ensure they are able to apply for those payments and get them as soon as possible.  I saw the figures from Teagasc today on how farm incomes fell substantially last year, because of the bad weather and other factors.  The farmers need the funding.  We are going to try to get it to them as quickly as possible.</p><p> I am conscious of the possibility that Mercosur may be back on the agenda.  Members will be aware that also.  I do not have an update on that yet but it is very much part of our watching brief.</p></speech>

Meeting our skills needs is vital to Ireland's future.  As we approach full employment, it is important to ensure that we have systems in place.  Today the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation launched a report on the role of apprenticeships and work permits.  Could I flag two issues, on which the Taoiseach might comment?  Last year, there were just under 15,000 apprenticeships in Ireland.  This figure is very welcome as during the recession, the number of apprenticeships fell by 80%.  Of the 14,953 apprentices, however, only 2% are female, amounting to 332.  This is an issue we certainly have to examine.  We learned that, prior to 2016, the State paid the apprentice during the off-the-job training periods.  However, for apprenticeships after 2016, the employer continues to pay the apprentice when on off-the-job training.  Therefore, block release, which is 15 weeks in length, can cost the employer &euro;7,500.  If somebody is on release for one day per week, however, it is much easier for the employer to absorb the cost.  Could this be considered?</p></speech>

It is a matter for all of us to deal with individually but, nevertheless, it is important to get a perspective from the Taoiseach's Department on it.  The credibility of the Oireachtas is threatened by the finding that we acted unlawfully, or that a committee did.  Therefore, it is important for us to reform ourselves.  I would appreciate the Taoiseach's comments on that.  The most important hearings at my committee this year were those on the FAI.  Over 100,000 people watched the proceedings online, yet members had not the capacity to ask particular questions and follow through on decisions that were made.  Therefore, there is a considerable gap we have to address.  I would really appreciate the Taoiseach's comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.1157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2019053000002#G00500"><p>I welcome the Taoiseach.  In the Taoiseach's opening comments, he made reference to the fact that are nearing full employment and that rates of poverty and deprivation are falling.  That is true but the statistics belie the fact that a significant number of people still are living in very difficult and challenging conditions.  There are families who have not worked in generations so there is intergenerational unemployment.  There are communities that are still very disadvantaged and deprived.  There is a range of programs across Departments to assist them.  We used to have the RAPID programme.  Unfortunately, it has now become the community enhancement scheme and its remit is much broader than that of targeting disadvantaged areas.  As for the social inclusion programme, the level of funding is static and is projected to be static for the coming years..  Funding for drugs task forces has not increased.  The point I am trying to make is that the targeted interventions required by the communities need to be assessed across Departments.  I am not saying for one moment that every subhead has to be increased but I ask the Taoiseach to consider a Cabinet sub-committee to examine the area of disadvantage.  Three, four or five Departments must be involved if it is to be addressed significantly.  We have in the past been in circumstances in which the country was doing well but we left people behind us.  I would not like to see this happening now.  We can do better than we are doing.  We should do better but a Cabinet sub-committee is probably needed to work in a cohesive and joined-up way.</p></speech>

I was not aware that the number was so low but I was aware that it was low.  The Deputy is correct that we need to make a serious effort to interest more girls and women in taking up apprenticeships.  We are facing major skills shortages in construction and so many other areas.  We definitely need more women to consider taking up careers in the sector.  The jobs are generally very well paid once one gets through the apprenticeship.  The Deputy's point is very well made in that regard.</p> <p>  On employers having to pay when the apprentice is on block leave, I will check the position.  There are always two arguments on this.  Some ask whether the employer should not make a contribution since the State is paying for the training for the employees.  If the State were not providing the training, it would have to be paid for oneself, as the guilds used to do.  On the other hand, employers would no doubt point out to me immediately that they pay both the national training levy and employer's PRSI and are therefore paying for the apprenticeships.  I will check the position again.  We are increasing the national training levy every year by 0.1%, which brings in an extra &euro;50 million for higher education and training.</p> <p>  I have not yet read the Kerins judgment so I am loath to comment on it.  The Government could certainly provide advice on it.  Now that there is the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers-----</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy O'Dowd very ably chaired the hearings on the FAI.  There was considerable public interest in that.  The hearings made change happen.  It shows the power of Oireachtas committees, that people can actually be held to account and that change can be made to happen.  At the same time, I confess that I believe the previous Committee of Public Accounts did treat some witnesses very badly a few years ago.  Notwithstanding all the issues around Ms Kerins' salary, I believe she was badly treated by the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  There was one referendum I voted for that I am glad got defeated, that is, the one that would have given Parliament the power to carry out Oireachtas inquiries and make findings of fact against individuals.</p><p>I voted for that and I was a member of the Government which proposed it.  I am glad the people, in their wisdom, rejected it.  Ultimately, we are politicians, we need votes to stay in our jobs and we are driven by news cycles.  If one is going to act in a judicial way and make judgments on individuals, one must do it in a fair way.  One must listen to all the evidence, not comment until one has heard all the evidence and then come to conclusions in a judicious way that should not in any way affect how the public sees one.</p><p> This was one of those occasions when the people were right.  We should maintain that separation between the Judiciary, which can make findings of fact and findings against individuals, and politicians, who probably should not go into that space.  That is not to say we cannot have robust committees that hold organisations to account and shine light into dark places.  They have done that very well in recent times.</p><p> Deputy Curran made some very valid points on the issue of poverty, which is real in Ireland where there are very disadvantaged communities.  He was an effective Minister of State in that area and I remember him working in that role.  Long-term unemployment is down to 1.9%.  It is probably as low as it has ever been.  However, that masks a different reality, which is what we call jobless households where nobody in the house is in paid employment.  I will not us the word "works" because often people work in their homes as carers.  We have an action plan to deal with that and it is being driven by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  It can make a big difference if, through a combination of incentives and disincentives, we can encourage those households, or at least one person in those households, to join the workforce.</p><p> I want to have a rethink about the community enhancement scheme and the RAPID programme.  I started to think about this matter the other day.  We all know what is being done in the north-east inner city and how it has been successful so far.  People would like to have that model replicated in their areas but that is not possible.  One could not find the resources to do it in all areas.  I thought that perhaps we should designate ten or 20 areas of profound deprivation around the State and do something similar, but then it occurred to me that we had done that previously and called it RAPID.  I had in mind places in Deputy O'Dowd's constituency, Corduff in my constituency and Ronanstown in Deputy Curran's constituency.  We can all think of such places.  We would very quickly end up reinventing RAPID.  I am giving some thought to that and I am going to talk to Mr. Fraser - he knows a great deal about the NEC as well - in order to see if we can relaunch something that would be targeted at a small number of disadvantaged areas based on objective criteria.  Everyone will want his or her parish included but that will not work.  I am giving the matter some thought.</p></speech>

The vast majority of EU countries are members of this scientific organisation.  There is an economic dividend in being a member of CERN, but membership, at &euro;1 million for associate membership and &euro;10 million and more for full membership, is expensive.  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to this matter?  The general consensus appears to be that if Ireland is serious about being part of the international science community, it ought to be part of CERN.  What are the Taoiseach's thoughts on that?</p></speech>

One of the issues that arises in investigation bodies that are accountable to us is that they only get a proportion, perhaps a minority, of their funding from the taxpayer, such as, for example, through Sport Ireland.  While due diligence is carried out in respect of that amount of money, it does not necessarily mean that there are no other issues arising.  We have to consider new legislation, if necessary, so that if Sport Ireland or similar bodies form an opinion that there may be other issues arising as a result of facts that are brought to their attention, they would have the capacity and legal authority to act given the strict and appropriate guidelines in that respect.</p></speech>

I recognise that everybody will want a programme in his or her area but analysis and figures are available to show the areas of greatest deprivation.  It is not necessarily about new programmes and schemes but probably about more targeted resources for our most disadvantaged areas.  It is not just RAPID funding but funding going through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for breakfast clubs and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It requires that joined-up approach.  As is being done in the north-east inner city, there is greater scope to tackle some of our most disadvantaged areas.  I do not like naming them because I do not want a stigma attached, but the evidence is available to support the areas that would benefit from it most.  If we cannot do it when the economy is growing, I doubt that we will ever do it properly.  We should take this opportunity and I am glad the Taoiseach is prepared to consider reintroducing a RAPID-style approach - call it what one wishes - that would target resources at our most disadvantaged areas.</p></speech>

I am aware that the question has come up and I have often seen online campaigns encouraging us to join CERN.  A guy who was in my class in primary school works for CERN, although I have not seen him for a long time.  I encounter his mother regularly at election time but I have not seen him.  I will have to check the position.  I have a feeling that we decided to join, perhaps taking an associate membership.</p></speech>

I will have to check with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  I have a recollection that we did decide to join, but I do not know why we did not do it.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Curran that it is as much about joining up what we are doing already as it is about resources.  In the new contract with GPs we have set aside a &euro;2 million fund, and it is only to get started, dedicated to primary care in areas of high disadvantage.  That is a start and we can scale it up.  There is a thing in healthcare known as the inverse care law - Deputy Harty will be familiar with it - whereby those people who need healthcare the most are the least likely to get it.  Wealthy people can afford healthcare and often have many unnecessary investigations and even unnecessary operations, whereas those who often need them the most get them the least.  The answer to it in education is DEIS and we all know how that works, but there is nothing like that in healthcare.  Primary care in areas of great disadvantage where people are more likely to die young, smoke, get cancer and be sick gets the very same funding from the State as anywhere else.  That is wrong.  If we doing a second RAPID or something similar, part of it must be healthcare and a significant increase in healthcare investment in those designated areas focusing on things that make the most difference such as public health, encouraging people to turn up for screening, cessation of smoking and the many things that blight people's health.</p></speech>

The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has been up and running for the past 20 years.  Some of the most difficult meetings we have had were with families of victims of the legacy killings and so forth who have appeared before the committee.  The concerns those people have relate to delays in inquests, some of up to 40 years, information withheld and inquiries agreed to but never set up.  The difficulty we are facing now is the statement from the British Secretary of State for Defence regarding the introduction of a statute of limitation in respect of British soldiers.  The Taoiseach has said he opposes this but has he told the Secretary of State for Defence that an amnesty for British soldiers is unacceptable?  Can he also provide an update on legislation the Government is to introduce regarding the Stormont House Agreement legacy mechanisms?  There is agreement in the Stormont House Agreement to move forward in respect of the legacy, but now we have a situation where the Secretary of State for Defence is undermining that process.</p></speech>

The first issue which arises is that our committee had a number of meetings recently to discuss defence and the Defence Forces.</p><p>It replicates issues raised with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions recently.  He knows the issues in question, namely, pay, retention and the lack of morale.  He has acknowledged them and mentioned that certain things are happening.  It is urgent that they be addressed, judging from what was said at the meeting this morning.  </p><p> The committee also welcomed the report on the national plan for business and human rights 2017 to 2020 which emerged after some time.  A chairperson was also appointed to the business and human rights implementation group.  When will we see some of its work?  I ask because it took a long time to put the policy together and have a chairperson appointed.  It is taking more time to hear about anything further that is happening.  </p><p> Another matter that I want to address concerns Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy, A Better World, which was launched by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in February.  We need to know how it will be monitored.  Is there a mechanism for it?  </p><p> That brings us to consideration of policy coherence, something we are not very good at.</p></speech>

Childcare is the overarching issue that always comes up at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  The launch of the national childcare scheme will happen shortly.  It is a major development.  However, we can never do enough in this sphere because we are so far behind where we should be as a state.  While an unprecedented budget has been provided for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, one of the meaningful steps we must take is dealing with rates.  This point has been raised repeatedly at the committee and in the D&aacute;il.  Waivers of rates apply in some instances but not in others.  It depends on whether provision is entirely dependent on the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme or some private work is also undertaken.  </p> <p>  The other issue for consideration is adopting a uniform approach to the after school set-up.  I refer, in particular, to using the State's assets, namely, schools throughout the country, to provide after school care.  Some meaningful step is needed in that area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.1177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2019053000002#J00500"><p>I will start with Deputy Crowe's question about implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government's position on the issue is crystal clear.  There cannot be a Statute of Limitations and an amnesty when it comes to crimes that might have been committed by British soldiers in Northern Ireland or any other combatant involved in the conflict.  The Government of the United Kingdom may intend to apply such measures in Great Britain, but we will vehemently oppose any attempt to extend their application to Northern Ireland.  We have stated our position, of which the British Government is aware, and will continue to make our stance known.  In fairness, I think the British Government has heard us.  As I understand it, the proposal in question would apply to Great Britain, not Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  Turning to the legacy arrangements agreed to at Stormont House, there has been no progress on the issue which has become tied to efforts to re-establish the Executive.  Talks are under way involving all of the parties.  The T&aacute;naiste is in Belfast today.  The British Prime Minister is very keen to see the institutions back up and running before she leaves office.  I would like that to happen too and the two Governments are going to work very closely together on the matter.  I hope all of the parties at the talks will be able to make whatever compromises are necessary to get the institutions back up and running.  It has to happen in a sustainable way in order that they will not collapse again in a few months.  That is essential, not just because of the sad killing of Ms Lyra McKee but also because Brexit may see us enter into a dangerous period ahead.  I am, therefore, committed to getting the institutions in Northern Ireland going again.  We should, however, welcome the British Government's releasing of additional money for the inquests.  We sought it for a long time and it has now been done.  Some of the inquests are under way.  I refer, in particular, to inquests into events at Ballymurphy.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about pay in the Defence Forces.  As I stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday, pay in the Defence Forces is linked with pay in the public service.  Members of the Defence Forces are not unionised and not part of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, but they do benefit from any national pay agreement made.  That means that by October 2020 pay for the vast majority of public servants, including soldiers, sailors and Air Corps personnel, will be fully restored.  It is being done in steps and the process is under way.  Separate from that process, the Public Service Pay Commission has also produced a report.  I have it now.  It covers issues specific to the military.  It makes recommendations which will be put before the Cabinet in about two or three weeks' time at the latest.  There is, however, more to this matter than pay.  There are other issues related to morale and retention.  We need to look at it in the round and are determined to do so.  </p> <p>  I must admit that I am not familiar with the business and human rights working group.  I will have to check it out and respond to the Deputy.  </p> <p>  On A Better World, it really is an exciting policy.  It seeks to expand what we do in international development throughout the world.  The increase in budget is &euro;100 million this year and, all things going to plan, there will be a further increase next year.  I am not sure how it is monitored.  I imagine the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence has some role to play in that regard.  I am, however, open to suggestions.  It is turning into a very big budget; it now amounts to some &euro;800 million overall and needs to be monitored properly.  </p> <p>  Deputy Farrell mentioned childcare.  I know that it is an enormous issue for citizens, particularly for those with young families.  It is a major issue in my constituency which has a very young profile, as it is in the Deputy's.  The Government has two objectives.  We aim to reduce the cost of childcare for parents, while increasing quality.  The topic concerns not only childcare but also early education.  I think we are doing it.  Deputy Farrell mentioned the national childcare scheme which will kick in November.  It will mean an increase in subsidies for those already in receipt of them.  It will also mean that about 10,000 middle-income families who currently qualify for nothing will qualify for subsidies for the first time.  That is not supposed to be the end of the process.  Once the scheme comes in, it can be expanded and developed, subject to the availability of finance.  One of the demographic advantages we have is that the birth rate has been falling for some years.  That creates opportunities to do more with resources in areas such as childcare, maternity services and primary education.  I am agnostic on the issue of rate exemptions.  As the Deputy is aware, the problem with rate exemptions is that any time a business is exempted from paying rates, including non-businesses such as public buildings, etc., others will inevitably have to pay more.  We have to bear this in mind.  We can exempt many good things, but then, all of a sudden, the tailor, the butcher and all of the other people on Main Street end up paying much higher rates.  That creates a problem in itself.  My general view on taxation is that it should be broad-based, rather than hitting some people with very high taxes.  </p> <p>  On after school care, it is something I would love to see being developed more.  It seems to be a lost opportunity.  We have school buildings all over the country.  Why is it not the norm to have study hall periods and after school activities?  I do not know why they have not been developed.  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the Deputy because it seems to be a lost opportunity to have schools shut down at 3.30 p.m. or 4.p.m.  There is much potential to provide after school activities.  I am not just referring to study hall activities but also to sports and many other similar endeavours.  I do not know why we do not do more of them.</p></speech>

The St. Andrews Agreement is one of the issues to be explored in future talks.  The agreement promised that &ldquo;the Government will introduce an Irish Language Act reflecting on the experience of Wales and Ireland and work with the incoming Executive to enhance and protect ... the Irish language&rdquo;.  What is the Government doing to secure an Irish Language Act, as agreed to in the agreement?  We are back again to the situation where people have made compromises and agreed to things, but there is no follow-up and no implementation.  What is the Government doing in that regard?</p></speech>

It would be interesting to obtain information on that issue from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and see what role is envisaged for the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.  Policy coherence has to be central to it.</p><p>We have played a major role in sustainable development goals but unless our climate and tax policies are also coherent with our official development assistance, ODA, policy, it is giving with one hand and taking with the other.</p><p> On the other issue that comes to the committee quite a lot, we meet quite a number of human rights defenders, indigenous peoples, farmers or whoever.  Some NGOs have very good connections, and they can make a call that can practically save a person's life.  We have had examples recently in Guatemala and Honduras.  The issue of having that access to somebody who can make the call to the relevant person when somebody's life is being threatened has been brought to us.  </p></speech>

I understand that it is a complex issue on the rates side, and is based on several generalities but based on the number of childcare providers across the State, the best guess is that it is a very small sum of money.  While I appreciate the Taoiseach's comments, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs could look at it, although it would have to do so through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local authorities.  It is not something the Department can achieve on its own.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the Taoiseach's remark on the Government's twin-track approach to improving childcare service providers while trying to assist families.  On that subject of higher standards, the elephant in the room is the rates of pay for those individuals with higher qualifications, who are still being paid very low wages.  That is something we have to look at in terms of what the international market is doing, particularly in the Nordic countries.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, had a pilot scheme in his constituency that ran for a number of years.  I have two after-school, school-building-use pilot schemes on the run and there are also several commercial operators in that sphere.  Some sort of formal Government or Department-led approach should be looked at.  As to the question the Taoiseach asked himself about why it is not being done, it appears it has been rolling for many years but has not actually been grasped.</p></speech>

It was in a sort of side agreement between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister at the time.  That is one of the reasons why it has not been implemented.  It is a shame that it has been caught up in the current dispute about getting institutions back up and running and it is a shame that people see the Irish language as some sort of threat in any way.  The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act in Scotland does not make Scotland any less British and the Welsh Language Act in Wales does not make Wales any less British, and it is a shame that it has got caught up in that whole constitutional question that always divides people in Northern Ireland.  As somebody who loves the language, I would like to see some sort of progress, such as official recognition for the language, a language commissioner, and so on.  Once that is there, it can be built on.  I am a great believer in the power of incrementalism, and we need an incremental approach to this so as to reassure people with a British unionist, loyalist or Protestant identity that this is not something to be afraid of or something that is being pushed on them.  The Deputy will have heard some of the wild stories that have been floating around about people being forced to learn Irish or having quotas for people in the Civil Service, but none of those things were ever really proposed.  It is a shame that that has become part of the narrative north of the Border.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the issue of contradictory policies, and I hear her on that.  When it comes to tax, we have made some really big changes in the past couple of years, such as getting rid of stateless corporations and the double Irish.  I am not sure whether that is fully appreciated by some of our critics.  We are now one of the few countries that fully shares its revenue information with other countries.  The only way one can know if a company is not paying tax anywhere is if every revenue authority shares that information, and we are one of the ones doing that.  We are now deeply engaged with the OECD on what we are going to do to make sure that big digital companies pay their fair share of tax.  Big profitable companies should pay their fair share of tax, although they do not always do so.  We also need to make sure that whatever reforms we sign up to do not hollow out our own tax base.  There was a view in the past that Ireland was under-taxing corporations but if that was true in the past, it is certainly not true now.  The warnings we get from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and others indicate the opposite, which is that we are over-reliant on the massive amounts of money we are now taking in from those corporations, and we need to bear that in mind too.</p> <p>  There can be apparent contradictions in other areas, such as the fact that we promote breastfeeding through our health and well-being programmes, and then promote baby milk through our other agencies.  Those contradictions are not lost on me but they might take a bit of time to unwind.</p> <p>  On childcare, Deputy Farrell mentioned the issues around rates of pay and how they are linked to quality, and he is correct in that regard.  At the same time, we also need to bear in mind how higher rates of pay will impact on costs for parents.  It is likely that some form of sectoral employment order for the sector will happen in the medium term.  It is not heavily unionised at present but if it were to become more unionised, there would be a case for a sectoral employment order to set minimum pay standards across the sector.  </p></speech>

The other two relate to a major international programme, Gaillimh 2020.  Cad iad na c&eacute;imeanna at&aacute; &aacute; t&oacute;g&aacute;il?  What steps being taken?  Is there an intention to increase the funding for it and will the Taoiseach meet the directors of Galway 2020 to help them gain the publicity they need to attract sponsors and to have as big a range of activities as possible?</p> <p>  Two items of legislation that have been promised in the area that comes under my committee and that I was asked to raise are the heritage Bill and the national monuments Bill.  When is it expected that we will receive them in committees?  It is a big job of work.</p> <p>  Finally, the committee, and it is probably the same with other committees, is struggling in terms of membership and turnout.  Some of that is due to positions not being filled by the Government parties or Government members not turning up.  It can be quite insulting for people who travel to attend our committee when there are one or two members in attendance.  We are all very busy so I am not laying the blame on any one person but it is a difficulty that we have to address as a Parliament and at the very least, all the positions should be filled.  </p></speech>

Deputy Naughton mentioned to me that the all-Government plan on climate action is going before Cabinet.  When is it likely to be published?  Her absence today is due to her attendance at an Internet regulatory conference.</p><p>When will the legislation regarding an online safety commissioner proceed?</p></speech>

The Deputy will get a much more coherent answer from me in English.  I will have to check publication dates for the official languages (amendment) Bill and the implementation action plan.  They have both been pending for quite a while and I know the Deputy raises them very regularly, so she is probably wondering why I am not giving her a date once again, but I will pursue them with the Minister.  One of the things I hope to do in the next two months is to have a Cabinet meeting in a Gaeltacht area.  We have had a number around the country in different provinces but have not yet had one in a Gaeltacht area, so perhaps that would be the opportune moment for us to have that work done.  I will not promise that the meeting will be go h-ioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; Ghaeilge but we will have it in a Gaeltacht area.  That might be a good deadline to focus the mind on these two projects.</p> <p>  We should have an islands policy.  We have scraps of one around the place.  As Minister for Health, I did a bit of work on the health of those on islands, while there are special provisions in education of which the Deputy will be aware, but it is not all pulled together.  That is a very good suggestion that I will take on as Head of Government who is able to pull together different Departments in that regard.</p> <p>  Galway 2020 is not led by central government, as the Deputy is aware.  I have met them but there has been a change in personnel since the last time I had a formal meeting in their offices and met them informally on Shop Street while I was canvassing with the new MEP, Maria Walsh, a couple of weeks ago.  I committed to meeting them again and I will do so.  It is a significant opportunity for the city.  One thing that strikes me about Galway, which I did not realise until quite recently, is that even though it is a great city from a cultural point of view, there are not many spaces where events can be held.  One of the reasons the Connacht Rugby project is so exciting is the fact that it is not just about a rugby stadium.  It will contain facilities for other events as well.  This is a very exciting project and I hope the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport will be in a position to provide some funding for it later in the year.</p> <p>  I will have to come back to the Deputy about the Heritage Bill.  Regarding attendance by committee members, I know it is difficult.  There are a lot of committees and we are all very stretched, particularly those on three committees.  We then give out to them for not being present for votes and being in the Chamber as well.  The solution is probably more parties or a wider range of Deputies in Government.  We will muddle on for now.</p> <p>  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment will bring the climate policy to us in the middle of June, so it is almost done.  It is shaping up very well.  I know that for some people, it will be too little too late, but what we are trying to do as a Government is get it right when it comes to climate policy and have a climate policy that is serious but sensible.  It will be serious in the sense that it gets our greenhouse gas emissions down, which is the whole point of it, but sensible in that it does not do it in such a way that makes us poorer, costs us jobs or makes us less secure.  That is the overriding philosophy around it.  That will arrive in the middle of June.  More importantly, we then need to implement it.</p> <p>  The legislation regarding an online safety commissioner is being prepared.  I do not yet know the date but I would expect the heads this year.</p></speech>

C&eacute; gur rud dearfach &eacute; sin, n&iacute;l s&eacute; s&aacute;s&uacute;il, beag n&oacute; m&oacute;r, agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir glacadh leis, an fhreagra nach bhfuil d&aacute;ta f&oacute;s don Bhille.  Bh&iacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga &oacute;s &aacute;r gcomhair sa seomra seo coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin agus chur s&eacute; in i&uacute;l c&eacute; chomh deacair is at&aacute; s&eacute; d&oacute;ibh a gcuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh.  An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga told us how difficult it was to do his work without an official languages Act.  We have one that is not fit for purpose.  It has been there since 2003.  We have been promised it repeatedly - before the summer, after the summer, before Christmas.  An t-aon bhot&uacute;n a rinne m&eacute;, the only mistake I made was forgetting to ask which year.  We were told it would be this year, then we were told Brexit, and now we are here.  The commissioner cannot do his work.  We are talking about the most basic rights - just bunceartanna, so it is iontach go bhfuil s&eacute; ar intinn ag an Taoiseach cuairt a thabhairt ar an nGaeltacht.  I have been to all of the Gaeltachta&iacute; with the committee and I can tell the Taoiseach this is the common theme.  Please publish the Bill so that we can have an Act and have basic rights.</p> <p>  Regarding the coiste, we have had a strategy for 20 years, which is very good, and we have a plean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta, which is also very good but we must implement it.  The implementation is dependent on a monitoring body, but it has not even been set up.  Sin mo dh&oacute;thain.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith ag an Taoiseach.</p></speech>

I have literally just come from a flight from London so the Taoiseach can guess how topical they will be.  We are about to reopen our public hearings based on the report we published in June 2017.  My first question relates to the Brexit preparedness that has been undertaken, not necessarily from the legislative side of things, because the Brexit omnibus Bill has gone through the Houses and is very detailed, and not necessarily relating to a no-deal scenario, but in terms of working with the various sectors such as the business and agricultural community, Irish citizens in the North, etc.  Has the Taoiseach's Department set down any matrix regarding what the level of engagement should be, how the various sectors have prepared, and whether they have put their plans together?  Where does the Taoiseach think we are at at this stage?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the Taoiseach's meeting this morning with the leader of the Opposition in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn.  I noticed in some media outlets that he said that if he was to become Prime Minister, much like many of those seeking to become Prime Minister across the water, he would somehow renegotiate the deal.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether he reassured him that the withdrawal agreement has been negotiated and closed and that it is the only way to have a managed Brexit that leads us into the future negotiations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.1205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WGC2019053000002#L01100"><p>In response to Deputy Connolly, t&aacute; n&aacute;ire orm.  I know that almost every week, she stands up in the D&aacute;il and asks when this legislation will be published.  Each time she does, I get a little bit more embarrassed that we have not yet published it and that we keep telling her it is imminent when it does not arrive.  I do not know if it is achievable or not but I will set that Cabinet meeting as the target date for doing it because we should do something Gaeltacht related there as well.  Let me act on that.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Richmond's questions about Brexit preparedness, we have statistics about how prepared businesses are and so on.  We have a red, amber and green matrix regarding what is done, what is not done and what is in planning.  We are in pretty good shape in terms of being prepared for no deal, but that is not in any way to diminish the seriousness of it and the impact it will have.  Our preparedness is good.  I had a very good meeting with Mr. Corbyn and his team today.  I met one to one and we then met as a group and spoke about a lot of issues, including Northern Ireland and Brexit.  I emphasised to him that while any change to the political declaration is possible, the withdrawal agreement is closed and the only way this could ever change would be if there was a fundamental change in red lines from the next UK Prime Minister or the next UK Government, for example, a decision to stay in the customs union or the Single Market.  I think that was well understood by Mr. Corbyn.</p><p> We also talked about how hard it would be to secure a further extension beyond 31 October.  There is a hardening view across the EU that we cannot continue to have rolling extensions.  While there could be a further extension if there is an election, to allow that election to happen, or a second referendum, it is not viable to believe there would be unanimous support in the European Council, as that is what is required, for a further extension while the United Kingdom continues to figure it out or for another set of indicative votes.  I imparted the message, as politely as I could, that the chances of a further extension are quite slim and the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and the backstop, is closed from our point of view.</p></speech>

It covered a great deal of ground and was comprehensive.  It is welcome that this is now part of our parliamentary calendar, as it is an excellent opportunity to allow for such engagement.  We look forward to the next engagement between the Taoiseach and the working group.</p></speech>
