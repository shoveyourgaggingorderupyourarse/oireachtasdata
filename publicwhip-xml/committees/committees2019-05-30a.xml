    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#A00300"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is joined by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit, and Mr. Ronan McCabe, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering, Jonathan O'Brien and O'Connell.</p> <p>  The first item is the minutes of the meeting of 16 May.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  On matters arising, everything that we might want to discuss will come up during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2187 and 2190 from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General at the Department of Finance, are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We note and publish them.</p> <p>  Category B comprises correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up responses to previous meetings.  We will note and publish these.  Held over from the last meeting is the minute from the Minister for Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform, regarding our periodic report No. 4.  I propose we hold it over until the end of our discussion on correspondence.  I want to clear that document but we will go through the other items of correspondence first.</p> <p>  No. 2160 from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman of the Office of Public Works, provides information requested by the committee on the leaking roof in Schull Garda station.</p><p>The OPW states that there was no obligation on the construction company to fix the roof as the six-year liability period had elapsed.  I propose we forward a copy of this correspondence to the person who raised the matter with us.  We will note and publish this.</p><p> The next item of correspondence is No. 2161 B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, dated 10 May 2019, enclosing the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities, which was undertaken by Mazars.  We will note and publish this but we will also discuss it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00200"><p>As the Chairman will know, I have been looking for this for a couple of years.  I would like to point out that it has taken two years for the HEA to produce this report.  I would like an explanation of the second paragraph of Mr. O'Toole's letter, which states:</p><blockquote>The Board of the HEA has determined that the recommendations contained in the report would apply, as appropriate, to all institutions. [That is fair enough.] It has also determined its preference, that similar reviews in the future should, in the first instance, be carried out by the governing body of the institution concerned unless there is a specific reason not to.</blockquote> <p>I take from this that Mr. O'Toole means that the institution should carry out reviews before the HEA does and that we should not be asking questions about it.  I would like that clarified but I take it that is what he is saying.</p><p>This report is not acceptable.  It is too generic, it lacks specifics, and there are issues around roles as regards how it was carried out, which I might talk about in private session at some point.  There are no details in respect of positions, roles and responsibilities within the organisations or companies.  While I do not necessarily expect names to be mentioned, I do expect titles, roles, and responsibilities to be referenced.  The report is too vague.  There are no figures of substance in it.  Granted, I have only just had a chance to read this report because it only came in yesterday evening and these are my initial views on it, but it is not what I was expecting.  It does not assuage the concerns of the committee.  I am not even sure that all of the companies referred to in our discussions with the HEA and the college are covered.  There is a huge volume of detail missing.</p><p>As we only got this report last night, I propose to put into writing some of my issues, requests, concerns, and questions for consideration at a meeting so that we could write back to the HEA in the coming weeks.  I suggest that we put this on hold to give us time to consider it further, given we only got it at 6 o'clock yesterday evening.  The report is very disappointing and it does not deal with the issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00300"><p>I support that.  I have also raised the issue of IMERC, which is mentioned in the report, in that regard.  I certainly support the Deputy's proposal to come back to this document.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00400"><p>I support what has been said.  I will add a few observations to what the Deputy has said.  We will write back to the HEA seeking further specifics on the matter.  People can send information to the secretariat in the meantime.  We will hold the item over for discussion at our next meeting after the June bank holiday weekend.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00500"><p>I agree with Deputy Kelly.  It is a response to our query but it is not an answer.  As Deputy Kelly has said, it does not remotely give the sort of detail required for us to say that we have no concerns regarding governance.  Unfortunately, it does not provide any of the specifics that would give us that sort of peace of mind.  I agree 100% with Deputy Kelly's proposal.  I look forward to his analysis, and that of other members, when we have time to go through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00600"><p>That is good.  I agree with what is being said, but I took a little while to read the report and I want to put some remarks on the record.  In the first paragraph the report reads: "This review was also informed by a recommendation of the D&aacute;il's Committee of Public Accounts ... in July 2017 [when we said that we were] not satisfied that there was sufficient clarity [in] relation to relationships with CIT's Maritime College and other corporate entities".  To a large extent this report has flowed from our work and our recommendations.  It was not necessarily going to be initiated in the first instance.</p> <p>  I want to make one or two observations.  I know the Deputy accepts this.  Based on the information available, there were eight Cork Institute of Technology employees working in a company called GAC Training and Service Solutions Designated Activity Company, GTSS, and there was one more CIT employee working in a company called SEFtec NMCI Offshore Training Designated Activity Company, SNO.  The report goes on to say that the conflict of interests register in respect of CIT had only been completed in respect of one case.  It recommends that this should be done immediately.  It provides the pay grades of the people working in the National Maritime College of Ireland.  Nine people are mentioned, one of whom was receiving a salary of more than &euro;40,000 from the subsidiary.  One person working for SNO was in receipt of payment of more than &euro;50,000 and was an employee of CIT at the same time.  The point the Deputy raises is very well founded.  The committee was right to pursue this matter but we have not got all of the information we require yet.  Those points can be taken on board.  There is agreement that it is, as Deputy MacSharry put it, a response but not a full answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00700"><p>No, and I do not want to be giving us even more work, but I believe we need to make this same request regarding campus companies of all third level institutions.  I have concerns about a number of them with regard to governance, the crossover between staff, ownership, equity, salaries, money, and the potential - although everything may be great - for such companies then to win internal tenders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00800"><p>I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for a general comment on whether subsidiaries and joint ventures are common throughout the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B00900"><p>They are very common.  When we reported on the University of Limerick there were questions around subsidiaries.  We have been examining subsidiaries.  They are all required to operate to the code of practice for the governance of institutes of technology, or universities as the case may be.  The same standards and governance expectations apply.  I would prefer not to respond specifically to the report on CIT as I have not had an opportunity to study or examine it in detail.  We will be examining the implications and looking for similar concerns in other institutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01000"><p>As Deputy MacSharry has suggested, we will have to write to the HEA and ask for a report on each body under its remit and separately to the universities.  We may not need the same level of detail but we should at least get the corporate structure, the breakdown, and details of compliance with procedures in the legislation under which the college or university, as the case may be, was established.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01100"><p>Perhaps we should decide how we are going to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01200"><p>We will come back to it next week.</p></speech>

We will be better informed.</p></speech>

The Deputy can see what we are thinking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01500"><p>We should use this as the basis.  Let us do this right, and we can then follow through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01600"><p>I wish to indicate a particular interest in that.  I am usually at every meeting but I have a particular difficulty with the meeting on our return as it clashes with a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands.  I ask the Chair to consider that and to discuss this item when I am here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01700"><p>We will be happy to do that because if we send off correspondence in the meantime, we will still be waiting on the reply.  We have touched on the issue and we now know it is a broader issue.  We will come back to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#B01800"><p>I will point out that subsidiaries are all listed in the notes to the financial statements.  There is considerable information there.</p><p>The interest of the institution in the spin-out companies should also be noted.  There is an indication of the scale of operation available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00200"><p>No. 2170 is next from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the sums involved in potential claims or claims lodged in respect of an outbreak of tuberculosis within the Irish Prison Service.  The agency has not attached confidentiality clauses to any settlement.  Mr Breen states that the figures provided are commercially sensitive and requests that we do not publish them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00300"><p>We may not publish them, but an article dealing with the matter was published in a newspaper today.  When taken together with No. 2174, it is obvious that the State Claims Agency is indicating-----</p></speech>

No. 2174, dated 21 May, is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It provides information requested by the committee regarding the lessons for the Irish Prison Service to ensure issues as the outbreak of tuberculosis will be prevented.  We will discuss the two letters together as they deal with the same topic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00500"><p>The State Claims Agency seems to be taking a whole-of-prison approach.  It is welcome that it has indicated what are the lessons.  However, it was quite a sizeable outbreak.  It is a very serious illness and a very expensive lesson.  Large sums have been paid out in settlements.  Obviously, people suffered significant damage.  We should put this matter back to the appearance of representatives of the State Claims Agency before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00600"><p>They will appear before the committee.</p></speech>

We have set aside the issue of the contingent liability in regard to the HSE, but this is a significant issue, as is the matter in respect of the Air Corps.  We must examine further the role of the agency in pre-empting matters such as this and what other illnesses they are screening for in addition to looking at the lessons that can be drawn from this kind of experience.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C00800"><p>I agree with the Deputy.  I am concerned most by the letter from Mr. O'Driscoll on this issue.  It states that following the outbreak of tuberculosis in 2011 in the Irish Prison Service it was recognised that a whole-of-prison approach to TB control was required.  It further states that the tuberculosis management policy was completed on 3 January 2019.  It took eight years from the outbreak being notified in 2011 for the Department and the Prison Service to come out with a management policy for TB, which they only completed earlier this year.  That they were writing a policy eight years after the event shows there was no learning of sufficient quality in the intervening period.  That is utterly unacceptable and it leaves the State and the taxpayer wide open.  It is clear that the line Departments, such as the Department of Justice and Equality in this case, the HSE, the Air Corps and other agencies do not seem to learn but, rather, just pass the bill on to the State Claims Agency to be paid by the taxpayer.  That must be addressed when the agency representatives come before the committee.  The outbreak occurred in 2011 and a management policy for TB in the Prison Service was compiled eight years later.  That speaks volumes as to how seriously the Department took the matter.  We will note and publish that correspondence.  I agree with the points made by the Deputy.</p></speech>

We should follow up on how the State Claims Agency deals with that particular aspect because it must be wider than taking a whole-of-prison approach.</p></speech>

Earlier this year, a patient with TB was hospitalised in Galway in a way that exposed other patients.  The matter was covered in the media.  The same issue occurred again.  Several people contracted latent TB.  The matter is factual and has been documented.  The handling of the issue and the exposure to the disease left a lot to be desired.  Naturally, people are now seeking due redress through the legal process.  This occurred this year in a hospital.  There are policies on the ground, such as those referred to in regard to the Prison Service, but the operation of those policies is the next question.</p></speech>

Risk management must also be considered.  Prevention is better than cure.  We will take these matters up with the representatives of the State Claims Agency when they appear before the committee in five weeks to deal with its annual report.</p> <p>  No. 2173 is from Mr. Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner.  It is a request that the record be corrected in respect of a comment he made at our meeting with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 9 May.  We will note and publish this.</p></speech>

This is not a minor matter.  Obviously, the record of committee proceedings must be correct, but I am sure he was advised and he gave a categoric response as a consequence of that.  This is not without consequence for the individual in question.  I am not happy that correcting the record is sufficient in this case.  I would like to know who briefed and advised the Commissioner on this matter.  It is a serious stuff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#C01800"><p>I will not get into the details of the matter, but in order that people know what is under discussion, at the meeting Deputy Cullinane asked the Commissioner in respect of a particular case about which he had read in the media.  He asked:</p><blockquote>Does that mean the Garda has conducted an examination of the case?  Has Mr. Harris examined the claims made by the individual in question?</blockquote> <p>Mr. Harris responded, &quot;That is also the subject of a public complaint to GSOC.&quot;  In the correspondence, Mr. Harris clarifies that no public complaint has been made to GSOC.  As Deputy Murphy points out, it is right to correct the record, but we need to write to the Commissioner and seek an explanation of the circumstances in which incorrect information was given to the committee, such as what notes or briefing were given or where the gap was in the information.  As the Deputy stated, it is a serious issue.  That is the essence of her point.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p><p>We have dealt with No. 2174 from the Department and Equality in regard to tuberculosis.  We note and publish it.</p><p>No. 2175, dated 17 May 2019, is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  He provides a further update for the committee in respect of the property transfer from religious congregations and contributions towards the cost incurred by the State in responding to the residential institutional child abuse issue.  We will note and publish this.  Deputies may wish to comment on it.</p><p>We are making good progress, at long last.  This committee is driving this matter because Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is responding to us and meeting the congregation.  It has been 15 years but we will keep at it until the matter has concluded, as long as we are here.  I welcome the progress but it is long overdue.</p></speech>

It arose from this committee and the questions we asked.  It was brought to my attention by the story of Lenaboy, the former industrial school in Galway.  It has still not been finalised but Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is keeping his word and keeping us updated.  There was a narrative that St. Anne's, Lenaboy, was given as a gift to the city but it was given as part of the redress scheme.  Unfortunately, it remains empty.  It was given over, theoretically, in 2009 but because they held onto it for so long, I have no idea of what the cost of bringing it up to par will be.  What the council will get as redress has to be seriously questioned, as has the security issue.</p></speech>

On page 3 of the correspondence it states that there has been further dialogue with the congregation of Christian Brothers on the proposed transfer of playing fields.  That does not tell us anything, other than that the two sides are talking to each other.  We need to get details of when it is likely to come to a conclusion.  The cash contributions are incredibly important.  They go directly to Caranua, which is there to assist people who have been damaged in these institutions.  Some &euro;6.4 million in cash contributions is required to achieve the maximum amount of &euro;110 million, which is set down in statute.  Some of it will come in as a consequence of these transactions but the speed at which they come is an issue.  We are not here to supervise the Department of Education and Skills as it is not our function, but that is essentially what we are doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#D00400"><p>That is correct.  It is an example of members' commitment to their public duty that they want to see this matter through.  We could have easily declined to insist on quarterly reports and allowed the matter to just hang there.  We will publish the letter.  There have been improvements in a number of areas.  The Christian Brothers have recently contributed &euro;2 million but they still owe &euro;6.4 million to bring the balance up and Caranua is waiting for that cash, which we are told will come in the months after the sale of the lands in Clonkeen, Dublin.  It is all contingent on that.  It is a progress report and we will keep at it by asking Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to use the Committee of Public Accounts in his negotiations with the various organisations.  He is under pressure to bring the matter to a conclusion.  We should not have to supervise this and some might say it is not within our remit but we are happy to do it anyway, in the interests of the public.</p> <p>  The next item is from from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, dated 10 May 2019, providing information requested by the committee on proposed legislation regarding the court poor box.  A reparation fund is to be established which will be used to provide additional funding for services for victims of crimes and compensation payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Moneys must be paid to the reparation fund unless provided for by law.  There was a practice that a judge could direct a defendant to make a contribution to a third party charity or organisation but it all has to go through the reparation fund, other than compensation as directed by a judge under the legislation.  That is good to hear.</p> <p>  The next item is from Ms Mary Donohoe, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, dated 22 May 2019 providing follow-up information requested by the committee relating to 12 items.  It is very thorough correspondence and it is good to put it on the public record.  I will highlight some key points, while other members may want to make additional points.  We asked about the EPA data relating to testing water supplies for illicit or illegal drugs.  The agency confirms there is an issue but nothing on the scale of London or Amsterdam because we do not source most of our water from rivers in the cities.  The vast majority of urban wastewater discharges are located in coastal or estuary areas, with none of it located downstream from any of these plants.  The agency is doing a study on it but it will be nothing like on the scale we have seen in other European cities.  There is a detailed report on landfill sites licensed by the EPA, unlicensed sites, historical land sites, private landfills, illegal landfills and a lot of great information that will be of interest to people.  There is a lot of information on the radon strategy and details of costs that we had requested and there is information on the river basin catchment areas.</p> <p>  The EPA also gives information on the emissions trading scheme, which is interesting.  It states that overall emissions of greenhouse gases from Irish power generation and industrial companies in the EU decreased by 4.8% in 2017 and a further 8% in 2018.  The decrease in emissions is due to a significant drop in power generation emissions of 13.9% as a result of the ESB Moneypoint coal-fired plant being offline.  That happened by accident and the EPA is taking credit for the place being closed but it is a fact that emissions are down.  Conversely, greenhouse gas emissions from the main industrial sources increased in 2018 from 2017, with the cement industry recording a 4.7% increase, dairy a 3.6% increase and the pharmagen industry an 8.8% increase.  The EPA states that this is on account of economic growth and that a wide group of industries contributed to the increase.  Emissions from aviation showed a 6.8% increase in 2018, arising from flights in and out of Ireland but also flights anywhere in the EU where the aircraft carrier has an operating licence from the Irish Aviation Authority, including Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  It means that emissions from Ryanair flights across Europe are booked in Ireland so it is important that people understand it is not all as simple as it seems.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#D00600"><p>That is why I am putting it on the public record.  The public might not appreciate the significant nuances around this.  We also asked about enforcement.  Up to 2018, all operators were fully compliant with their obligations but in 2018, two operators failed to comply with their obligations to surrender emissions trading allowances to cover their emissions for 2017.  The two operators were St. James's Hospital and Vodafone.  The EPA proceeded with enforcement action under EU regulations which resulted in a penalty for St. James's Hospital of &euro;210,000 and the agency is working with St. James's Hospital on a payment plan.  It is extraordinary that our health services are involved in non-compliance with EU emissions trading regulations.  The penalty for Vodafone was &euro;51,000, which has been paid in full.</p> <p>  The final point was on a question I asked about whether people applying for planning permission had to apply for a waste licence first.</p><p>It says that people can do either but the EPA is required in cases involving an environment impact assessment or an environmental impact assessment report to ensure that the grant of planning permission has been made before they grant the licence.  We will note and publish that comprehensive reply and I thank the EPA.  It is an example of an organisation which comes before the committee with good information and which comes back with a comprehensive reply when asked for information.  We would like all other State organisations to follow suit and to do so in a timely manner, as the EPA has done.  We will note and publish that.  </p><p> No. 2185 B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 22 May 2019, provides comparative information requested by the committee regarding the cost of accommodating individuals in direct provision centres and in nursing homes under the fair deal scheme.  We will note and publish this.  It relates to how much money someone residing in a nursing home can retain for personal use and a comparison with how much a person living in direct provision has for personal use.  I think it is approximately &euro;30 in both cases.  </p><p> No. 2186 B is from Mr. Mark O'Mahony, commissioner, the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 22 May 2019, provides clarification requested by the committee in relation to the bimonthly progress update which we considered at our last meeting on 16 May 2019.  I did not understand its contents.  The commission is saying that when it came before the committee last year, the number of cases on hand had a total quantum of &euro;1.7 billion.  I emphasise, that is not necessarily &euro;1.7 billion due in tax, some of it might have been paid and there might be refunds due.  Cases with a value of &euro;2.1 billion were lodged with the Tax Appeals Commission in the last week of December last year, which means it now has &euro;3.7 billion worth of cases on their books.  That is a phenomenal figure.  Two of the big ones have &euro;1.6 billion are before the courts so the commission is precluded from dealing with them until those cases have concluded.  It is an example of the complex cases arising in the commission.  We will note and publish that letter and it is good to get clarification.  </p><p> No. 2188 B is from Ms Dee Forbes, director general, RT&Eacute;, dated 24 May 2019, in response to our request for further information regarding the review of employment contracts.  Ms Forbes reiterates that the review of the 433 contractors providing services to RT&Eacute; concluded that the majority of those reviewed were appropriately engaged and classified as freelancers or contractors.  It also concluded that the cases of 157 individuals were in need of further review.  Ms Forbes advises that RT&Eacute; has commenced discussions with individual contractors and that this process will continue into the second half of 2019.  She states that RT&Eacute; cannot accept that anybody should be described as being on a "bogus self-employment" contract - a remark to that effect might have been made - and that RT&Eacute; has at all times acted in good faith with respect to this matter.  We will continue to monitor this issue and will request a further update at the end of July.</p></speech>

In other words, there is a question of whether the decision will be backdated, because there will be issues arising with pensions and so on.  We should seek clarification on that.</p></speech>

Our position is this is a policy area and an ongoing project.  No. 2171 C from an individual dated 15 May 2019 also requests the committee to undertake a detailed scrutiny of the proposed BusConnects project.  I propose we forward these items to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for whatever action it deems appropriate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2167 C from an individual dated 13 May 2019 relates to decisions related to a tourism project made by Cork County Council.  The correspondence is addressed to Cork county councillors and while the individual seems to be requesting that the Committee of Public Accounts reviews an alleged loss of public money, the local authority matters raised are not with the remit of the committee.  We will advise to the correspondent that the matter could be brought to the attention of the local authority audit service and note the item.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2169 C is from the clerk to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, dated 14 May 2019 advising the committee that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the Public Service Performance Report 2018.  We note this item.  The report has already been published.  We have seen copies of that report in recent weeks.</p> <p>  No. 2172 C from Professor Kerstin Mey, vice president, academic affairs and student engagement, University of Limerick, dated 30 April 2019 providing information requested by me as Chairman regarding grade recheck and grade appeal processes.  It was a matter I raised on behalf of a constituent and which arose out of our meeting on the regrading in the University of Limerick.  I propose we note the item and write to the correspondent that the information supplied by the university is all we have been able to extract.  It goes back to 2011 and there is no mechanism to regrade those exam papers at this stage.  </p> <p>  No. 2182 C is from an individual dated 17 May 2019 in relation to an alternative site for the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We will take that correspondence on board when we do our periodic report on that matter and note the item.</p> <p>  No. 2184 C is from Deputy David Cullinane dated 20 May 2019 in relation to Commissioner Harris&rsquo;s evidence to the committee regarding a particular case within an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As mentioned earlier, the Commissioner has corrected the record and we note that.  As we already have dealt with that particular issue, we will ask the secretariat to let the Deputy know we have dealt with it.</p> <p>  No 2177 C is from Mr. Allen Morgan, dated 16 May 2019 inquiring about his attendance at a private meeting of the committee in relation to the management of State-owned property by the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We had previously advised that this item is on our work programme but due to other pressing business, we have not been in a position to schedule a meeting.  He wrote following the committee's discussion of the Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street.  We discussed that and other matters relating to the OPW in detail.  We have written our periodic report and made our conclusions on the matter.  Mr. Morgan has information on other projects, including Thornton Hall and the property in Fairgreen in Galway, Nos. 91 to 93 Merrion Square, a Mullingar site and Batty Langley Lodge, in relation to overspending.  That goes back over a long period.  He is asking if we will invite him into a meeting and to conclude one way or another as he has other things to move on to.  We can thank him for his input.  We have taken everything he said on board and have considered it as part of our periodic report.  We will return to the OPW again in the autumn.  The information he supplied will help us in our work when we return to the OPW on the next occasion.  I do not think that there is time between now and the recess for a meeting on this issue.  He has asked us to let him know if we are not proceeding and I think we should.  That is my suggestion.</p></speech>

This man has made considerable effort to inform us.  He has gone to great trouble and gone out on a limb.  That is important.  He is asking us to make a quick decision which is difficult for us in our work programme.  He did ask to meet us and I believe we did agree to do so in theory.  Perhaps I am wrong.  The issues he is raising are not merely historic.  He is raising processes and he is also talking about the inadequate, according to him, financial model under which the Office of Public Work operates.  I am no expert.  I can only read it and note the concerns.  I will be guided by the committee but we should listen to him and take it from there.</p></speech>

We have gone through an awful lot in relation to the OPW, I understand that, but as Deputy Connolly noted, there are issues involved which are ongoing.  If the modelling by which the OPW does its work continues, it could have similar problems into the future.  That is a real issue and concern.  There must be some forum on this.  Much work was done.</p><p>He is raising valid issues and I would hate to be left in a situation in years to come whereby, because of what he is raising and the modelling not changing, further issues arise.  Given the volume of effort he has made - he has gone out on a limb - there has to be some process by which we at least give him an outlet to air the matter.  Then we can make decisions and move on, or not.</p></speech>

We will check that directly with him.  If his preference is to have a private meeting, we will have it some afternoon.  There will be some afternoon when we will be finished to 3.30 p.m. or some such time.</p></speech>

There is no point in meeting and not doing anything about it afterwards.  We have to timetable in such a way that we meet the individual and then follow up, but we need to know what the follow-up is likely to be.  Could we get any correspondence we have on this in advance of the meeting?  There are matters concerning the OPW in regard to some of the work, for example, on historical buildings where the contingency is set at a certain level.  The position is not realistic.  It is very hard to see how a Department can budget for works if there are flaws.  There are a number of issues that merit full understanding, not just a meeting for us to gain an understanding.  It is a matter of our gaining an understanding in order to do something.  That is what we have got to decide.</p></speech>

Will we contact Mr. Morgan directly with a view to setting up a meeting?  It will be on a Thursday afternoon.  We can determine whether he wants a public or private meeting.  It he wants a private meeting, we will go private.  If he wants a public meeting, we will have it in public.  It will be on a Thursday afternoon.  That would probably be the best.</p></speech>

If there are ten of us or three of us, the meeting can proceed.  That is why I am suggesting a Thursday.  I thank Mr. Morgan for his continued communication with the committee on this issue.  Obviously, he has a lot of experience.</p><p>The next correspondence is No. 2178 C, from the European Lotto Betting Association, which is requesting a meeting with the committee.  This matter is not within our remit.  The licence was issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Perhaps it is a justice issue.  I believe it is about gambling.  We will write back.  It is certainly not within our remit to hear the association's views.  It has probably written to every Deputy and its representatives are probably meeting Deputies individually.  We will let them proceed as they are doing on that matter.</p><p>No. 2180C is from Deputy Niall Collins on behalf of an individual.  It concerns a donation to the Irish Cancer Society in Kerry.  This matter is not within the remit of the committee and I propose that we advise the Deputy accordingly.</p><p><b></b>No. 2189C, from Ms Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is a response to a request from the committee on foot of correspondence from an individual alleging a waste of public moneys by the authority.  The authority provides a comprehensive response to the remarks.  I propose to send the response to the correspondent.  It concerns the production of CDs for the visually impaired.  We dealt with this previously.</p><p>The final correspondence, No. 2151B, will take a few minutes to deal with but I want to try to clear the decks on it.  We will move fairly quickly.  It is the minute from the Minister for Finance.  It concerns our periodic report for the May-July period.  We can move quite quickly on this.  It would be remiss of us, in view of the time, our issuing of our report and the time it took the Department of Finance to report back to us, not to move expeditiously.  Members need not take out the previous report.  It had 29 recommendations, I believe.  I will make a fleeting reference to those we need to think about and then make an observation.</p><p>The first recommendation was for the Department of Finance and concerned a target for presenting the annual financial statements by all organisations.  The recommendation is accepted and the Department will draft a new circular, which will be incorporated.</p><p>The next recommendation is that Departments should ensure circulars are fully complied with.  That is in regard to the timeline for accounts.  The first recommendation concerned presenting for audit and the second concerned laying before the Oireachtas after audit.  It is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation was to the Higher Education Authority to ensure boards or bodies under its remit have the range of competencies necessary to carry out their functions.  We mentioned the finance area.  The recommendation is accepted by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Education and Skills.  The boards are now being requested to ensure they have a balance of skills and experience.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, it is a requirement that the boards agree with the HSE the competence required of external board members.  That is important and that is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation states, &quot;The Committee recommends that where a public body is not totally satisfied that it can conduct an internal investigation objectively, it should recuse itself or, in the case of a protected disclosure, use the services available under the Office of Government Procurement's Framework Agreement for the Receipt and Investigation of Protected Disclosures.&quot;  That is accepted.  The framework is in place.  It is a multi-sector framework.  The recommendation is accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform consider measures to prevent unnecessary expenditure resulting from public bodies competing against each other in the purchase of buildings.  That happened in Cork in respect of two institutions.  The Department has noted the recommendation.  It is stated each organisation has a right to bid for a property if it comes on the market but the officials are saying they are trying to co-ordinate.  They see the merit but cannot prevent organisations from looking at property.</p></speech>

Part of this process is that we do not necessarily accept or agree with every response we get from the Minister.  That is his response and it is not as strong as we would have liked.  He says he is captured by the legislation and cannot prevent them, but we are saying some mechanism is required in the Department for a level of liaison.  It is about protecting taxpayers' money.  We will draft a letter accordingly.  We might have one or two more observations.</p></speech>

In Galway, the Corrib Great Southern Hotel is owned by the State.  Beside it is the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, which is struggling for accommodation.  The State sells the hotel and it ends up in liquidation.  It is in private hands again and the State is seeking to buy it back.  They are beside each other.  It could not be a more acute picture of idiocy and madness.  The hotel remains empty to this day.  It was owned by the State and is located beside an institution that is struggling.  Is it not a bigger issue regarding acquiring public buildings and Departments talking to each other?  The hotel should not have been sold in the first instance.  It should have been acquired by the Department of Education and Skills.  This is happening throughout the country.</p></speech>

In every town and city in Ireland there are various approved housing bodies funded by the State competing with each other to buy sites so they can build their houses and units.  They are driving up the prices.  It is happening everywhere now.  Approved housing bodies and local authorities are often competing against each other.  I saw it happen recently.  That is a big point to which we will return.  What we have touched on is the tip of the iceberg.  That is all we can say at present.  We can come back to it.  We will draft a response to that particular recommendation.</p><p>The next recommendation is: &quot;There is a lack of transparency in relation to the companies which have an association with the Higher Education Institutes.&quot;  It states the Comptroller and Auditor General has access to accounts and financial statements and the Minister is aware of all the reports.  Our earlier discussion dealt with that point and we will follow it up on that basis.</p><p>The next item is a recommendation relating to the Office of Government Procurement &quot;to ensure that they have the necessary controls in place to allow themselves sufficient time to develop specifications ...&quot;.  This followed the roll-over of an ICT contract in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was caught as it did not have time.  The Minister accepts what we said.  The next recommendation is on the same point.  There is the broader issue and the specific issue.  It states that the Department of Justice and Equality is informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the recommendation is accepted.  It also states that in 2019 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na initiated a planned update of the Garda procurement guidelines and will run training courses on this.  It states it is also governed by future planning in &quot;A Policing Service for the Future&quot; and these issues are included in it.  We note that.</p><p>The next recommendation was on prepayments and procurement guidelines.  That involved making advance payments where there are ICT contracts.  We are told it is the industry norm but there can be a risk to the taxpayer.  The financial status of the companies should be checked.  The Department accepts the recommendation.  We will keep an eye on that.</p><p>The next recommendation was that &quot;the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform uses a more nuanced approach to recruitment expenditure planning to ensure that initial headline savings do not result in additional costs in the long term&quot;.  We are saying that due to the public sector employment embargo there is a lack of skilled resources in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department notes that recommendation.  It likes it, but it is subject to Exchequer pay ceilings.  That is probably the answer we expected.</p><p>In Recommendation A.11 the committee &quot;recommends that the Commissioner takes the necessary steps to ensure that the governance structures and systems in place within AGS are understood by all and supported at the highest levels&quot;.  This is accepted and the recommendation will be taken forward as part of the Policing and Community Safety Bill, replacing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  That will come before the Oireachtas in due course.</p><p>The next recommendation is important.  People will be interested in the fair deal issue.  We had an issue regarding the nursing homes and we had asked if there was value for money.  The Department of Health commenced a value for money report.  It has noted our Recommendation A.12.  A number of the recommendations flow together.  It states that the Department of Health is currently undertaking a value for money review of nursing home care costs - a comparison of private and public sector care costs.  Members will be surprised to hear the following:</p><blockquote>A number of critical technical issues has arisen which has delayed the work of the Steering Committee and Review Committee.  Following legal advice the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) was not in a position to provide the detailed data requested by the Department, given data protection concerns.  Subsequent to this, the Department's legal advisors and the NTPF's legal team agreed an approach that would allow the provision of high level aggregated data, consistent with legal obligations.</blockquote> <p>Clearly, the information that is required to examine the value for money is within a State organisation but data protection is preventing the National Treatment Purchase Fund giving granular information to the Department team to provide a good report and recommendations.  This is dreadful.</p><p>It goes on to say that the most cited reason for cost differential is that public nursing homes have a much greater cohort of high dependence residents.  The Department will do a sample to determine if the resources provided are aligned with care needs.  It will only do a sample.  Then it says that this will extend the timeline further.  It will take time to complete the value for money report, &quot;but without this data the VFM Review would have to rely on hypotheses to explain a significant element of the cost differential.  To proceed without the data may have significantly undermined any conclusions and/or findings reached by the VFM&quot;.  Essentially, it is saying that this is being said but it has no evidence to support that hearsay.  Despite what has been said by successive Ministers about the higher dependency it is saying it has no data or evidence anywhere to support that statement.  It is what everybody thinks, but one cannot do a report on that basis.</p><p>It states that due to the body of work required to acquire sufficient data, a revised completion date at the end of 2019 is now proposed.  However, it is already acknowledging that it will not have the necessary granular data to carry out a detailed report due to the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am putting this on the public record because many people are asking when we will get the report on this issue.  Many self-employed people who have assets want to see this report.</p></speech>

I ask the Members of the Oireachtas to follow up on this matter through mechanisms other than this committee because we will be told it is not the business of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is, because it affects costs.  I outlined it to put it on the record.  That was the value for money report.  We also spoke about a separate report.  The committee recommended that the National Treatment Purchase Fund review its pricing mechanism.  This response to the committee was probably drafted several weeks ago but it states that the NTPF is now close to completing the report and aims to discuss the draft report in the early part of this year.  Once complete, the report of the review will then be submitted to the Department for consideration and for publication later in 2019.</p> <p>  There are two different reports.  One is the value for money report and the other is the pricing report.  We have seen neither yet and members can see some of the complications.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund review of its pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private voluntary nursing homes is ongoing.</p><p>That was one of the committee's recommendations last autumn and the Department is now saying that report is almost concluded.  The pricing report, how much the nursing home has been paid, is a different issue from the value of money between public and private.  It appears to me there are two, separate and independent mechanisms.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Chairman is familiar with the single assessment tool which the HSE uses for home care assessment.  It was run as a pilot project.  It takes at least two to three hours to administer it through a questionnaire from a computer.  One's dependency is being assessed on a computer with a single assessment tool.  It is time consuming.  I am only giving an example and I know I am discussing minutiae here.  The HSE is delaying things.  The HSE is meeting people and doing a single assessment tool assessment on them with a computer and a standardised questionnaire.</p> <p>  Clinical judgment, whereby a doctor and a nurse will say a patient needs this or that, seems to have gone out the window.  We are back to a computer and special assessment tool.  I can give two specific examples of results from that process for people who were looking for home care in Galway.  One person was in their early 60s and suffered from early-onset dementia and has qualified for ten hours' home help as a result of that single assessment tool.  </p> <p>  I have lost the Chairman's attention and I understand that.  I am talking about minutiae but it is difficult to look at that single assessment tool because it raises all sorts of other issues as to what is happening with our health system and our approach to looking after our people.  I would not like a member of my family or a colleague to be assessed by a computer using that single assessment tool.  I would like to rely on somebody's clinical judgment and expertise as a nurse or doctor.  That is a separate point and is impertinent of me.</p></speech>

I am aware of organisations that are struggling with the obligations imposed on them by GDPR and finding the correct approach to take.  It has certainly made administration of personal data much more complicated and there is a higher risk for organisations.  I cannot comment on specifics because I have not looked at the nature of the data they are looking for and, obviously, it would be for the Data Protection Commissioner to issue a judgment on a matter such as that.</p> <p>  To complicate matters further, I have said previously that I am doing a special report on the costs of nursing home care.  I am expecting to put a draft to the relevant organisations shortly and I aim to finish it over the summer.  There may be a plethora of reports in this area.</p> <p>  It is complicated and I am trying to create a framework into which all of these individual pieces will fit so that there is a structure that will help to approach the issues that are raised.

We will say that is moving.  Many people are inquiring about that value for money report and it is useful to put out information when we have it.</p> <p>  The next recommendation was that the HSE take steps to develop a protocol to ensure that all residents of nursing homes can avail of medical services when residing in nursing homes.  That recommendation is noted.  This is about the issue of transport to appointments and the Department of Health states that there is no statutory requirement on the HSE to provide transport.  It provides some ambulance services on a discretionary basis.  It is not a core health service and is not covered by the basket of services in the medical card or the nursing home support scheme.  The Department also goes on to state that the nursing home support scheme covers some living expenses.  Residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home.  In recognition of this, anybody in receipt of financial support can retain 20% of their income.  The Department is actually saying that, if a patient needs transport to a medical appointment, he or she can use that 20%.  That is dreadful but it is what the Department says.</p> <p>  The next recommendation was that the Government develops a clear, multi-annual plan to meet the commitment to contribute 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development assistance by 2030.  This is accepted by the Government and there is a plan in place to do all that.</p> <p>  The next item relates to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is about passports and the difficulties the Department had last year.  We asked the Department to publicise the fact that passport renewal application is the fastest way of doing it.  The Department accepts this recommendation and, in line with our recommendation, it has been extremely active in publicising this.  I think the Department appreciated the input from Members of the Oireachtas on the passport service when we had Department representatives before the committee early last summer.  That is good.  </p> <p>  There was a further recommendation that the Department hire more staff for this year.  It accepts that recommendation and says additional full-time staff have already been recruited and the Department will continue to monitor operational requirements.  We will see how this year goes.  It has not reached the deluge yet.</p> <p>  The next item is the recommendation that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade values the rental and leasing of property abroad versus purchasing of same.  It accepts the recommendation.  It will continue to do that and will continue, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to examine the benefits of each in order to decide which is most suitable.  That is fair enough.</p> <p>  The next item is the international election observation roster.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts the recommendation to have the necessary procedures in place to establish a panel in adequate time.  The Department will, in 2019, undertake a review of the operation including the optimal panel duration.  The Department has said it is actually acting on that.</p> <p>  The next item brings us to the Department of Finance.  We mentioned the Tax Appeals Commission earlier.  This recommendation is that adequate, evidence-based planning takes place in advance of the establishment of any new public body.  The point is, essentially, that the Tax Appeals Commission was set up without a proper plan and without knowing the extent of its workforce.  The Department looked at the number of appeals that were there but, when a new office is set up, it attracts appeals.  I do not think that was taken into account.  The Department accepts the point and, in future, bodies will take it into account.  The committee's point is well made.</p> <p>  The next one was the workload and operations review of the Tax Appeals Commission and that its recommendations are implemented on a timely basis.  That recommendation is accepted and the Department and Tax Appeals Commission are in frequent contact, as mentioned earlier in correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is the amount of tax under appeal at any time and that the committee recommends measurable targets be set for the Tax Appeals Commission.  That is accepted by the Tax Appeals Commission and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and they are working on the procurement of a new IT system to help facilitate the management of cases.</p> <p>  The next item is about outstanding taxes and is a recommendation to the Minister for Finance.  The committee recommends that Revenue reviews its approach to the collection of outstanding taxes with a view to identifying initiatives such as increasing the number of taxpayers in phased payment method arrangements in order to accelerate the receipt of collectable taxes.  Revenue accepts this and says that it has updated statistics.  It has improved and a new debt management service application was due to commence last month.  I am hoping that will prove beneficial.</p> <p>  The next item is about cases of tax defaulters that are published.  It became very clear to us, to remind people, that 289 tax settlements, totalling &euro;53 million were published in 2017 and 91, which is 30%, had unpaid amounts of &euro;25 million.</p><p>In other words, when they publish the tax defaulters showing the amount due, does it show whether it was ever collected or not? The committee recommends that in addition to publishing the tax settlement amounts, Revenue would consider publishing details of the amounts subsequently paid and outstanding balances and it does not accept this.  This is an issue on which people may have a view.  The Department accepts that Revenue is very strict but that legislation does not provide for this measure specifically and if it is to be done, it requires legislation.  If legislation is to be changed then all aspects must be taken into account such as taxpayer confidentiality, the balance of the good versus the bad and the fairness of it.  I believe that as we have already agreed in legislation to publish the person's name and the amount, it would not be a major step to publish the same person's name, the original amount and the amount ultimately collected.  That could be an amendment to the Finance Bill if anybody wants one.  It is a legislative matter.</p></speech>

I will think about it, seeing as I raised it.</p> <p>  Ireland's national debt stood at approximately &euro;198.7 billion at the end of 2017.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-30a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019053000002#J01000"><p>When one takes personal debt into account, Ireland is next to Japan in the world figures.</p> <p>  I will now turn to recommendation A.26.  The committee recommended that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, publishes a list of housing completions on at least a quarterly basis.  The idea is that the statistical information gathering is not last century but is prior to the last century.  The Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform is informed that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which is part of the NTMA, accepts the recommendation.  It has published housing completions for the year end 2018 and a report was published in February.</p> <p>  The committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance to public bodies to ensure the short-term benefits of leasing of properties are not given undue emphasis when compared with those that outright acquisition may offer.  Again, this recommendation is noted and the Department gives the various factors it takes into account in that regard.  The committee will keep that matter under consideration.</p> <p>  The committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform carries out a review of public bodies whose claims are not managed by the State Claims Agency, with a view to extending the remit of the State Claims Agency to such bodies.  The response says that the committee will be aware that it is a matter for the relevant Minister to consider which agencies will come in under that.  The Department does not comment "Yes" or "No".  It says that it is a matter for each Minister.  The committee approached this due to what came to light during our report, which is that all the voluntary hospitals and section 38 organisations - that receive some &euro;4 billion in taxpayers' money - come in under the State Claims Agency.  The committee had pointed out that local authorities are similar in their scale of activity and we asked why they do not also come in under the State Claims Agency in order to have one management structure for all the claims.  We are aware that Irish Public Bodies Insurance is the body the county councils have set among themselves to monitor those claims.  There is, however, very little public transparency in that regard.  It is a private company.  The freedom of information issue has been before the courts.  The committee will come back to this issue because there is a lack of transparency for the public on that.  We can revisit this recommendation again when representatives of the State Claims Agency are before the committee.</p> <p>  The Committee recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Development Finance Agency should carry out a review of the impact of significant events, such as the collapse of Carillion, on public private partnerships, in order to document what lessons can be learned.  The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform accepts this recommendation.  In addition, the response says that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs an interdepartmental steering committee on public private partnership, PPP, projects and that the building of the schools will go ahead.  The public private partnership issue is on the agenda of this committee and we have taken the decision that we can never sign off on any Department accounts in which there is a significant PPP contract because if we do not get the information, we cannot have sight of what it is we are discussing and we cannot express an opinion on whether the contract is good, bad or indifferent with regard to value for money.  When a contract has been signed and is up and running, such as with the motorways, then commercial confidentiality has to cease after a certain period of time.  It cannot continue for the 25 years to the end of the project.  That is an issue we will come back to.</p> <p>  I wanted to get it off those items off the agenda for now.  It is a big item of correspondence.  Is there any other business before we suspend today to allow or witnesses to come in?</p> <p>  On statements and accounts received since the last meeting, we note the clear audited opinion of the Western Development Commission.</p></speech>

It goes back to when the committee took a position on the establishment of a committee of inspection for the liquidation.  To date that has been, effectively, ignored by the Department of Finance.  I accept that people may not have had time to read it yet, and while it was commissioned by a third party, Professor Gurdgiev's report very much supports that proposal.  The report indicates that without such a committee of inspection, it is not possible for us to really be sure of value for money in that process.  The periodic report is as per other periodic reports.  One is heading for &euro;306 million in expenditure in this regard.  The level of transparency around the liquidation would not be remotely like that for a standard liquidation.  There is an awful lot of stuff that is not there at all.  Professor Gurdgiev's report makes recommendations and suggestions on how we might go about that, which is very much in keeping with our own position on this over the past couple of years.</p><p>We could usefully do the State some service by inviting Professor Constantin Gurdgiev to come in here and tease out some of his proposals and hope that the Department of Finance, which has not acted heretofore to establish a committee of inspection to give the appropriate oversight to this liquidation, may yet do so. </p><p>   There is an ongoing case where the applicant is just seeking the same thing we are and the State is defending the case.  I am sure we will raise the issue with departmental officials when they come in.  We came across correspondence, which I shared, where the Office of the Chief State Solicitor offered the Committee of Public Accounts an olive branch, apart from that.  One of my questions when the officials come in is: how much money has been spent so far on defending the case?  Why can heads not be cracked together, make the appropriate improvements, get rid of this unnecessary case that is before the courts and give the public the level of oversight that they require?  This is the most expensive liquidation in the history of the State and is probably comparable with the largest in Europe, and oversight is non-existent.</p></speech>

Given the cost that the public have paid for the liquidation of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, there is a public obligation to make sure that we have some oversight of the assets that were liquidated.  It would be helpful to have these experts before the committee.  I support the idea that there should have been a committee of inspection.  The problem is that while this court case delays oversight, the liquidations are continuing and it will become almost a moot point if we do not have some change at this stage.  This would be a very helpful way to move it on.  I concur that this should not be playing out in the courts and that the Committee of Public Accounts should routinely have oversight.</p></speech>

In addition the financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, are presented in full as part 2 of the finance accounts.  The accounts for 2017 were certified by me on 28 June 2018.  I can inform the committee that the accounts for 2018 are expected to be certified in or around the same timeframe this year.</p> <p>  Chapter 1 of my report on the accounts of the public services is designed to summarise the transactions on the Central Fund recorded in the finance accounts in a more accessible format and to highlight relevant trends in such transactions.  In addition, because the finance accounts do not include any kind of statement of financial position, the chapter provides an overview of key Exchequer assets and liabilities at the year end.  Exchequer receipts in 2017 totalled &euro;58.4 billion, representing an increase of &euro;3.3 billion, or 6%, compared with 2016.  Issues from the Central Fund in 2017 amounted to &euro;56.5 billion, which was a year-on-year increase of &euro;395 million, or just under 1%.  The surplus of receipts relative to issues for the year was &euro;1.9 billion.  The gross national debt stood at just under &euro;199 billion at the end of 2017.  This was marginally higher than at the end of 2016.  The cost of servicing the national debt fell from &euro;6.8 billion in 2016 to &euro;6.2 billion in 2017.  That was a drop of 9% year on year.  This reflects the impact of the refinancing of debt by the National Treasury Management Agency.</p> <p>  Members may wish to note that in 2017 the Department of Finance commenced publication of an annual report on public debt in Ireland.  This provides useful information and commentary on the composition and evolution of Irish Government debt, on measures of debt sustainability, and on progress towards achievement of debt targets.  As a consequence, I have reduced my own reporting on the public debt, which was intended to address the previous information gap.</p> <p>  Turning to the special report, in addition to many other responsibilities, the Department of Finance represents Ireland&rsquo;s interest in the EU budgetary process and EU policy formulation.  Schedules to the finance accounts show payments from the Exchequer to the EU and receipts into the Exchequer from the EU.  However, this is only a partial view of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions from the EU, which flow through many sets of financial statements.  In fact, there is no single source that gives a complete overview of such transactions.  Against the background of Brexit, negotiations for a new EU multi-annual financial framework and European Parliament elections, I felt it might be useful to provide such an overview.  This resulted in the special report before the committee today.</p> <p>  As the figure which can now be brought on screen indicates, financially Ireland was a net beneficiary of the EU up to 2014.  Since then, Ireland has received marginally less than it has contributed.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU budget is linked substantially to Ireland&rsquo;s economic activity levels, with elements related to VAT collected, customs duties imposed in Ireland, and gross national income levels.  The Irish contribution in 2017 totalled &euro;2 billion.  The Department of Finance has projected that the contribution is likely to increase significantly in future years.  Ireland received a total of &euro;1.8 billion in EU funding in 2017.  Over 80% of the amount received was in respect of agriculture and rural development.  As members are aware, this funding makes a significant contribution to the viability of farming in Ireland.  Approximately 90% of EU funding received in 2017 was administered through central government Departments.  The remaining 10% went directly from the EU to public bodies, bodies in the private sector in Ireland or was spent on EU bodies operating in Ireland.  I recommended that there should be annual reporting on a consolidated basis of Ireland&rsquo;s EU transactions, but the Accounting Officer was not convinced of the need for this.</p> <p>  The 2017 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records gross expenditure of &euro;34 million.  There was a net underspend of &euro;7.2 million, relative to the Estimate, which was for surrender at the year end.  The appropriation account presents expenditure under three expenditure programmes.  These relate to the costs incurred in 2017 in respect of economic and fiscal policy, on which the Department spent &euro;18.9 million, banking and financial services policy, on which the Department spent &euro;8.1 million, and provision of shared services, on which the Department spent &euro;7.1 million.</p><p>The expenditure on banking and financial services policy recorded in the appropriation account does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.</p><p> The Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 requires me to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann each year with respect to the correctness of the sums brought to account by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Chapter 22 is my report for 2017.  I gave a clear audit opinion on the council&rsquo;s financial statements for 2017 when it incurred expenditure of &euro;607,000.</p></speech>

The items on today&rsquo;s agenda are chapters 1 and 22 from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2017, the appropriation accounts 2017 - Vote 7, the finance accounts 2017, and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.</p> <p>  The Estimate for the Department of Finance for 2017 was set at &euro;40.8 million, that is, &euro;39.5 million net of appropriations-in-aid available and the capital carryover of &euro;200,000.  The net outturn for 2017 was &euro;32.5 million, leaving a surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;7.2 million.  This surplus arose for a number of reasons.  Recruitment did not progress at the pace anticipated, resulting in a pay bill underspend of approximately &euro;600,000.  The 2017 pay bill estimate was based on a headcount of 329 staff and, by comparison, the average number of staff during 2017 was 307.  At the end of 2017, staff numbers stood at 310.  Some &euro;2.8 million of underspend occurred on non-pay administration expenses, &euro;2.2 million of which was due to capital projects not proceeding during the year.  There was also an underspend of approximately &euro;3.6 million on programme related costs arising from lower legal and consultancy costs of &euro;3 million during the year, mainly in regard to the shareholding and financial advisory division of the Department, savings of &euro;500,000 in regard to the disabled drivers fuel grant scheme, given a total of 13,321 claimants received an average grant of &euro;704 in 2017, and some &euro;93,000 that was returned to the Exchequer relating to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  We remain committed to seeking to minimise costs where possible, subject to achieving the best outturn for the State.</p> <p>  In terms of the Exchequer financial outturn, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the following key points.  Tax revenues for 2017, at &euro;50.7 billion, were up &euro;2.9 billion, or 6%, year on year and &euro;100 million, or 0.2%, above profile.  In regard to income tax, which is the largest tax head, the performance in 2017 was solid, with receipts finishing the year 1.2%, or &euro;236 million, below profile.  However, this represents an annual increase of 4.4%, or &euro;840 million.  Corporation tax receipts in 2017 of &euro;8.2 billion were &euro;500 million, or 6.3%, above the budget forecast for that year.  VAT returns saw a strong 7.1% annual increase in 2017 and were broadly in line with profile in that they were under by 0.5%, or &euro;72 million.  Total VAT collected during 2017 was &euro;13.3 billion.  The major consumption tax heading, excises, was just below profile by 1%, or &euro;60 million, and &euro;5.9 billion was collected.  This represented a 3.7%, or &euro;214 million, year-on-year increase.  On the expenditure side, total expenditure, at a gross &euro;58.5 billion, was &euro;29 million above profile.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to provide independent assessments of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary plans and projections and to inform public discussion of economic and fiscal matters.  A joint memorandum of understanding exists between the council and the Department underpinning the endorsement process of the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by the Department upon which the budget and stability programme updates are based.  The council is funded from the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The funding ceiling for 2017 was &euro;800,000.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report presents an overview of the transactions, contributions, receipts and financial corrections relating to Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU during 2017.  I welcome this report, which makes an important contribution to helping to improve understanding of how the EU budget works.  My Department has engaged with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on an ongoing basis over the past year or so on various issues related to the report, including the single recommendation that there should be annual reporting on a consolidated basis of all contributions and receipts from the EU.  As stated in the correspondence over that time, I remain open to having a further discussion with the Comptroller and Auditor General on this issue and, in that regard, I have started an internal scoping exercise on how we might make progress towards greater consolidation.  In due course, should we decide to report on a consolidated basis, all relevant Departments would need to be involved to assess fully the implications of the preparation of such a report.</p> <p>  I turn now to some departmental performance outputs in recent years.  The Department completed its Statement of Strategy 2017-2020 and we continue to work towards achieving two broad goals: a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances, and a balanced and equitable economy, enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well-regulated financial sector.  The successful initial public offering, IPO, of AIB in June 2017 was the second biggest in the world at the time and raised &euro;3.4 billion for the taxpayer.  This has created a strong platform for the State to recover all of the money it has invested in AIB over time.  In December 2017, Ireland repaid its remaining programme related loans to the IMF, together with the bilateral loans from Sweden and Denmark, early and in full.  The Department published an action plan in 2017 under the Government&rsquo;s strategy for international financial services.  In 2017, 2,000 jobs were created under the strategy.</p> <p>  Climate change has been identified by the Department as a risk to the sustainability of the public finances and the health of the wider economy.  In this regard, the Department supported the NTMA&rsquo;s launch of Ireland&rsquo;s first sovereign green bond on 10 October 2018.  A rainy day fund has been established to protect against severe economic shocks.  It will be seeded with an initial &euro;1.5 billion contribution from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  The Government announced it is setting aside some of the historically high levels of corporation tax, with a contribution of &euro;500 million per annum being provided for this year.</p> <p>  Since 2015, modest and sustainable annual increases in expenditure have been implemented.  This approach, underpinned by growing and broad-based tax revenues, is targeted at delivering ongoing, sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  I am encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 6.7% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland remains one of the fastest growing economies in the EU and the recovery in the economy is seen most clearly in the labour market.  Strong employment gains have driven a substantial turnaround in unemployment, which has fallen from a peak of over 16% in 2012 to a rate of 4.6% in the last quarter.</p> <p>  The prudent economic and fiscal policies implemented over recent years have placed Ireland in a stronger position, most notably through the improvement in competitiveness and growth in employment.  As a result, Ireland continues to maintain its A grade rating with each of the three major credit rating agencies.  However, we are now at or about what is termed full employment, and the economy is likely to be at, or close to, capacity.  With uncertainty in the global economic and trade environment and the reality of Brexit, we face a different set of challenges in managing economic and fiscal policy in the coming years.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union will impose significant costs on the Irish economy.  The question of how costly depends on the exact form that exit takes, whether orderly or disorderly.  While the ratification of the withdrawal agreement remains the Government&rsquo;s preferred outcome, it is not possible to assign an exact probability to the different forms of UK exit at present.  In recognition of this, the broad strategy has been to assume an orderly exit, but simultaneously to plan for a disorderly exit.  Brexit issues are mainstreamed into the Department&rsquo;s work in all areas, including economic analysis, financial services and taxation.</p> <p>  Before concluding, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the staff at the Department for their ongoing work.  It is only through their continuing commitment and dedication that we can deliver on our objectives.  I thank the Chairman and committee for their attention and welcome any follow-up questions.</p></speech>

I do not think there has ever been a state aid case across Europe where &euro;14.3 billion has been recovered.  This is one of the reasons that use of an escrow and having that negotiated between the State and the company and approved by the Commission became so important.  If one simply placed &euro;14.3 billion on deposit at negative interest rates rather than put it into a fund that will be managed by agreement across the parties, the State would be looking at very large cashflow losses in the short term.  This is an exceptional amount.  I do not think there has ever been anything of this level.  The reason that we use an escrow is that the money goes in, it is managed against an investment and whatever is left, whether there is an increase or a decrease, settles the full amount, rather than put all the risk on the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I would contrast that with the potential cashflow loss from a negative interest rate in a year, which could have been as much as &euro;60 million.  Those are the costs associated with it.</p></speech>

These costs run from 2014 onwards.  In terms of the Department's spend, we have spent about &euro;2.3 million on legal services, &euro;90,000 on translations because the documentation can be in French, and other expenditure of about &euro;65,000.  The predominant cost in the &euro;2.5 million figure is legal services.  The CSSO and Revenue have probably incurred expenses as well.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does a report twice a year.  It makes recommendations but they are mostly in the policy space so it would be more for Government rather than officials.  There are some recommendations that it makes, for instance, to improve the macroeconomic forecasts or to do this, that and the other, most of which would have been implemented.  I will try to track down which two have not been implemented and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It has been suggested that we are reliant on the significant revenues from corporation tax, which have been increasing over recent years.  It seems that we are particularly reliant on the moneys generated by the top ten corporates.  I note that the chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners stated in an article that a number of companies move in and out of the top ten contributors to our corporate tax take.  He argued that this provides some level of security.  I would like to refer to the overruns in the Department of Health, our exposure to Brexit, our current expenditure path and our current growth rate.  Mr. Moran used a dangerous term in his opening statement when he said that "economic fundamentals are strong".  Many people have perished on that previously.</p></speech>

The Department has been told that there have been concerns about our concentration on corporation tax for several years.  We have not been behind the door about that.  The historic long-run average contribution of corporation tax to our overall tax take has been approximately 14%, but it is now up around 19%.  This has to be a cause of prudence and concern.  We have to watch it.  Some of the consequences of the global tax reform that has been happening have made Ireland a more attractive proposition for multinationals.  We have seen a strong performance from the global economy, which is continuing to grow.  Profitability has improved.  Other changes have also been going on.  That is why taking &euro;500 million out of that continued high performance and putting it into the rainy day fund is not a bad thing to do.  The last thing we want is for a big line of funding to disappear when we hit slightly bumpy waters.  We do not want to be totally reliant on it.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Moran think this growth is sustainable, given the uncertainties associated with Brexit and our increased level of corporation tax?  I appreciate that some money is being put aside.</p></speech>

The numbers have to be taken over a four-year or five-year period.  There has been an average current expenditure increase of between 3% and 3.5%.  It has probably been slightly less in real terms.  That is below our trend growth rate, which is between 3% and 3.5% with inflation sitting on top of that.  We need to look at this in the round over a period of time.  It is absolutely the case that the last thing we want to do is see a situation in which this starts to spin out of control.  We have to be prudent about the taxes that are there.  They are not there simply to be spent, because they are vulnerable.  We need taxes we can rely on.  There was a time when domestic companies were in the top ten corporate taxpayers, but that is no longer the case.  They are all multinationals.  The top ten varies over time as new companies come in and as people use up capital allowances or losses that they might have had in the past.  The concentration of more than 40% of the corporation tax take across ten companies is not unusual from an international perspective.  While it is not unusual to have a high concentration across big companies, it is something we have to watch.</p></speech>

A couple of things arise as we head into 2020.  The prospect of a disorderly Brexit is one of those concerns.  There are simple costs associated with what Mr. McCarthy would refer to technically as the operation of the automatic stabilisers.  Unemployment would go up and tax receipts would fall as a result of a disorderly Brexit.  The cost could run to a couple of billion euro.  We need to have an eye on that.</p></speech>

We have estimated that over the medium term, a disorderly exit would take approximately five percentage points off the level of GDP.  After that decade, if there was no policy response, the deficit would be one percentage point worse than otherwise would be the case.  For regular people, this means the unemployment rate would be two percentage points higher than in our baseline scenario.  It would have an impact on growth, the public finances and the labour market, which is where people would feel it most.</p></speech>

At the moment, it is hard to say what the probability around Brexit is going to be.  In my view, we would have to be very cautious in an October budget if there was going to be a hard exit two weeks later.  We would have to act accordingly.  If a deal is eventually done and there is an orderly exit, another set of challenges arises.  We are at or about full employment.  Earnings in the economy are starting to tick up.  We are starting to see capacity pressures.  All of that would argue in favour of pumping less money into the economy, which involves containing expenditure increases and tax reductions.  A counter-cyclical budget is very much where we should be going.  I do not know whether Mr. McCarthy wants to add to or disagree with any of what I have said.</p></speech>

The answer is "everybody".  In the case of the omnibus Bill that went through, for instance, there was a massive amount of tax content in it, so the tax division was involved, and the economic division did the analysis.  Mr. Tobin and his colleagues work with the Central Bank on preparations for the financial sector.  Brexit is essentially integrated into everything we do.  We have a small co-ordination unit to bring it all together, but the entire Department is involved in the work.</p></speech>

We have heard about the mortgage tracker scandal and other issues in terms of how the banking sector has behaved.  Given that the State is still a key investor in the sector, will the witnesses explain the safeguards the Department employs in terms of its decision making?  I am talking about, for example, potentially recommending a discontinuation of loss relief in respect of corporation tax for the banking sector.  That represents a huge asset for taxation on the balance sheet and, in theory, makes our banking system more valuable for investment.  Given its status as key investor, for the State to get its money back out of the banking sector, it is in its interest that the banking sector be as valuable as it can be.</p><p>My second question relates to non-performing loans, NPLs, and the power of the Minister <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Department in a situation where, say, the CEO from one of the main banks argues that the bank is under pressure from the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, to reduce its non-performing loans.  Where a lot of people are caught up in these NPLs and some of them have split mortgages, one bank may have a totally different interpretation from another bank as to what a non-performing loan is.  As a member of the finance committee, I saw on several occasions that witnesses from the main banks differed in their adjudication of what constituted a non-performing loan where people had signed agreements and got their mortgage split etc.  I am a little confused as to how the State manages the decision-making process in terms of safeguarding those competing interests.</p></speech>

We keep the banking policy entirely separate because, as the Deputy observes, one cannot have a shareholder who is looking to maximise value while at the same time making or influencing banking policy, deciding how one might look after consumers or any of those issues.  Deputy Burke is absolutely right on this point.  We have to manage that within the Department because we hold both the shares and the responsibility for the banking aspect.  At the end of the day, we have a responsibility to the taxpayer to try to get back the money we put into those banks, but we should not do so at the cost of the consumer.</p></speech>

How does the Department, representing the State as a key investor and shareholder, evaluate that and ensure it is holding the bank to account on that line?</p></speech>

The problem is that to take loss relief from one sector and make it available to everybody would not be sustainable in policy terms.  It is less to do with pressure from the banks to retain their loss relief.  What we have done is impose a bank levy of &euro;150 million to get something back by way of a contribution, and that is ongoing.</p></speech>

There is a Chinese wall between the two, for all the reasons Mr. Moran gave.  The banks operate on a commercial basis and their individual independence is protected by the relationship frameworks, which are legally binding documents.  The Department does not interfere in the commercial decision making of the individual banks.</p> <p>  In terms of the tracker mortgage investigation, it is probably the most complex investigation the Central Bank has ever undertaken.  There has been &euro;665 million of redress given out to customers to date.  Our focus is to try to ensure that what happened with tracker mortgages does not happen again.  One of the key ways in which the Minister and the Government are proposing to do that is through the Central Bank (amendment) Bill, which is being brought forward. The legislation will have three key elements, one of which is the introduction of a senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, for senior managers in the banks that will allow us to pinpoint who is responsible for what function in advance in individual banks.  It can be argued that through the crisis, it was not clear exactly who was responsible for which particular part of the disastrous decision that led to X, Y or Z.  The SEAR is designed to overcome that.  There will also be new conduct standards for all financial services firms and enhancements to the fitness and probity regime and the enforcement regime.  There will, as a result, be a greater number of rules in place, which will, we hope, ensure that some of the activities we saw through the crisis, including in respect of tracker mortgages, will not happen again.</p></speech>

In many instances, I have seen loans that are put up for sale comprising mortgages which are up to date and which have never been in arrears or loans on rental properties that fell behind six years ago but which are up to date now.  I have seen how those loans were placed in a bundle and sold.  Some of these cases were extreme and the Department needs to be aware of how issues like this affect people.  Citizens of this State have to be protected too and they are being railroaded by some of these practices.</p></speech>

I would not disagree with anything the Deputy is saying.  Sometimes what happens is that loans are connected so that one could have a principal dwelling house, PDH, loan that is connected to a commercial loan.  In such circumstances, some of the issues that the Deputy mentions can arise.  The definition of what constitutes an NPL is set down by the European Banking Authority.  We have a European definition-----</p></speech>

The ratio at AIB is below 8%, at Bank of Ireland it is around 6% while at PTSB it is approximately 10%.  The concern of the ECB and the SSM would be that the banks need to be ready for the next potential downturn.  We cannot go into the next downturn, to which the Secretary General has alluded, with elevated levels of NPLs from the last crisis, a decade ago.  That will only exacerbate what we face into the next time.</p></speech>

This committee has offered to try to see if we can help.  The Chief State Solicitor's office, without checking with us, put it into a letter of correspondence to the applicant in the case to ask if the applicant would pull back if it let the Committee of Public Accounts do a bit of work.  All we want to do is save a little bit of money, get the appropriate oversight and, meanwhile, we have a case going on in the High Court where nobody is engaging with anybody.  We are heading for &euro;306 million in taxpayers' money for this liquidation.  I have a report in front of me today that was commissioned by a third party where Professor Constantin Gurdgiev effectively said that as a consequence of the failure to properly account, analyse, assess, challenge or monitor, or both, the costs of the interests of the Irish taxpayer and ultimately all creditors of IBRC have not been or are not being adequately protected.  That happens to be my uneducated, ordinary five-eight view, as articulated at this committee many times over the past two years, but he comes with a bit of credibility.  When we were last here we did have the relevant person, a former employee of KPMG apparently - not that that is an issue - and he was able to tell us that about two people were dedicated to this.</p><p>The other issue is that we are not even going to be able to adjudge at the very end, whenever the end is, on the performance, because part of the terms of reference, when one puts it all together, there was no valuation of the assets or expected recoverable value of the assets held at the time of liquidation, so that established no benchmark or key performance indicators for liquidation process performance.  We are all just going to arrive at the end and say we did a tremendous job, which we know cost &euro;306 million, because we will have nothing to compare it with and we will have added no oversight other than the glorified PowerPoint presentation that is rolled out, the most recent one being on 22 May, with headline issues, but it is not remotely the sort of detail that was available to me when I was voluntarily liquidating my own very modest business.  I did not have any creditors because I paid all the bills.  It is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

The big money is the &euro;306 million.  With the appropriate oversight, perhaps a committee of inspection would come out with a detailed report saying KPMG did the best possible job that could be done.  I always qualify my remarks about this matter by saying that, but perhaps it would not.  In any event, the people are entitled to it.  As things stand, I am not even sure there is anyone in the Department of Finance who has the level of detail available to him or her that an ordinary creditor or stakeholder would have, because KPMG pays itself from recoveries.  The rates of pay are the NAMA rates but I am not looking at the time sheets.  I do not know how many seniors, juniors or partners were involved.  I often heard it said that in accountancy firms, if a particular job is done people are told to put down this time for one liquidation and that time on another liquidation.  That is what committees of inspection are for, namely, to question and challenge those things and the need for stakeholders to be involved.  We do not have that.  The witnesses cannot in all fairness tell me that they are 100% confident we are getting value for money because they cannot possibly know that.</p></speech>

Why does somebody not discontinue the case or go to somebody to mediate and say, "Let us do a deal here"?  These people are not looking for compensation or money, to the best of my knowledge.  I have read the statement of claim for one of them.  I was not aware of the others.  Nobody I am aware of is looking to make money here.  They are looking for the same thing we are looking for - oversight.  Obviously, I can understand that the State cannot be a soft touch.  If somebody was looking to take action against the State for financial gain, of course, that is a matter for the courts to decide and we must issue a defence.  However, what we are fighting here is two people privately looking for the same thing that the Committee of Public Accounts is looking for, which is, oversight and transparency on the most expensive liquidation in the history State, at &euro;306 million.  To date, &euro;150 million has been paid in fees - for example, &euro;144.9 million to KPMG up to December 2018, &euro;35.8 million to A and L Goodbody, and &euro;20.2 million to Linklaters.  Maybe everything has been done right, but we would like to know.  We will not until it is all over.  I am concerned that the people are not getting value for money.  I am also concerned that two or three staff in the Department is not sufficient.</p></speech>

None of us, the Chairman included, is bound to support or repeat the mistakes of the past, but it is reasonable that we would learn from them.  I cannot imagine the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, saying to the Secretary General that he notes he has a proposal here for a committee of inspection, that he is sorry he is not agreeing to it and that the legislation was passed in the middle of the night in February 2013 or whenever.  The Minister would take the Secretary General's arm off and say that it is a great amendment Bill, that they should do that and let the committee of inspection in there and give the people the oversight they require, and that he amendment would also put to bed two court cases where other third parties are looking to achieve effectively the same as the Committee of Public Accounts.  Would Mr. Moran not recommend that to the Minister?</p></speech>

The special liquidation passed by the Oireachtas was a major issue.  The Department of Finance effectively stated that it would adopt a hands-on approach with this legislation and appoint a special liquidator, the Minister appointed him on 7 February 2013 and he commenced work a minute later.  That is fine.  However, the public probably would have expected that the level of scrutiny that a committee of inspection would provide in a normal liquidation would be provided by Department of Finance given that the Department did not prescribe a committee of inspection in the legislation.  It appears that the two staff members who are overseeing this would not equate to a normal committee of inspection.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran told us the Department had eight or nine staff when it started, but we are down to two staff now.  Given the scale of this issue, we would expect the same level of scrutiny in this case by the Department as if it was done through the Companies Act in respect of a committee of inspection in another circumstance.  We do not get the impression that there is a similar level of scrutiny here.  One may call it what one likes.  Maybe I am wrong, but it is just the feeling I am picking up.  Does Mr. Moran get my point?</p></speech>

The usual practice is to use the Companies Act.  We are aware the Oireachtas did something different here.  The Oireachtas was probably entitled to believe that, because of the special circumstance, we would have the normal level of scrutiny but we would not call it a committee of inspection.  I do not feel we have that.  That is my observation.  It is not a conclusion from me.  It is my observation at present.</p></speech>

I have a few further questions Mr. Moran might respond to as well.  Who were the auditors for IBRC before it was liquidated?  I am aware KPMG were the auditors of Irish Nationwide, which, obviously, makes up part of IBRC, but I cannot recall who were the auditors of IBRC.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran might give us some indication as well in this regard.  In the report on Vote 7, the Department refers to unsecured creditors payments but it would be quite useful for the committee to see a profile of what is happening in IBRC from the time of its liquidation.  It is quite difficult to get a handle on it.  The lack of any kind of transparency on this is a real cause of concern.  Obviously, that is why the committee of oversight is being sought.</p> <p>  I accept a committee of oversight is not in the legislation, which was rushed and, obviously, deficient.  If, for example, it was a question of a committee of oversight being put in place, and, obviously, the legislation would have to be amended to do that, would that make the court cases moot?  Would the Department agree that would be the case?</p></speech>

The Government provided &euro;1.2 billion to Irish Water in 2017.  There is the same issue here with oversight being one step removed because Irish Water was set up in the way it was.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a function in auditing and that is something that is under consideration.  I do not know if there is any advance on where that is at?</p></speech>

For the benefit of the committee the witnesses might outline the rationale for the various approaches adopted to funding Irish Water.  We all know that a lot of money is required.  Did Irish Water come to the Department?  What is the priority that is set up?  How does that work and how do we see that?</p></speech>

I agree that when one looks at the Byzantine funding of it through various channels such as the Vote, the local government fund, equity injections and loan financing, it is a strange structure.  That was recognised and water charges were abolished.  This has been tidied up since 1 January 2018 and all funding going to Irish Water will go through the Vote of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  That should give the clarity that the Deputy is looking for on where the money is coming from and what it is going there for.  That should be seen in the 2018 accounts for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  Irish Water's commercial borrowings are to be replaced by what we call a central funds stability scheme.  In other words, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will borrow on its behalf, rather than have it borrow commercially, to get that funding more cheaply.</p></speech>

Its lending is for more purposes than just for housing.  It is local authority lending and matters such as the land aggregation scheme and the purchasing of sites or the taking into control of sites under land aggregation has allowed some reduction and repayment to the Housing Finance Agency.  There was one transaction in 2017 where there was about &euro;470 million.

This year the rate of unemployment is 4.6% and it was higher than that in 2017.  Does the Department have an explanation of why it is below profile?  Does it understand the nature of the workforce, for example?  Is that impacting on the gig economy and the likes of part-time work?  Is there an analysis on that?</p></speech>

That arises for a range of factors.  It may well be because it is at entry level and people come in during the middle of the year and have tax credits available which have not been used in the course of the year.  The intensity in tax terms is much weaker.  When there is an adjustment in earnings we get a much stronger elasticity.  Mr. McCarthy is much better at describing elasticity for an increase in earnings, but if we see a 1% increase in employment, we will see approximately a 0.8% or 0.9% increase in tax.  If we see a 1% increase in earnings, we might get a 2.1% or 2.2% increase in taxes.  That has always been the way.  It is not a new phenomenon.</p></speech>

Income tax is a broad church.  We have labour related income taxes - PAYE, USC and so forth - but we also have taxes on income that are not generated from employment, including DIRT, life assurance exit tax, dividend withholding tax and so forth.  I cannot remember the details exactly because I tend to focus more on what is going on now, but in 2017 the shortfall on income tax was more related to those taxes rather than the labour taxes.</p></speech>

We saw that the Moneypoint power plant was part of the reason for the improvement in our emissions numbers last year.  That was because there was a breakdown at the plant.  Since our underlying figures on emissions are not improving, we cannot be sure that we can avoid exposure to greater fines.  The way to deal with this is to invest in public transport, retrofitting of housing and so forth.  Has the Department done a profile or cost-benefit analysis specifically on climate or is that simply looked at on the basis of each individual capital project?</p></speech>

The analysis of carbon investment is probably a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  From the point of view of the Department of Finance, the key issue will be pricing carbon.  This is the controversial and ongoing difficult issue of carbon taxation.  There is broad consensus that one of the biggest contributors to reduction of emissions is by pricing carbon and putting a cost on it, but that is not simple.  It is genuinely not simple.  It would have distributive effects.  It may affect those people on lower incomes more heavily and, therefore, we have to address those things.  There is an urban-rural question in terms of the impact on farming and so on.</p> <p>  As recently as Monday or Tuesday this week, we put out a public consultation document at the request of the Joint Committee on Climate Action around the phasing in of carbon taxation, the hypothecation of those revenues and what might be done to support climate change efforts.  Climate change is one of those issues.  It is seldom that a Secretary General of the Department of Finance comes before the committee to say that hypothecating revenues towards something is a good thing.  The underlying problem of the environment is one area where any revenues from a carbon tax should go towards carbon reduction.</p></speech>

There are no issues whatsoever identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is important to put that on the record.  I thank Mr. Moran for that.  We have no issues.  I will now go into the substance and the Department's opening statement.  I am not sure whether it was with Mr. Moran himself but I raised a particular issue with the Department the last time it was before the committee.  I have great difficulty with something in the opening statement which reads:</p><blockquote>I am encouraged by the robust pace of the recovery in the economy, with GDP increasing by 6.7% last year.  The increase in economic activity is broadly based and economic fundamentals are strong.  Ireland remains one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.</blockquote> <p>I have great difficulty with that statement.  Reference is also made to our credit rating, which really reflects more on what suits the agencies who produce the ratings.  I put no emphasis on that whatsoever.  The reason I have great difficulty with this statement is that I have just checked and, as of yesterday, we had 10,378 people homeless, comprising 6,584 adults and 3,794 children.  I cannot square that figure with that paragraph.  Either I am ignorant or uneducated in these matters or the Department is taking a very narrow view of the economy and fiscal policy.  I cannot accept that we are the fastest growing country in Europe and that we are fundamentally sound when that is our position.  I will finish with this point and then I will ask some questions.  We are now in a situation in which accommodation meant for tourists, that is to say, hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, is used to house homeless people while the accommodation meant to house our people, that is to say, houses, is being used for tourism through Airbnb.  Does Mr. Moran accept that is the position?  I have great difficulty with this statement.</p></speech>

As I have already said, the economic fundamentals are strong.  I could live to regret that statement but I have included a very strong "however" a couple of paragraphs later when I state that we face new challenges.  Our role is to ensure, as far as we can, that the economy itself is stable, that public finances are stable and predictable, and that the revenue can be generated to address the real problems about which the Deputy is talking.  I do not disagree with her in any way.  As an Irish citizen, the idea of that homelessness is-----</p></speech>

There was no construction for five or six years.  All of these issues contributed to what the Deputy is describing.  It is, however, the performance of the economy that will generate the revenue to allow for spending on building the 10,000 social houses that are targeted.  That is what will provide the money for capital investment.</p></speech>

That is for another forum.  It is difficult to wade through all this information, although I know and appreciate all of the work that went into it.  It is premised on a completely wrong ideology, however.  How can any Department say we are sound when we have that level of homelessness and such a serious crisis in housing?  One simply cannot get a house to rent in Galway.  Policy is forcing the market up to unsustainable levels of rent.  We know that.  The very policy of the Government, including the housing assistance payment and the other payments, is forcing rents upwards unsustainably.  I would love it if the Department of Finance began to look at that.  Perhaps I am taking unfair advantage of Mr. Moran in this regard but I come from a city in which the housing crisis is worse than in Dublin, in which the health crisis is worse than anywhere, and where a hospital is falling apart but Mr Moran is telling me our economy is sound.  There is something wrong with that definition of an economy.</p> <p>  Moving on to specific questions, what is the second state aid case?  The first was that regarding Apple.</p></speech>

The value of a report over a set of accounts is that one can look at a longer time period.  The sums involved and the complexity is so great that something like the debt report was what I had in mind, or the special report we produced.  Repeating that on an annual basis, or something like it, could be useful.</p></speech>

I have no dispute with the Comptroller and Auditor General's view that this would be more informative, more transparent and so on.  There are also projects we are doing around the Government's balance sheet in trying to get a consolidated view of that and to move to bring on some of the assets that we do not currently see, and then do an intertemporal exercise with it as well.  There is a range of things we are doing.  Hopefully, when I am back next year, I can outline what progress we have made on that.</p></speech>

To take the people who will be doing this, the European team will be dealing with the MFF and the negotiation of that, and to do it is carving out time from other work they are doing.  For the accounting and corporate function, we have things like financial management and shared services going on.  We will address resources.  We have a challenge around staffing.

The bottom line is that the Civil Service is expanding.  Most of these people are not leaving the Civil Service.  They come in, they stay with the Department, we invest quite an amount of money in our skillset and they get promoted into the wider Civil Service.  Of that 20% average, only about 4% actually leave and go to the private sector and the rest go into the wider Civil Service.  As a management team, that is presenting us with an enormous challenge.</p></speech>

Again, the report was just noted.  It was the amendments that changed it.</p><p>I am not asking Mr. Moran to comment politically but that was the background.  That report was being noted before the D&aacute;il so there seems to be a certain lack of urgency - I would use the term "cognitive dissonance".  We are one of two countries to declare a climate emergency yet we are one of two countries that will miss their targets.  It was the amendments from the various parties that forced the D&aacute;il to do what it did and that is the position now it has been declared.  Where is the Department building that into its forecasts?  The biodiversity report contained an entire section on the financial implications of what is happening with the loss of biodiversity.  The Governor of the Central Bank has said that if we do not deal with it, it will be worse.  I am paraphrasing the man.  Where is the Department building it in?  </p></speech>

I have already referred to it.  Pricing is a profoundly difficult issue - using the pricing of carbon through tax to create a set of incentives that encourage people to use less carbon-intensive fuels.  This in itself generates the revenues that allow us to do many other things referred to by Deputy Murphy.  It involves getting the balance of that right.  This is why we have a public consultation out.  There was a recommendation to the committee that we do so and we have done so.  We will move from there.</p> <p>  We also got the ESRI to do some more medium-term research for us.  Does Mr. John McCarthy want to give a sense of it?  </p></speech>

The report was published in March.  What we asked it to do and what it has done is look at the impact of that on the economy.  The impact is to reduce GDP by between a half and a percentage point.  We also wanted to find out what the impact would be on carbon emissions.  It is work in progress.  It does reduce carbon emissions but the amount would be insufficient to reach the various targets.  What we were concerned about is the distributional impact of that because different people will be affected in different ways.  We are working with the ESRI using the SWITCH model to try to model the impact on different deciles - different household segments - and we intend to publish that research.  As the Secretary General mentioned, the tax lever is the one lever that is available to the Department of Finance.  It might have been Deputy Connolly or Deputy Murphy who mentioned that it is much wider than tax and must be a whole-of-Government approach.</p></speech>

My question really concerned risk.  I will leave tax for another day and the debate on it.  I think it is foolish, will divide people and take the focus away from where we should be.  People have asked us to acknowledge and deal with climate change.  My question to the Department concerned where it was looking regarding that emergency and how it is building it into its forecasts.</p></speech>

I think the Chair of the Climate Change Advisory Committee, Professor John Fitzgerald, often refers to the point that to retrofit all the existing stock of houses will cost &euro;50 billion.  We must find the means by which we can do that over the next 20 to 30 years.  That will require a lot of private money but also public support.  As I understand it, over the next number of weeks, the Government is due to publish its strategy around the actions in the plans.  I hope that many of the answers to the questions posed by Deputy Connolly will be in that.</p></speech>

We saw the plenary summons at the time.  I think Mr. Tobin unfortunately said that we would have to ask them about their motivation.  I did not realise there was a second case.  We saw the plenary summons relating to the first case.  It was simply looking for accountability.  I am not sure if it was Mr. Moran or somebody else that was there who said that we should wait for the statement of claim.  It seems absurd that somebody would have to go to court to bring about accountability.  They were not looking for anything for themselves.  They were simply setting out what they thought were the necessary oversight mechanisms.  I will leave Mr. Moran with that.  I think the Department of Finance should look at the fact that a citizen had to go to court to get proper oversight mechanisms.</p></speech>

In recent years, the Oireachtas has set up its Parliamentary Budget Office, something we did not have before.  Can Mr. Moran talk to me about the relationship between the Department and that office?  The office is trying to assist the Oireachtas in terms of knowledge for budget planning but the budget comes from the Department.  Is there close co-operation or are the Department and the Parliamentary Budget Office at arm's length?</p></speech>

The population of people who produce a national budget is quite small so one is fishing in the same pond for staff.  They would be colleagues.  There would be that sort of connection.  The critical thing is that they provide more information to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that allows for proper challenge.  The contacts are largely informal.  I do not think there is a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and the office or between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the office.  There would be ongoing contact around information but not in a formal way.  It does add to the layers of accountability and improvements in accountability around budgeting in the same way as the IFAC is fundamental.</p></speech>

This has nothing to do with the Department but I find that they are a great help when it is not needed but once the game is on, they are up in the stand.

They are in a process involving the Public Appointments Service as I understand it.</p> <p>  On the EU report outlining Ireland's transactions with the EU, this country's contribution to EU resources is 0.85% of Irish GNI.  The figure for national income is different to the GNI figure and the GNP figure.  That includes the value of the multinational sector in Ireland.  We are getting a lot of extra corporation tax because the multinationals are based here on the one hand and we are paying a higher contribution to the EU because they are located here on the other.  We all know what the top multinationals are paying in corporation tax but does the Department have a figure for the additional amount we are paying in EU contributions each year as a result of them being based here?</p></speech>

We want data that are as recent as possible.  I know that the increase was not so big but it is at a much higher base now.  That is my question and the Department will come back to me with a response on that.</p> <p>  I see value in having consolidated reports because I suspect that the majority of Members of the D&aacute;il do not appreciate that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for example, is not accountable to the D&aacute;il for the spending of &euro;1.3 billion or whatever the figure happens to be.  We tripped upon it here with the Department and asked it about the EU funds.  The Secretary General, as the Accounting Officer, signs off on the report which is sent to the European Commission but not to the Oireachtas.  There is no mechanism in place.  There is nothing stopping the Oireachtas from examining the accounts and we discussed it when we came across it but there is no formal mechanism in the Oireachtas to examine all of this money coming in from the EU.  That is why there would be a benefit to having a report.  This is relevant, for example, in the context of what happened in the Brexit debate.  People were able to make all sorts of crazy statements about how much Britain would save by not having to contribute to the EU.  I am not saying that such a debate could happen in Ireland but people can make outlandish statements in this country and if the Department does not have proper figures, it cannot reject those statements.  In that sense, the Department has a duty to compile those figures.  The witnesses spoke about the risks in the Department.  There is a risk that a Brexit-like debate could happen in Ireland, which could be damaging.  All it takes is for someone in the Department to put a report together each year, including all of the important figures, so that it could respond quickly to such a debate, were it to raise its head in Ireland.  One does not know what way political debates will go.  One would hope that facts would win out at the end of the day but in the absence of a consolidated, factual report, the job is made more difficult.</p> <p>  I note from paragraph 2.3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that in 1985, the UK correction lowered the contribution made by the EU by way of a rebate, which is replaced by an additional contribution by other member states.  I think that was when Mrs. Thatcher got her money back.  Am I right?</p></speech>

The mechanism reduced the UK's contribution by &euro;4.9 billion in 2017, while Ireland's contribution increased by &euro;135 million.  Has the Department worked out the figures in terms of risks to the economy of the impact of contributions to and moneys received from the EU if Brexit happens?  If the UK is gone and its contributions are gone, others will be required to make higher contributions.  The &euro;135 million will not exist any more because the UK will not be making any contribution.  On the other hand, because the UK is not contributing, Ireland might have to pay more to fund the CAP and everything else.  I presume the Department has done a paper on that.  How stands that?</p></speech>

Do we have a 100% shareholding in these?  In terms of the tables on pages 27, 28 and 29, I ask the Department to supply information on the percentage shareholding in each case.  I presume that a lot of these are 100%.</p></speech>

I suspect they are 100%.  I see the ports of Waterford, Shannon and Foynes.  I presume they are 100% owned by us.  That answers that question but where are the AIB and Permanent TSB shares in all of this?</p></speech>

That occurred when the licence was sold.  How did that process conclude?  Where did the residual unclaimed prizes in the national lottery end up when the company was wound up?  There is some dispute about this issue.</p></speech>
