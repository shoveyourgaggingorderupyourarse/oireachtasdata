I welcome everybody to our online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to this constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  We considered the minutes of our meetings of 27 and 28 April and 11 and 13 May at our private meeting last Tuesday.  Standing Order 107(3) requires that the minutes be agreed in public session.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p></speech>

This follows on from our examination of the accounts of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage last November.  The Department funds these schemes and this engagement will help inform our next engagement with the Department, which is scheduled for 3 June.</p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by Dr. Robert Sweeney, senior economic and policy analyst at TASC.  I welcome him to the meeting and thank him and his colleagues for the briefing material they prepared for the committee.  When we begin to engage, I ask Members to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  As usual, I also remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference that may be made to other persons in evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today&rsquo;s witness is giving his evidence remotely, from a place outside the parliamentary precincts, and as such may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  The witness has already been advised that he may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I understand Dr. Sweeney is making a presentation to the committee, so I ask him to share his presentation now so we can confirm it is visible on our screens.</p></speech>

As the Vice Chairman said, I am going to talk about RAS and HAP.  I will also talk briefly about rent supplement.</p> <p>  To begin with a short overview and reminder of the schemes, rent supplement is the historic cash support available for those in need of assistance with accommodation costs and who are not currently in local authority housing.  This payment was originally intended as a short-term support for existing tenants in the private rental sector.  Under the scheme, the local authority provides part of the payment in respect of the rental cost - most of it, in fact - and the tenant also contributes a payment.  One of the issues with rent supplement was that people working 30 hours or more each week were ineligible.  Therefore, it was deemed a financial disincentive to the taking up of full-time employment.  An important point is that people who availed of rent supplement could remain on the social housing waiting list.  Those tenants were in the private rental sector and could get supports, but they could also remain on the waiting list to get local authority housing or approved housing body, AHB, accommodation.</p> <p>  Rent supplement has gradually been replaced by the RAS programme.</p><p>It was intended for long-term recipients of rent supplement - those who had been in receipt of rent supplement for about 18 months or more.  Under this scheme, the local authority sources and contracts the landlord for accommodation.  Importantly, particularly when we contrast this with HAP, the local authority is responsible for alternative accommodation if the landlord exits.  The local authority makes payment to the landlord and the tenant pays the local authority.  The tenant payment through the local authority is based on the tenant's income and ability to pay.  The tenant pays the local authority and the local authority pays the tenant contribution to the landlord but the local authority will typically pay most of it as well so the local authority takes up most of the slack.  Rental limits apply to this as they do to rent supplement and HAP, which means that each local authority will have a limit as to how much it is willing to pay to private landlords.  With RAS, the resident is removed from the social housing waiting list so his or her social housing need is deemed to be fulfilled.  Importantly, unlike rent supplement, tenants are entitled to continue to work full time or take up full-time work.  </p><p> RAS and rent supplement are due to be replaced by HAP, which is already replacing rent supplement.  It is envisaged that HAP will also replace RAS.  HAP is very similar to RAS.  One crucial difference is that the tenant sources accommodation in the private rental sector.  It is the tenant's responsibility to find accommodation.  The contract is between the tenant and the landlord.  The contract is not between the local authority and the landlord.  It is similar to RAS in that the local authority makes payment to the landlord and the tenant makes his or her contribution to the local authority.  The tenant is removed from the social housing waiting list, as with RAS.  HAP and RAS are similar in that rent limits apply in each local authority.  If the rent exceeds the rent limits, the tenant typically pays the difference to the landlord.  Some discretion is allowed in terms of exceeding those rent limits.  In what are called exceptional circumstances, local authorities can pay 20% more - 50% in the Dublin area - than the rent limit if the household is homeless.  The tenant is allowed to work full time.  The difference between HAP and RAS is that with HAP, the tenant sources the accommodation and has a contract with the private landlord whereas with RAS, it is the local authority that contracts with the landlord.  </p><p> Here is some information on spending.  This is what is called social housing output from 2005 to 2019.  The social housing current expenditure programme, SHCEP, is the leasing scheme.  HAP is here, as is RAS new transfers, Part V - new build-----</p></speech>

We have Part V new builds.  That is where the private sector builds 10% social housing as part of its developments.  We have RAS new transfers and HAP.  We should see that expenditure on HAP has increased a lot in recent years.  There has been very significant expenditure on HAP.  RAS new transfers now form a fairly small part of overall expenditure.</p> <p>  The next slide shows public current expenditure on housing in 2019.

We see that HAP is the main component of this at 36.4%.  Homeless accommodation is 15.7%, SHCEP is 13.2% and RAS is 12.8%.  We see the figure for rent supplement along with a variety of other schemes.  HAP is the most important part of current expenditure on social housing and is set to become more important in the coming years as rent supplement and RAS are gradually phased out.</p> <p>  In terms of how we might assess HAP, I will present what one might call positives.  Spending has broadly been in line with Rebuilding Ireland projections.  There is often criticism of HAP for increased budget outlays.  As I will discuss shortly, it is not a very efficient way of providing social housing but nevertheless spending has been in line with the Rebuilding Ireland projections.  It has been effective in providing income support for those in the private rental sector, many of whom would become homeless without HAP.  The advantage of HAP is that it is comparatively easy to set up.  It takes time to scale up local authority or AHB building of social housing whereas HAP is very easy to scale up.</p><p>Research by the ESRI has shown that HAP creates a financial incentive to do paid work.  One of the criticisms of rent supplement was that it created barriers to work.  Whatever one's views are, one of the goals of HAP was to remove some of those barriers.  On that ground, HAP has been successful, whether one agrees with that policy or not.</p><p> There are problems with HAP.  Can everybody see the problems with HAP slide?</p></speech>

For anyone watching from outside I wish to state that, with the agreement of the committee, we will publish the presentation on the committee's web page because it is appearing for those of us at the committee meeting but it does not appear to be appearing for those who are watching.  We will publish the presentation afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Robert Sweeney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052000002#C00300"><p>So there are difficulties with HAP.  One of the difficulties is that with most accommodation in the rental markets, the cost of that accommodation exceeds the rental limits or the amount of rent that the local authority is willing to pay.  This has fluctuated from year to year.  In 2020, according to the Simon Community only 5% of rental accommodation as advertised on <i>daft.ie</i>was within the rent limits of HAP.  That is it was within the limit that the local authority was willing to pay, and that is 2020.  This improved dramatically in the latest round as rents in Dublin, particularly, fell and I presume that is what was causing it.  So, 38% of rental accommodation that was advertised fell within the rent limits of HAP.  One could still be critical of that and say that almost two thirds of the accommodation that is out there is outside the rent limits of HAP.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the rent limits have not been revised since 2017.  So the legislation is 2017 but the actual rent limit is, I think, from the second quarter of 2016.  What happens is that the tenants pay their share to the local authority and the local authority pays most of it to the private landlord.  Sorry, the local authority pays most of the rent and it pays that to the private landlord and also the tenant pays a contribution to the local authority.  What actually happens as well is that there are these tenant top-ups whereby the tenant actually pays an extra amount to the private landlord because his or her contributions are insufficient to cover the rent.  That is also a problem.  That is a figure from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Threshold, based on a survey, said that it might actually be higher and be closer to half of tenants now paying top-ups to private landlords.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, it is very difficult for HAP tenants to actually source accommodation.  We have, obviously, a big supply shortage in housing and also the rental sector.  So it is really a landlords' market and they do not really want to go to the hassle and risk of taking on a HAP tenant.  HAP tenants are competing with other tenants who have more means to pay higher rents.  If it is a choice between a regular tenant and a HAP tenant, the landlord is only going to choose one person and that is the non-HAP tenant.<br/><br/>There is a lack of stability as well.  The tenancy can be terminated for a variety of reasons and then it is up to the tenant to find somewhere else.  That is in contrast because if one is in social housing there is much greater stability.  Even with RAS there is greater stability because it is the local authority which has responsibility for finding accommodation for the tenant.  As I am sure we will discuss, it is more expensive.  Whether one uses HAP, RAS or rent supplement, it is a lot more expensive to the State over the long term, especially to pay the rent of these tenants rather than to build social housing.  As I mentioned, the advantage of HAP and similar schemes is that it is able to facilitate their needs in a quick manner.  It takes time to build up one's housing stock but, as is widely recognised, it is expensive.<br/><br/>My last point is that the slide looks at trends in public housing expenditure and the mix between capital expenditure and current expenditure.  What we saw in the depths of the financial crisis, in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and a year here and there, was that there was not a massive increase in current spending but a massive increase in the share of public housing expenditure that was accounted for by current expenditure.  In 2013, for instance, current expenditure was over double capital expenditure.  That has improved in recent years.  In 2019, current expenditure accounted for, I guess, about 40% of total housing expenditure so capital expenditure was actually greater, basically.  That is different from what we had in 2005 and 2006 where current expenditure was less than half of capital expenditure.  Obviously it is much more efficient, from a public finance perspective, if one invests in social housing, which is what capital expenditure is, rather than pay all of these transfers which, essentially, go into the pockets of private landlords.<br/><br/>So there are good things and bad things.  What I would like to see, and I think what most people want to see, is for the share of public housing expenditure, accounted for by capital expenditure, to continue to rise in recent years.</p></speech>

Obviously the big problem around that period was access to funding but at the same time there was a huge demand to deal with the housing issue.  There was not a huge amount of choice at that stage.  If one had put funding into capital one then would not have had Ministry funding to support people who required housing.  We have seen an increase in the amount of current expenditure.  Has Dr. Sweeney a figure for the number of households who availed of the scheme in that period?</p></speech>

If we look at the figures for HAP, for example, in the second quarter of 2019 there were 48,261 tenancies in the HAP scheme.  This has increased greatly since the scheme's inception.  HAP was only introduced, on a phased basis, in 2014, when there were 6,200 tenancies.  However, the figures have grown significantly in each subsequent year, and almost 50,000 households were availing of HAP in 2019.  I do not have the figures in front of me regarding how many people are availing of RAS but we would have to think that it is a smaller number.  I say that because the pie chart I displayed earlier and which is also in my submission demonstrated that HAP is now the main support.  If we combine RAS and rent supplement together, the total comes to approximately the same as what is now spent on HAP.</p></speech>

If we look at the total number of households availing of HAP in 2019, that figure was 48,261.  However, if we look at the total number of HAP payments which have been set up, that figure is about 63,000, but some of the people who go onto HAP then leave the scheme for a variety of reasons.  They might find employment, for example, or they might go back to education.  Therefore, the latest figures I have for the number of active tenancies in HAP is 48,261.

I state that because what is being presented distorts the figures.  On the one hand, the total number of local authority and approved housing body completions are included, but on the other hand, we do not see total numbers of those availing of the HAP scheme.

I think, again, it was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which looked at the cost of schemes in different areas of the country, such as Dublin versus Mayo, etc.  The Department then broke those figures down according to the type of accommodation involved and found that the best value for money, in the Dublin area anyway, which is where the need for social housing is most acute, is derived from local authority construction.  Local authority acquisitions would generally be the next best way in respect of value for money.  The third best way, then, would be local authority long-term leasing.  Also, according to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the AHB lease scheme is a more expensive way of doing it.  However, the Department did not do a breakdown regarding how much it costs when the AHBs build housing themselves.</p></speech>

Looking at the graph in Dr. Sweeney's submission concerning 2005 to 2019, what explains there being such a dip in the figures from 2012?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Robert Sweeney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052000002#D01800"><p>As we were just discussing, in 2012 there is a dip in total expenditure when we include current and capital expenditure.  Obviously, that was in the depths of the financial crisis when the Irish State was coming under a great deal of pressure in international financial markets.  There was a general reduction in public expenditure during the years of austerity.</p> <p>  I imagine one of the reasons there was a large dip in the capital expenditure in particular was that we had extensive overbuilding of housing in the 2000s.  In 2020, for example, we built about 20,000 houses and in 2019 the figure was approximately 21,000 houses.  However, in 2006 we built 90,000 houses.  Those are the total numbers of houses built, by the way, including public and private construction.  During the housing bubble years, therefore, we had massive overbuilding of housing.  That meant there was an overhang, or excess supply, of housing.</p><p>I would imagine that was a contributory factor to why capital expenditure was scaled back during the crisis years, in addition to the general pressures on public finances.</p><p> In hindsight, we definitely scaled back our public expenditure too much, not least because if you wait for the economy to recover, it will be more expensive to build houses in a booming economy than when house prices are cheap and costs have fallen.  There was an oversupply of housing and there were general constraints on public finances and, notwithstanding those things, we did reduce our capital expenditure too much, as we have subsequently found out.</p></speech>

It is for the Government to forecast because it is pulling the policy strings, but we need an increase.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, for instance, is calling for a doubling of capital expenditure for public hosing output and I certainly support that because we have such supply constraints in our housing market at the moment.</p></speech>

He will tell me he does not set policy but it would seem very clear from what he has presented so far that all of the expenditure under these schemes is yielding nothing in return, including the fact we do not have homes to house people.  What I mean is that a vast amount of money is being spent with no return.  Would we not be better with a policy that would see homes built in some shape or form?  Social housing is now an asset to the Government, as opposed to something that just funds private landlords.</p></speech>

The advantage of the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the other schemes was that it was very quick to set up whereas it takes time to scale up local authority building.  It is not good value for money to rely on what are essentially transfers to private landlords.  Reliance on these schemes is not an efficient use of public funds and it would be better to build new units, as analysis by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has shown.  That was also shown by an analysis by the architect, Mel Reynolds.  In 2017, he compared how much it costs to build social housing directly with relying on HAP.  He calculated, based on 2017 figures, that the State monthly payments, when he took everything in, were approximately &euro;400 greater under HAP than direct build.  We are absolutely better off building new units than relying on the transfer system.</p></speech>

I certainly feel the HAP programme for struggling tenants, where the State subsidises rising rents through direct payments to the private rental market, is not value for money.  Since its introduction, we have seen the scheme bloom.  Dr. Sweeney earlier mentioned that more than 50,000 people avail of the scheme and that is evidence of its blooming.</p> <p>  I was surprised no reference was made in Dr. Sweeney's presentation to the thresholds that are applied to applicants for social housing under the housing assistance regulation.  There is a maximum threshold in Mayo and I am sure that threshold is much higher in the Dublin region.  I think the threshold for couples is &euro;26,000.  That means a whole cohort of people who are earning &euro;30,000 do not qualify for social housing and cannot get access to a mortgage.  In other words, these applicants are too wealthy to avail of housing assistance and too poor to get a mortgage from their banks.  Am I correct in saying income limits are set by the Department and not by the council?  What concerns does TASC have with regard to the many people who do not qualify because of these income thresholds?  I would like to get Dr. Sweeney's thoughts on that.</p></speech>

As to who sets them, I understand it is the Government but I am not clear on whether that is the Government in conjunction with local authorities.  As I said, the thresholds have not been changed since the most recent round that was introduced in 2017, based on the second quarter of 2016.  Rents have obviously increased a lot since then.  I referenced the fact that many households are now topping up their HAP to private landlords.  For instance, Threshold did a survey in conjunction with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in 2019 and found that 48% of HAP tenants are paying top-ups to their landlords.  Under the HAP scheme, local authorities allow tenants to pay top-ups to their private landlords but, in general, that is not supposed to be in excess of 30% of their net income, so their total housing expense should not be more than 30% of their net income.  The Threshold survey found 20% of people who are paying top-ups were paying more than 30% of their income.  There appears to be an issue there in terms of the thresholds not keeping pace with rising rent expenses.</p> <p>  Figures from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform showed only 28% of tenants are paying top-ups.  Let us say that between 28% and 48% of tenants are paying top-ups.  I agree with Deputy that there are affordability issues for people on the HAP scheme despite the fact there has been an increase in funding for HAP in recent years.  The funding is in line with the projections made by Rebuilding Ireland but I take the Deputy's point that it is not sufficient for many households.</p></speech>

The rents themselves now have been driven up.  It is now hard to get access to good housing.  It is a difficult situation seen in more towns and villages.</p><p> The solution is to build up supply in our housing stock to get people into more secure tenure within the social housing network.  The State subsidising tenants and paying private landlords is not the way forward.  It is not sustainable in the long term.  I thank Dr. Sweeney for his presentation.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Sweeney for his presentation.  Much research has gone into it and it is welcome.  How many existing tenancies remain under the rent supplement scheme?  From my experience RAS was better than the rent supplement scheme.  HAP was also better than RAS.  There are flaws and there is an over-reliance on each of those schemes.  With rent supplement, I was aware of some tenancies falling into arrears for various reasons at the time.  Does Dr. Sweeney have a breakdown of the number of tenancies that fell into arrears which were in receipt of rent supplement?</p></speech>

I do not have the figures for the number of people on rent supplement or the number of those in arrears on rent supplement.  I can have a look to find those and bring them to the committee.</p> <p>  Regarding the merits of each, there are good and bad points.  For instance, there were criticisms of rent supplement in terms of the ability of people to take up full-time work.  That is not so much the case with RAS and HAP because you are allowed to take up full-time work on those schemes.  There is not that barrier that if you work 30 hours or more, you cannot take up full-time work.</p> <p>  One of the advantages of RAS over HAP is that the local authority has greater responsibility to source housing for the tenant, including when the tenancy is terminated by the landlord.  With HAP, it is the responsibility of the tenant to find that accommodation himself or herself.  One of the stated advantages of HAP is that the quality of the accommodation will be higher.  As we have a long social housing waiting list, it is not straightforward for a local authority to find accommodation for someone through RAS.</p></speech>

Those are 2017 figures.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done some numbers as well comparing the various schemes.  According to its figures, local authority construction is the cheapest way to deliver houses in the Dublin area compared with RAS and HAP.  Generally, HAP is more expensive than RAS.  That changes when you go outside of Dublin.  There is less of a difference between the expense-----</p></speech>

I presume that is because of that top-up that so many people have to avail of in the Dublin region, given the price of properties.  Does Dr. Sweeney have any data on the numbers availing of the top-up to avail of rent support in the Dublin region or in other major population centres?</p></speech>

One involves the tenant paying directly to the private landlord.  The other type is where the local authority pays.  It exceeds the thresholds.  There are two ways of exceeding those thresholds.  Generally, they only have discretion in a certain number of cases to exceed those thresholds by 20%.  In some cases, where the family has been homeless and in the Dublin area, those thresholds can be exceeded by 50%.</p><p>I have the relevant figure on the proportion of HAP tenancies that are exceeded by 20%, and it is 28.3%.  The proportion of HAP tenancies that avail of the 50% uplift is 10%, essentially.  In total, almost 40% of local authority tenancies are availing of those uplifts.</p></speech>

Dr. Sweeney spoke about the number of current HAP tenancies.  I have departmental figures relating to May 2020.  The total HAP tenancies in May 2020 was 59,821.  That is quite significant.  I presume it has increased since then.  The figures were broken down by individual local authority area.  For Dr. Sweeney's own knowledge, the figure had increased to almost 60,000 tenants.</p> <p>  Looking at the number of additional households that are supported by HAP each year and the associated cost, there seems to be a decreasing yield on moneys spent.  There was an increase in the spend of &euro;42 million in 2016 for, I believe, 12,000 new places.  It amounted to an average cost of around &euro;3,482 per person, per year.  The additional &euro;78 million that is provided for this year will work out at around &euro;5,200 per person for 15,000 people.  That amounts to a doubling in the subsidy, when nationally we have seen rent increase by over 25% since 2017 alone.  In my own constituency in Louth, for example, in quarter 1 of 2017 the average rent for a three-bedroom house was &euro;977 per month, with the cost over the same period this year being around &euro;1,230.  That is an increase of nearly 26%.  Is it the case that Dr. Sweeney sees this money as being an increased spend aimed at resolving the issues in the housing market or does he believe these subsidies to private landlords are having a role in driving up rental prices?</p></speech>

Ultimately, the increase in rental prices has been driven by an underlying lack of supply in the market.  Obviously, by availing of HAP, the amount of money that low-income households are able to spend increases, so there might be some small factor there in terms of driving up prices.  Essentially, the Government is creating a demand for rental accommodation that low-income households would not be able to create on their own.  However, the underlying factor is there are not enough houses being built.  It could be argued there is an opportunity cost in respect of the amount of money the Government is spending on supports.  If that money was spent on building houses, it would alleviate some of the rental price pressures.  Of course, we need the temporary measures such as HAP until we scale up the building of public housing.</p> <p>  In terms of the reduced yields, rents have risen significantly in recent years, but the proportion of rent the HAP tenant pays to the local authority is based on his or her ability to pay.  For instance, in 2016, the tenant paid about 28% of the total payment.  That figure fell slightly in 2019 to around 26%.  There has been some attempt to maintain the fact the tenant payment is based on his or her income and the local authority is taking up most of the slack in respect of the rising rents.  Still, the tenants are paying more over time, but the local authorities do appear to be taking up most of that slack.</p></speech>

Nowhere in the contract is the cost of the rent taken into account.  That was a bone of contention for me when HAP was introduced back in 2014.  It is as if we do not need to know the reality.  Dr. Sweeney mentioned the percentage of HAP tenants paying top-ups.  I believe he stated it was around 28%.  I can guarantee that it is much higher than that.  Even outside of Dublin, in places like counties Louth and Meath, the top-up that tenants have to pay can be as much as 40%.  It leaves them put to the pin of their collars.</p> <p>  In respect of the HAP contract, does Dr. Sweeney believe the rental cost of the property is being excluded from the contract deliberately?  The contract gives the impression it is setting out the cost of the rent for the property, even though local authorities and, indeed, the Government know fine well it does not set out the cost of the rent.  Happy days if it was.  What does Dr. Sweeney think about the fact the contracts exclude the reality of pricing?</p></speech>

The figures are supplied by Threshold.  It did a survey in 2019, according to which the figure was 48%.  It may well have increased since that period.</p> <p>  I do not really have a view on why the cost of the rent is not included in the HAP contract.  Obviously, if people are paying an increasing amount of top-ups, that would raise questions about the contracts and their sufficiency.</p></speech>

Now there are people who are in their 30s and even their 40s who are unable to secure home ownership.  The average term of a mortgage loan is 20 to 25 years.  There are people who are now in their 40s and retirement age is 65, or it could be 67 if the Government gets its way.  Are we effectively working towards a deadline in respect of the housing that is available?  For example, will an entire generation be locked out of home ownership for good if they are not presented with a realistic opportunity to buy in the next decade?  Will that be the next crisis that we will face?</p></speech>

The average age of a first-time buyer has increased over time.  I believe it is currently 34, compared with 29 in the 2000s.  There is an increasing number of people in their 40s and 50s who are renting, perhaps, because they could never afford to purchase a property or because of a relationship breakdown and so on.  This will be a problem in the years to come if we do not begin to address our housing problems today.  </p> <p>  Renting is not necessarily bad, if we have a functional rental system.  Currently, rents in the Dublin area in particular are not affordable or stable and tenants are open to eviction where a landlord proposes to sell a property or to move some of his or her family into it.  I am not necessarily opposed to having a high proportion of our population renting if we have a good rental system, which is affordable and meets high standards and provides security.</p></speech>

I want to focus on cost rental and where the opportunities lie in that regard.  Cost rental is a measure in which the State, up to now, has not engaged, but it is a feature of various models throughout Europe?  Where do the opportunities lie for the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Robert Sweeney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052000002#H00400"><p>Under the cost rental model it is envisaged that the rent will essentially cover the costs of building and maintaining the property.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been advocating for a cost rental model for a number of years.  In terms of roll-out, the local authority or approved housing body would build the house and the tenant would pay rent which is sufficient to cover the cost.  In the case of approved housing bodies in particular, some would have to borrow to build the housing and the rent would have to be sufficient to cover that cost.  To be honest, I have not done a huge amount of work on the cost rental model, but it seems a way to proceed going forward.  The system we have now for social housing is very much oriented towards low-income households.  I would like to see a situation where it is not just the poorest of the poor who can avail of public housing.  A cost rental model would be a way of doing that.  The rent paid would be based on a person's income.</p></speech>

For example, a primary school teacher will stay within a particular pay bracket and need certainty around housing, in particular duration of tenancy.  This is a big part of the affordable housing Bill that is currently on the table and a large part of the Land Development Agency model.  In my own area in Shankill, planning permission granted for 600 homes provides that a chunk of those houses will be used for the cost rental model.  In terms of where the opportunity lies, I would be interested in taking up with Dr. Sweeney another time if it is around providing certainty to people in regard to rent, which is the cost of build plus the cost of management, but not profit.  That differential enables the State to build more and to retain the asset in perpetuity and thus there will available stock over time.  The other advantage is the ability to provide long leases, be that five or ten year leases, which will provide certainty to people that they will not be subject to eviction or rent increases and also access to homes for those over the social housing threshold, people on fixed incomes and at pension stage, who have made changes to their lives.  I appreciate this is not a matter which Dr. Sweeney expected to be raised today, but I just wanted to get his perspective on it.  There is so much more to the affordable housing Bill.</p></speech>

We are seeing that now.  </p> <p>  In the chart provided by Dr. Sweeney, he sets out percentages.  Does he have the figures in terms of the finances, as opposed to the percentages, on HAP?

As I mentioned, we needed a measure like HAP to address the emergency need while we built more houses.  The spend on HAP takes from the investment in social housing.  It will be an ongoing expense over the next five to ten years that will add to the Exchequer expenditure, but over the longer term there will be savings from it.  As I mentioned, it is not an efficient of addressing housing need.  Interest rates are very low so now is a great time to build.</p></speech>

We do not yet have the figures for 2020 which, owing to the pandemic, are likely to be lower.  I understand total output was approximately 21,000, a component of which was local authority build.  We can get those figures.  The figures for 2015 to 2019 are low when one considers the growth in demand or the requirement in terms of the other schemes.  Dr. Sweeney spoke about completions and acquisitions.  Increasingly, I am seeing acquisitions of whole estates as turnkey.  Did Dr. Sweeney investigate the cost of direct build versus acquisitions?</p></speech>

I can do that myself.  In terms of the capital spend, rents are increasing right across the country by incredible amounts.  In Maynooth last week we saw that some of the houses that were acquired by a developer are likely to be somewhere in the region of &euro;1,900 to &euro;2,000 a month.  That is an incredible amount of money and very unaffordable for most.  That puts people on HAP outside of the option of renting them because once there is a limit on HAP people are not be permitted to rent what might be available beyond a certain figure.  Is it not the case that it becomes more cost efficient in that scenario to build?</p></speech>

The Government's or at least the Department's economic evaluation service has done some analysis on the cost to the State of building versus supporting tenancies through HAP or RAS.  It differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction - from local authority to local authority - but as I mentioned once or twice already, in the Dublin area where the affordability pressure is most acute, the savings are the biggest there in terms of the local authority building versus RAS or HAP.  As I indicated, interest rates are very low so there has never been a better time to scale up our building of public housing.</p></speech>

I am aware of some of the top-up amounts.  We have all seen them.  They have been a feature for some time.  When the rent supplement limits were lowered after the crash to try to keep rents down, top-ups started to be a feature and they have been a feature since then.  Do we really get an accurate picture of rent?</p> <p>  We probably all see scenarios where there is a queue for a rental property.  If HAP is involved, the local authority must approve it and inspect a premises.  There is not automatic approval, so there is a time delay for someone getting HAP and it means that a landlord will take a person with cash in hand, who is possibly offering two months deposit and rent for one or even two months in advance.  It is becoming much more difficult for people on HAP to get accommodation and not just because of the limit.  Are rents distorted by top-ups?  Are we really seeing the full picture?</p></speech>

I mentioned already that the Department's figures are 28% but a survey by Threshold suggested that 48% of HAP tenancies are topping up and that many of them are topping up such that their total housing expense is in excess of 30% of their net income, which it should not be.</p> <p>  In terms of the distortionary effects, basically, landlords will accept or demand a top-up because they are able to do so.  Essentially, it is a landlords' market.  It is because of the lack of supply of rental accommodation relative to the demand that landlords are able to extract high levels of top-ups.  It is more that there is insufficient supply relative to demand that is causing the distortion and the ability of landlords to demand top-ups.  They would not demand them if they were not able to get higher rents or equivalent rents elsewhere.  If a landlord was not able to get as good a tenant from his or her perspective in terms of the amount of rent paid, then he or she would not demand a top-up.  I would see the distortion of top-ups, if one wants to call it that, as being more due to an underlying lack of supply rather than the top-ups themselves being the cause of the supply problem.</p></speech>

Rising rents are a factor as well.  As capital expenditure is increased, hopefully we would see current expenditure decline, but it really depends on how much capital expenditure is scaled up and if it is done at the scale that is needed.</p></speech>

There have been lease agreements right through from 2009.  We can see the numbers he has provided us with on the top line of the first chart.  However, there is a substantial difference now in local authorities long leasing.  Dr. Sweeney mentioned something about them being more expensive.  Could he elaborate on that?</p></speech>

The Government's economic evaluation service examined the cost of providing accommodation.  The cheapest way in the Dublin area is local authority construction, whether that is two-bedroom or three-bedroom.  Long-term leases are significantly more expensive.  In terms of a hierarchy in the Dublin area, the most efficient way is local authority construction, then local authority acquisition and then long-term leasing, which is significantly more expensive than that.  HAP is typically more expensive still than the leasing scheme.</p></speech>

Today the committee will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the Public Service Performance Report 2020.  I welcome our witnesses: Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary; Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer; and Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, assistant secretary.</p> <p> Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege for our witnesses and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, the witnesses are giving evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members should also note on privilege that they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind Members of the constitutional requirement that they should be physically present within the confines of the place which the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and or the convention centre in Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a Member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any Member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p> I ask Mr. Downes to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The first such report was published in 2017, with the Public Service Performance Report 2020, being the fifth edition of the report.</p> <p>  As recommended in the committee&rsquo;s Interim Report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the course of the budgetary cycle late last year, it was signalled that financial performance should be assessed through the principles of performance budgeting, focusing on what is being delivered with resources and how this aligns with the programme for Government and departmental statements of strategy.</p> <p>  The purpose of the performance report is to increase transparency and accountability and to ensure that the committee, as parliamentarians, and that citizens can see clearly how the public funds are being used and what they are accomplishing.  The information is deliberately presented in as clear and accessible a way as we can to ensure that people generally, not just those with financial expertise, can better understand how public money is being used.</p> <p>  The report builds on the existing elements of the performance-based budgeting initiative and creates a space within the budget process and cycle for performance-based dialogue.  While performance information is provided alongside financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, in December, of each year, outturn information for the current year cannot be provided because of the timing of the REV publication.  This means that committees may not have the relevant or most up-to-date information to allow them to assess performance for the most recent year in a timely fashion.</p> <p>  The performance report tries to address this lacuna by providing timely quantitative and qualitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year so that there is an opportunity for meaningful dialogue between Ministers, Departments and the relevant sectoral committees on Government performance.  The information provided will hopefully assist the relevant sectoral committees in tracking progress from year to year as to the outputs and outcomes of key governmental strategies.</p> <p>  I note that the committee's Final Report on the Framework for Parliamentary Engagement Throughout the Course of the Budgetary Cycle puts forward the proposal that sectoral committees should meet to consider the chapters of this performance report that are relevant to their areas of oversight.  The performance report is designed to support such an enhanced focus on performance and delivery by committees.  The relevant performance indicators are presented in this dedicated, focused document in as accessible a manner as we can make it.  This approach seeks to enable the sectoral committees to make best use of the time available for reviewing performance and achievement by Departments and agencies.</p> <p>  This performance report is just one part of a broader suite of measures across the system to increase evidence-based decision-making, such as the spending review process, and the analytical papers that are produced regularly in that context, including by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, network and the public spending code, which also set certain standards there.</p> <p>  Towards the back of the document the report includes an update on initiatives such as equality budgeting and green budgeting which are both integrated into this performance budgeting framework.</p> <p>  The equality budgeting pilot was introduced in 2018, and brings a new focus to performance budgeting, looking at various equality dimensions such as gender, socio-economic inequality, disability and minority groups.  To date, 12 Departments have participated in equality budgeting and it has increased steadily year-on-year.</p><p>Following a Government decision earlier this year, we are stepping that up and an interdepartmental group is being established to drive this important work across all areas of Government.  This work is overseen and contributed to by an equality budgeting expert advisory group, which comprises key stakeholders and relevant experts, including independent voices.  The last time I spoke to this committee, I drew attention to the OECD report on equality budgeting and we are moving forward with implementation of the various recommendations in that report.</p><p> Also related to the OECD, in 2019 Ireland joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and committed in that context to the progressive implementation of a range of reforms to the budgetary process with a view to better embedding climate and environmental goals within the budget process.  With the ambitious climate targets in the programme for Government and their incorporation into legislation via the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2021, the requirement for the budget process to support this grows more pressing.  As I said, an update on this work is also included in the performance report.</p><p> As regards next steps, an ambitious work plan for performance budgeting policy is in place for the year ahead, which aims to continue and build on the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.  Last year, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform successfully applied for funding to develop our performance budgeting framework and systems under the EU structural reform support programme, SRSP.  The project incorporates the various elements and dimensions of performance budgeting, such as equality and climate-related budgeting and other aspects, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the well-being framework, all of which is in line with the programme for Government commitment to develop and utilise a national well-being framework.  That EU-funded project is now near its mid-point and we are focusing on key priorities, such as improving and upgrading the IT framework for performance budgeting and increased the tagging or labelling of expenditure so we can more easily prepare and generate reports in order to highlight progress.  In this context, we have undertaken a number of peer-to-peer study missions with counterparts in other countries to allow us to learn from best international practice.  We keep our performance budgeting framework under constant and regular review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and, in particular, we value feedback from this committee as a cornerstone of that ongoing process.</p><p> In conclusion, it is clear from the committee&rsquo;s final report that the performance report is a source of information that can be further utilised by the various sectoral committees in their engagement with Ministers and their Departments.  This engagement in principle allows the various committees to consider, with the relevant line Departments, any issues regarding performance against target and what is actually being achieved, and perhaps issues with the specific indicators selected for inclusion in the report and how they can be refined and upgraded.  We found that the recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s report were quite thoughtful in this regard and we are putting together some material with a view to submitting a formal reply to the recommendations in that regard.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the committee for including this performance report on its agenda and I look forward to hearing feedback and the views of members.  This engagement with the committee in regard to the overall format of the report, and its positioning and role within the budgetary cycle, is very important to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as we continue our work in enhancing the overall performance budgeting framework and the performance report in particular.  I know the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is committed to advancing this agenda.</p></speech>

As I have to go to the convention centre to chair a session at 10:30 a.m., I will do what politicians often do, which is to speak and run.  No disrespect is intended.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Downes for his presentation and thank the witnesses for attending.  On equality budgeting, the assistant secretary general will know that was an initiative of the last Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I and Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett were members.  It is excellent to see it embraced.  It resulted from a lot of consultation and the Scottish Parliament was particularly helpful to us on that.  For the benefit of newer members, although they may know anyway, until that point there was always a danger that budgetary measures could have a disproportionate impact on different members of society.  The social protection cuts in 2011 were a classic example in that they disproportionately hit women more than men.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight had people from a range of equality backgrounds present to us and equality budgeting was originally an initiative and recommendation from this committee.  The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, embraced it in the first year it was introduced, and it has been embraced since.  It would be nice at some stage to have a report on its impact, where it has worked and what difference it has made.</p> <p>  I want to make a general point in regard to public service performance, as a public representative interfacing on behalf of the public with the public sector.  My experience is that there have been heroic performances by Departments, and maybe that is because some are more visible.  The Department of Social Protection has performed miracles in the last year in keeping society afloat, particularly those who have become dependent on it, including those who might not have been used to being dependent on it.  I have also found the HSE incredibly responsive.  However, there have been Departments where there is remote working, which I think is going to be an indicator in the future, and the witnesses might have a comment to make on how we measure the performance of remote working as it becomes a significant part of the work of some Departments.  What I liked about the Department of Social Protection and the HSE, just to use those two examples, is that the officials who were available to us pre-Covid remained available to us.  Officials in other Departments, which I will not name, cannot be reached and have been unreachable directly for a year without going through a Minister's office.  That is part of public service performance.</p> <p>  I have a couple of further points on remote working as an indicator.  Has the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looked at its impact in different Departments?  What are the plans?  What impact has the provision of remote working had on public expenditure?  I also ask Mr. Downes to follow up on the equality budgeting piece.  Is there an opportunity to integrate the metrics regarding the implementation of the public sector duty into the public service pension reduction, PSPR?  On green budgeting, which has also become a staple of the way we move forward, does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provide reasoning for its own choice of indicators or are there any other choices of performance indicators?  Can Mr. Downes explain why it chooses the indicators it does and what is the basis for that?  Is any further examination undertaken by the Department as to the correlation between outcomes and impacts?  How does the Department measure those?  Those are my questions.  I thank the witnesses again.</p></speech>

Certainly, this has been a tough year for everyone and for those in the health service and in various parts of our public service who deliver and continue to deliver public services to a high standard during those tough times.  I thank him for that acknowledgement.</p><p> With regard to remote working, that has been a relatively new experience for most civil and public servants over the past year.  We have gone from a position of 98% or 99% of civil servants working in the traditional office to it being completely reversed with 97% or 98% of civil servants working remotely.  Of course, that is not the case in the health service where certain front-line workers have had to keep working.</p><p> Regarding the Civil Service experience, there is much working ongoing with surveys, getting feedback and a sense of the impact remote working has had on public service performance.  There is probably more work to do to collate and interpret that information, but the initial signs we are seeing are that people have adapted very well to the remote working environment.  Departments continue to deliver on their core missions.</p><p> Looking forward, the Deputy asked whether we would develop an indicator for that.  Certainly, there are some operational indicators which would be relatively routine to build in into the future regarding the number of staff who work either on site or remotely or in a blended working environment, which some people think we are evolving into.  Ultimately, the purpose of this performance report, subject to the committee&rsquo;s views, is and should remain not so much on the operational issues but on what is being delivered in terms of public services, outcomes and impacts.</p><p> The Deputy asked how we select outcomes and impacts.  In the first instance, the people who know and the organisations that know their business best are in the Departments and are the Departments themselves.  It is a matter for Departments in the first instance to come up with output and impact indicators.  Members will see throughout the report that, for each organisation, we have broken down the indicators very simply into outputs and impacts.  Outputs are things that are delivered on year to year.</p><p> Looking at page 12 of the report, which refers to income supports for children, for example, there are the number of monthly child benefit payments, and &euro;1.2 million is delivered by the Department of Social Protection.  There are also listed several impact indicators, such as the percentage of children at risk of poverty.  We can see that percentage has declined, that is to say the situation has improved to some degree, certainly since 2017, and there are the percentage of children in consistent poverty and deprivation rates.  Looking at supplementary payments, there are impact indicators there such as the percentage of people without heating at some stage during the past year, which is something people can understand what that means, and the percentage of people who are unable to keep their homes adequately warm.  Rather than just providing the number of household benefit payments, which is 440-odd thousand, which the Department is delivering, it is about what it is actually doing in terms of the impact on people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p> There is also the method of how we select the indicators.  There are opportunities as we implement, embed and evolve our processes for performance supporting and accountability, including the role of this and various sectoral committees, for members as parliamentarians and in committees to ask questions, challenge or make suggestions to counterparts and colleagues in Departments as to whether there are other indicators members would like to see to give a better flavour or a more rounded account of what is being accomplished in different areas and what are the things that matter most.  Perhaps I will leave it there for the moment.</p></speech>

I am a new member of this committee, unlike the previous Deputy who was speaking about the developments within equality budgeting.  I have a question on that.  I can see from Mr. Downes's presentation and the report that it is something which is being focused on.  On some of the shortcomings highlighted by the OECD in its recent report, it stated that when it comes to equality budgeting that:</p> <blockquote> 	... there is no overarching strategy or set of goals in Ireland.  This makes it difficult to judge the extent to which equality goals currently being set by departments are in line with real needs or are sufficiently ambitious. </blockquote> <p>It further noted that:</p> <blockquote> 	... equality budgeting is not obligatory; departments have limited incentive or capacity to participate, and they are unclear of the ultimate goal of the initiative. </blockquote> <p>That all sounds very negative and I had started off today thinking I would be very positive.  I do not mean this to be negative, I am just reading out what the report stated.</p><p>We know a huge amount of money is spent annually on public procurement.  Can this spending be challenged in such a way as to achieve social and environmental objectives through the inclusion of social clauses in contracts?  Does Mr. Downes see a greater role for progressive public procurement in equality budgeting?  Does he envisage it being reported on in future public service performance reports?  Going back to my starting point, it is positive to see this and I would like to hear Mr. Downes&rsquo;s reaction to my comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronnie Downes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052000002#C00500"><p>I thank Deputy Farrell for those comments.  Regarding equality budgeting in general, it was introduced in 2017-2018 on a pilot basis.  We invited the OECD to come and take a critical look at what the experience of the project was in its initial stages and to help us set a direction for the future to make sure it would have an impact.  We were hoping, and were quite happy, that the OECD report would give us the critical feedback we wanted to help us stay on track.  The point it made about the lack of an overarching framework within which equality goals can be articulated is one we can acknowledge.</p> <p>  One of the ways that is being addressed and progressed is in the context of the work already under way to develop a national well-being framework.  The national well-being framework is at a reasonably advanced stage.  It is being spearheaded by our colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach, with us in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, and the Department of Finance sharing leadership of that agenda, but it is taking place on a whole-of-government, cross-departmental basis.  Part of the objective of that exercise, as signalled in the programme for Government, is to develop a set of indicators which can serve multiple purposes.  One of those purposes, for example, is to develop an alternative set of economic and social indicators to see whether Ireland is making progress in improving the lives of our citizens, including alternatives to GNP and so on.  It can also play a more systematic role in providing the overarching framework of recognisable well-being goals and objectives.  Each of those goals and objectives, from our point of view and part of the role DPER plays in this, is to make sure the well-being framework can serve that purpose as an overarching framework for performance budgeting, but also to integrate those equality dimensions within each of those well-being indicators so that it will also serve those purposes.</p></speech>

That is very informative.  I am just conscious that my time is running away from me so I will ask my other few questions together and then give Mr. Downes an opportunity to respond.</p> <p>  Regarding housing, the whole point of this performance report is that it increases transparency and accountability and ensures that every citizen can see clearly how public funds are being used.  On that basis and on those principles, the principles of the report, the housing section reports the "total number of units delivered through Social Housing build and acquisition programmes".  This is not by any means unique to this report; the lumping together of social housing builds with housing acquisitions into a single metric is something we see time and time again.  However, building and acquisition are two very different things.  In future could we see these two presented separately so we can see what is actually being built rather than what is being acquired?  In the interests of transparency and for citizens to see how public funds are used, that would be really important.  I know this report has been reformed in recent years, so I hope that perhaps in the next report these two things, social housing builds and social housing acquisitions, will be accounted for separately.  I would like Mr. Downes's views on that.</p> <p>  As for the Department's approach to green budgeting, there are three pages focused on this.  The first two pages mainly explain what green budgeting is and the principles that underlie it.  The last page of this part notes: "Over the course of 2021, DPER will work with those Departments responsible for climate and environmental related expenditures to develop ... metrics that are meaningful."  My question relates to the development of such metrics, particularly as it relates to capital expenditure.  We know that capital expenditure is budgeted to rise, and it is fair to assume that sizeable amounts of this will be on what can be referred to as green investment.  It seems to me, therefore, that we need some metric that can link capital expenditure on green infrastructure to our emissions target, as per the new climate Bill.  Can Mr. Downes tell us about any work that has been done in this regard?</p> <p>  I have one question about capital expenditure.  I see on page 7 of the report that gross capital expenditure for 2020 was just shy of &euro;9 billion.  The stability programme update, SPU, states that gross capital expenditure in 2020 was budgeted to be &euro;11.5 billion.  Could Mr. Downes advise on this difference?  Was it the significant carryover cost?  Will the Department put in place measures to ensure that each Department will be incentivised to spend its allocation?  We heard reports at the weekend that the Minister was concerned about ensuring that the capital expenditure is actually spent.</p></speech>

I will deal with them in turn.</p> <p>  Regarding social housing build and acquisition, the Deputy's point is that it would be perhaps useful to know about the separation between those and what underlies them.  There are two ways we can progress that.  One is that we can relay this feedback to our colleagues.  We will take on board the Deputy's comments, certainly for the next iteration of the report, and relay that feedback to our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is another way of addressing this, going back to my opening remarks.  These indicators are being put forward by the Departments, including ours, as indicators that we think are useful.  However, when it comes to having that performance dialogue, which is envisaged in the report the committee brought forward recently, with the relevant Departments, committee members should by all means have that discussion with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and tell them what would be more useful for committee members to have broken down.  We, for our part, will see what we can do.</p> <p>  Regarding the question about green budgeting and environmental budgeting, Deputy Farrell asked about some metrics that are being developed and the work that is under way in that regard.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that we have worked with EU and OECD colleagues and have had some peer-to-peer or virtual visits with colleagues in other jurisdictions to see some approaches to integrating environmental indicators within the budgetary cycle.  We are very much developing in that context.  In the context of the ongoing work on the national development plan, as the Deputy mentioned, and regarding capital expenditure, we have been working closely with colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to make sure there is a strong environmental focus that permeates right through the national development plan.  I will mention two specific initiatives.  I guess they will be spelled out more fully when the NDP is brought forward in due course.  One arises from some of our lessons from best international practice, including in the context of the Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting.  We are putting in place and have developed a process to conduct an environmental assessment or weighting of the different projects and programmes that are brought forward by each of the Departments in order that when it comes to the overall prioritisation and presentation of capital initiatives within the national development plan, that dimension can be taken systematically into account.  Beyond the NDP, we will look to see whether and to what extent this type of systematic approach to assessing and weighting by reference to environmental criteria can be brought forward beyond capital to current expenditure also.</p> <p>  The second point about capital expenditure is that we are engaged in another initiative to improve and upgrade our public spending code still further.  As the Deputy may be aware, we undertook a major update of the code and published it in late 2019.  We are also conducting a specific analysis to see how, when it comes to conducting appraisals of capital projects, the technical appraisal can integrate those environmental dimensions in a way that is more structured and more specific than has been the case in the past.  Those are two ways in which those environmental dimensions are being embedded into the capital side of things.</p> <p>  Deputy Farrell's final question related to overall capital expenditure and how Departments can be incentivised to spend.  It is the case that there was a capital carryover into 2020 and a high capital carryover into 2021 arising in part from the shutdown in works that took place during the first lockdown.  There are perhaps other issues that may be more specific to particular Departments and sectors.  One of the number of initiatives that will be developed and spelled out further in the context of the final NDP report will be a range of measures to improve capacity and capability and to professionalise skills within our public sector capacity for delivery in the context of some of those supports at the centre, whether in procurement, as the Deputy mentioned, or public-private partnerships and some of the technical analysis around that.  There is also other work on expert independent appraisal and how all this can be made more systematically available and more streamlined to develop that culture of professionalism.  We are talking about approximately &euro;10 billion in 2021 in capital expenditure, depending on what the NDP will come up with.  It will be of that order of magnitude of capital expenditure just about every year for the next five to ten years.  That requires that each Government Department and the system of how we interrelate with one another in the Civil Service and the public service are fit for purpose in making sure we can use that money in a timely way such that it delivers and has an impact as soon as possible for citizens.  That is the agenda we are working to in the context of the NDP and beyond.</p></speech>

I have ten minutes, so I will ask all my questions in one go and have plenty of time for the answers.  I am watching the monitor at the same time and if I have to leave, it will not be that I am being rude but I must go to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  The first issue I want to mention is performance monitoring and the extent to which the system is working adequately and is sufficiently incisive to identify trends that may have a negative impact on our economy, our financial independence, or whatever the case may be.  For example, alternatives in housing provision have gradually emerged in the past few weeks.  This has a direct impact on the State's finances because housing is a strategic element of our taxation system.  If we do not have affordable housing, we must pay people more to pay their mortgages and so on.   </p> <p>  Are the witnesses satisfied with the extent to which information available to the Department on an ongoing basis to alert them to changes that might have a positive or negative impact?</p> <p>  Deputy Lahart made some observations on working from home.  This is something that will affect our economic performance.  I think working from home is boring.  That is my opinion and it is not the only opinion.  Restricting oneself to working from home is not good for individuals for two reasons - boredom and lack of interaction with work colleagues and the work environment and the tendency towards working more hours, where people are forced to work by virtue of calls, commitments etc., when they are unable to do the work in the course of the day, which then drags on into the evening.  Some conscientious people will then try to work after hours.  That will further contribute to boredom and a poorer performance.  </p> <p>  Two other issues will affect our economic future.  We hear much about restoring houses in the centres of towns and villages to the market but we do not seem to stop and ask ourselves why such places are vacant now.  One reason is people could not stand the level of noise, interaction and traffic and the racket in the background at all times.  There are places on the main streets of towns and villages where sound barriers had to be erected inside buildings to ensure some quality of life for the people working there.  People also moved out of the main streets because it was not safe to have children there.  Where could they go?  If they stepped outside the door, they were in danger.  There are issues that should be borne in mind.  We can rely on these alternatives but we should not pretend that they are a panacea for our problems in the future because they are not.  </p> <p>  Working in hubs and centres throughout the country has considerable potential.  Industrial parks could be developed anywhere allowing access to the central location.  However, they must have communications, including top grade broadband.  They give people a work environment within easy reach of their homes.  They do not contribute to carbon footprints.  They are an important development.  They can have a huge impact on less populated parts of the country, of which there many, and can help address the lopsided nature of our economy.  </p> <p>  From all the information I have, our procurement system is slow moving, repetitive and is not something in the interest of the public.  I am not sure what the Department has found around that.  I acknowledge it was mentioned earlier, but it is an area on which we need to spend considerable time to make the procurement system efficient, effective and up-to-date.  A simple issue can go into the system at local level and emerge a year or two later.  That is ridiculous nonsense.  We cannot compete on world markets like that because we are competing with people who have developed nuances to a significant extent, and identified the negatives.</p> <p>  I must go into questions soon.  I will stay as long as I can but please do not be offended if I am seen running out.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening remarks, the performance report is just one element of a broader package.  It is almost the tip of the iceberg in the type and nature of the information available to policymakers to keep track of what is happening and to inform ongoing policy developments.  In this report, we are trying to focus on some of the key high level indicators.  As became clear in the discussion earlier with Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, there might be scope for separating things out a bit more or clarifying to zero in on those indicators that are of most relevance, certainly in this forum and in other sectoral committees.  Other analytical and evidential tools are available to policymakers in the civil and public service.  These include spending reviews.  Our Department has produced a series of spending reviews that focus on different aspects of the housing market and the relative efficiency and impact, for example of rental and leasing models versus purchase models.  Those all form part of that corpus of analytical information that can inform policymaking.  However, as we know from recent times, developments happen all the time that we need to keep on top of and aware of.</p></speech>

For example, approaches were made to me by people who wanted to invest in housing, as I am sure they were to everyone else, and I rejected them because it did not give to my constituents what I thought should be made available to them, that is, affordable housing within their reach.  If someone is intervening in the market, does one presume that they are there for the purpose of providing money for the market in order that people can be housed or are they intervening for a profit for themselves first and then go on from there?  Any intervention there is negative for the constituent.</p></speech>

Most obviously, my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and their interaction with local authorities who are on the front line in developing and implementing policy, weighing up the evidence and putting it into practice.</p><p>A separate point, which goes some way towards answering the Deputy's question, is that when it comes to assessing those particular policy choices there are different ways of approaching the analysis.  In spending reviews we look at it from the point of view of the value for money for the public purse or the Exchequer of the different interventions.  Part of the value for money consideration is not only the money being spent but what interventions will deliver in improved outcomes or housing outcomes for people.  Some relevant considerations are whether the State is holding on to or developing an asset over time or is the asset more of an ongoing recurring expenditure.  From the point of view of capital investment in housing, there are value for money advantages in the public sector developing its own asset base rather than purely having recourse to other models which involve ongoing payments.  The analytical approach is to look at the value for money aspect.  That is the overall amount of money going out and the efficiency and positive impacts of that for our citizens in delivering housing outcomes.  We are aware our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities often do not have the luxury of waiting for years for a particular policy to bear fruit, as intended.  They may have to adopt some short-term and immediate-term interventions to get people the housing they need.  In parallel with that, we understand colleagues are developing those medium and longer term policies which would put things on a more sustainable beneficial basis in the longer term.</p><p> The Deputy raised other important questions regarding working from home, including that it is not necessarily completely advantageous to work from home.  The Deputy mentioned some mental health related issues arising from the tedium of working in the same place all day and the blurring there can be between work and life that can impact on having a work-life balance.  Those are issues my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are reflecting on as we take account of and collate the different learnings from the experience to date.  Part of the solution or the space we may be evolving towards is hubs, to pick up on the Deputy&rsquo;s point, and the potential that may have to strike a better balance for some people.  Some of the negatives in working from home that people report are the lack of social and direct interaction with their peers and colleagues and the learning by osmosis and interaction that takes place.  There is scope in hubs for some of those benefits to be captured.  There are regional development benefits with respect to regional hubs.  All of that is currently in the mix.  If we are moving towards a blended approach, whether it be the traditional workplace, working from home or a blend that will incorporate some of those regional hubs, that is all being currently considered.</p><p> I recall being at a meeting prior to the pandemic with some senior officials at which remote working was mentioned and someone around the table expressed the view that remote working or people working from home would never work and that we focus exclusively on people working in hubs, which was the way to go.  There was much nodding of heads at the time.  My experience of working from home for the past year has changed my thinking on that for what it is worth.  I have seen civil servants work extremely well and effectively from home.  I am working from home today but I have been in the office a few days this week.</p></speech>

I will confine my remarks to a number of straight questions.  When we talk about budgetary oversight, the way we spend money and if we are getting value for the money we spend, an issue related to housing that increasingly comes to mind is the amount of money we spend on the housing assistance payment scheme and what return we will get from that in the long term.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  I will move on to capital expenditure.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the procurement process.  I believe we have created a procurement process which has created a procurement industry in its own right. We have created something that is not giving us any more value for money.  We seem to have over-complicated the process, introduced a great number of rules and regulations and distanced ourselves from the smaller suppliers and contractors in the regions who have walked away from public contracts on the basis that the process is too complicated and they could not be bothered with it.  We are not getting value for money in the long term because local businesses which were sponsoring events in schools or communities are being excluded.  When one wants to buy photocopying paper one must buy it centrally from some place in the country and get it delivered and one does not know what quality of it will be or if left short of an item one does not know who to contact, and the threat is if that one does not comply with the process one will lose one's capitation grant.  </p> <p>  On the capital expenditure side, the public private partnership contracts we have put in place leave a great deal of liability with the State.  The witnesses might give their view on that.  I will cite a good example of that.  The capital build of the 14 primary care centres in this country has left the HSE without any control over the buildings.  I can vouch for that.  The HSE cannot change anything structurally in the buildings for the next 25 years without, first, getting the permission of the public private partnership company and, second, getting a cost from it on it.  Something has gone wrong on that.  That public private partnership process took three years.  It was going to deliver everything and anything and now when it has been worked out I wonder how we will measure that.  For instance, currently the public private partnership company is refusing to allow a water main to go through a site which is owned by the HSE to service another HSE site.  What is going on is baffling.  </p> <p>  Public works contracts need to be examined and addressed.  We have created public works contracts which are very adversarial and confrontational and they are not achieving what they set out to achieve, which was certainty in terms of cost, time and quality.  It is now the norm for those in the construction industry to go to mediation, conciliation and arbitration.  That must be a fantastic business for people who are in that game but such conciliation or arbitration must be costing the State, the taxpayer and public purse a great deal of money and that money should be spent on building structures.</p> <p>  We are coming out of a pandemic and there are major inflationary pressures in terms of capital works and how they will be delivered.  How do we measure or consider that as we start to spend money into the future?</p><p>Will the carryover that we have had for the past two years, when we did not have public spend, be spent?  My entire frustration is based around the fact that the day it is decided to do a capital project, it takes on average about seven years before we get a contractor on site.  Something has gone wrong that was not there 20 years ago.  We have created a huge plethora of paperwork and mini-industries within the industries.  How can we unravel that and what is the Department's take on that?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done several spending review analyses and produced a series of analytical papers which have had a critical look at the relative return on the HAP-type models versus building-type models.  I refer the Deputy to some of the findings from those spending review papers.</p> <p>  Our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have their own priorities.  There is always a balance to be struck between meeting the immediate needs of someone who actually needs to have their housing situation addressed versus putting in place some long-term developmental measures.  The people best placed to directly address those important issues are my colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>  To the extent that this performance report sheds some light on some of those policy achievements, policy trade-offs and value for money, if Deputies want more indicators to be developed to help them in their oversight work, we are happy to listen to what emerges from discussions.</p> <p>  As regards procurement, my colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement are the experts in all of this.  The Deputy raised an issue about risk.  On the one hand, we have a highly developed and professionalised public procurement system.  It delivers many benefits in terms of integrity, consistency, clients of European frameworks and so on.  In that sense, we have a best-in-class procurement model from a compliance perspective.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of whether this has come at a cost of some overcomplication, as well as at a cost of making things more difficult for local contractors and local businesses to get in on big contracts.  That is something my colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement are very much alive to.  For example, on page 85 of the performance report, there is a series of indicators from the Office of Government Procurement which includes the frameworks and mini-competitions which have been developed and implemented.  They were developed specifically with a view to facilitating engagement with a broader range of contractors, not just the biggest contractors.  Then there are the numbers of users on e-tenders and how matters are dealt with on the help desk and so on.  This is the sort of topic which would benefit from detailed engagement with the committee and my Office of Government Procurement colleagues directly.  I will certainly pass on some of those remarks.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned some issues with public works contracts.  I was not aware of the specific case about the 14 primary care centres which the Deputy said has given rise to some issues.  Public private partnerships, PPPs, have some pros and cons to them.  As a model, they have been quite effective in rolling out a round of public infrastructure with the involvement of private partners, both national and international.  This has been seen with the provision of, for example, schools and courthouses.</p> <p>  Among the benefits of public private partnerships, if things go wrong, say one of the contractors goes bust, the State can be protected from some of the financial fallout which would not arise otherwise.  We saw that in recent years when school building projects have run into issues but it was all dealt with on the private rather than the public side of the equation.  There are benefits.  It is a question of the trade-off and the balance of benefits versus costs and various risks.  I was not aware of issues about control, access, operation and capabilities associated with these buildings.  I will take that up with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to see what specifically the case is.</p> <p>  With regard to the more general points the Deputy raised about public works contracts and whether they have become overly adversarial over time, this is an issue under review.  Colleagues in the Office of Government Procurement who are responsible for the public works contract are undertaking a review of that, including with regard to some of those issues the Deputy raised.</p> <p>  The final point the Deputy raised is about capital expenditure and the degree to which it could give rise to inflationary consequences, for example.  We are aware of the fact that there has been a huge ramping up of capital expenditure over recent years, not just in the context of the pandemic response.  Even before we take account of capital carryover and exceptional pandemic payments, this year we are at over &euro;10 billion in capital expenditure.  It is the largest level of capital expenditure in the history of the State.  That carries with it some challenges in terms of ability.  As I mentioned earlier, there is an obligation on the public sector to work with colleagues across the sector, while developing our capabilities and having a professional relationship with colleagues in the private sector.  That is something we are actively working on at the moment.</p> <p>  We commissioned a report from EY to review phase 1 of the national development plan to look at different aspects and dimensions of what needs to be upgraded in terms of public sector capability.  There are many areas of good practice but also much work to be done.  We are working on that.  Just last Friday-----</p></speech>

The target for older people in receipt of intensive home care packages was 235 but only 149 were delivered.  The target for the number of home support hours provided from intensive care home packages was 363,000 hours but only 276,000 were delivered.  What are the reasons behind this?</p></speech>

The pandemic situation will play a role in that regard.  I note, for example, on page 11 that there was a target for last year of 273,000 for working-age income support payments and 692,000 were delivered.  That includes all the pandemic unemployment payments.  Some trends go in other directions throughout the Department's Vote.  The best way to run that to earth, so to speak, is to talk directly with colleagues in the Department of Social Protection, who I am sure would be happy to go through each of those indicators and give the explanation.  That is exactly what this report is intended to do.  It is intended to show what we are trying to achieve and whether we are ahead of target or below target, and therefore to support the committee in its role of asking critical questions of civil servants like us as to what has been accomplished.</p></speech>

The health service has taken an awful battering in the past year.  There are already long waiting lists and they are probably going to get much longer.  I am concerned about the long-term effects.

That was to achieve a number of objectives.  The first was for specific Covid-related interventions, for example, getting extra support from private hospitals and getting extra PPE.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of focus in the Department of Health and in the HSE on addressing some capacity gaps and improving the number of critical care beds in hospitals.  That has been upgraded.  There are some learnings from the pandemic experience about the readiness and resilience of the health system.  The Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan was introduced last week, and I am sure the Deputy is aware of the very high level of ambition for what it going to be rolled out.  That will have resourcing implications as well that we will need to consider carefully.</p></speech>

We talked this morning about value for money.  When the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform undertakes a value-for-money exercise, what are the timeframes involved?  This is possibly different across Departments.  I am asking the question with an eye to the future and the use of capital funds to address environmental issues such as flooding because it might need a different contextualisation in terms of value for money than we have been used to in the past.  I also ask in view of decisions on the leasing of social homes.</p></speech>

When we upgraded the public spending code in late 2019, one of the issues that we looked at was the proper time horizon to discount out costs and benefits into the future.  We extended the overall time horizon to capture benefits to 20 years and in some cases 25 years.  This is something we are looking at in the context of the ongoing revision of the public spending code.  A case could also be made for potentially even longer time horizons in the context of intergenerational environmental and transformational projects to come up with a longer time period for those costs and benefits to be discounted but incorporated into that frame of reference.  When it comes to applying those frameworks then on issues like social housing, the 20-year to 25-year horizons are the timeframes that we have in mind.</p></speech>

How exactly that is conducted and how the results of that are weighed into the reckoning is a matter for each Department concerned.</p></speech>

When we looked at the upgrade of the public spending code in late 2019, we looked at international practice on capital appraisal guidelines, our traditional ones and some international examples.  In general terms, when it comes to capital infrastructure, these are the kind of time horizons that tend to be used internationally.  It might be useful if I follow up directly with you, Chairman, with a more detailed response specifically on those time horizons.</p></speech>

I am probably biased because of my background, but some homes do not last for 25 years so I wonder if that is coming from the duration of an average social tenancy or what the reason is.  Some of the social homes we have built in the past are approaching 100 years old now and are still going strong.  That is something the committee might return to at some stage.</p> <p>  For someone who is relatively new to this and is somewhat reading it from the outside, this report has been very useful in terms of understanding how various Departments operate.  I will outline what might be helpful for me so as to address some of the opacity.  The discussion around equality budgeting and green budgeting are taking shape for the future and I am trying to understand how budgets have been formed in the past and what the metrics are within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for deciding on how money is spent.  At what level do alarm bells go off when faced with a Department that is underperforming in particular areas of expenditure?  I ask the question in the context of what happens the next year.  I have done it in a university context and any of us who has ever run a budget before knows that if one does not spend one's budget, one often does not get the same budget again.</p><p>I am looking at page 18 on disability services, items 3 and 4.  Output 3 is "Centre-based respite nights provided to people with disabilities" and output 4 is "Movements facilitated from congregated to community settings".  Both of these are massive issues in society at the moment.  The proportion of both targets delivered is in the region of 50%.  I am just using these as an example; I do not really want to go into the weeds with the details.  At what stage do alarm bells go off within the Department?  What is the response?  How is it dealt with?  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform go to the relevant Department and ask what the issue is?  What is the performance response?</p></speech>

This is usually conducted through what we call our Vote sections.  For example, there is a section for the health Vote which deals with our colleagues in the Department of Health and an agriculture Vote section for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Part of the role of these sections is to engage in discussion and dialogue with counterparts in the line Departments to monitor the degree to which the Estimates allocation, the voted allocation, is being drawn down and spent on the capital investment and services for which the moneys were allocated.  We cannot micromanage each particular area.  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of each Department to make sure that the money is used effectively for the purposes for which it was allocated.  The head of each Department is the Accounting Officer.  That person has to give an account of how the money is used to the D&aacute;il.  There is a whole process which involves the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sectoral committees and the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

It makes a proposal as to the money it needs based on the programmes it wants to run.  As much as a Department has some discretion as to how to allocate its funds, there is an understanding with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as to how those funds will be used.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It is not a situation whereby, if a Department underperforms, we will automatically give it less money.  We have to listen to what colleagues have to say.  I know the Chair is not zeroing in on those particular examples but I imagine that, if my colleagues in the Department of Health are listening in, they will probably be screaming at their screens and asking how they possibly could have moved people from congregated community settings as anticipated last year when there was a lockdown and when movement was not possible.  That is an example of something envisaged at the start of the year that turned out not to be possible or practicable as the year went on.  In some cases, there is an explanation for why a Department did not achieve what it envisaged.</p></speech>

I completely accept that with regard to the Department of Health but I am asking whether, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's point of view, there is a particular benchmark or percentage point at which particular protocols click into action.  For example, it might be if a Department spent less than 80% of what was allocated for a given purpose.  Are there protocols in place whereby particular underspends are identified?</p></speech>

We have ongoing discussion and engagement with Departments.  The Department of Health, for example, has a budget of &euro;21 billion and it is its own job to manage that money.  Particular critical issues will come to our attention from time to time.  We tend to focus on key priority issues.  It is on these that we engage.  If we have particular concerns about value for money or non-delivery, we will focus on those issues.  There are also other processes that support us on an ongoing year-to-year basis and help us to get an understanding of what is working well and what is not going so smoothly in particular areas.  We have to prioritise our focus towards those areas from time to time.  For example, to take the year just gone, although it was, of course, not a typical year, we had extensive and intensive engagement with colleagues in the Department of Health on issues such as the arrangements with private hospitals to secure extra capacity during the course of 2020 and expenditure on personal protective equipment, PPE, and how such PPE was being procured and expended.  We also engaged with the Department in respect of its engagements with nursing homes and the kinds of special measures that needed to be put in place to protect people and standards in those facilities.  We also engaged with regard to some other issues regarding the overall trend in expenditure and whether it was above or below profile.</p> <p>  There is a range of tools available to us.  Some are at the technical level.  At the start of each year, Departments put in place a profile of expenditure showing how they expect expenditure to roll out month to month.  We engage closely with them on that.  Other issues are more policy-specific.  A particular priority may be associated with a particular topic or we may be aware of a difficulty we want to explore in more detail.  That is how things move forward.  There is an understanding and implicit assumption that when Departments are allocated a given amount of money to achieve certain objectives, we give them sanction or permission to spend the money for that purpose but that it up to them to make it happen.  We cannot monitor each and every project and microproject but we can monitor things in general terms and zero in on the areas that are of more concern to us.</p></speech>

One of the projects we have under way at the moment relates to the policy-proofing of measures.  I have already mentioned the public spending code, which people tend to think about by reference to capital programmes.  We are upgrading this code by reference to current spending programmes.  Since that page is open, if someone were to bring forward a proposal to improve disability services in a particular way, the Department concerned would have to bring forward a proposal in a structured way that makes it clear how much money was to be spent and what the impact would be across different dimensions, including the impact on equality.  This equality provision obviously affects people with disabilities but there would also be intersecting issues relating to gender and ethnicity.  Issues of regional balance might also arise.  In that more structured format, there will be a greater opening for both ourselves in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and for Oireachtas select committees to engage with Departments as to whether particular projects and programmes are achieving their objectives.</p></speech>

One of my questions was going to have regard to where the well-being budget indicators actually come in, whether they come in at the beginning of the process or at the end.  It sounds like they will come in more towards the beginning of the process when the budget is being formed and developed.  Am I understanding correctly?</p></speech>

To expand just a little bit, I will mention one of the things we have learned from experience with regard to how we manage capital expenditure programmes as against how we manage current expenditure programmes.  We have reached a pretty structured approach with regard to capital projects.  With the new public spending code, there is a project lifecycle.</p><p>One of the lessons we learned when capital projects, including big ones, went wrong over the years was that a lack of effort and attention to detail at the outset of the planning stage will bedevil a project all the way through, including in respect of monitoring its effectiveness.  This lesson should apply, in principle, to current programmes such that, right at the outset, before a well-meaning or nice-sounding project comes forward, we will have to do some due diligence to be clear on what we are trying to achieve with it and to determine how we will know whether it succeeds and its likely impacts in terms of the various dimensions of quality.  Once that rigorous process takes place at the outset, it puts all of us, as policy stakeholders, in a better position to monitor and hold people accountable for what is delivered.  Unfortunately, what can tend to happen not only in Ireland but also in other countries is that where a project is proposed based on some brainwave or other, there can be an impetus to move forward with it before it is subject to the rigours I have mentioned.  People may criticise the latter as causing a delay or being overly bureaucratic but we have certainly learned the lesson on the capital side that more focus on getting things right at the outset stands us in good stead throughout the project lifecycle.  Those good principles also apply on the current side.</p></speech>

An internal working group with representatives from each of the Departments is providing the input at Government level.  The external co-ordination is being done by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  NESC has been running extensive consultation over the past couple of months.  That will feed into the well-being framework and the set of indicators.  The plan is to have these published before the summer.  As Mr. Downes has outlined, that certainly provides a starting point for us within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in terms of embedding the work within the public policy and performance budgeting frameworks.  It will be an iterative process.  We will have an initial framework set out at a high level with a set of indicators.  The plan is that the CSO will manage the dashboard that provides information on progress against the indicators.  The challenge for us, as a Department, is to embed that within the overall policy-making and budgetary work.</p></speech>

I was aware that NESC is undertaking the consultation.  I very much hope it will be iterative and include academics and universities, but also community groups on the ground working in various areas.</p> <p>  I am aware that other countries that have introduced well-being indicators have somewhat struggled with the differentiation between objective and subjective indicators.  There are obvious areas where the CSO would be very strong and be able to give hard data, for example, but some countries have allowed the public to engage throughout the process and throughout the life of the well-being indicators, not just during the creation of the system.  Every year, they have an input.  What access does the public have now, and what access will they have throughout the use of a well-being budget?</p></speech>

The fundamental aspect is setting out the dimensions and what we are trying to capture within them.  What flows from that is the selection of the indicators.  NESC has an input regarding the dimensions, or what should be captured, and the indicators.  I am not involved in the NESC process so I am not entirely clear about its current position.  We make a presentation to NESC to outline how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform can have an input, take the work and embed it within our own work in the coming years.  There is an internal discussion in the interdepartmental group considering the selection of indicators.  Some of the proposals on indicators are subjective and others are objective.  Some of them are already available but they are not available annually.  There are surveys that are carried out over years rather than annually.  The types of issues that are being discussed internally relate to the balance between objective and subjective and the question of how subjective indicators, if we are to opt for them, will be measured.  We are still at the stage where the initial selection of indicators is being made.  The plan is to have a relatively focused set of indicators for each of the dimensions but, over time, as we expand this aspect within the broader policy-making and budgetary work, the objective is to have clear linkages between the indicators that sit below the overall framework and the indicators that are being captured at a national level.</p></speech>

Simply asking people how they feel about how money is being spent on their behalf is a useful exercise.</p></speech>

To complement what Mr. Kinnane has just said, there is also work ongoing in our Department on developing the Our Public Service strategy, which concerns the principles that underpin the kind of public service we provide and how we provide it.  One of the three pillars in this strategy involves the citizen focus and listening to what citizens have to say to us about what they feel about the services and the quality of the services they are getting.  That would be in the spirit of what the Chairman has just indicated.  We will certainly reflect on the extent to which we can accommodate that thinking within our well-being budgeting framework.</p></speech>

To finish on the issue of the well-being budget, I have two questions.  One of the witnesses said we would see something before the summer.  When will the system be fully up and running and implemented in our annual budgetary development?  The witnesses will probably have seen from our report that this committee has addressed or is interested in the budgetary cycle, including the timing of reports and decisions, the associated intersection with the important work of sectoral committees and the question of how we can improve that.  Do the witnesses envisage that the implementation of initiatives like well-being, green and equality budgets will have an impact on the budgetary cycle?  If so, how would it happen?</p></speech>

It could serve many very useful purposes.  As Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell mentioned earlier, the ambition of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to have an overarching framework which can be an anchor around which we can build many of our processes and a common frame of reference for what we do both in how we design policy and how we account for the achievements and accomplishments of policy.  Having that in place by the summer is just the first step in setting the parameters for that framework.  How we use it and embed it within our policy processes and our accountability processes into the future will be an ongoing process.</p><p> The Chairman asked whether there should be or could be an impact for processes and the budgetary cycle.  That will be worked through, including in the context of the implementation of the various recommendations from this committee's report.  We have an annual cycle which at least in principle should lend itself to segmenting different parts of the year for different areas of focus or perhaps in parallel for different things to be brought forward.  I believe one of the recommendations of the report was that once the Estimates are presented to the D&aacute;il in December, to try to have the various D&aacute;il committees conduct their analysis of the Estimates by the end of January.  That could allow space for more detailed engagement with the sectoral committees and the line Departments during the spring.</p><p> There are some recommendations in the committee's report about pre-budget engagement.  While I do not think that equality budgeting or green budgeting in themselves would be drivers of a changed budgetary cycle, they could facilitate useful discussions at different stages of the budgetary cycle as it evolves.</p></speech>

We have mentioned capital spending a number of times this morning.  In recent months at several committees and also in the media there has been discussion about various versions of valuations, particularly with NAMA coming to an end.  I understand that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was doing some work on standardising the process for valuation and introducing some controls on that.  I ask Mr. Downes to comment.</p></speech>

We have had some experiences in the past where early guesstimates and projections have become crystallised or maybe have taken on a life of their own in public discourse as though they were some sort of analytically based sound estimates and projections for capital projects, which is not always the case.</p> <p>  Part of the guidance in the new public spending code is to be more circumspect about the bands and the nature of projections at any point in time, and to ensure that the various risks to project assessment are suitably factored in.  The experience nationally and internationally is that there may be a figure in mind at a very early stage when a project is at the conceptual stage but then issues, complications and inflationary factors arise, and things move in a different direction.  It is only at a certain point in the process that those risks can be stripped out.</p> <p>  The Chairman also mentioned valuations for holdings.  I would not be an expert when it comes to holdings of stocks and shares and things like that.  </p></speech>

I am thinking more of the purchase or disposal of lands.  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform set out a particular standard for valuation and the timeliness of those valuations for other Departments when they are engaging in that work?</p></speech>

The rules relating to the public spending code and public financial procedures require people to get the best valuation at a particular time.  When a disposal or a prospective disposal of land is involved, valuation professionals would be called upon to give guidance.  In those cases, there is less speculation and more professional valuation.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to representatives of Decision Support Service: &Aacute;ine Flynn, director; Joanna Macklin, head of the panel of management; Kate Frowein, head of registration and supervision; Patsy Fitzsimons, head of complaints and investigation; and to Mr. Ian Grehan.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex or the complex in the convention centre.  If members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm whether they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus or the convention centre prior to making a contribution.  For anyone watching the meeting online, witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely due to unprecedented circumstances.  I ask everyone to bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether or to what extent the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they should respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice not to comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call Ms Flynn, director of the Decision Support Service, to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I have sent on my opening statement.</p> <p>  In my opening statement, I propose to set out the key reforms introduced by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, to provide an update on the Decision Support Service, DSS, establishment project, including timelines and dependencies and throughout to comment on how the 2015 Act interfaces with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.</p> <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is significant and long-awaited legislation.  According to its Long Title, it is: "An Act to provide for the reform of the law relating to persons who require or may require assistance in exercising their decision-making capacity, whether immediately or in the future."  The signing of the Act on 30 December 2015 followed a protracted legislative process and extensive consultation and it has been broadly welcomed as reforming, human rights-based legislation.  On enactment, it was described by Inclusion Ireland as "a seismic cultural shift away from a paternalistic and 'best interests' approach ... to a rights-based approach of choice, control and consent".  The Act applies only to adults and, according to early estimates provided by the Department of Justice, as many as 220,000 adults could potentially benefit from the new statutory framework.  This figure includes adults with decision-making capacity difficulties due to intellectual disability, acquired brain injury, enduring mental illness and age-related cognitive impairment.  It would be wrong, however, to presume that any one of those 220,000 people will necessarily come within the ambit of the Act.  That will depend on their individual circumstances.  Equally, it would be a mistake to think that this legislation is targeted at or belongs to a particular cohort of people.  Any of us could experience difficulties with our decision-making capacity in the future due to illness or injury and the Act provides important tools for advance planning. Therefore, this is an Act for everyone.</p> <p>  Although fully enacted, the 2015 Act is largely not yet commenced and intensive work to prepare for commencement is ongoing.  Commencement of the Act has been identified as a priority in the current programme for Government and essential to compliance with CRPD.  The 2015 Act is regarded by the State as the principal legislative reform required to give full effect to its obligations under Article 12 of the CRPD, which requires that: "States Parties shall recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life."  I am aware that other stakeholders who have appeared before this committee have called for the Act to be operationalised as a matter of urgency and their impatience is understandable.</p> <p>  I turn to the key reforms contained in the 2015 Act.  These may be summarised as follows.  The first is the abolition of wardship.  The Act abolishes the wards of court system, which currently operates under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  When a person is taken into wardship, the court declares the person to be "of unsound mind and incapable of managing his or her person or property".  This has been described as a blunt instrument.  In 2019, the Supreme Court acknowledged that an order for wardship can deprive a person of the power to make many of the choices which are fundamental and integral to day-to-day life and that orders can be over-broad in their effect and disproportionate in their scope.  Following commencement of the 2015 Act, there will be no further applications for wardship, and all current adult wards will have their cases reviewed by the wardship court within three years.  These wards may have their assets and their autonomy fully restored or, where appropriate, will transition to the new supports available under the 2015 Act.  The DSS understands there are approximately 2,300 such adult wards at present.</p> <p>  The Act also repeals the Marriage of Lunatics Act of 1811.  This repeal came into effect on 1 February, so wards are no longer prohibited from marrying. </p> <p>  Significantly, these antique Acts from 1811 and 1871 are the only two pieces of legislation which the 2015 Act repeals.  There is nothing else to repeal.  The 2015 Act introduces structure and regulation to the area of decision-making and capacity, where currently we often operate based on custom and practice.  There is a tenacious but unfounded proposition that the next of kin enjoys some presumed status as a substitute decision-maker who can supply or withhold consent on behalf of another adult.  There is no legal basis for such a proposition.</p> <p>  A second key reform concerns the functional assessment of capacity.  Under the Act, capacity is defined in a time-specific and issue-specific way.  Section 3 states: "A person&rsquo;s capacity [is] assessed on the basis of his or her ability to understand, at the time that a decision is to be made, the nature and consequences of the decision to be made by him or her in the context of the available choices at [the] time."  Incapacity is not a status as in wardship and is not linked to a medical diagnosis. The intention of the 2015 Act was to adopt a disability-neutral approach, so that a person lacks capacity in respect of a particular decision if he or she is unable to understand the information relevant to the decision, retain that information long enough to make a voluntary choice, use or weigh up the information, and communicate his or her decision, with assistance if necessary.  This is already the applicable standard at common law, having been articulated by the High Court more than 12 years ago.  The functional assessment has already been adopted in standards and policy, including the HSE national consent policy and the Medical Council&rsquo;s guide to professional conduct and ethics.</p> <p>  Section 8 of the Act sets out a number of important guiding principles to ensure the rights of the "relevant person", who is defined as "a person whose capacity is in question or may shortly be in question in respect of one or more than one matter".</p><p> As we see it, the 2015 Act&rsquo;s fundamental purpose is to ensure that the relevant person is supported to make his or her own decisions as far as possible.  The guiding principles include the following: the presumption of capacity; a relevant person shall not be considered to lack capacity to make a decision unless all practicable steps have been taken to help him or her to do so; a person is not considered to lack capacity on the basis of having made or being likely to make an unwise decision; there is minimal restriction of the relevant person&rsquo;s rights and freedom of action; respect for dignity, bodily integrity, privacy, autonomy and control over one&rsquo;s affairs; respect for a person&rsquo;s past and present will and preferences; and to act in good faith and for the benefit of the relevant person.</p><p> Respect for will and preferences has been held up by the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as essential to Article 12.  The committee has emphatically rejected any approach based on a person&rsquo;s best interests. &ldquo;Best interests&rdquo; as a standard is not mentioned anywhere in the 2015 Act.  It is notable and encouraging that the recent statutory instrument to facilitate the Covid-19 vaccination programme contains a requirement to ascertain the will and preferences of a person who cannot supply consent.  We understand that this is the first reference to will and preferences in legislation other than in the 2015 Act itself.  At present, the guiding principles apply only to &ldquo;interveners&rdquo;, as defined.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, has called for an amendment to broaden the remit of the guiding principles so they are of general application.</p><p> I turn now to the three-tier framework of supports.  Decisions under the Act are broadly defined and divided into two categories: property and affairs; and personal welfare, including healthcare.  All such decisions are capable of being supported within the new graduated framework.  At the lowest, least formal level on the framework, the relevant person may appoint a decision-making assistant to help to gather up and interpret information and communicate the relevant person&rsquo;s decision.  The relevant person is still the decision-maker.  At the middle tier, a relevant person may register a co-decision-making agreement, under which specified decisions are made jointly with an appointed trusted person.  At the upper level, there is provision for an application to the Circuit Court by any person who has a bona fide interest in the welfare of the relevant person.  Foreseeably, the applicant will often be a family member or carer, or the HSE, as is the case in a significant number of wardship applications.  The court may make a declaration that the relevant person lacks capacity in respect of a specified decision or decisions.  The court may either make the decision or may appoint a decision-making representative to make decisions on behalf of the person, under the supervision of the DSS.</p><p> In its General Comment 1, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities interpreted Article 12 as prohibiting substitute decision-making.  At the time of ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, the State entered a declaration permitting the retention of substitute decision-making in appropriate circumstances and subject to appropriate and effective safeguards.  Therefore, orders for substitute decision-making should be made as a last resort and only where lower-tier supports have been considered and discounted.  The court must apply all of the guiding principles, having regard to the known will and preferences of the relevant person.  Orders must be limited, where possible, in terms of time and scope, made subject to periodic review and may be re-entered before the court by the relevant person.  In line with Article 13 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which guarantees the right of access to justice, the Act provides for the relevant person to be heard by the court and to have access to representation and to legal aid.</p><p> The 2015 Act also provides two tools for advance planning to allow a person to plan ahead in case he or she loses capacity in the future.  First, enduring power of attorney, EPA, may already be created under the Powers of Attorney Act 1996.  The scope of an EPA is extended under the 2015 Act so that an attorney may now be appointed to take decisions in healthcare matters.  Attorneys under the 2015 Act will now be subject to a new form of supervision by the DSS.  Second, advance healthcare directives, AHDs, are placed on a statutory basis under Part 8 of the Act, the part of the Act which is the responsibility of the Department of Health.  The purpose of an advance healthcare directive is to allow a person to be treated according to their will and preferences and to provide healthcare professionals with information about a person's treatment choices.  A person may also appoint an agent, known as a designated healthcare representative in the AHD, to ensure that his or her AHD is complied with.</p><p> Part 8 states that the Minster for Health may make regulations to provide for the notification of the making of an advance healthcare directive to the director of the Decision Support Service and for the director to maintain a register of advance healthcare directives.  It is the view of the DSS that these regulations would enhance the operation of Part 8 and would benefit the person and healthcare professionals alike.  However, we are informed by the Department of Health that the absence of unique health identifiers is an obstacle that must be overcome before these regulations can be written.</p><p> Certain other matters in Part 8 require attention by the Department of Health.  The DSS and the Mental Health Commission have called for the amendment of a section which provides that an advance healthcare directive is effective if the person is detained under the Mental Health Acts and purporting to refuse mental health treatments.  It is our stated view that this is discriminatory.  The section dealing with the applicability of advance healthcare directives in pregnancy also requires review following other legislative changes since the Act was passed.</p><p> The 2015 Act establishes the office of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, MHC.  The MHC has proved to be a very good home for the DSS as it has important experience of applying reforming human rights legislation to develop new structures.  The support of MHC colleagues has been invaluable to the DSS establishment project.  The principal functions of the director are as follows: to promote public awareness in relation to the Act and related matters, including the CRPD; to provide information and guidance; to set up a website; to establish and maintain searchable registers of decision support arrangements; to regulate and supervise the activities of &ldquo;decision supporters&rdquo;; to receive and investigate complaints; to appoint four separate panels of suitable persons to assist with certain statutory functions; to furnish reports to the Ministers and make recommendations on the operation of the Act; and to act as the central authority under the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults.  The director may also publish a suite of codes of practice to provide guidance, including guidance for certain categories of professionals.  In general terms, the Act provides for significant regulation and oversight of the new support arrangements.  This is in keeping with the requirement under Article 14 of the CRPD to ensure liberty and security of the person.</p><p> I will now give an update on the DSS establishment project and our dependencies.  Responsibility for the 2015 Act and the DSS transferred from the Department of Justice to the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in October 2020.  The level of engagement with and the support of the new Department and of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability have been very welcome.  An interdepartmental steering group for the implementation of the DSS has been in place since 2016.  It is now chaired by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with membership from the MHC, the DSS, the Courts Service, the HSE national office for human rights and equality policy, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice.  I was appointed to the post of director in October of 2017 at a time when the only blueprint for the establishment of the DSS was the Act itself.  The project is well under way and comprises six work streams, with 28 sub-projects.  Progress has continued without interruption while we have been working remotely during the last 14 months.  The project is subject to detailed oversight and reporting requirements, internally and externally.</p><p> Our vision for the DSS is for a person-centred, accessible service with a digital-first approach, while we must accommodate the challenges that some of our stakeholders may experience with digital literacy and connectivity.  Key milestones to date within the establishment project have included the following: the appointment of an experienced DSS senior management team, who accompany me today; development of our organisation design and workforce planning strategy; mapping of approximately 60 detailed business processes; policy development; development of proposals around fees for our services, noting that costs must not be a barrier to those accessing our service; commencement of the ICT project with departmental approval, and a provider has been procured and is in place since July 2020; the review of codes of practice drafted by the National Disability Authority and the HSE ministerial working group, in preparation for public consultation; the launch of our website in August 2020; demand forecasting to support our planning activities; preparations for panel recruitment; extensive and diverse stakeholder engagement, including the procurement of Inclusion Ireland to facilitate focus groups of potential future service users; and development of our communications plan.</p><p> At the request of the Department of Justice, a detailed 24-month, costed plan for the establishment of the DSS was presented to the interdepartmental steering group at the beginning of 2020.</p><p>This proposes that the DSS would commence operations in mid 2022.  The plan was approved by the steering group members.  The requested uplift in budget allocation was achieved for 2021 and the  Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has publicly committed to a date for full commencement of the Act, which is 20 June 2022.</p><p> Regarding dependencies, as set out in our 24-month plan, the timeline for commencement of the DSS is subject to a number of external dependencies that affect the critical path of the project.  These include: budget allocation; sanctioning of posts as per our workforce plan; finalised amending legislation; finalised regulations to provide for multiple procedural and documentary matters; and decisions on fees for services and terms and conditions for panel members.</p><p> The Bill to amend the 2015 Act has been granted priority in the current legislative programme.  The amendments will address certain matters, some of a technical nature and others more substantive.  It is hoped that these will ensure the better functioning of the Act.  In particular, it is proposed to improve the position of current wards of court with regard to access to the court, to representation and to ongoing periodic review.</p><p> The readiness of the DSS is not the only precondition to commencement of the Act.  The 2015 Act will have impacts on stakeholders, including the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board, legal and financial service providers and their regulators, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, disability services, and generally across health and social care.  There is much preparatory work to be done in these sectors.  There must be support for training and education and the re-evaluation of policy and standards in line with the 2015 Act.  Appropriate supports are required to ensure that costs are not a barrier, where, for example formal legal documents and capacity statements are required to support the registration of arrangements with the DSS.</p><p> The DSS welcomes the recent amendment of the terms of reference of the interdepartmental steering group so that its purpose is not just to prepare for the implementation of the DSS but for the commencement of the Act.  It is our view that the appointment of a mandated single point of contact in the Department of Health to co-ordinate preparations for which it is responsible is now a matter of some urgency.  As part of our statutory functions, the DSS remains committed to working with all relevant stakeholders to provide information and to promote organisational change.

It was excellent and contained much important information.  I have three questions.  We have seen approximately 1,200 people taken into wardship since the enactment of the 2015 legislation, yet because of this slow pace, various levels of decision-making supports are not operational.  Wardship is, in my opinion and the opinion of many, including Ms Flynn, a blunt instrument.  We all agree that it is important that it be replaced by a new graduated framework of supports aligned to a person's need.  While it is disappointing that this is taking so long, it is welcome that we are seeing real progress.  The guidance from the President of the High Court regarding vaccines and wards, together with the memo from the HSE, was a welcome development in assisting healthcare professionals with approaching the matter of consent with regard to public health measures.  That was an issue for me.  It led me to think about how Covid had impacted us so much.  We had to take a minute because the law stipulates that consent is required for vaccination.  Some issues were thrown up which would highlight the importance of this Act.</p> <p>  We were expecting the establishment of the decision support service next year.  Has Covid had an impact on that?  There was an issue of funding.  Where are we now?  Is there likely to be more delay?  It is important to properly reconcile the Constitution, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>  We must support all adults who have difficulties with their decision-making capacity for medical access.  Can Ms Flynn talk me through the costs?  She gave some figures there.  I have concerns about costs involved which are not guaranteed under this legislation.  Medical card holders would be covered for any costs relating to supporting documentation from doctors but what about those without a medical card?  Have we a plan to make this affordable?</p> <p>  There was a report entitled Mind the Gap.  It was compiled by a researcher at the Centre for Disability Law and Policy at NUI Galway's Institute for Lifecourse and Society, and was commissioned by the Ombudsman for Children's office.  It stated, "the supports offered under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act apply only to adults, even though children and young people with disabilities might also benefit from specific and tailored decision-making supports, especially during the transition from childhood to adulthood".  Ms Flynn said that this is an Act for everyone.  Is that being discussed, especially at the age where a child becomes an adult?  I welcome that Ms Flynn spoke about awareness and websites.  I thank her for the valuable information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052000002#C00400"><p>It is concerning that since the Act was signed into law, people have continued to be admitted to wardship in some numbers.  I mentioned in my presentation today that there would be immediate provision for the review of all current adult wards of court.  We believe that, in total, they number something like 2,300.  That is a matter to be managed by the Office of Wards of Court, which will organise for those cases to be brought before the wardship court.  They are all entitled to bring themselves up the list if they want.  They do not have to wait for the wardship court to get to them and can bring their own applications to the court to have their cases reviewed and decisions made about their capacity and their need for further supports.  Many may choose to take that route.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether Covid-19 has had an impact on our establishment project.  We were able to mobilise quickly.  Perhaps it was an advantage of being in project mode rather than business as usual.  I offer my gratitude to colleagues who were able to make it happen.  We were able to adjust to remote working quickly and almost without interruption.  We were able to move on to remote working platform and the project was continuous.</p> <p>  I also welcomed the comments of the President of the High Court, the structure of the roll-out of the vaccination programme and the welcome use of the words "will" and "preference" in the context of people's consent to be administered the vaccine.  That was novel and we were glad to see it.</p> <p>  We are sensitive to the fact that costs must not be a barrier to service.  This cannot be something which only those of means are able to access, especially when one thinks of the importance to all of us of being able to plan ahead.  That is why I have described it as an Act for everybody.  We have presented proposals on fees for our services.  The Act also provides that there can be an abatement or full waiver of fees in certain circumstances.  That is important.  We have also received assurances that there is no imperative that we be a self-funding service.  That will be reviewed over time when we look at how we deliver when in business as usual mode, but the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said at an event of ours on 13 April that costs should not be an impediment.  That was very much a theme.  The Deputy asked how people of limited means, not just medical card holders, will be able to access services.  The Minister of State certainly had something to say about that.</p> <p>  There are certain arrangements under the Act which require a formality of presenting documentation, including a statement by a legal professional, and by medical and other healthcare professionals.  We are keen for people to be able to access those statements without costs getting in the way.  In the UK, the Office of the Public Guardian has looked at it and has been keen to make its service, which is narrower than ours, accessible.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the Centre for Disability Law and Policy's Mind the Gap study.  I was aware of its comments about how anyone under 18 is not served by this Act.  That is correct.  This is an Act which applies only to those over 18.</p><p>I am aware that in other jurisdictions with roughly comparable legislation, 16 and 17-year-olds are sometimes identified as a separate cohort and provision is made for those young adults.  That has not been part of the conversation here.  Again, it is something that may be kept under review.</p><p> Those minor wards who turn 18 years post commencement of the Act will enter in that transition period as well.  They do not have to wait until three years has passed before they are considered adults and are able to benefit from the review.  Those who age out, as it were, after the Act commences will also be due to have their cases considered in that transitional review period.  The position of younger adults is something to keep an eye on.</p></speech>

I thank all of the guests for attending the meeting to inform us about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the establishment of the Decision Support Service, DSS.  We all recognise the importance of this matter, particularly in terms of the full implementation of the UNCRPD that, without this Act, cannot be fully realised.</p> <p>  My first questions concern the timescale.  The Act was passed in 2015.  Was it always foreseen that it would take seven years for the Act to be operational?  Was there an issue with funding?  What issues delayed the Bill, if it was delayed, or was that always going to be the timescale?</p> <p>  In terms of the role of decision-making assistant, co-decision-maker or decision-making representative, will the process of engaging with the service be straightforward and uncomplicated?  How will people find information and access the service?</p> <p>  Does the DSS anticipate tension and possible opposition to the operation of the Act from family carers, especially those who care for family members with fairly complex disabilities who may feel, as next of kin, they know what is right for the person concerned?  Will family carers end up, in some cases, as the decision-making representative?  Is that possible or does it have to be someone who is neutral to the family?  Sometimes decisions could be made by a person that are contrary to what other persons in the family feel is the right thing.  If so, how can that situation be resolved?  How will the service communicate with people who are not verbal or have extreme or complex disabilities?</p> <p>  I had a question about costs but I believe Ms Flynn has dealt with the issue when she responded to the previous speaker.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052000002#D00300"><p>In terms of the timescale, I hope I have conveyed the impression there was rather a lot to do.  Quite honestly, when I came into the post, which was two years post commencement of the Act, I may have underestimated the sheer scale of what was involved.  The Act is dense and complex legislation.  It is ambitious and attempts more than comparable legislation in other jurisdictions.  There literally was a lot to do and the direction from early days was to do it all at once.  Some other Acts might be more amenable to an incremental roll-out but the decision had been taken, which was correct, that everything should come together and be green lit at once.</p> <p>  Having said that, we did hope it would be quicker.  There were funding issues, which we have been open about.  The direction was to do it quickly.  We had a plan and presented budget proposals relating to that but we did not get what we sought in terms of our allocation in either 2019 or 2020.  There was also some delay in achieving approval for our ICT project.  Again, that was linked somewhat to budget allocation.  There was a concern we would be committing to a vision for ICT without the funding to back it up.  There were delays of that nature.</p> <p>  Things stepped up, improved and had a much better sense of momentum and political will at the beginning of last year when we were asked to present a 24-month plan to commencement.  Ideally, we would have presented a 12-month plan to commencement and been resourced accordingly but it was considered at that point that a 24-month plan was realistic.  That plan was presented, endorsed and we got the budgetary uplift we sought for 2021.  A budget is only a year's budget so it will need to be backed up by a budget allocation in the coming year.  We will be entering into the Estimates process shortly having regard to the fact that, for the second half of next year, we will be an operating service with all of the associated costs, including fees for panel members.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the three tiers and the possible complexity of having to engage with our service.  We are very keen to ensure this is very much an accessible, public-facing and person-centred service.  Accessibility is going to be key and it is with that in mind that we have engaged with focus groups to try to get a sense of how well we will be able work with them and so we will be properly alert to their needs.  The CRPD would require that.  The codes of practice will help with that but we are also producing easy-read guides and other guidance materials on which my colleagues are hard at work.  We hope the engagement with us will be as straightforward as possible, and I can say a little more about that, if the Deputy wishes.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about particular sensitivities family carers might have.  We are aware of those.  My colleague, Ms Fitzsimons and I have recently engaged in workshops with Family Carers Ireland and its concerns can be distilled down to this: life is hard enough, and it is.  The task and ask of a family carer is no small thing.  We are very sensitive, therefore, to their apprehension that this might create a further burden and create undue formality, costs and complexity, and that they have always been the decision-makers and now they are being asked to do so in a formal and regulated way.</p> <p>  Our message is that we will work with them on that.  We are not setting people up to fail.  At the same time it is to bring home that message that where they may have thought they had a formal and authorised decision-making role up to this, they really do not because next of kin does not mean anything.  You do not have legal authority merely by virtue of that family relationship.  Our message is that, with this Act, you have the opportunity to step into a formal, recognised and unarguable legal role, so you have security of tenure so nobody can argue about your right to be in the room, to access information and, if necessary, to be the decision-maker.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether, at that upper tier of support, it would be appropriate for a family member to be the decision-maker, and the answer is "Yes".  The Act specifically spells out the court must have regard to the value of subsisting family relationships and to not interrupting those, as far as possible, having regard always to the wishes and value, the will and preference of the relevant person, himself or herself.  There is a very clear role and a preferred role for the trusted family member or friend.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about, and this is to be anticipated, whether there could be problems within the family dynamic, whether one family member will think a certain thing and the other will disagree.  The Act sets out notice requirements so that it is not possible for one family member to get in there ahead of other siblings, shall we say.  If we imagine a situation where siblings might have different and competing views about what is best for an elderly parent with age-related cognitive impairment, if one sibling were to attempt to apply to court and to step into that decision-making representative role, he or she cannot do so without putting other family members on notice.  Those other family members have an opportunity to input or to object, and they can do it on the lower tiers of support as well.</p> <p>  There will be decisions to be taken.  We will have to deal, perhaps, with objections that come our way, or the court might have to deal with objections to try to resolve difficulties.  Those difficulties could arise post the registration of the arrangements in terms of complaints and investigations.  Perhaps Ms Fitzsimons might want to say a word about how there will be provision for dealing with complaints and investigations, including alternative dispute resolution, which would be key to our processes.</p></speech>

The Act provides for the resolution of complaints in an informal way as quickly as possible.  We are, as part of our processes, setting up an informal resolution service within the DSS to help resolve those family conflict situations we anticipate will arise, because not everybody will agree on every point or every action a decision supporter is going to take.  We will have trained staff in the DSS to help resolve those family disputes that will ultimately arise.  If we cannot resolve them, then we will proceed to investigate the complaints and see if there is a need to go to court and have that person removed, ultimately, if needs be.  Obviously, our first port of call is to resolve disputes as quickly and as early as we can.</p></speech>

Deputy Tully touched on a couple of the questions I had intended to ask.  I was glad to hear about the consideration of carers because they are often such incredible advocates for the people they care for.  The idea that this is a pathway towards an unarguable legal role is an important message to get across to families who might be a little worried about what it might mean.  The volume of work the committee has ahead of it is considerable.  That this legislation was passed in 2015 but will really take full effect only in 2022 is, I have to say, disheartening in terms of the rate of change.  I hope there will be faster and better progress in this area.</p> <p>  I was struck by the point our guests made that this relates mostly to interveners and that they hope the remit could be broadened to give it a more general application.  Will they expand on what that would mean for other Departments and other sectors of society?</p> <p>  Where an order is enforced, who or what body sets out the time and scope of the order?  I refer in particular to the timing of the periodic reviews.  Is there an appeals mechanism within that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052000002#E00200"><p>I share the Deputy's view on timelines, to a large extent.  We are committed to a timeline taking us up to commencement and, subject to the dependencies I mentioned, it is a timeline we hope to meet.</p> <p>  On the question about the scope of an order, it is a court order and the Act has quite a level of detail about that.  We hope to engage further with court personnel and the Judiciary to provide input on training and a uniform approach insofar as possible, and a shared understanding of the Act and its ethos.  The Act sets out time limits for a review of a declaration of incapacity.  The declaration has to brought back before the court and kept under review.  I think the recommendation is for every 12 months or, at the most, every three years where there is a perception that the person is not going to recover capacity.  Even within that timeframe, the relevant person has a pathway back to court to seek to re-enter the matter and to have the court revisit the finding that he or she lacks capacity, and it can then revisit the decision-making representation order that has been put in place.  The Act is quite strong on the business of review and the continuing right of access to the court, and that is important for all sorts of considerations relating to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD.</p> <p>  The other, lower tier arrangements are subject to periodic review by us as well.  I refer in particular to the middle tier, the co-decision-making arrangement.  We have to be satisfied that a person's capacity, as declared under that arrangement, remains the true position.  There is quite a degree of oversight, and the Act in its drafting has been clearly person-centred in that regard.</p> <p>  To respond to the question on interveners, which relates to section 8 on the guiding principles under the Act, this has been something of a theme of ours and we have raised it with the Department of Health, and previously with the Department of Justice.  I do not want to get too niche or technical about it but those guiding principles I mentioned are really important.  They include the concept of will and preference, which is really at the heart of the Act.  They apply to interveners as defined, and interveners in turn are quite narrowly defined under the Act.  They are a category of persons that includes all the decision supporters I mentioned, the court, my own role and healthcare professionals carrying out a function under the Act.  A person is an intervener when he or she is carrying out an intervention, which in turn has quite a narrow definition.</p> <p>  Why are we taking these guiding principles, which also govern how we even assess capacity, and narrowing them down to quite a fixed category of people doing fixed things?  If this is about ushering in a new ethos and approach, why is it not just how we all do things in the future, relative to somebody who may have an issue with their decision-making capacity?  That is an idea that has gone back and forth a bit, and while I do not want to speak out of turn, it may be addressed in the amending legislation.</p> <p>  Having said that, the ethos and the key ideas of autonomy and respect for will and preference are taking hold in any event.  I mentioned that they can already be seen in other policy and standards, and they are infiltrating how we approach people who may have an issue with their decision-making capacity.  They can also be seen in other standards throughout health and social care.  That idea of a rights-based approach is taking hold.  It has been a theme of mine that I would have liked to see those guiding principles have a general application, but there may be-----</p></speech>

They apply only to interveners as within that narrow definition.  It is open to, for example, a solicitor dealing with somebody who has a question mark over his or her decision-making capacity to say those guiding principles are interesting but that they are over there and the solicitor is never an intervener because he or she do not fit within that definition.  There will be codes of practice for them, largely informed by those guiding principles, that will help but my view is it might have been useful if the guiding principles had a broader remit.</p></speech>

Deputy Tully and other members asked many of the questions I had prepared.  The DSS will have a great deal of co-operation with other stakeholders and many changes are coming down the road.  Based on our guests' engagement with those stakeholders, how prepared are they?  Might there be a backlog, with potholes that could be identified along the way?  How are the stakeholders being resourced to deal with them and how can that be improved?</p> <p>  This will be a very significant, though welcome, change of mindset in regard to how we look after people who might need the Act.  Does the DSS have a role to educate the general public on what the DSS will provide and to make us all aware of how we can ensure our loved ones are advocated for in the best way?</p></speech>

The HSE group, for example, is a small team but it has been doing a great deal of work since before I came on board to reach out across health and social care and to educate people about the provisions of the Act and the cultural change the Senator mentioned.  I think that, broadly speaking, there is receptiveness to that.</p> <p>  As for the practical preparations, as I mentioned earlier, it would be very beneficial if the Department of Health had a mandated single point of contact to co-ordinate its preparations, but thus far that has not happened.  The Department is represented on the interdepartmental steering group and I acknowledge it is busy at the moment with a variety of concerns.</p><p>There is the potential for the health and social care sector to be most affected by the Act so it would be useful to have a sense that somebody is steering all of the preparations.</p><p> We meet a diverse range of stakeholders and I find that I generally have to go back to first principles every time, which I do not mind because this is complex and new stuff.  The number of people who understand the Act and feel ready for it is relatively small.  That is to be understood and we need to work with people.</p><p> In terms of a huge change in mindset, that landscape is improving.  We often speak about a cultural shift but it is important not to overstate that.  I am aware of a growing receptiveness to change but some people have reservations and it is important that we deal with them.</p><p> We are considering awareness raising of the importance of having an accessible and very much public-facing service so that people feel they can engage with us.  We are already open for questions and are more than happy to take them.  We get questions all of the time and our website provides information on the Act.  We also have a section on getting ready that we endeavour to keep updated so that people feel prepared.</p></speech>

I want to use my time to relay the frustrations of the people who have been impacted by the fact that the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act has been delayed in its commencement and the implications a delay has on individuals.  The time that lapses between the introduction of legislation and its commencement can be years, which is hugely unfortunate.  In addition, it makes the introduction of legislation slightly redundant.  Stand-alone legislation seems like it is not good enough.  We need commencement, implementation, resources and regulation.</p> <p>  I am aware of specific difficulties with the ward of courts process from families I have had the pleasure of communicating with about the implications that this has for them and their families.  I welcome the point that has been made about the role of an existing carer or even a family member being afforded the opportunity to facilitate that decision-making capacity, and also that it has to be the will and preference of the individual in question.  That aspect is hugely important because the provisions have created a bit of nervousness within families about what is in store once the legislation is commenced.</p> <p>  The Mental Health Commission, in its 2019 annual report, noted that the ward of court process has been determined to be insufficient in hearing the voice of the ward and lacks safeguards in the interest of the ward.  Can DSS representatives discuss how the new service will ensure the voice of the relevant person?</p> <p>  There has been discursive conflict between the carers' interests and how carers have been depicted by designated adult protection officers, DAPOs, perhaps.  The witnesses have said that they are aware of the matter so I will move on.</p> <p>  I welcome the abolition of the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  It is hard to stomach that such archaic legislation held sway in a modern, 21st century Ireland.  Mr. John Dunne, Family Carers Ireland, has expressed deep concerns about a distinct lack of meaningful consultation with many different stakeholders and is dubious that these issues will be resolved over the next 12 months.  The organisation anticipates that anywhere between 10,000 and 25,000 people will want to register some aspect of a decision in court and he does not feel that many people will feel a direct benefit.  Will that volume of applicants be dealt with in a timely fashion?</p> <p>  I noted that Ms Flynn stated earlier when discussing the commencement that it was decided to have a 24-month project.  Please elaborate on why the project could not be more succinct and be for a 12-month period.  I ask because I am conscious that the situation will have a knock-on effect on families who have really needed an intervention for the past number of years and for the Act to be commenced.</p> <p>  Finally, does the DSS put excess stress and pressure on family carers?  The scheme relies on civil society to make it fly.  The intricacies of the duties and obligations of family carers get increasingly nuanced and complicated as more policies come into play.  Are there supports for family members who will take up the role in being able to implement decision-making effectively for the person in question?</p></speech>

I wish to briefly mention that there will be an amendment to the Act to improve the position of current wards of court, and to improve Part 6 of the Act, so that that voice is better heard in the context of the review of those current wards in terms of access to the court, representation and the same periodic reviews as the relevant person who is coming in brand new to the system.  I hope that I have made sense.  We have been assured that there will be access to a scheme of legal aid and we have spoken to the Legal Aid Board about its preparations.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the 24-month project could have been shorter.  I wish it had been a 12-month project.  I suppose with speed comes extra cost and that is what we were asked to produce.  We produced a 12-month plan but the 24-month plan was the one that was approved and considered realistic in terms of resources plus the scale of the task.  In fairness, I mentioned that we have six different work schemes and 28 sub-projects.  We are really busy getting from here to go live given that the direction is that we do everything at once, and that is the correct direction.</p> <p>  In terms of carers, it is important that we do not somehow fall into setting up carers and the Independent Living Movement Ireland against each other.  There is no need for that tension to exist.  I am very keen to address that narrative, where we can, and provide reassurance.</p> <p>  I am aware of the burden carers already carry.  In my past life, I worked in a law firm that acted for carers and very often on trying to unlock access to appropriate services.  I was aware of the particular frustration that carers encountered when they found that they were sidelined when a child turned 18 years so I am think that I am sensitive to the plight of carers.</p> <p>  Our intention is not to catch people out.  We seek to work with carers if they move into decision-making roles to ensure that they are the best they can be and that there are appropriate supports to ensure that their access to the Act, when they need it, is streamlined.</p> <p>  There is a perception, I think, that really high numbers are going to have to immediately apply to move into these formal structures.  That may not necessarily prove to be the case and I do not think that is what was foreseen or intended.</p> <p>  Ms Frowein may comment on forecasting and on what we think, based on our best estimates looking at raw data and some survey work that we have done or perhaps the realistic levels of demand on the Act in the early phase.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that the DSS is a totally new and novel service so there is no national data on the number of people who might need or benefit from our services.  To repeat what Ms Flynn said earlier, there is no assumption that persons who are currently in receipt of certain services or have a diagnosis would immediately fall into the services of the Decision Support Service, or be presumed as needing those services.</p> <p>  Having said that, we have been looking extensively at potential people who may benefit from our services.  We think that there could be between 15,000 and 20,000 people who could benefit from some of the top-tier services but, again, we would not see them immediately being subject to a court order.</p><p>It is one of the guiding principles that there would only be an intervention when it is necessary.  There is a decision that needs to be made and a trigger to bring that into play.  Based on our estimates, we think it could be around 1,500 to 2,000 people that would be in court each year and that there may be an order in respect of their capacity and in requiring the appointment of a decision-making representative.  That would be around the top tier but there would be a much broader cohort of people who would benefit from other supports like the co-decision-making agreement or a decision-making assistance agreement.</p></speech>

That bilocation element means I may ask something that has already been answered but I am trying to avoid that.</p> <p>  The witnesses have spoken extensively on the ward of court and how that will work.  I thank them.  I am not clear whether families will have to apply to be the committee or insert themselves into decision-making on behalf of an existing ward of court.  Will there be a pathway of transition out of that?</p> <p>   My next question relates to next of kin.  I hear the witnesses and I think we need to do an information programme to explain to people that next of kin has absolutely no standing.  I have had a number of cases in recent years where people do not understand that and cannot understand how they are excluded from information.  We had a "Prime Time" documentary some years ago about a husband excluded from the care of his wife in a care home, where she needed constant care and he was excluded because, he alleged, he started making complaints in that context.  It has a silencing effect on families at the moment.  The way around that in current law would be to establish enduring power of attorney so there is somebody who can make decisions.  However, that is very expensive.  My concern is the system we are putting in place will rely on families having to make an application to court.  Has consideration been given to ensuring there will be legal aid provision for that?  Is there an easier way to create a pathway to court?  Otherwise, those with means will have access to having a say in the care of their loved one while those without means will be left in some sort of wardship arrangement.</p></speech>

Those applications will be taken by the wardship court, which can decide whether the person is to have his or her autonomy and decision-making restored to him or her or whether he or she needs to transition into one of the new supports under the Act.  The new supporter under the Act could be the family member.  He or she will be involved in that application, able to make representations and, if necessary, appointed as a decision-making representative.  Families should not consider that they are to be sidelined in this process.  The court will have the obligation under the guiding principle to hear from those closest to the relevant person and to look at existing family relationships.</p> <p>  I agree there is work to be done in addressing the established myth around next of kin.  People can feel hurt and offended by this and there can be a perception that the Act is doing it to them when I would say the Act is the solution filling the gap that has always prevailed. </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned EPAs as the current solution.  One can only make one when one has the capacity to do so.  I recognise that advanced planning is not a route available to everybody.  The Senator is correct that it can be an expensive structure to put in place currently.  We are keen that costs are not a barrier to the service and the support under the Act.  If all of us who can do so plan ahead, we may avoid the more onerous and off-putting process of having to go to court.</p> <p>  On supports around going to court, the Act amends the Civil Legal Aid Act.  The amending legislation will further amend the Civil Legal Aid Act, so members should keep an eye on that.  It makes provision for the relevant person to have fairly ready access to a scheme of legal aid.  They do not have to satisfy all the conditions that would apply.  Legal advice and legal aid is to be made available to other parties to Part 5 applications, including family members. </p> <p>  I hope the court process is streamlined as far as possible.  We have engaged with court services to ask that the court rules be made as accessible as possible and that one form be sufficient, rather than many affidavits, motions and supporting documentation, so the path to court is eased for people and the costs associated with filing a court application are not an off-putting factor.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  I will list them off and if there is not time to answer them, that is fine.  Maybe there will be time at the end or a written response would be great.</p> <p>  First, I support what Ms Flynn said about the importance of carers not being pitted against the Independent Living Movement Ireland.  As public representatives, we need to play an important role in ensuring that does not happen.  Any feedback on that from witnesses would be appreciated.</p> <p>  Second, Ms Flynn referenced the development of proposals around fees.  What are the proposals and who are they from?  It does not just apply to people with disabilities but we know people with disabilities are more affected by poverty.  We have to ensure cost is not a barrier.  What are the specific proposals?</p> <p>  How will it work in terms of access?  Will there be regional offices or what will be the approach?</p> <p>  Finally, witnesses spoke about how, in other countries, this applies to 16 and 17-year-olds as well.  I am interested to hear what witnesses think about the pros and cons of that or had other feedback.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Flynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052000002#G00700"><p>I quite agree.  I reiterate the importance of carers not seeing themselves pitted against the Independent Living Movement Ireland and its support for this Act.  We need to be very conscious of and continue to address that.</p> <p>  On fees, I do not have the specific numbers but we can share those as appropriate.  We looked at best practice in other jurisdictions.  We came up with numbers.  Fees are largely to be set by regulations to be supplied by our parent Department.  Looking at the service we will have to provide, we have recently come up with proposals to say, "What do you think of these numbers?"  We will see what the feedback is on those.  The directive to us has been that there is no perceived requirement that we are to be a self-funding service.  Other comparable services in other jurisdictions are.  In certain cases, we will provide an extensive, involved and lifelong service for people who may be high net worth individuals and it may be entirely appropriate that a certain cohort have to pay for some of our services.</p> <p>  Access and regional offices is an important consideration.  We have all in the last 12 to 14 months had to think creatively around that and use virtual platforms.  Is there a greater opportunity to reach out to ensure this is perceived as a State-wide solution?  We are looking at the possibility, which is very much in its infancy, of having regional hubs or other offices.  Where people cannot access us digitally, we are looking creatively at perhaps using the services and good offices of the Citizens Information Board, library services or whatever, so information is available through those channels.</p><p>I will not comment greatly on the 16 or 17-year-olds.  They are identified otherwise as a separate cohort in legislation.  In answer to an earlier question, however, it has not been part of the conversation here yet specifically on capacity legislation but it has certainly been the subject of comment and is something to watch with interest.  We would have to be responsive to any changes that will come down the tracks as far as these younger people are concerned.</p></speech>

This is quite a complex area and I thank our witnesses very much for giving us the overview which is greatly appreciated.  I have number of small questions.  I am assuming - and this follows on from what Deputy Cairns said - that when we are talking about adults, we are talking about over 18-year-olds.</p><p>On the question of bona fides, in Ms Flynn&rsquo;s opening statement a reference was made to a person who may have a bona fide interest in the welfare of the relevant person.  How do we define such a bona fide interest?  I am aware that our witness has said that the applicant can often be a family member, carer or the HSE, but Ms Flynn made reference to perhaps where different members of a family may have different views and there can be conflicting interests there as well.  If there is a relevant person and a number of family members who have different views, how is that issue addressed?</p><p>In a practical situation, a parent may, perhaps, leave something in a will to a family member with an intellectual disability and there may need to be support around that.  Is that something that comes within this situation if there is conflict between other members of the family in respect of such a will?</p><p>Apart from those points, I refer also to the challenges in the use of substitute decision-making versus supported decision-making and how that aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which is essentially what our committee is about.  What other changes does Ms Flynn think are required to ensure compliance because part of our <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>is to ensure compliance with the CRPD.</p><p>I share the sense that others have expressed in how long it has taken to implement this convention and the fact that the Act was passed in 2015.  I am aware that Ms Flynn said that this is a priority for legislation this year and that she expects to have it in place in 2022, together with the full operation of the Decision Support Service, DSS.  I also hear what Ms Flynn is saying and that she is functioning at the moment and that people are contacting her.  That is good and what is absolutely needed.  From the point of view of our committee, how can we, as legislators, help to support that?</p><p>I also ask about the delay of the commencement and the fact that we have had hundreds if not thousands of those individuals going into the wards of court system since this Act was passed.  The reason I ask is that I have recently been dealing with a number of these and there are concerns which need to be allayed.  Where does this fit in with the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, system or does that system have any impact at all on this?</p><p>I understand what Ms Flynn is saying on the lack of awareness that is out there.  We need to have a very significant education programme throughout the country, as I am sure will professionals who would be dealing with all of this.  A great deal has been mentioned about family carers and, as Ms Flynn will be aware, we made a very strong submission on that and it is of very great importance.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

There are a number of people who do not need the leave of the court in order to so act and these are the top tier group.  I could be an applicant under Part 5 of the Act and certain categories of persons do not need leave of the court.  In other cases, there will be an interim stage where the court will have to engage with the person bringing the application and, perhaps, assess their bona fides.  Yes, families may come into conflict in that.  I mentioned earlier that we will have a certain role in addressing that and the court may have to assess the competing positions of different family members as to whether they should step in to a formalised role or not.<br/><br/>The Senator asked about a family member receiving money by way of an inheritance.  That is exactly the sort of thing that might be amenable to support, bearing in mind always - and this is a point I would seek to emphasise - that somebody with an intellectual disability may well be about to manage that inheritance without stepping into a formal structure under the Act but the stepping off point is not to think how we go formal with this but rather to try to shore up somebody's independent decision-making to see if that is something that he or she can manage himself or herself.  On the face of it, managing an inheritance, or any kind of property decision around that, is something that could come under the formal support of the Act.<br/><br/>Substituted versus supported decision-making is a day-long conference in itself.  Article 12 of the CRPD is subject to varying perspectives and, as I mentioned, the State at the time of ratification entered a declaration that if substitute decision-making is something that is prohibited by CRPD -  the convention does not explicitly prohibit it but the interpretation of the convention by the committee for the convention does - the State is then still going to have substitute decision-making very much as a last resort, as I set out in my statement.  There are all kinds of competing perspectives and a great deal in the literature about that.<br/><br/>It is important that the fact we provide for substitute decision-making does not mean that that is the default option of choice.  We need to be careful that decision-making is facilitated and supported on those lower tiers far as possible, bearing in mind that substitute decision-making is still a matter that is subject to the guiding principles, including the individual's will and preference.<br/><br/>In terms of ensuring that this can really happen next year, I have mentioned our dependencies and they are fairly straightforward and are the ones that might always arise.  We need support for our resourcing as to the continuing budget allocation.  We will be addressing that in the Estimates process and we will be looking at what we think we need to open our doors and to operate a service for the second half of next year, together with sanctions for posts, and so on.  The importance of getting that amending legislation through and the whole regulatory framework is going to be essential to our operations.<br/><br/>We must feel for the wards of court who have been brought into wardship because of the delay.  Here is a structure that was promised and while waiting for it people have continued to be taken in through the front door of wardship.  I have mentioned the route out of the back door and these individuals will be amenable to that review process and can seek to have their applications heard on day one, when the new service commences and I hope that many may take up that offer.<br/><br/>On the GALs, I know that the wardship court has been somewhat creative about ensuring representation and hearing the voice and I know that my colleague, Ms Macklin has looked somewhat at those guardians <i>ad litem</i>and parallels with the panels that we will operate.  We have looked at those mainly around identifying, resourcing and recruiting those panels but our hope is that with that access to the court, to representation and to legal aid, that the voice of both the relevant person coming into the system and the current ward who is being reviewed potentially out of the system will be heard very strongly in court.</p></speech>

Where somebody does not have immediate family, who has either siblings of equal status, or nephews or nieces, where do they go when this legislation is enacted?  What is open to them, to their family or indeed to the community to ensure the person is given the proper care and dignity? </p></speech>

They are often very tragic cases where someone has received an award compensation following, for example, an acquired brain injury.  There can be this unfounded perception that that is somehow something that can be managed by the next of kin.  If one has not been able to plan ahead by way of an enduring power of attorney, EPA, then that is not true.  Anyone of us in exactly that situation could be the subject of an application for wardship.</p> <p>  The Chair asked what might happen if that person is unsupported by family members and there is nobody appropriate to step into that role.  The court is the decision maker under wardship, with certain day-to-day decisionmaking devolving to what are called committees.  There are committees for the person and committees for the estate.  Often the day-to-day function is carried out by family members.  Where nobody is available or suitable, it is a role that is taken on by the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court.  If we think again about that number of 2,300 or so current adult wards, the general solicitor acts in about 600 of those cases.  In about 25% of cases, family members are either not available or not suitable for one reason or another.  That is the process, as it is in the present day.  </p> <p>  Often those applications are brought by the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Sometimes - where money is not an issue at all, but there are day-to-day decisions to be made where somebody is very much unsupported in the world - the fundamental object of the application for wardship is around safeguarding consideration.  This is often the context of applications for wardship that are brought.  </p> <p>  Having said that, I am no longer in the wardship court.  I hesitate to provide an authoritative statement on exactly what is happening in the wardship court at the moment.  By way of the replacement process, in the scenario that the Chair described, it would be open to a family member or anybody with a bona fide interest, if necessary, to bring an application to court.  It would normally be the Circuit Court, the idea being that is more regional, accessible and less costly.  The Circuit Court could say that somebody sadly lacks the capacity to make a decision around the management of this award of compensation.  It will, therefore, appoint a decision-making representative to fulfill that role.  If there is no family member to fulfill that role, the court can call on us to nominate a decision-making representative.  We can nominate two from a panel, which we will set up and maintain.  The court can then appoint a decision-making representative, who will be a professional person.  We hope to make that panel as diverse as we can.  They will be able to step in and carry out that decision-making role.  My colleague, Ms Macklin, has been looking at setting up those panels currently.  Work for their recruitment is active and ongoing.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, and officials from the Department of Defence, who we cannot see but who are present.  I thank the officials for the briefing material received by the committee.  On behalf of members, I take this opportunity to thank the Department for its engagement with us over the past while and for its prompt replies to queries and submissions on the part of members.</p> <p>  The committee will with deal Votes 35 and 36 under programmes A and B.  At the outset of the consideration, I will invite the Minister to give an overview of the Votes, outlining any pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance or expenditure in regard to the Votes for the remainder of this year.  We will take the Votes in reverse order, starting with Vote 36 and followed by Vote 35 and then the floor will be open to members for questions and observations on each programme for both Votes.  I ask that members put their questions on specific programmes in order that we can progress in an orderly and efficient manner.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members have received the briefing documents on the Revised Estimates - Votes 35 and 36 - from the Department and the committee secretariat.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to make his opening statement on these Votes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021052000002#A00500"><p>I welcome the opportunity to engage with the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to consider the 2021 Revised Estimates for public services, Vote 35 - Army Pensions; and Vote 36 - Defence.  In this opening statement, I will set out the overall position and update members on some of the recent developments within the defence sector.</p> <p>  As members will know, the defence sector comprises two Votes: Vote 35 - Army Pensions; and Vote 36 - Defence.  The high level goal of both Votes is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.</p> <p>  The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2021 provide for gross expenditure of more than &euro;1.07 billion, an increase of over &euro;32 million, or 3%, on last year.  The 2021 provision comprises &euro;810 million for Vote 36, which is all of the broader defence issues, and an increase of &euro;29 million on 2020 and more than &euro;262 million for Vote 35 - Army pensions, an increase of &euro;3.5 million.  The Army pension Vote is a single programme entitled, provision for Defence Forces pension benefits.  It makes provision for pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.  The 2021 Estimate provides for a gross sum of &euro;262.7 million for the Army pension Vote, of which &euro;253 million covers expenditure on superannuation benefits.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.</p> <p>  During 2020, 290 Defence Forces members retired on pension.  There are currently 12,780 pensioners paid from the Army pension Vote and this number continues to rise year-on-year as people are living longer.  Against that background, I am pleased to inform members that the gross allocation for Army pensions increased by &euro;3.5 million to almost &euro;263 million for 2021.  This builds on the previous funding increase of &euro;10 million achieved in last year's Estimates.  On the issue of pensions, I am pleased to say that I recently secured the approval of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to pass on to the qualifying military pensioners the benefit of the increase in the military service allowance, effective from 4 July 2019.  This increase was awarded to Defence Forces personnel on foot of the 2019 report of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The work is ongoing on the calculation on the pension arrears involved.  </p> <p>  I will turn now to Vote 36 - Defence, which is delivered under a single programme entitled, defence policy and support, military capabilities and operational outputs.  The Revised Defence Estimate of &euro;810 million for 2021 includes a pay and allowances allocation of more than &euro;534 million.  The pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of up to 10,440 public service employees, including Permanent Defence Force personnel, civil servants and civilian employees.  It provides for all outstanding commitments arising from the Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020, along with the restoration of the 5% cut in Permanent Defence Force allowances imposed under the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The non-pay allocation comprises current and capital elements and the Revised Defence Estimate provides a non-pay current expenditure allocation of more than &euro;144 million for 2021.  This allocation provides, in the main, for expenditure on ongoing and essential Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.</p> <p>  The capital allocation provided in the Revised Defence Estimate is &euro;131 million.  This allocation has increased over recent years and demonstrates the Government's commitment to capital investment in the Defence sector.  It will facilitate an ongoing programme of equipment replacement and infrastructural development.  Comprehensive multiannual plans completed through joint civil-military work in the form of the defence equipment development plan and infrastructure development plan were published last year and are delivering on the White Paper on Defence policy commitments.  </p> <p>  The White Paper on Defence has identified that demands on future capability will need to take account of climate change objectives.  In that regard, defence remains fully committed to incorporating green procurement practices into all defence organisation procurements, in line with the overarching climate action plan objectives and in accordance with all applicable obligations in the fields of environmental law applying under national and EU law, as well as various international conventions on environmental law matters.  The principal demand drivers of defence capital funding are the ongoing renewal, retention and acquisition of military equipment, along with the development of military infrastructure and information and communications technologies.  The acquisition of military equipment is pursued through the equipment development plan and is based on White Paper objectives and provides a consolidated, structured basis for investing in military equipment to maintain and develop the necessary capabilities.</p><p>At present, a significant number of defence equipment programmes and projects are at various stages of development and include the ongoing upgrade of the Army Mowag armoured personnel carriers, the maritime patrol aircraft replacement programme, the purchase of military transport vehicles and the mid-life refit of two Naval Service vessels.  In addition, an ongoing schedule of capital investment across a broad range of force protection, transport, communications, information technology, weapons and ammunition systems continues in 2021.<br/><br/>Similarly, an infrastructural development plan sets out the requirements for essential infrastructure development works over the medium term.  This infrastructural investment, which has a strong regional or local dividend in terms of local enterprise and employment, seeks to ensure that all Defence Forces installations are fit for purpose, taking account of operational security and health and safety considerations.  A significant level of defence built infrastructure projects, many of which involve buildings with historical significance and encompass accommodation, training and storage facilities, are at various stages of development from design and tender to construction.  Those include: an upgrade of training facilities in Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, and Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny; upgrades of accommodation facilities and various military installations, including the Defence Forces' training centre in the Curragh Camp and Defence Forces student accommodation in Galway, which is badly needed, McKee Barracks and the Naval Service base in Haulbowline; an upgrade to aircraft hangars in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel; and the remediation of Spencer Jetty in Haulbowline.  I called in to look at the progress at the jetty in the past ten days or so.<br/><br/>I will now briefly reference some of the many outputs to be delivered by the Defence Forces from the Defence Vote throughout 2021.  The 2021 allocation will allow Defence Forces personnel to meet Government commitments on our overseas peace support missions and proudly represent Ireland abroad in diverse and often challenging locations around the world.  As of 10 May, there were 561 Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in ten overseas missions around the world.  This level of overseas deployment reflects Ireland's ongoing contribution to international peace and security and I thank our Defence Forces for their professionalism and commitment to their overseas roles.  I hope to visit some of those missions by mid-summer.<br/><br/>At home, the funding provision allows the Defence Forces to continue to provide essential support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as requested across various roles, such as explosive ordnance disposal call-outs, Garda air support missions and Naval Service diving operations.  It also enables the Defence Forces, as part of their aid to the civil authority role, to provide support to local authorities and to the HSE in their emergency response efforts.  In what has been an unprecedented challenge to our country, the defence organisation has contributed and played a leading role in the national response to Covid-19 throughout 2020 and in 2021.  This collective defence response involved Permanent Defence Force personnel, members of the Reserve, Civil Defence volunteers, civil servants and civilian employees within the Department.  I thank them all for their resilience and support throughout what has been an anxious and uncertain period for us all.  They have shown remarkable flexibility and professionalism in what they have been asked to do.  I say that of the Department as well as the Defence Forces because members of both organisations have been phenomenal at a time of significant need when there have been big asks of them across multiple areas.  I am happy to take questions about that, if committee members want me to.<br/><br/>Throughout the pandemic the Permanent Defence Force has continually provided significant and essential support to the HSE in areas such as contact tracing, patient transportation, logistics, vaccinations and Covid-19 testing.  In terms of the financial impact, more than &euro;18 million has been expended from the Defence Vote to date in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  This expenditure was incurred across a broad range of areas and includes, for example, the payment of additional aid to the civil authority allowances, to Defence Forces personnel, the acquisition of a new Pilatus PC-12 utility aircraft, additional expenditure on medical, engineering, building, personal protective equipment, audiovisual information technology, communication and transport requirements, and other additional Civil Defence and departmental requirements.  All Covid-19-related expenditure was met from within the overall Defence Vote allocation in 2020 and to date in 2021.<br/><br/>The Defence Vote provides funding of more than &euro;4 million for the Civil Defence in 2021.  This funding supports Civil Defence units throughout the country by way of central training and the supply of vehicles, boats, uniforms and personal protective equipment for volunteers.  Civil Defence volunteers provide essential support to efforts of the front-line services and had a highly visible role in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>The Government also values the support of the Reserve Defence Force and the White Paper on defence highlights that there is a continued requirement to retain, develop and, I hope, grow the Reserve in the months and years ahead.  On behalf of the Government, I commend the voluntary effort made by members of the Reserve Defence Force and thank them for their ongoing dedication and enthusiasm, particularly those who assisted in the Covid-19 response.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, pursuant to a commitment in the programme for Government, the Government established the independent Commission on the Defence Forces last December.  The role of the commission is to examine structures for governance, joint command and control, the arrangements for the effective defence of the country and the composition of Defence Forces and their pay and allowance structures.  The commission has been busy to date and I was delighted to observe a very productive and positive interaction between the committee chairperson and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence at the meeting in April.<br/><br/>In addition, as a further part of a broad, ongoing consultative process, the commission is reviewing more than 500 submissions from individuals and organisations on matters relevant to the terms of reference.  This level of response highlights the significant level of public interest in the broader issues with which the commission is being asked to deal.  It is my hope that the commission's report, when published, will assist the Government in ensuring that our Defence Forces remain agile, flexible and adaptive in response to dynamic changes in the security environment, including new and emerging threats, such as from climate change and cybercrime, and in terms of seeking to develop a longer-term strategic vision for the Defence Forces.  That applies not only to the Defence Forces' role in protecting the State and their international role, but also in presenting the Defence Forces as offering an attractive career path for people who want to choose them as a career option.<br/><br/>Aligning with the commission's role, I also want to advise members of the strategic review and development process currently under way within the Department.  There is, in many ways, a parallel process here.  There is a commission on the future of the Defence Forces and there is a review process of the Department, which is serious and robust.  Both will report and conclude at the same time, which is appropriate for many reasons.  This process, which will include, <i>inter alia</i>, a very comprehensive independent organisation capability review of my Department, allows for an objective assessment of the Department's capabilities and capacity to deliver on objectives and presents an opportunity for my Department to take positive action to address any gaps that may emerge from this review process.  This process will be ongoing throughout the year.<br/><br/>The onset of the pandemic has forced a significant recalibration for all of us, as individuals and as organisations.  However, through a combination of innovation, resilience and sacrifice, the collective national response, which encompassed significant defence inputs, has helped us to turn a corner.  We can now start to look forward with real optimism to an easing of restrictions and a return to some semblance of normality across society.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with the significant overall level of funding of more than &euro;1 billion provided to the defence sector for 2021.  This allocation ensures that the Defence Forces will have the necessary level of resources to enable them to fulfil all the roles set by the Government and within the White Paper on Defence.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on both the defence and Army pension Estimates and I look forward to a positive engagement and to addressing any of the questions committee members might have.  If there are technical or detailed questions that I cannot address today, perhaps committee members could send such questions on in writing or, as with previous meetings, if they want to follow up with telephone calls or meetings with me and various experts in the Department, we would be happy to do that.</p><p>That was quite a long introduction but hopefully it answers some of the questions from earlier on.</p></speech>

I now turn to members to put their questions on Vote 36, programme A, defence policy and support, including military and operational capabilities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021052000002#C00300"><p>I acknowledge the efforts by the Minister and the Department in bringing forward the Estimates.  I agree and fully support the comments by the Minister about the fantastic work by all members of the Defence Forces, and especially those on overseas missions and those engaged in efforts to tackle the Covid pandemic.  I say a big well done to all members of the Defence Forces who actively participated in all of that.</p> <p>  The key issue affecting the Defence Forces is recruitment and retention.  While the issue of pay and conditions are central to recruitment and retention, the financial answer to that question must be preceded by a political solution, namely, the freedom to associate with ICTU and the restoration of allowances.  I spoke to the Minister in the Chamber last week on the issue of the 1994 service contracts.  As we head into this debate, the number of members in the Defence Forces continues to drop.  The 2019 to 2020 numbers have decreased again, which emphasises the problem and the huge issue of retention and recruitment.  The ongoing under-staffing of the Naval Service and the Army remains a massive concern.  I heard what the Minister said about the huge work the commission has embarked on, with more than 500 submissions.  The commission will ultimately make its recommendations on all the matters that have been identified and that fit within the terms of reference.  I am not entirely sure that we can hold our breath, however, and hope the political will that is required will actually follow to implement the recommendations that come.  I hope to be proved wrong on that but we will have to wait and see.</p> <p>  Within the Naval Service, we have seen a 40% reduction in the number of patrols carried out since 2018.  This is alongside a 12% reduction in the number of inductions to the Permanent Defence Force in the same period.  Those issues are a major concern that need to be addressed.</p> <p>  I want to touch on the issue of cybersecurity.  It must be said that the Defence Forces are playing a key role in the State's efforts to defeat hacking attempts of key systems.  Over the past week we have seen how important all of that work is and the impact it is having on our health service.  The Communications and Information Services Corps is the unit with responsibility for this and is supplying the HSE with a specialist team from within that it.  Will the Minister respond to the claim put out that the unit has been subject to massive cuts over the past years?  It has been suggested that it included the loss of a whole company of 50 personnel and that the unit is currently one third below strength.  It has also been suggested that these cuts have savagely undermined the capacity within the Defence Forces to assist in the defence of our country against these types of cyberattacks.  These cuts, along with the failure of the Government to introduce the necessary measures to retain the key skilled personnel, are absolutely devastating.  This is despite agreeing in 2019 to introduce technical pay for the specially trained members of the forces, such as those in the Communications and Information Services Corps.  Will the Minister clarify what provisions will be made to bring this unit back up to full strength to ensure it can play the critical role it is supposed to play?</p> <p>  I turn now to the measures to ensure there is gender equality within the Defence Forces and to the need to recruit more women into the Defence Forces.  I congratulate Chief of Staff, Mark Mellet, and his team on the immense amount of work they have done on the issue.  I congratulate also Lieutenant Aoife Campbell who last month replaced Commandant Gillian Collins as the new gender equality and diversity adviser to the Defence Forces.  We, as a country, and the Government have identified women, peace and security as a key area for the duration of Ireland's membership of the UN Security Council, which must be commended.  It is a fact that the more women involved in peacekeeping missions the greater the chances of maintaining peace.  I raised this last week with the Minister in the context of Mali and the key role played by women who participate in those peace negotiations and agreements.  It is critical.  By achieving a figure of 35% involved in peacekeeping missions we can see tangible transformation.  What measures are contained in the Government's plans to increase female members within the Defence Forces and overseas missions to allow them to build on the already fantastic contributions in combat roles and peacekeeping missions?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021052000002#C00500"><p>I thank the Minister and his team for coming in today and for the opening statement.  The Defence Estimates are very clearly itemised.  It is very insightful with regard to what is going on in the Defence Forces at the moment.  </p> <p>  I will go through the Estimates one page at a time, starting with page 3 if that is okay.  I will flag a few things.  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force at 39% is appalling.  If one was asked to run a school with 39% of teachers, or a hospital with 39% of nurses, one can imagine how dysfunctional that school or hospital would be.  It is particularly poignant this year in light of what the Reserve Defence Force could have done during the pandemic and could have done last week during the cyberattack.  They really have niche skills that could have been used very effectively.  I am aware the Minister has inherited this problem and he is actively engaged in improving it, but those figures are absolutely stark.  They do not require any forensic questioning of the Estimates because they just jump off the page and slap us in the face.</p> <p>  On page 3, it is very clear that even though there is quite a large reduction in the numbers of troops, there is detailed expression there that there has been no impact on operations whatsoever.  This gives the false impression that even though the Defence Forces claim to be in crisis, they cannot really be in crisis because they are meeting all their operational objectives.  Underneath those figures, however, we must realise that many people are working to the point of exhaustion and of burnout.  I can speak with personal experience on that.  One of the reasons people are leaving the Defence Forces is that so few people are doing so many jobs.  They are absolutely exhausted.</p><p>The next point I would like to raise concerns sea fisheries patrols.  There was a big reduction in 2020 by comparison with the previous year.  It is stated there is no control plan and no defined target for Naval Service inputs for 2022.  This is also a point of concern.  The Minister might be able to comment on that.<br/><br/>The fourth point relates to quite good news.  Page 4 refers to the Defence (Amendment) Bill, which I hope will be enacted this year.  It is important from the point of view of the Reserve Defence Force.  There is a plan to enact the Bill this year.  I got very good advice from a gentleman in Portarlington many moons ago.  He said, &quot;If the Minister wants it to happen, it will happen.&quot;  In fairness to the current Minister, he has grabbed the bull by the horns on this one and is bringing forward legislation.  Is there a date for enactment?  When will the legislation come back before the D&aacute;il for approval on Report Stage?  What is contained in it?  It was indicated that it would give the Reserve Defence Force the ability to serve overseas.  What would be the position operationally from training, sport and ceremonial perspectives?  It was suggested that the legislation may contain crucial employment protection provisions for Reserve Defence Force personnel called up on active service.  Will it?  This would be very useful.<br/><br/>The next point I would like to raise is on page 5.  It concerns Naval Service patrol days.  As Deputy Brady quite rightly pointed out, there is a big reduction.  There is a mitigating factor in that it is stated that 197 days were spent in support of the HSE in three dockyards - in Cork, Galway and Dublin - in respect of the pandemic but even that does not account for the drop-off.  My concern is that a reduction in the number of Naval Service patrol days increases the number of gaps in our defences.  We need our ships on patrol to address issues with drugs, weapons, fugitives, vulnerable persons and, crucially after Brexit, fisheries protection.<br/><br/>There is some good news on page 6.  Subhead A13 refers to built infrastructure.  A sum of &euro;28 million accounted for the Estimate in 2020.  Unfortunately, 25% of that budget was not spent.  I accept that the building sites were closed last year on foot of a Government direction and I can understand the public health reason for that.  There is an increase for 2021, up to &euro;37 million.  It is already nearly the end of May.  I would be grateful the hear the Minister's thoughts on whether that &euro;37 million can be spent as intended.  As he is aware, the infrastructure deficit in the Defence Forces is huge.  Many of the buildings are from the Victorian era and were inherited from the British armed forces.  Therefore, every single euro allocated for infrastructure needs to be spent in this area, if possible.<br/><br/>The next point is a little more contentious so I will be as courteous as possible.  Page 7 mentions the Civil Service and the number of civil servants in the Department.  I am very much in favour of the Civil Service and Department of Defence but there is an anomaly in that the number of uniformed personnel, or front-line troops, in the Defence Forces has plummeted in the past ten years from 10,500 to 8,500.  Unfortunately, the number of civil servants in the Department has increased.  That is a red flag in any organisation.  According to the Estimates, the number of civil servants in 2010 was 354.  Last year, the number had increased by seven.  It is incredible that the number of troops has dropped by 2,000 while the number of civil servants has increased by seven over a ten-year period.  In any organisation, alarm bells should ring when the number of administrators is increasing and the number of front-line personnel is in free fall.  That is the canary in the coalmine.  I fully appreciate that there is a need for the Department of Defence and for staff therein doing Civil Service duties but when we see one number increasing and another plummeting, it should raise concerns.<br/><br/>I am aware that an organisational capacity review is taking place.  I thank the Minister for mentioning that in his opening statement.  My concern is that the review might recommend a further increase in Civil Service numbers.  That would have a serious effect on morale in the uniformed services.  They would be dealing with more micromanagement, perhaps, and more encroachment and bureaucracy.  The role of the organisational capacity review should be to reduce the layers of bureaucracy rather than increase them or keep the <i>status quo</i>.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.<br/><br/>Even in the three past years, the number of civil servants has increased by 8%.  It has increased by 22 in the past three years while the number of front-line personnel has plummeted.  That is an anomaly in any organisation.  Perhaps we could work on this over time.<br/><br/>There is some good news on page 9.  It states there should be 14 members in the Army nursing service.  They would have been really useful during the pandemic.  They could have gone into nursing homes and helped out with vaccinations and a myriad of other tasks.  There are probably only three or four left.  A nursing review has been ongoing for the past five years.  It depends on who one speaks to.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on it or indicate when it will be completed.  What is the report likely to contain?  The review has been going on for years and the number of Army nursing service staff has plummeted in the meantime.  At present, many on-call nurses are being hired.  These are really expensive from an organisational point of view so it would make more sense to regularise the nurses' employment contracts.  There is a nurse in Kilkenny barracks whose contract has pretty much been renewed every 24 hours for the past ten years.  If the position could be regularised and the nurse could be brought into the Army nursing service to have a regular job with full benefits, it would make a whole lot of sense.<br/><br/>There is a comment on page 9 to the effect that the ability to adopt and train recruits in 2020 was severely impacted by Covid.  That is 100% correct.  My answer is that we should put more emphasis on re-induction.  The re-enlistment and recommissioning of former members of the Defence Forces are important.  I have two points to make on that.  First, a major impediment to getting former members of the Defence Forces back is that their pension abatement is not waived.  Most people will be aware that when personnel leave the Defence Forces, they get a very small pension.  Its value is between that of the dole and that of the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is the kind of scale we are talking about.  If a prison officer returns to the Prison Service, his or her pension abatement is waived.  Based on a deal struck with the unions and the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, only a couple of months ago, a teacher who returns to the teaching profession can work for 50 days every year without having his or her pension abated.  Similarly, a healthcare professional who returns to the health service can work for 19 hours per week without having his or her pension abated.  Is it likely that these policies will be extended to members of the Defence Forces?  It makes perfect sense.  The principle is exactly the same.  Members of the Defence Forces are also public servants.  The provision is deemed good enough for the prison officers, healthcare staff and teachers so it should be extended to military personnel.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on that.<br/><br/>As mentioned by Deputy Brady, the 1994 contract is coming to a head now.  We should try to hold on to the personnel as much as possible.  There is no point in turning on the tap of recruitment if there is a big leaky hole in the bath or sink.  Any sensible intervention the Minister could make in this regard would make a whole lot of sense.  We should remember that most people who join the public service get a full-time job and have tenure for life, but it is not the same in the Defence Forces.  Any latitude or flexibility that could be granted would make a big difference.</p><p> On page 11, there is another good news story.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister and the Secretary General over the last few months to sort out the anomaly in regard to the pay of the Defence Forces Reserve.  The FEMPI cuts have been restored, which is a positive news story.  There should not have been any cuts in the first instance, but the matter was promptly rectified when brought to the Minister's attention.</p><p> At the bottom of this page is news that is not so good.  The strength of the Defence Forces Reserve, which should be more than 4,000, has continued to plummet in the last three years and now stands at 1,588, which is probably generous.  I understand the effective strength is probably below 1,000 at this stage.  The Defence Forces Reserve could have been very useful during the pandemic.  Our Permanent Defence Force is exhausted.  The Defence Forces Reserve could have been brought in to do camp security barracks guard and thus allow the regular troops to deploy on operations from a pandemic point of view.  I do not think any other European Union country would accept those numbers in their Defence Forces Reserve, or the trajectory in that regard.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to make in-roads through the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020, but a more concerted effort is required to get the numbers and capability back up, particularly from a cyber perspective.  Many members of the Defence Forces Reserve work in the cyber field in large big tech companies around Dublin.  It would be ideal to hold onto those people, who are very patriotic.  The number of cyberattacks will likely increase over time and we need to be prepared for that.</p><p> On page 13, there is another good news story in terms of the slight increase in the number of civilian employees.  There should be 550 such staff but currently there are only 446, which means we are down about 100.  These are key staff.  Many of these people have never served in the Defence Forces, but some of them have, and they re-entered as technicians, mechanics, aircraft inspectors and so on.  I have received a number of calls from former members of the Defence Forces who would love to rejoin as a civilian employee.  These people are skilled armourers, aircraft technicians and mechanics, but they cannot rejoin because of the pension abatement.  The introduction of a pension abatement waiver in this area, as happens in other areas of the public service, would result in a large number of former members of the Defence Forces rejoining and a use of the skills they were trained to use in the Defence Forces.  If this was implemented, it would make a significant difference, particularly in the Curragh Camp, where much of the technical expertise is based.</p><p> Page 17 deals with Naval Service fuel costs.  This appears to be dressed up as an improvement.  The reduction in costs for the Naval Service, from a fuel perspective, was &euro;1.5 million.  For me, this is a bad news story because it means the Naval Service was not patrolling the seas, as it should have been doing, and the fuel bill reduced by &euro;1.5 million in 2020.  I take the point that at least two of the Naval Service ships that could have been put to sea were deployed in Galway and Dublin temporarily.  Our Naval Service ships should be on the high seas rather than tied up in port for lack of personnel.  </p><p> On page 19, again, there is a good news story in terms of the increase in the infrastructure spend for 2021 to &euro;37 million.  As we are almost half way through the year, how likely is it that that &euro;37 million will be spent on infrastructure?  My own view is that it will be difficult to spend that amount of infrastructure given building sites have been closed for four months.  Are there alternatives or a plan B in regard to that spend from a capability perspective, if not on infrastructure?  I was grateful for the Minister's comment a week or two ago that he is open to an multi-departmental approach to solving the infrastructural deficit in the Defence Forces.  It would be a good move to get the Departments of Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Rural and Community Development and the OPW involved.  In that regard, I would like to raise one matter with the Minister.  The post office in the Curragh Camp is a historic building with massive heritage, but it is falling into disrepair.   Kildare County Council is keen to use the town and village renewal scheme across the county.  The old post office is owned by the Department of Defence.  I would welcome the Minister's thoughts on tapping into that fund through Kildare County Council.  My constituency team is meeting tomorrow to map out our plans for the post office and to put forward a proposal in that regard to Kildare County Council.  Perhaps the Minister would arrange a meeting for us with the property management branch of the Department over the next few weeks at which we could firm up on what is possible in regard to the old post office.  If we do not intervene soon, it will deteriorate further and open the doors for anti-social behaviour.  </p><p> On page 23, there is another interesting statistic.  In regard to travel and moving of stores and people abroad, the Defence Forces spent &euro;1.74 million last year.  That is a very expensive way of moving troops and cargo around.  Would we not be better off purchasing our own organic capability from an aircraft perspective?  If we are spending &euro;1.74 million per annum in this area, would it not make more sense to invest in a strategic aircraft over a ten or 20 year timeframe?  The aircraft would pay for itself overtime and also add a great deal more capability and flexibility not just across the Defence Forces, but Government.  Rather than outsourcing that spend, we should in-source it and ensure maximum benefit across the public service.</p><p> I come now to page 24.  I am very grateful to the Minister for addressing the issue of private healthcare for enlisted personnel, at a cost of &euro;4 million, in the programme for Government.  I accept it is expensive, but it is much less expensive than the cost of personal injury claims.  </p><p> Page 27 deals with both a good news and bad news story in that it is about litigation and compensation costs.  Approximately &euro;7 million was spent on compensation claims last year.  For me, this is unnecessary spend.  Many of the compensation claims are medical claims, the reason being, that enlisted personnel who are injured in training exercises and operations receive emergency treatment free of charge through the HSE hospitals, but, if required, they have to pay for back surgery, knee surgery, MRI scans and CT scans.  The only recourse they have then is to sue so that they or their families are not out of pocket.  It would be helpful if the commitment in the programme for Government that private healthcare be extended to enlisted personnel, which is 11 months old at this stage, was implemented.  This would result in savings for the State because the level of compensation would drastically fall.  The vast majority of the compensation claims are to ensure that troops are not out of pocket.  In regard to the &euro;7 million paid out in compensation claims, statistically about 40% of those claims will go to legal fees.  I do not think the Defence Forces should exist to pay the legal profession.  The establishment of a compensation tribunal should be considered by the Minister and the Department.  I refer to the model used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service.  As in the case of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which is based in Cork, matters would be dealt with in a non-adversarial and non-legalistic way.  This would save the Department a fortune in legal fees and, most important, it would result in swift and smaller pay outs for people who are deserving.  If the Minister is not minded to establish a Defence compensation tribunal, consideration might be given to the Defence Forces linking into the model used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would then become a tribunal for garda&iacute; and Defence Forces personnel.  That would make a big difference from a compensation perspective and it would ensure that people who are injured would not be out of pocket.</p><p> I note that &euro;1.5 million of the &euro;7.5 million was for employment cases, rather than personal injury cases.  Again, this begs the question as to whether we should be adopting this overly legalistic approach to solving employment cases.  There is a conciliation and arbitration scheme in the Defence Forces' establishment.  The findings of an adjudicator should be on a par with that of the Labour Court.  The adjudicator's findings should be implemented and the matter not taken down the legal road because in doing so we are only feathering the nests of the legal profession, when the money should be going to the people who are deserving of it.</p><p> On page 28, there is a very good news story, or at least I think it is.  On the grants to the veterans associations, I am not sure what the figures were last year but they seem to have increased this year which is a good thing.  The amount is &euro;411,00, which is very positive.  IUNVA and the ONE will be very grateful for that.  I am not sure of the breakdown but that appears to be an increase.  Many people do not know this, but I suspect there are in excess of a 250,000 military veterans in the country, including former members of the Reserve Defence Forces and Permanent Defence Forces.  That number is increasing over time.  It is probably on a par with the GAA or the IFA in relation to the size of the network and constituency.  I would not have become be a Deputy if it were not for that network.  It is regularly overlooked.  The veterans' network is huge and it must be supported.  There are people in it with issues resulting from service and with medical issues.  The veterans associations are the original Men's Shed.  Any further support the Minister or the Department could provide would be greatly appreciated.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that many issues and questions were covered.  I was quite liberal with time with Deputy Berry in particular, much to the detriment of Deputy Clarke.  While I say to the detriment of Deputy Clarke, I hope it is not to her annoyance.  I put it to her that we will revert to the Minister now to deal with the questions from Deputies Brady and Berry, and then come back to her with what should be a clean slate.  If Deputy Clarke would like to come in at this stage, I am inclined to allow her, but I want to give another minute or 90 seconds to Deputy Berry, who I interrupted.  How does Deputy Clarke feel about that?  Should we go back to the Minister and then return to her?</p></speech>

I think 60 seconds should be enough.  On page 32, there is reference to receipts from occupation of official quarters.  Some &euro;90,000 was taken in rent.  This proves that if we invest in military accommodation, it would not be a cost; it would actually be an investment because the Department would receive rent back.  Something should be considered regarding married quarters.  There are very few houses there and yet there is an income of &euro;90,000 coming in under appropriations-in-aid, which is very important.</p> <p>  My last point is on appropriations-in-aid.  Under receipts on discharge by purchase, &euro;50,000 has been paid out by troops who have not fulfilled their full five-year engagement and are fined &euro;300.  These are people who have not gone to college or an educational establishment.  They have only been taught how to march and shoot.  I think this is an injustice.  If the Minister could look into this and consider waiving the discharge by purchase system in the future, it would certainly help.  As Members, we all sign up for a five-year term.  If I leave today, I would walk out with a golden handshake, but if a private soldier walks out without having completed a five-year term, he or she would be handed an invoice for &euro;300 or &euro;900 depending on whether they have been taught to drive or not.  There are all the questions I have.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for hearing me out.  I thank the Chair and Deputy Clarke for their latitude and understanding.  It is much appreciated.</p></speech>

We must also consider Vote 35, but I think it is more straightforward.  There are not anything like the same number of complications, as were in previous years, regarding shortages of fund for the pensions Vote.  I think it is more straightforward.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked me about the ICTU issue.  As he knows, within the Defence Forces organisations, there are differences of opinion on this.  RACO's and PDFORRA's views on being formally associated with ICTU in the context of public sector pay negotiations is a source of ongoing discussion and debate.  As I have said, I have an open mind on this.  On balance, my view on this is that the setting up of a separate and independent pay review body for the Defence Forces makes sense, because a career in the Defence Forces is unique within the public service in terms of limitations on political lobbying and industrial action, and so on.  The kind of service people commit to and the oath they take puts them in a slightly different category.  We must take account of that in the context of the complexity of pay and allowances, and a take home package that is attractive enough for people to commit to a career with the Defence Forces.  Whether or not associate membership of ICTU in someway compromises that, or compromises ICTU, is a source of ongoing discussion and debate.  I will happily continue to talk to PDFORRA about this.  I know it is pursuing a legal course of action on this issue.</p> <p>  On the pay and allowances issue, there is an outstanding discussion which is continuing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the technical pay issue.  Members who know about pay and allowances and commitments that have been made will know that there is an outstanding technical pay issue.  We are trying to make progress on that.  It has taken a long time but we continue to try to make progress on that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  Deputies Berry and Brady have talked about the Naval Service and the number of patrol-duty hours.  Let us be honest, we have a problem in the Naval Service with recruitment and retention.  That has been the case for a number of years.  We must fix it, and we are going to fix it.  We are putting together a very ambitious plan to change those numbers.  Ships have been tied up this year that would otherwise have gone to sea.  Covid has added to that because we had to prioritise ships to set up testing facilities on quaysides in places like Cork and Dublin.  That was a higher priority than fisheries protection.  We made that call and that is what happens in the middle of a pandemic.  That is why, when one looks at the patrol-duty hours, they are lower than they otherwise would have been because of both those reasons.  Are we still doing a good job on fisheries protection?  I think we are doing a pretty good job on fisheries protection.  We have moved away from the memorandum of understanding with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which is the body that is answerable to the European Commission in terms of our sea-fisheries protection, the enforcement of the rules, and so on.  We have moved away from a set number of hours that are committed annually to a risk and outcomes-based approach.  That has given more flexibility of hours.</p><p>That does not mean it should be used as an excuse to drive down hours year after year, by describing that as a shift to a risk-based approach.  We can do a lot in Air Corps surveillance, and a lot more data are available now for fishing vessels, which we can monitor in a much more accurate way than ten years ago.  Anyone who visits the Naval Service and looks at the screens will see all the fishing boats in Irish waters under the Common Fisheries Policy.  We have applied a risk-based approach, reflecting some of the challenges we have around sea-going capacity in our Naval Service fleet.  We hope to get more ships to sea.  To do that we are looking at the decommissioning of some vessels and the potential acquisition of vessels that could be crewed by a smaller number of crew, which could do as good if not a better job in terms of more modern vessels.  These vessels are also much more efficient from a fuel perspective, which is a by-product benefit.</p><p> I do not shy away from the problems we have with the Naval Service numbers.  We have great people in the Naval Service.  It is a super career.  I had very seriously thought of joining the Naval Service when I was leaving school but I did not do it for a whole series of reasons.  We have an exciting plan for investment in new equipment and new ships.  We are investing heavily in Haulbowline naval base, as we speak.  The State has spent more than &euro;30 million putting in the new People's Park as part of that, of which the Department of Defence has now taken ownership from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The workplace on Haulbowline Island is improving all the time, in terms of quality of life and facilities, and will continue to improve through this year.  We have a big capital expenditure programme there.  I am on the case with regard to the problems in the Naval Service.  I do not sugar coat the problem that is there.  We are well below where we should be in numbers, but I hope to be able to turn that around in the next few years.</p><p> Everybody in the country is talking about cybersecurity at the moment because of what has happened with the HSE, the Department of Health and the attacks on the systems.  If we do not manage it really well it will result in loss of life and huge inconvenience for patients.  Hospitals are trying to manage a pandemic as well as significant increase in demand for healthcare over the last months.  It is hugely demanding and now they are faced with this.  We have a lot of good expertise in the Defence Forces.  Cybersecurity is an issue with very significant implications.  The response to cyber threats is a whole-of-government challenge, with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications taking the lead role, through the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, and with inputs from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  The primary role of the Defence Forces in cybersecurity relates to the defence and security of its own networks and systems, which I understand are well protected.  During the current situation the Defence Forces have provided IT facilities for contact tracing, as requested by the HSE.  I confirm that my Department has received briefings from NCSC on these incidents.  As the situation is evolving and investigations are ongoing I will not make further comment at this time, because it is not appropriate to do so.</p><p> Officials from my Department and members of the Defence Forces are actively participating in the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.  Officials from my Department are members of the steering group developing the public sector cybersecurity baseline standard.  My officials and members of the Defence Forces are also actively involved in the preparation of a national cyber risk assessment, which will support the development of resilience in Ireland's national infrastructure.  My Department has recently availed of Build to Share management desktop services.</p></speech>

There are some vacancies in the Communications and Information Services Corps, but there are also very strong contingents of people with a lot of expertise.  We also have people on secondment in Tallinn, Estonia, which is the European research centre for cyber security response.  We are very embedded in the national response and the cross-government response in cybersecurity protections.  We are involved in this current incident also, working with the HSE and the Department of Health.  I just want to give some reassurance around that.</p> <p>  We have made some progress in the area of gender equality.  The last time I was in the defence role I spent a lot of time speaking to the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General about how we can attract more women into the Defence Forces.  There has been a gradual improvement.  In 2016 it was 6.2%; in 2017 it was 6.5%; in 2018 it was 6.7%; in 2019 it was 6.9%; and 2020 it was 7%.  There is a gradual increase, but it is still only 7% of our Defence Forces.  We must get that into double figures at least.  Much thought is going into how we can make a career in the Defence Forces more attractive for women.  It is working, but it is working far too slowly.  It is one request I often get when I have conversations at the UN on peacekeeping.  It is always asking if it could get more female peacekeepers from Ireland.   In many of the very complex environments, which Deputy Berry will understand very well, and particularly in conflict and post-conflict management in parts of the world where sexual violence is being used as a tool of war, as well as being really good soldiers, female peacekeepers can do things that male peacekeepers cannot such as engaging with local populations and having private conversations that are often difficult and traumatic.  We will continue to prioritise this and I thank Deputy Brady for raising it.</p> <p>  There are 600 women in the Defence Forces, which is a good story and can be made better.  I would sum it up that way.  I do not want to down play what we have done here.  It is an improving situation.  Ireland is one of the few countries in the world where it is an improving situation.  Let us take the positives when they are there.  When one considers the career of someone like General Maureen O'Brien, for example, and the role she continues to play, there are templates for hugely successful careers for women in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  On Deputy Berry's 96 questions, I will get to them.  I am joking, but the Deputy knows that I am happy to take a call from him at any stage on any specific questions.  I will try to move through these questions quickly.</p> <p>  The strength of the Reserve Defence Force is nowhere near where it needs to be.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The main reason is why would a person join if he or she does not feel part of something that is active?  Of course, some people will always want to join for the opportunities around training and career development, but ultimately I would like to see a broadening of the role for the Reserve, very much working in a complementary manner to the Permanent Defence Force at home and overseas.  This is why the legislation is being amended, as we have proposed.  We hope to have this done well before the end of the year.  It is not complicated legislation.  This element of the Reserve has become the focal point of that legislation now, rather than the other elements within it.  I hope we will see a significant increase in numbers.</p><p>On some of the suggestions we have got, people who leave the Permanent Defence Force now are targeted as potential reservists in that they are given a brief on the Reserve and the options available to them.  There is a genuine effort to attract new personnel into the Reserve but it is also a case of asking personnel who leave the Permanent Defence Force to consider joining the Reserve because their skill sets could be very useful, not just in a pandemic but more generally.</p><p> The Defence Forces are delivering on what they are asked to do but they have to work 120% more than they would otherwise have to.  I take that point.  I have heard it made during visits to various barracks and so on, and having spoken to leaders there about the multitasking of many Defence Forces personnel.  Ultimately, we are a thousand personnel short of where we should be in terms of the overall Defence Forces number.  The Naval Service experiences the really sharp end of the problem but it also features in the Air Corps and the Army.  In some areas, however, we are not short at all.  In others, there are many vacancies.  This is not going to be solved overnight but it certainly needs to be solved in a sustained and planned way over a period.  I hope the commission will be able to make a serious contribution by way of proposals in this regard.  The idea that we are standing still or sitting on our hands on this issue is not true.  There are many things going on, such as re-enlistment, recruitment, recommissioning and directly targeting people from the private sector.  The latter initiative has been very successful in getting pilots back into the Air Corps, for example.  There is a lot happening in this space but we need to do more.  It is the job of the commission to consider this strategically.</p><p> On the question as to when we will see the legislation, I will introduce it as quickly as we can.  Whether we will be able to complete it before the summer, I am not sure, but we will certainly try to get it passed before the end of the year.  My target is to have it done before the commission reports, so it will have more options legally.  What we do not want is for the commission to make recommendations on the Reserve and then for us to go through a 12-month process of legislation to facilitate that.  The legislation allows us to do a lot more with reservists.  I hope it will allow us to act quickly on the commission recommendations on the Reserve.</p><p> I believe I answered the question on the targets for the Naval Service.  We do not have a target number of patrol hours.  The arrangement with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is different.  It is more qualitative and risk based but that is not necessarily an excuse for fewer hours; it is just a different approach.</p><p> On the question on whether we can spend &euro;37 million on built infrastructure, I believe we can.  There are currently infrastructure projects worth more than &euro;53 million at different stages of development.  This expenditure will increase as the programmes advance.  It is projected that &euro;100 million will be spent over the next three years and that &euro;145 million will be invested between 2021 and 2025.  There is no shortage of projects; it is a question of whether they can be delivered in the context of the disruption for which the pandemic has been responsible.</p><p> Capital expenditure for this year is likely to increase significantly beyond the estimated amount because there will be unspent money marked for current expenditure because we have enough in our Estimate for 9,500 serving personnel but we do not have anything like that number.  Therefore, we have managed to solidify an agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to transfer unspent money for salaries and allowances into capital and funds for other strategic investments.  Our Estimate is probably an underestimate of what it is possible to spend in this area.  I hope that gives us financial options.  The main challenge is whether the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence can, working together, deliver the projects in a timely manner given the huge disruption so far this year, particularly affecting building projects.</p><p> On staff, it is a little unfair to make the case that the number in the Department is increasing and the number in the Defence Forces is decreasing as if Government policy were to increase the number of civil servants and reduce the number of serving personnel.  That is not the case.  We are bending over backwards to try to find ways to recruit more people into the Defence Forces and to limit the losses owing to people being targeted by the private sector.  An increase of seven people in the Department is hardly a significant one.  Believe me, they are hard-working, talented people.  I work with them every day.  As in other Departments, there has been a modest increase in the number of civil servants since the deep recession of ten years ago, during which the number of civil and public servants generally was reduced.  The growth in civil servant numbers is very modest.  The civil servants are working in a very focused way to help the Defence Forces to recruit more people.  The better the teams in the Department, the more we will be able to improve the prospects for recruitment to the Defence Forces and have less churn in terms of losses.  There are some signs of positivity based on the numbers of personnel leaving the Defence Forces last year and this year by comparison with previous years.  There have been challenges associated with recruitment and training because of Covid restrictions, which have been a genuine problem.  The Defence Forces are trying to respond to that.</p></speech>

Several questions are outstanding so the Minister might drop a note to the committee on them because we have to move on to the pensions Vote.  I am very keen to hear from Deputy Clarke.  I will call her now and then return to the Minister briefly, based on his agreement to furnish in writing the many outstanding replies to Deputy Berry.</p></speech>

I believed there were 102, not 96.  I do not intend to go back over questions that have already been asked.  I thank Deputy Berry for his generosity in that regard.  I very much echo his concerns about the Defence Forces.  The numbers are deeply concerning.  The Minister might address the Civil Defence and the funding of &euro;4 million that is being provided.  I note there was under-expenditure in 2020 and I note also, with some concern, that there has been a significant drop in the number participating in courses, seminars and exercises.  I am concerned for constituencies like mine, which rely heavily on the Defence Forces and Civil Defence when it comes to issues such as flooding.  They have played a significant role in this area in recent years.</p> <p>  I want to touch on subheads A10 and A17, which concern military transport and Defence Forces logistics and travel, respectively.  In one case there is a decrease, and in the other there is a significant increase.  Can the Minister go into some detail on how the climate Bill will affect these two subheads of the Estimates?  What is the impact of the reorganisation that took place several years ago on the increasing travel demands being placed on members of the Defence Forces?</p> <p>  I would like to move on to Defence Forces communication and IT.</p><p>A quick glance over the documentation provided today would say to me this is an area that is looking at a significant decrease, in fact one that is very closely behind the payments being allocated to relatives of those in the War of Independence.  It is one of the highest levels of decrease.  I have to put it to the Minister that in many ways this is not reflective of a modern defence force.  We should be seeing increases in spending on technology as the work undertaken by the Defence Forces changes and modernises in line with the rest of society.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1495" speakername="Sorca Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2021052000002#J00300"><p>This is heading A15 on communication and IT.  It is an area where we should be seeing increased spending year on year simply because of the changing nature of the environment in which the Defence Forces work.</p> <p>  I know we are under time pressure and I want to move ahead quite swiftly.  With regard to medical care and support and the increase in the Estimate for litigation and compensation costs, when we look at this in comparison with A5, which is under Vote 35, regarding allowances for compensation payments, how does the Minister square this circle?  We are seeing a decrease in allocation for medical and healthcare supports and an increase for litigation and compensation costs but we are not seeing an increase in the allowance for compensation payments.  This is something that needs to be looked at again.  With regard to these compensation costs and payments, what alternative non-adversarial models has the Department looked at to reach a quicker outcome that meets the needs of the person and the Department and limits the amount of money that needs to be spent on legal fees?  Often, in my experience, resolution can be found much quicker and much more easily where there is active negotiation and communication.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned briefly there has been an agreement with regard to an underspend being almost ring-fenced into defence and this is very positive.  The Minister also mentioned buildings of historical significance.  How much money is being allocated this year for barracks that are closed and for the maintenance of historic buildings to ensure they do not go to such a low level that essentially they are worthless or useless, or that we lose all of their historical aspects?</p></speech>

The total number of active Civil Defence volunteers as of today is 2,793.  The total budget for Civil Defence from the Department in 2021 is &euro;5.64 million.  This includes &euro;1 million from the dormant accounts fund, which is used to upgrade the Civil Defence fleet.  This allocation will ensure the Civil Defence continues to perform its core function of supporting the principal response agencies, as set out in the Civil Defence - Towards 2030 policy, which was launched last year.  We continue to support the Civil Defence and it is playing a significant role again this year in the voluntary work it does.  Our funding is primarily about ensuring it gets the right equipment and training to be able to do the job and we remain strongly supportive of the work it does.</p> <p>  Climate action is important across all aspects of Government now, even in defence.  If we look at what we are doing here, we are investing in the energy proofing of our buildings and we have a significant number of buildings.  Improving energy efficiency and the energy management of our portfolio of buildings is important.  We use electric vehicles where possible but there are some vehicles for which this does not work.  We are not likely to have an electric Mowag any time soon.  This does not mean that in terms of many of the transportation vehicles we cannot look at more emissions-efficient vehicles.  We are also using green energy where possible.  This will be factored into procurement discussions and choices, as it will for every Department.</p> <p>  With regard to communications and information technology, the outturn for last year was a lot higher than this year's Estimate.  I am told that if the outturn this year is higher than the Estimate as it was last year then we will spend more money as needed.  When we look at the list of areas where we are spending money, including computer and data preparation, equipment, printing, photocopying, signal equipment and maintenance and telecommunications services, they are in contract cycles so we will sometimes have higher expenditure and sometimes lower expenditure.  I assure the Deputy, and I have been very clear with the chair of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces on this, that I expect it to look in a very serious way at cybersecurity as one of the key priorities in future planning for the Defence Forces, in terms of their own systems and contributing to the national challenges on this.  I do not think money or funding will be a problem in terms of this issue.  The challenges will be skill sets and recruitment.  The Deputy can take from me that the actual hardware and equipment and the housing of those personnel will not be a problem.  It is about the skill sets.  We already have many skilled people in the Defence Forces but we probably need more.  Believe me, there is a lot of competition for people who are talented and educated in this area.</p> <p>  On the compensation issue-----</p></speech>

We have an arbitration process in the Defence Forces that works reasonably well.  I make a point of committing to the recommendations that come through this system and the same goes for the ombudsman.  If there are better ways in which we can make decisions that avoid court cases I am totally open to it.  There is too much litigation linked to the defence family, if we want to call it that.  There are also a lot of protected disclosures that we have to think about how we address in terms of systems in the Defence Forces.  This has less to do with the Department and much more to do with the Defence Forces <i>per se</i>, whereby people feel they have not been treated fairly or that decisions were made that did not follow full procedures.  Within the Defence Forces we have many procedures and structures and we need to find a way of not tying ourselves up in knots when we do not need to with regard to litigation and protected disclosures.  Of course, there has to be a transparent and confidential outlet for people also who feel they have been unfairly treated.</p><p>That is important, particularly among Defence Forces personnel and working in a structured environment which needs to protect people as well as systems.</p></speech>

On my own behalf and that of members, I acknowledge this has been a difficult year for the Defence Forces with the challenges of Covid in particular.  They have made a great contribution over a wide range of issues directly related to the pandemic.  The committee is most grateful for the leadership and endeavour shown by the Chief of Staff, the Defence Forces and officials in the Department of Defence.  Their contribution to logistics, testing and the ongoing vaccination programme, along with the assistance to the civil power has been quite remarkable.  I know it will continue.</p></speech>

The committee is meeting to continue its pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Electoral Reform Bill.  We are joined by representatives of the following political: Mr. Darragh McShea, assistant general secretary, Fianna F&aacute;il; Mr. John Carroll, general secretary, Fine Gael; Ms Maura Rose McMahon, general secretary, the Green Party; Mr. Brian Sheehan, general secretary, the Social Democrats; and Deputy &Oacute; Broin from Sinn F&eacute;in.</p> <p>  I will ask witnesses to make opening statements.  I ask witnesses to be brief and keep their opening statements to a minute or two so that we have plenty of time for questioning.  Any of the written statements submitted will be published on the website after the meeting.  </p> <p>  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre in order to participate in public meetings.  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. McShea to make his opening statement.   </p></speech>

I must admit that having somebody appear as both a witness and a member of the committee is an unusual situation.  I do not see it covered in Standing Orders.  We requested the presence of the general secretaries or assistant general secretaries of the parties or their nominee to assist us in our pre-legislative scrutiny this morning.  It would appear that Deputy &Oacute; Broin has been nominated as the representative of the general secretary of Sinn F&eacute;in to appear as a witness at the committee.  Could Deputy &Oacute; Broin confirm this?  I see he has his hand up.  I do not want to spend too much time on this because we have a lot to get through.

As per the letter of invitation to the party, it was the secretary general or a nominee and the party has chosen me as its nominee so I am quite happy to fulfill that role.  My understanding is that there is nothing in Standing Orders that prohibits such a decision.</p></speech>

That is not in question.  It never was.  What I am questioning is how that works from the committee's perspective in terms of whether Deputy &Oacute; Broin will ask himself questions, which he will then answer, and whether he intends to also act as a member of the committee and question the other witnesses.  It is important for the committee and it is also out of respect for the other witnesses because they will not have an opportunity to interrogate or question other witnesses.  I just want to know what the intention is.  To be fair to everybody, we need to clear that up at the start.</p></speech>

I am just wondering how this will work from a practical perspective.  Is someone allowed to be both a witness and a member of a committee?

I will leave that to the other members.  I am sure they have plenty of tricky questions for me.  There is nothing in Standing Orders that prevents such a thing and in fact, this is not the first time it has happened.  There have been periods before where members of committees have also been witnesses to committees so I do not think it is problematic.  It is my intention as a member of this committee to ask questions, as I am entitled to do.  Of course, I will happily answer any questions members put to me as the party's chosen witness.</p></speech>

Our general secretary has a prior commitment this morning and sends his apologies to the committee.  He has asked me to represent the party this morning.  We have made a full statement, which has been submitted to the committee, but in light of the Chairman's request that we try to keep our opening statements to one or two minutes, I will shorten it accordingly.</p> <p>  The committee has invited political parties here today primarily to deal with the issue of the electoral register.  It is our view that the recent revelations regarding the holding of a unique and growing database by one political party represents an abuse that flies in the face of the core principles which have underpinned our electoral and data protection laws for over 20 years.</p><p>The most recent case was met by repeated denials of the existence and nature of the database, as well as assertions of compliance.  I acknowledge the significant work of Philip Ryan and the <i>Irish Independent</i>on this issue, work which is probably the reason we are today discussing this matter.<br/><br/>I want to be very clear.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not, has not and will not use the electoral register in the manner in which Sinn F&eacute;in does.  We have not maintained, nor do we maintain, a national database of voters.  We have had, for many years, a member of staff who has specialist qualifications and knowledge in the field of data protection.  We go to great lengths to abide by the letter and spirit of the law.  We appointed a qualified data protection officer prior to the enactment of the 2018 legislation.  This was a legal requirement of all parties upon the enactment of the 2018 Act.  As a party, we take our responsibilities and obligations in this area seriously.  We are conscious that we have significant responsibilities and obligations to both the Data Protection Commissioner and to those whose data we hold, specifically our members and supporters.<br/><br/>There is no basis for allowing any party to maintain a large super database that links its own records with the electoral register and combines it with profiling from individual social media accounts.  We do not believe, and we have been advised, that this was not the intention of the law enacted in 2018.<br/><br/>The electoral register exists in order that candidates can know the names of their electors.  It is right and proper that candidates and political parties should know the electors eligible to vote in an election.  It is, in fact, crucial for democracy.  However, under no circumstances, should anyone be allowed to use the register as the foundation to construct a much bigger database, cross-referencing many sources to gather information about individuals, unbeknown to those individuals, for the purpose of micro-targeting them into the future.<br/><br/>It is our view that there is a need to introduce safeguards regarding databases in general.  We believe registered political parties should be required to register all databases.  This registration should include listing the persons with access to each database and the location of its management.  Where a database includes any personal details, a proper and transparent data protection notice should be provided to individuals in advance of the storing of this information.<br/><br/>We know people, rightly, are increasingly conscious of the rights surrounding their personal data.  We know people are worried about the ever-increasing risks with respect to their personal data.  As a party, we will continue to take all steps necessary to comply with both the spirit and letter of the data protection laws.  We strongly advocate that the tolerance of super databases, built centrally using the electoral register as the foundation, is not accepted.</p></speech>

I must note first that my understanding was that I was invited as general secretary to attend the committee hearing today.  While I was aware that I could delegate this to another individual within the national organisation, I was not aware I could delegate it out of the ambit of headquarters.</p> <p>  The general scheme proposes that the information in the register of electors maintained will only be used for electoral or other statutory purpose.  This is broadly the same legislative position as currently applies.  Under the current legislation, it is stated that a person who uses information in the register for a purpose other than an electoral or other statutory purpose will be guilty of an offence.  Given this, it would appear the proposed legislation will not change the situation as for what the electoral register can be used.</p> <p>  Relating to Fine Gael's use of the electoral register, we hold copies of a number of electoral registers from recent years.  These are kept for reference, research and planning purposes.  For example, we use the information to be able to understand how many voters are in an area.  We also use this information to assess changes in voter registrations from year to year and, in particular, to inform submissions to various constituency boundary commission reviews when they occur.</p> <p>  We also hold electoral registers on behalf of public representatives or candidates to facilitate their electoral activities.  For example, they may not have the technology to maintain a copy of the register on their own systems.  We do not merge, transfer or export the data from these registers to any central database, nor do we associate any other data against those held from the electoral register.  We do not have a national database of voters.</p> <p>  We also hold copies of the marked electoral registers.  This is for reference and planning purposes, primarily relating to turnout in particular areas.  The data from the marked electoral registers are not associated with any other data.</p></speech>

To clarify, we extended the invite to the general secretaries of each of the parties or asked them to submit a nominee to attend.  It would be reasonable to infer that the nominee would have some sort of responsibility or knowledge of the data requirements of the party they represent.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms McMahon to make her opening statement.  I know she had a power failure and is late in joining the meeting.  It would be appreciated if witnesses could keep their opening statements to two minutes.</p></speech>

In particular, we recognise the challenges around the dynamic nature of technological innovation across international borders and through new platforms developing.</p> <p>  The Green Party would like to comment in particular on the need for an equal playing field for all candidates to get elected, especially those who have not been traditionally involved in politics and might not have the tech or plain language savvy to understand some of the issues around the non-statutory use of the electoral register that has been alluded to in the media recently.  We advocate for a transparent electoral process that uses plain language to ensure appropriate access to the register for statutory purposes.</p> <p>  In terms of the party's use of the register, we have an outsourced data protection officer with in-house data champions.  The electoral data are used for electoral purposes in line with GDPR and our party objectives, which are active participation in the political process, as well as informing, educating and involving the public in politics.  The party does not currently maintain copies of unmarked registers.  The party maintains two scanned copies of marked registers from 2019 and 2020.  The registers are stored on secure EU-based servers and are subject to strict access control at HQ level.</p> <p>  Any use of the marked register is subject to data protection impact assessments, DPIA, as required by the data protection officer, to ensure that all risks associated with processing these data are accounted for and appropriately mitigated against in advance.  Marked registers are used for anonymised voter engagement and personal data are not used.  The identification of voter engagement patterns is used to optimise our party electoral strategy and success.  We find that is dependent on party resourcing and data protection safeguarding.  As a growing party, our intention is to utilise data for heat maps, for example.</p></speech>

We are keen it has the maximum levels of powers, particularly adequate resourcing and funding.  We also support the move towards a centralised register of electors and an updated and appropriate register given the difficulties that all of us experience with it.</p> <p>  The one area of the Bill with which we have concerns is the regulation of online advertising, which we feel is weak.  That is shared by many members of the committee.  Accordingly, we would like to see that strengthened.</p> <p>  There are three reasons our secretary general appointed me.  First, this is about the electoral reform Bill and I am the party spokesperson on the issue, meaning I am best placed to answer questions about it.  I also have been fighting elections for 25 years, including being a director of elections most recently in the Dublin Mid-West by-election.  I have hands-on knowledge of how we use the electoral register and can provide those questions with detailed answers.  I also provide canvass training for party members.</p> <p>  We do not use the electoral register for anything other than electoral purposes.  We do not cross-reference data or information from any other source.</p><p>We use the register along with face-to-face, door-to-door canvassing to do exactly what Mr. McShea, Mr. Carroll and others have outlined, which is about identifying and targeting our vote and getting it out on the day.  It is a really important tool regardless of whether you do it with paper and pen and hold the information in a biscuit tin, whether you use private sector databases such as, for example, Blue State, NationBuilder or Ecanvasser, or whether you have a centrally provided facility, as we do.  This is a key tool for voter engagement, mobilisation and turnout.</p><p> Just so people are very clear, we do not hold a national database.  What we have is an online platform in which every general election and local government constituency can access the electoral register.  One of the advantages of using a system like that is that it is much easier to ensure compliance rather than having to rely in many cases on volunteers, candidates and elected representatives in multiple constituencies having to grapple with the complexities of the general data protection legislation, GDPR, and the relevant legislation.  Some of the characterisations are misinformed but I am happy to go through all that in further detail during questions and answers.</p></speech>

We welcome the scrutiny the committee is giving to the issue.  It is very important voters have confidence in the security and uses of the electoral register.  The Social Democrats makes limited use of the electoral register.  We do not engage in any processing of the register and do not augment the information on it.  We continue to comply with the letter and spirit of the data protection legislation.</p> <p>  We have been advocates of enhanced processing and centralised management of the electoral register to ensure all those eligible to vote can vote and to ensure there are accurate statistics around turnout and constituency sizes, so we very much welcome many of the proposals in the Bill.

I should make it clear at this point that the Labour Party supports the primary purpose of the Bill under consideration by the committee, which is to provide for the establishment of an independent electoral commission.  We have some reservations about the division of responsibility that is proposed between the new commission and the Standards In Public Office Commission.  However, given the time constraints this morning, I will not go into these now and will just focus on issues relating to the electoral register.</p> <p>  Data protection and privacy is something the Labour Party regards as being very important.  We have a data protection officer and we engage staff both internally and externally to monitor our obligations in this area and believe we are fully compliant.  We ensure our responsibilities relating to privacy and data protection are under regular review and we apply improvements as required.  Where necessary, the Labour Party carries out a data protection impact assessment on any proposed changes to data processing within the party.</p> <p>  The Labour Party holds a database of members and supporters.  This database includes information such as the names, addresses, contact details, trade union membership, date of birth, party membership fees and areas of interest.  It also includes where the particular members or supporters have been involved in campaigns such as election or referendum campaigns.  Supporters are added to our database if they sign up to our mailing list, get involved in a campaign or sign a petition or survey, but all of our data on members and supporters plus our website are hosted in Ireland.  We do not hold an electoral register database in head office.  As members will be aware, individual candidates for election or elected representatives are entitled to receive a copy of the electoral register under the Electoral Acts but this is not uploaded to a centralised database on our behalf.  Candidates and elected representatives at local level may hold data relating to constituents relative to their functions in those roles and with regard to electoral activities, but this is not held in a centralised database within the Labour Party.</p> <p>  I thank members for their time and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for attending today.  We have had a number of sessions.  We are conducting a very important piece of pre-legislative scrutiny.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish an electoral commission.  It has been talked about for years and we very much hope to get this piece of work completed swiftly and to have an independent electoral commission in place as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I will focus on two key areas: the use of the electoral register and political advertising.  I thank the witnesses for their statements.  I understand from them that Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party that operates a centralised database and combines that database with online political advertising.  I heard what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  It is a cloud-based database.  I guess it is hosted on servers internationally in the US, Germany, Bosnia and Northern Ireland.  My understanding is the database contains information about constituents from the electoral register and from the party's constituencies.  I guess the party has 50 offices that serve the 37 Deputies, their secretaries and what I guess are a few hundred councillors.  As I understand it, from what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, all those Deputies, councillors and volunteers contribute to the database, which also contains the electoral register.  While I accept Deputy &Oacute; Broin is saying it is secure, many people have a lot of access to information about an awful lot of people if the database contains information on up to three million voters.  As I understand it, the database would be characterised by having information such as voters' names and addresses, the people with whom they live and their friends and families.  If somebody was to go to a local councillor such as S&eacute;amas McGrattan in Cabra or Larry O'Toole, he or she might also give his or her PPS number, phone number, email address or the status of his or her employment if it was a housing issue.  That is an awful lot of information - very personal information.</p> <p>  The security of it is very important not just for those individuals but also for our democracy when you combine it with the power of the microtargeting that can be done on platforms like Facebook.  I see from Sinn F&eacute;in's Facebook ad profile that it has 17 advertising managers based in the US, Germany, Serbia and Ireland.  I presume those 17 Facebook managers, combined with all of Sinn F&eacute;in's Deputies, councillors and volunteers who have access to the database, have access to and are managing all of those data and from there, creating custom audiences.  This involves microtargeting similar to what was used in the Brexit campaign in the UK and, more recently, in the US presidential election.  Sinn F&eacute;in has an ad running this week where Mary Lou McDonald invites people to join her on a Zoom call to talk about housing.  Does Sinn F&eacute;in use that microtargeting in the database to do that?</p><p>If that is the case, the challenge is to understand if people are comfortable with that, if it is good for our democracy and how it will impact on our democracy going forward.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that it is not just Sinn F&eacute;in that has access to this; other parties also have access to it.  I heard Deputy McDonald say that up until recently Sinn F&eacute;in did not have a data protection officer, which is a requirement under GDPR.  It also only recently provided a privacy statement on its website, which is also a legal requirement under GDPR.  Did Sinn F&eacute;in undertake a data protection impact assessment before uploading the electoral register and merging that data with the information its constituents provide to local representatives?  They are all legal requirements.  </p><p> My final question relates to Facebook.  Its terms and conditions require every user of its customer audience function to have a lawful basis for creating those audiences and microtargetting.  Has Sinn F&eacute;in complied with that requirement?  If the other three requirements - a data protection officer, a privacy statement and a data protection impact assessment - were not met, how can Sinn F&eacute;in comply with Facebook's terms and conditions?  Perhaps, it has done that by deleting the database and the custom audiences.  If so, I would like to hear about that.  We need to address this issue going forward in the electoral commission legislation.</p></speech>

However, I am sure others will ask similar questions so I will answer them at some point.</p> <p>  I want it to be clear that we do not take information from any source, be that a constituency case file or social media interactions, and cross-reference those with the electoral register.  It is not possible to do it on the Ab&uacute; system and we have never wanted to do it and it would not be appropriate to do it.  When a person comes into my constituency office and asks me to take up a constituency case and he or she gives me private information for the purposes of that work, that information is stored separately in my constituency case file.  Some of our members use the Oireachtas system for that purpose, but I am a little old fashioned and I still use paper and pen that is adequately secured in paper files.  None of that private information, for example PPS numbers and so on, is in any way cross-referenced with the electoral register or uploaded into Ab&uacute;.  As Senator Fitzpatrick will know, I am very active on social media on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  We do not, and cannot, take information from social media and upload it onto the Ab&uacute; system.  None of the propositions about which Senator Fitzpatrick inquired take place.  </p> <p>  On the second issue, it is probably a mischaracterisation to talk about a national database.  When one logs onto the Ab&uacute; system, as I would do as a candidate or director of elections, I can only access the register to which I am entitled, which is the Dublin Mid West register.  The only people who will have access to that register are me, as a candidate, or my director of elections or director of canvass.  We will only use that register during the course of elections for the purposes of canvassing, knocking on doors, talking to people, persuading them to vote for us and so on.  If those people voluntarily confirm to us that they will vote for us we take a note of that such that on election day, Get Out the Vote operation, we can interact with those people.</p></speech>

I do not want a row, honestly, but, I regret, that is a significant decision by a Chair which I would have to challenge.</p></speech>

The Deputy is within the confines of Leinster House so he has privileges above those of other witnesses in attendance.  In that regard, I need to be fair.  I cannot allow a witness who has extra privilege to put questions to another witness.  I do not think it is fair for one witness to question another witness.  I think the Deputy would agree on that point.  It is for members of the committee to put questions to witnesses, but as confirmed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin in his opening statement he is appearing today as a witness.  The question of privilege also arises.  I need to be fair to all witnesses and that forms part of my ruling on the matter.</p></speech>

I request that at a later stage the committee would write to the Ceann Comhairle for an opinion on the matter.  Again, I am not seeking to delay the process of the committee, but it is unheard of for a Chair to deny a member of a committee the right to participate as a member.  I would like the Ceann Comhairle's ruling on that at a later stage.</p></speech>

In my parts of my constituency, voter turnout is very low.  In terms of the electoral register, in some cases, only 25% of those registered are voting.  A lack of knowledge around how to vote appears to be an issue.  In that regard, in previous elections, we distributed sample ballot papers to try to encourage more people to engage in the voting process.  When the European and local elections or a referendum are being held at the same time the number of spoiled votes is high.  We believe this is down to people either not being used to voting or unable to manage the process.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to work to get more people to vote.  As mentioned earlier, we need everyone entitled to vote to engage in the process and vote.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on that issue.  I will come in again later, time permitting.</p></speech>

This is very much an issue in the Green Party's constitution around gender commitment.  We would ensure that we targetting an equal number of males, females and others - they, he, she - and also that we are targetting people who have not participated in the electoral process to date.</p><p>We strongly feel that the 60% on the electoral register is not representative of current Irish society.  We do a significant amount of outreach throughout the year, beyond electoral periods, to make sure we engage with a variety of stakeholders, such as the Irish Traveller network and through the school systems.  One suggestion we have had is to create a waiting list.  This is a great opportunity for the electoral reform commission to create a waiting list of young people who are trained up and have it embedded in their education, that they understand their rights as voters and how they can engage from the first opportunity when they turn 18 years old.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to have it so that it is when they turn 16 years rather than 18 years.</p><p> Ongoing engagement with the stakeholders is under way through our own party.  Embedding constitutional mandates across other political parties would be helpful to ensure we get a wider group of people.  The educational process alluded to should be a cross-party initiative embedded in the commission&rsquo;s work, quite frankly.  Those are things which the Green Party has advocated for and is driving.  With the leadership of our own Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Matthews as the chair, and Deputy Duffy, we will work to continue to do that and welcome the opportunity to do so together.</p></speech>

It is something we take very seriously, and I agree with the previous speaker, Ms McMahon, that the electoral register needs serious reform and needs to be examined and looked through again.  I believe that is something the electoral commission would be tasked with, along with constituency reviews and encouraging voting.  The previous speaker spoke about education and the inclusion from a very young age in school information on how to vote and how our political system works.  Many schools do this with their own elections internally with young children and that is something that needs to continue in the older years as well.  It is achieved through education and ensuring the electoral commission is tasked, empowered and resourced to carry out the function of encouraging voting.</p></speech>

A constituent brought it up with me that when their son turned 18 years, he was taken off the child benefit.  The children&rsquo;s allowance was stopped.  What they could not understand was why he did not automatically go on to the electoral register so that he could vote.  When the election came last year, he was not able to vote.  He was 19 years at that stage.  One of the things I have asked for, and this obviously goes hand in hand with data protection, is to look at how we can use PPS numbers and to see how the Department of Health, Department of Education, Department of Social Protection can link in to ensure the register is accurate.  The other issue was the age at which people are able to vote.  What are witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on that?</p></speech>

They would be very welcome pieces.  The more bureaucracy we can reduce by allowing people to get onto the register while ensuring it is accurate is welcome.  I concur with Deputy Gould&rsquo;s view on that.</p></speech>

In relation to Deputy Gould&rsquo;s first question, during the session in two weeks' time, we intend to invite the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland to attend to address some of those issues of expanding and increasing voter participation in elections.  Pre-registration of 16- and 17-year-olds is a very positive move to get people on the register before they turn 18 years of age.</p></speech>

Normal politicians did.  Today, I would like to find out whether Sinn F&eacute;in watched it unfold and wondered how it could use that strategy for its political gain.  I had intended to put a number of questions to the general secretary of that party, but instead they selected a politician to give political answers to data questions, questions on the register of electors and questions on facts.  I find it interesting that nobody in Sinn F&eacute;in headquarters seems to have the authority or knowledge to answer those questions on the database it holds under the strict protection legislation.</p> <p>  I hope Deputy &Oacute; Broin, as the expert on electoral reform for Sinn F&eacute;in, can answer my questions.  The data contained in the Ab&uacute; system was described by Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s leadership, and by Deputy &Oacute; Broin today, as being merely the electoral register.  However, how was data scraped from the electoral register, in particular from the marked register, into Ab&uacute;?</p></speech>

Again, let me be very clear so there is no confusion.  We do not take any information from social media or, as Senator Fitzpatrick asked, from our constituency work as politicians and in any way cross-reference, upload or integrate that with the electoral register.  The electoral register is purely for canvassed returns and get-out-the-vote operations during an election period.</p></speech>

I suppose it is just one of the fields that the designer of the system put in.  The only thing I could think of from my personal experience is every so often when you are on a canvass, as I am sure Deputy Higgins knows, and somebody who is a voter for your party requests, for example, that they would like a lift to the polling station on the day, you might record something like that, but it would be very unusual.</p></speech>

What we were interested in doing was seeing how different demographics would react to it.  As Deputy Higgins knows, it is a facility Facebook provides and therefore you might have had the advertisement targeting people in geographic area or an age group.  We do not store any of the information arising from that.  Facebook stores it.  The information is fully anonymised.  The only thing you get back from Facebook is the Facebook analytics in terms of the anonymised responses to the advertisements.</p></speech>

To clarify, when he speaks about the Ab&uacute; system and it being cross referenced with the marked register, I note that in my own subject access request, SAR, the party was able to tell me whether or not I voted in elections.  Is he saying that is done manually by someone sitting down with a marked register and literally cross-referencing it with the Ab&uacute; system?  Has somebody done that in constituencies right across the country, even though there are only a very limited number of people who have access to this?</p></speech>

To get back to some sort of context, we are here to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on the electoral reform Bill.  I have two simple questions in this first round.  I will speak in the second round if my colleague is not present.  I made contact yesterday in the Oireachtas on the marked registers.  We are in a bubble in here and we all know what is going on but the public who are listening in &ndash; I have no doubt there will be many &ndash; need to understand what is a marked register.  A marked register is one that is marked off at the polling station, which indicates that someone has presented himself or herself to a polling station and received a ballot paper.  It is nothing more than that.  The person may or may not have voted.  Of course, 99% of them vote.  That is what it is.  The returning officers for each constituency is mandated to submit the marked register to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I contacted the people dealing with this yesterday.  The marked registers are then kept here.  The Clerk is specifically given guidelines to the effect that he must destroy those registers within six months.  He must get a certificate confirming that they are both manually destroyed and that they are removed from our IT systems.  I checked all of this yesterday.  I also got the statutory declaration documentation on this process, which I thought was particularly interesting, setting out that the declaration that must be signed.  In addition, I got a schedule of the fees that are paid.  Let us be clear for the public listening in: political parties and politicians, and for that matter, I learned yesterday that it is open to the public, can apply to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to have the marked registers, every register in the country, if they so wish.  My question to each of the parties is whether they can confirm that they applied to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the marked registers.  Can they confirm where they store them or upload them?  Can they confirm if they divided up those registers among the constituencies?  How did they distribute them?  There are very strict criteria in the declaration.  I have a copy of it and I will circulate it to the committee later setting out the legal requirements on how all that is done.  That is one question.</p> <p>  It is really important that the public know what happens.  I think the public will be appalled and shocked that, first, the marked registers are kept, second, that a fee is paid for them, and third, that they are transferred to all the political party groupings.  Would everyone confirm that to me in a moment?  That is a question for each and every witness here today.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses please explain the manner in which their party uses targeted advertising, deliberately showing political advertisements to people on the basis of their gender, age and location?  I put that question to everyone.  I will start at the top with Fianna F&aacute;il and Mr. McShea, and work down through Fine Gael, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats.</p></speech>

I do not believe we have applied for the marked register for the most recent election.  We do not hold it.  Centrally, in party headquarters, we hold very little data outside of the party's membership.  We adhere to the very strict data protection requirements even pertaining to our membership and supporters.  Online, we have our data protection notice.  We do not hold databases centrally in the party.  It is restricted to the members and supporters of our party.  We hold the information on that basis.</p> <p>  In response to the Senator's second query on political advertising, I can confirm that we do not use our data to target advertisements by gender or anything of that nature either.</p></speech>

On the marked electoral register, we get that from the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and we pay the appropriate fees.  As he mentioned, this is open to anyone, not just the political parties, it is also open to Independents, Independent councillors and to members of the public.  We store that locally within headquarters, with a very confined access regime to ensure its security and we do not share it beyond ourselves nor, as I mentioned in my opening statement, do we associate it with any other data from our side.<br/><br/>Regarding advertising, Facebook advertising is the predominant format, we target geographically.  That is natural enough because if one has a candidate standing for election in a particular area, one probably does not want the people in Dublin Bay South to see Deputy Higgins's material and <i>vice versa</i>, so it would probably be negligent of us to engage in some kind of broad national advertising campaigns.  Geography will always be a factor.  Gender will be a factor as well if there is particular material that we feel is more appropriate to a female audience or a male audience we will target it, and obviously age.<br/><br/>Going back to Deputy Gould's contribution on voter engagement, there are different messages that different parts of the audience will hear and will want to hear.  They are the broad pieces that we do.  We do not use pixel data or cookie data or lookalike audiences within that context.</p></speech>

They are stored at headquarters in a secure location and they are accessed by the data protection champions.</p><p>They are not distributed.  We are strict on access and we use data protection impact assessments, DPIAs, in respect of any type of future use.  We do not use targeted advertising.  The Senator spoke about fees and resourcing, the limits that poses and the uneven playing field it creates among parties, particularly the Independent candidates that would like to access politics but probably are not able to.  The Green Party does not have the capacity to use targeted adverts.  We are aware of from our elected representatives of regional areas of interest, as mentioned by my colleague, John Carroll.  We would try to promote particular areas of interest in region, age, gender and so on.  That is done on a cerebral basis.  Limited budget is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed by the electoral commission so that we can ensure there is a fair playing field.  I thank the Senator for that question.</p></speech>

I would like to pose some questions myself.  I have been knocking on doors for 20 years with an electoral register in my hands.  Candidates engage with people and they take note of whether a person is likely to support them.  They do that for their own benefit.  This has moved into a much greater sphere with a much more complex collection of data.  It puts the wealthier parties at a much greater advantage in terms of the amount of money and the resources they can invest.  The smaller parties and Independents just do not have that access.  It is influencing politics in a way.  It has always been the way that the more money you have, the more influence you have.  We know that to be true across society, but in politics and democracy, that it is a very unfair direction in which we appear to be going.  My question is to the representatives of the three smaller parties in terms of representation, namely, Ms McMahon, Mr. Sheehan and Ms Sparks.  Do they feel at a disadvantage when trying to compete with the wealthier parties and do they think the playing field is level for them?  I ask the witnesses to respond in reverse order, starting with Ms Sparks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Billie Sparks" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021052000002#G00900"><p>The Chairman raises an important point.  Online advertising, like any advertising, costs money.  The larger and better resourced parties have more opportunity to put money behind advertisements to microtarget to a larger extent.  They have more staff members who are devoted to this task.  This is something we come up against.  It is a challenge.  It is something we focus on and prioritise, but resources are limited for us compared with some of the other parties and we often have to be smarter in regard to how we go about doing things and ensure we invest the limited resources we have wisely.</p> <p>  I share the Chairman's concerns in regard to how this will impact on democracy and how politics functions in this country going forward.  The Chairman is correct that those with more money tend to have a position of advantage, but it has never been as apparent or obvious in politics that the parties with the larger resources and money behind them have a much greater advantage than smaller parties such as the Labour Party, the Social Democrats or the Green Party.  The Chairman has raised an important issue that needs to be looked at in terms of how we want our democracy to function into the future.</p></speech>

To be clear, any funding spent on advertising that we are able to do throughout elections is money raised directly from our members or the public.  We do not spend any State funding on advertising through an election.  That limits us as a smaller party.  In the previous election, we were very successful in reaching voters and getting our message across.  The challenge, as we have seen internationally, is the use of microdata and microtargeting to reach people with messages that, in some cases we have seen, inflame and are anti-democratic and anti-voter turnover.  Those are the areas where money is being spent that are most damaging to the body politic and to democracy in general.  The resources mean some parties with deeper pockets can reach people in a way that does not create a level playing pitch.  It is crucial there is transparency around who is being targeted by whom and the amounts of money being spent.  That should be done in real time rather than post an election.</p></speech>

Not to discount the importance and critical nature of competitive advantage, but it must be done on a level playing field.  This goes beyond the party.  It is about the party, the candidate and the electorate.  In speaking about resourcing, off the top of my head I am thinking about resourcing for adverts that is costing in content creation as well as mobilisation, staffing and how parties are able to mobilise staff to access electoral data and help support people to access voting.  Tech-savvy is about staffing and having the money to be able to afford to buy people with particular skill sets and the ability to provide plain language materials for the electorate such that you can engage people in a naturally transparent and accessible way.  Again, this is a serious issue that can be addressed in a meaningful way by the electoral commission and give voters more sense of agency.  The more complicated things are, the less people feel that their voice makes a difference in politics.  Perhaps, that is part of the reason we are seeing declining numbers across all areas of the island in terms of voter turnout.</p></speech>

We are talking about the online sphere here.  Fifteen or more years ago, when it was not as prevalent, small parties and Independents still faced the onslaught of armies of well-organised parties erecting posters and distributing leaflets.  They had huge armies of canvassers then as well, which was always demoralising.</p> <p>  I would like to return to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's comment that access to the Ab&uacute; database is for the candidate and campaign election manager.

As I sure the Chairman will know, when the local authority provides local government candidates or Deputies with copies of the register, that is often in electronic format.  It is often emailed or provided in a compact disc or memory stick.  Strictly speaking, anybody could pass that information on, but that would not be the practice.  The electoral register is a very sensitive document.  People from all parties who are entrusted with it, I assume, would treat it with the seriousness it requires.  It would not be passed on.  The only people with access to it are those who should have access to it during election time, which in general is candidates or key appointed members of their election teams.</p></speech>

Our data protection officer is constantly reviewing the cases that emerge with regard to potential difficulties as to where the data we hold could be stored.  The vast majority of any information we hold is held here in Ireland but there are cases, for example, when we use certain providers, where we would rely on standard contractual clauses, which I think many parties rely on, whereby data may be transferred for short periods to other jurisdictions outside the EEA.  We would do that in line with the regulations.  As I said, our own data protection officer is monitoring the situation constantly and monitoring developments with regard to case law, update us regularly and seek external legal advice to confirm what we are doing is correct.</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier in regard to the electoral registers, they are stored locally in Ireland as well.  We also use a service, Poppulo, a company based in Cork, to provide communications to supporters who consent to that information on our website.  It uses servers in Dublin, Cork and London, so that is outside the EU, as we understand it.  We received confirmation again yesterday from our data protection advisers that it is in line with the current data protection arrangements.  We have a data processing agreement with it since 2018.</p></speech>

We store our members&rsquo; data on a system that is not in the EEA at the moment.  The Senator will know, following the Schrems case, that the privacy shield which governed that was declared against EU law.  However, the standard contractual clauses were held to be valid by the EU court.  We are working with our suppliers until we get a decision from the European Data Protection Board, and there is currently a consultation and new guidance is coming from it.  As soon as that new guidance comes, we will certainly implement that.  In any event, towards the end of this year, we are probably moving to a new system which will probably be stored internally on an Irish server.</p></speech>

For example, like many of the other parties, most of our data pertaining to membership and things of that nature are stored here in Ireland.

What is the intention of each of the parties and how are they going to approach the use of the electoral register and the marked register in the Dublin Bay South by-election?  On a question to Fine Gael in particular, will there be a crossover of centrally managed databases from former Deputies and representatives that are used by Fine Gael in the campaigning in Dublin Bay South?</p></speech>

I draw the Senator's attention to the letter the Oireachtas gives to all outgoing Members when they resign, which states: &ldquo;Outgoing Members are also reminded that personal data which was given to them by constituents may not be transferred to third parties without the consent of the data subject.&rdquo;  That is what the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission tells Members and we would not in any way try to go around that.</p> <p>  The other bit that is important is that we did not say we had a central electoral register or central marked register.  I want to be clear that what I said was that we maintain copies of the individual ones we receive from the clerk, but we do not in any way merge, export, scrape, optically scrape or anything of that nature to bring them into some other format.</p></speech>

One of the reasons, I understand, that political parties, Independents and candidates have access to the marked register as well as the register is to try to ensure we get the maximum number of people voting in the election, which is obviously something we all want to see in any democracy.</p></speech>

On a question for Deputy &Oacute; Broin regarding the information stored on interactions at the doors, does that include voting intention or political profiles of individual voters?

I am speaking to a committee of Members of the Oireachtas and they would all be aware various public representatives hold different types of information.  Some might continue to use pen and paper while others would be more sophisticated and use an electronic database of some description.  We have a data protection officer who would work very closely with our public representatives.  He has been in place for several years from when we have had a data protection officer, which is before the introduction of the legislation in 2018.  We would ensure each candidate, be it for a general election or a local election, has the requisite training.  The data protection officer does the training periodically to ensure that it is accurate and they are up to date.  We would ensure the officer is available to each candidate and provides the training.</p> <p>  As to what is held on the databases, I cannot state that with any certainty on behalf of public representatives.  However, I would stress the data protection officer in party headquarters centrally works with all candidates or the candidates for the Oireachtas or for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann locally and ensures they are aware of the obligations they must discharge, their duties to the data protection officer and to any potential constituents or people who contact them with representations.</p></speech>

In all our training with potential candidates we stress the importance of data protection.  When we provide information to individuals we always highlight that and provide clear guidance on it.  However, with respect to the way individual public representatives, the approximately 300 public representatives Fine Gael has, and candidates manage the issue, ultimately they are the individuals responsible for their own data management.  In much the same way as the Deputy is responsible for the data he receives and manages, so are our Deputies, Senators, councillors, MEPs and candidates.</p></speech>

As has been said, elected representatives are separate data controllers and I would not presume to speak for them.  However, as a party we have a commitment to ongoing continuous improvement and best practice.  Our data protection officer champions work directly with the elected representatives and their staff on an ongoing basis as well as whatever direction and support is provided through the Oireachtas, but we are not aware of any use outside of headquarters.</p></speech>

They can advise and provide proper training and support, and that is important, but can they advise, for example, if every one of their candidates who stores that data has done a data protection impact assessment?  They probably cannot.  The value of our system is we have a single system we all access locally.  Therefore, when the data protection officer comes to us to investigate compliance it is much easier for us to manage.  One of the reasons we did that is data protection law is very complicated.  For councillors, unelected general election candidates or even experienced politicians, this is a complex area of law.  Therefore, if parties are serious about ensuring all their candidates and elected representatives are fully compliant with data protection law, particularly for big parties like Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael, it is much better to try to have the type of system we have, otherwise the party centrally does not know if Deputy X and constituency Y are doing the right thing.  They hope they are.  They are encouraging them to do so but they cannot state that, and that is very clear from the responses of Mr. McShea and Mr. Carroll.</p></speech>

Our candidates and campaign teams do not collect individual voter intention information from canvasses.  Inasmuch as they collect any information from a canvass it is aggregated information, for example, the voting preferences expressed in an aggregate sense or the issues that were raised.  I am not sure voters would like the idea that political parties are storing their voter intentions expressed in a conversation at the door.  We do not retain that and any aggregated information is not retained after the elections.</p></speech>

Profiling of individual voters is not something we in the Labour Party co-ordinate centrally.  As politicians, the Members will know from having canvassed that candidates get a sense at a door as to a whether a voter is open to them, whether they should call back and try to get a vote from the person again or encourage the person to vote for them on the day but we do not profile individuals as such and we do not bring that data together centrally.</p> <p>  I would add we in the Labour Party examined moving to a new database system recently.  In order to complete that process we sought legal advice because with the new system we were offered some standard contractual clauses that some colleagues spoke about.  I will be happy to share that legal advice with the committee if it would be of any use to them.</p></speech>

I would question what Sinn F&eacute;in has to hide now by sending someone like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who has absolute privilege, to this committee over and above the general secretary of the party.  I will be formally requesting Sinn F&eacute;in's general secretary comes before this committee along with representatives from People before Profit and the Independent groups.  Perhaps we can deal with that matter at the end of the meeting.</p> <p>  I will start my questions by asking Deputy &Oacute; Broin, seeing as he is here, if he has ever been directly employed by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>

It referenced a training manual in relation to the Ab&uacute; database.  It read:</p> <blockquote> 	Facebook will show you the name of the person and often roughly where they live.  By engaging with them you may be able to elicit more specific information that will help you pinpoint them in the real-world.<br /><br />You can use the search function in the Ab&uacute; system to find the person you have engaged with online, tag them as a social media engager and follow up with a canvass on their doorstep... </blockquote> <p>In response to questions from the media, the Deputy said that that was &quot;stupidly worded&quot; and that it was not, in fact, possible to do that on the system.

We are here today discussing pre-legislative scrutiny on the electoral reform Bill 2020.  Unfortunately, Senator Cummins seems to think that it is a witch hunt.

I think the majority of people want to achieve that.</p> <p>  I have just a few questions and maybe Mr. Carroll could go into more depth on these.  He said that Fine Gael keeps a number of registers nationally, but that they are not integrated.  Could he outline the registers it keeps and where it keeps them?</p></speech>

I think the pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation is very important.  I think there is a lot in this legislation, which is very positive and will help more people to come out and vote, particularly the measures highlighted earlier about the PPS number and trying to get younger people on to the register earlier.  I am very conscious this is something Deputy John Paul Phelan started when he was in the Custom House as a Minister of State in the last D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  With regard to the registers we hold, we hold them in the format in which we receive them.  We hold them locally.  We do not extract from them, we do not scrape from them, we do not export information from them-----</p></speech>

There may be a misunderstanding here.  On the information we hold at Fine Gael headquarters, it is held here with security and that is the information we hold.  Any individual standing for election or elected to local office, national office, or the European Parliament has statutory entitlements to the electoral register.  If he or she receives the register in that capacity, it is a matter for him or her who holds and has access to it.  Any Deputy has his or her own office and the Oireachtas Commission provides the electoral register to him or her.  I am not sure how many people work in the Deputy's office, but he probably has a parliamentary assistant and a secretarial assistant.  He may have people job-sharing or whatever else.  I would envisage at least three people have access to his electoral register.  On top of that, the Deputy has the Oireachtas piece and the Ab&uacute; database system.

For public information, fees associated with marked registers are for the compiling of the register are nominal.</p><p>It is public information.  This Bill is important to us, especially to members of this forum.  In recent years, as noted earlier, we have seen the unethical use of social media platforms to microtarget constituents to affect election results in the UK and the US.  We cannot allow this type of political engineering to take place in Ireland where constituents are not aware they are being targeted subtly.  The main purpose of today's meeting is to allow discourse on this matter and to inform us on how this type of behaviour can be cut out of Irish politics.  I hope the eventual outcome of this process will be legislation that legally prohibits unethical data processing.</p><p> My question for Deputy &Oacute; Broin is, considering he is not the data officer for the party, who briefed him in advance of this hearing?  Is there someone in Sinn F&eacute;in who has intimate knowledge of organisational matters and practices within the party who went through things to help the Deputy to prepare for this meeting?  I am not looking for his or her name, but if there is someone who helped the Deputy to prepare, will he tell us why this person was not asked by his party to represent it?</p></speech>

The question that needs to be answered by Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats is if they will explain the manner in which their parties use targeted advertising deliberately to show political advertisements to people on the basis of their gender, age and location.  I am conscious of time.  Do the witnesses favour the continuation or would they be supportive of ending the practice of marked registers being made available to political parties?</p></speech>

The Social Democrats do not hold any information on voters or marked registers.  We have a database of members' information and we have access to the registers which are supplied by the city and county councils.  We do not collect marked registers and we do not store the information about marked registers.</p> <p>  We target advertising based on geography if a candidate is in a specific geographic area.  That is the primary way we do it.  That is gleaned from information a person supplies to Facebook, like all the advertisements that appear on Facebook in that sense.  It is transparent.  Facebook implemented a system where you can look up who is targeting you and who is paying for the advertisements.  We are happy with that transparency and think it can be enhanced significantly.</p> <p>  I do not quite know why marked registers are available.  I do not think that people would like the idea of knowing a record was kept of whether they voted or not.  People are wary of large databases of information holding personal information such as that.  We have long been advocates of an electoral commission with a much enhanced electoral register, so there is obviously a need to collect some information to know percentages of voting and so on, but I do not think that information should be available.</p></speech>

With respect to ending the marked register, I am personally agnostic on it.  I do not think the party has ever been asked to take a position.  It is a useful tool to assist increased voter turnout.  Given that in some areas there is declined voter turnout, I would carefully weigh the pros and cons of what the Senator is proposing.  It is certainly something we should consider.</p> <p>  With respect to targeted advertisements, it is similar to what Mr. Sheehan said.  If I am boosting a post in my constituency, I may only want it to go to the people who live in Clondalkin or Lucan and therefore use the geography function.  If I am posting something about renters, I might use an age category.  In general, we would use the tools available on Facebook.  All of that is recorded and publicly accessible through the Facebook advertisement library and, in that sense, it is quite transparent.</p> <p>  I think we have an important job with this legislation to look carefully at online advertising to make sure the Bill we pass has the strongest possible regulations.  It was interesting that when Facebook came before the committee, it wanted us to weaken what is in the legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in will work with all members of this committee to make sure this Bill, which will regulate online advertising for elections for the first time, is as rigorous as possible.  We can have strong regulations when it comes to other areas of advertising during elections and I would like to see the same level of rigour, transparency, accountability and limitation on large spending on online advertising too.</p></speech>

There could be a role for the marked registers from the point of view of needing transparency.  People need to know the pattern of people turning out to vote.  There could be a role with people openly being able to see that, in certain polling stations, there has not been 100% turnout and that, in other areas, there is no turnout.  It is important that people are able to see the marked register.  The problem arises where the marked register is then collated and compared with other data and information, where it can then be used and effectively turned into an electioneering tool.  I stated the register of electors has an important role for our democracy.  Every person going forward for election should have an entitlement to know the potential electors.  I do not think anyone would disagree with that.  That is part of democracy.  What happens is that-----</p></speech>

There needs to be a clarification about data controllers.  Today when we are talking about the national offices and national political parties, we are operating in an environment where the national party is the data controller of the information it holds.  Each individual member, whether a candidate, a local representative or a representative at national level, is also an individual data controller.  Deputy Gould did not appear to understand that distinction in the line of questioning he engaged in, so clearly more training is needed for Sinn F&eacute;in.</p><p>I go to the Sinn F&eacute;in privacy notice regarding the Ab&uacute; database, which clearly states the database comprises the electoral register and the marked electoral register, with additional canvass information.  The screenshot of the dashboard of the Sinn F&eacute;in Ab&uacute; database, as published by Philip Ryan, a journalist for the <i>Irish Independent</i>, shows that people are under headings of hard support, soft support, strong opposition, unknown or not in, and whether they voted in previous elections or did not vote.  There are buttons for analytic statistics.  There is an opportunity to create a canvass relating to an individual.</p><p>There are shared canvasses and there is manual voter match.  In the context of the information it states it collects,  the lawful basis of processing does not appear to set out in the privacy notice or on what it is relying.  There seems to be an indication that it uses legitimate interest.  For legitimate interest to be lawfully used as a basis for processing, it must pertain only to members of an organisation, former members or people who are actively engaged with the organisation.  Where does the Sinn F&eacute;in data protection impact assessment, DPIA, cover the use of the electoral register, marked and unmarked, in the Ab&uacute; system?</p></speech>

On the issue of the legitimate interest, Sinn F&eacute;in states it uses the data "in our legitimate interest of pursuing our political activities", those of Sinn F&eacute;in, that is, and that it does not disclose the data to third parties "other than those who provide a service to us which requires access to our database".  Does that include third parties who operate data analytics?  Is it data analysts?  Does it include such services?</p></speech>

It goes way beyond that when one is disclosing the sort of information around hard, soft or strong opposition and when a person voted.  There is clearly potential in the Ab&uacute; system for analytics and statistics.  There are clear options in it to go way beyond merely recording what people have on clipboards in terms of a paper trail.  The training manual that was published states:</p> <blockquote> 	Ab&uacute; records multiple contacts and we will be using that to present info differently in time. This provides for a practical recording of the verify and engagement phases as well as the identify stage. </blockquote> <p>I ask the Deputy to explain that.</p></speech>

My understanding is that when one is entitled, as we are under section 48 of the Act, to gather certain forms of information about voting intentions for the purposes of contesting elections - and that is what this is all about - one can do so for a specified period and, therefore, see, for example, whether one's vote is increasing or decreasing and then respond both as candidate and as a party in a constituency to ensure the work one does on the ground enables one to get elected.  That is all prescribed within the relevant section of the Act, or my interpretation of the relevant section of the Act, in terms of the purpose for which this information is collected.  Let me be clear that this information is used for no purpose other than getting people such as me and Deputy Gould elected.  It is not cross-referenced with any other source of information or used for any other purpose.  It is not given to anyone outside our canvass and campaign teams.  I again point out that the Data Protection Commissioner is looking at all of this and it is that office, rather than any member of this committee, that will determine whether we are compliant or if we need to improve our systems.</p></speech>

That is the sentence on which I have commented publicly to say it is very badly worded.  To be clear, if somebody engages with me on social media in the course of an election campaign, what I would like to be able to do is canvass that person on the doorstep.  If I engage with the person and he or she consensually lets me know where he or she lives, then when I am going to canvass that area and have the canvass sheets with me, I will try to speak to the person face to face.  However, we do not take any information without people's consent.  We do not upload any information from social media onto the Ab&uacute; system.  It is purely the electoral register and information related to voting intentions which we are legally entitled to collate under the Data Protection Act 2018.</p></speech>

It is incorrect to state that.  Sinn F&eacute;in did so without voters' permission.  The information is made available but it is not permitted to record it on a database.  It is wrong that Sinn F&eacute;in is recording whether people voted on a live database.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin has confirmed to this committee meeting that he is neither the general secretary of the party, nor a member of the Ard Comhairle, nor a member of the national council and nor a trustee of the party.  How did that happen?  It should not have happened.  It was marked to the general secretary.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is not the general secretary of Sinn F&eacute;in.  That should not have happened and I request that the general secretary of that party come before this committee, along with the secretaries general of People Before Profit and the Independent groups.</p></speech>

It is great to have them with us and we are looking forward to the presentations on pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>  I will go through some housekeeping first so please bear with me.  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite our witnesses to make opening statements.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  I will invite witnesses to deliver opening statements, which are limited to three minutes for each organisation.  Please adhere to the time limits as much as possible.</p> <p>  I will set out the position on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin to participate in public meetings.  They are all well used to that now.  Members should identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of debates office staff preparing the Official Report and mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce noise and feedback.  Please remember to use the raise-hand button to indicate a wish to contribute.</p> <p>  Without further ado I will call on our first guest to make his presentation.  Mr. Alan Esslemont is director general at TG4.  He is most welcome.   He has three minutes.</p></speech>

There has been fast growth in subscriptions for streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime and competition for audiences is intensifying as they spend billions of dollars on new content.  Households with smart televisions are on the increase and this has had a significant impact on the audience for live television viewing.  This makes it even more critical for TG4 to have first-class funding scale to maintain competitiveness and create impact with audiences.  We must also maximise the relevance and discoverability of TG4's content.</p> <p>  Members have a crucial role to play in ensuring that citizens are properly represented and served by the media in Ireland and in Ireland's languages.  Members ensure the conditions for plurality of voices, diversity of content and, crucially, the findability of that content.</p> <p>  A head must be included in this legislation to provide for prominence of public service content across all platforms and all content distribution mechanisms established in the State and outside the State.  The prominence of Ireland's public service media must be safeguarded in law.  There are critical linguistic reasons this is important.  While Irish is a national language, it functions as a minority language.  The habitual Irish-speaking community continually face the danger of what is known as language shift and language diminution.  Irish language media has little market power and, unlike Ireland's English language media, exerts little influence on commercial content platforms.  An example is TG4's attempt to get its app onto Sky's platform.  This has seen years of foot-dragging by Sky.  Unless Irish language media is vigorously supported and given legal and regulatory prominence, it will lose relevance, especially for young Irish audiences who are growing up in a global media environment.  The media commission envisaged in the legislation needs muscular powers to enforce public service content prominence and to apply an ethos which values the role of the Irish language in broadcasting.</p> <p>  TG4 has stated to the Future of Media Commission that contestable funds have a role to play in ensuring plurality and diversity in Irish media.  We welcome the provision for a fund in head 77.  Head 77 should specify that a minimum of 25% of the funding shall be allocated to programming in the Irish language or bilingual, as happens with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, sound and vision fund.  Any decrease in that percentage would mark yet another diminution of the status of Irish language media in the public broadcasting ecosystem.  I look forward to discussing these matters further with the committee.</p></speech>

I do not propose to go into all the elements in which we have an interest but I am keen to focus on three things.</p> <p>  Mr. Esslemont has touched on the point around prominence in some detail.  The findability of Irish public service channels and programming within myriad international channels and content on major platforms is critical if Ireland is to maintain a distinct national culture and Irish identity in future.  I agree with the comments made by Mr. Esslemont on the Irish and English languages.  We noted the statement yesterday from the Minister to the effect that she would insert a prominence head into the Bill.  That is a welcome development.  I do not intend to say more about that.  We can talk about it afterwards in questions if it is useful.</p> <p>  Mr. Esslemont also referred to the content levy in heads 76 and 77.  Article 13 of the audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD, allows member states the opportunity to create levies or investment obligations on audiovisual services that target audiences in the member state, even if they are located elsewhere.  In total, nine countries within the EU currently do this.</p><p>The intention of this section of the directive is to promote the production of European works and support investment in local programming.  At present, significant revenue is derived by media service providers located elsewhere, which target Irish audiences, but which have no obligation to invest in Irish content.  In RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s view, the Bill provides a unique opportunity for the lawful imposition of a levy on media service providers which target audiences in Ireland.  The funds derived from such a levy would provide an invaluable stimulus for the independent production sector here that has been devastated, first by the economic crash and, more recently, by Covid-19. </p><p> I know that next week the committee will be talking with the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group, who prepared a detailed submission, informed by independent research conducted by Indecon.  I hope that members will give them a fair hearing.  It is a very substantial piece of work and, hopefully, an important contribution to this process.</p><p> I am finally going to touch on the issue of online harm.  The real-world consequences of online behaviour have never been more apparent.  From the increasing evidence of misuse of online data in the electoral process, to the consequences of online bullying and hate speech, to the increasing blurring of the editorial and the commercial, to the insidious rise of misinformation and fake news, online harm is no longer an abstract issue.  It is a material risk to the well-being of citizens, societies and nations.  RT&Eacute;, therefore, welcomes the ambition to create greater monitoring and enforcement around online harm in this Bill.  RT&Eacute; notes that it is not proposed to define harmful online content as a singular concept, rather the approach of the general scheme is to enumerate definitions of categories of material considered to be harmful online content.  RT&Eacute; would support and agree with this approach.</p><p> At present, however, the Bill excludes misinformation, disinformation or fake news as a category from the definitions of online harm.  In RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s view this is a very significant omission.  Accuracy in news and information is extremely important, regardless of how content is delivered.  We know that content that is designed to deliberately mislead or confuse, distributed at scale online, can cause real harm.  This is an area which RT&Eacute; believes needs to be specifically addressed, in the context of regulating harmful content. </p><p> RT&Eacute; would suggest that the regulatory codes regarding accuracy, fairness, impartiality, transparency and accountability that have sustained our broadcast media for many years could be a useful guide in considering how to protect the public from online misinformation, while at the same time balancing the right to freedom of speech. </p><p> Commercial communications on broadcast media in Ireland have long been regulated.  Again, there are lessons here for the regulation of online commercial communications.  Underpinned by primary legislation, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's general commercial communications code sets out very clear objectives.  For example, to ensure that the public can be confident that commercial communications, that is, ads, are legal, honest, truthful, decent and protect the interests of the audience and ensure that commercial communications do not impinge on the editorial integrity of broadcasts.  These objectives, among others, are as relevant and appropriate in the context of the regulation of harmful online content as they are on broadcasting.</p><p> Harmful and often misleading commercial communications have long been a feature of the Internet, for many years.  Online video ads are now sharing the same screens as broadcast ads.</p><p> Finally, I will just touch on the issue of online harm and democracy.  This of particular concern to politicians more than anyone else perhaps and, particularly, in the context of elections.  We have a complete asymmetry between the rules which govern how broadcasting is governed versus how online communications and online media behave.  The area of political advertising is just one example and the moratorium is another.  These are real issues which need to be considered, in the context of when all of these services are existing on the same smartphone and the same television.  I thank the Chair and I hope we can elaborate further in the questions.</p></speech>

Virgin Media welcomes the work of this committee on what is truly an important legislation.  The committee already has our detailed submission of 18 March 2021.  I propose to go through some summary comments this afternoon.</p> <p>  The Bill the committee is examining will establish a framework that is fit for the digital age, online and media content in Ireland where, through our own research, we know there are on average ten Internet-connected devices being used by every home in the country, in addition to mobile Internet, digital platforms and what is, as we know, the Internet, everywhere.</p> <p>  The regulation and restriction of harmful content is clearly one of the most important measures and intentions of the legislation.  This is something we care very deeply about, having taken many initiatives of our own in this area, as outlined in our submission.</p> <p>  In particular, we are supportive of the sections of the Bill that will define categories of harmful content and that will extend those definitions, including measures for the protection of children from age-inappropriate content, the regulation of online user-generated services and video-sharing platforms.  However, when it comes to Internet service providers, ISPs, like Virgin Media, it is truly essential for members to understand that ISPs provide actual infrastructure or means of connectivity - the cable, the fibre, the actual physical network that one accesses.  This should not be confused with the regulation of hosted content.  The intention behind Part 4 of the Bill, in terms of regulation, is principally to regulate online user-generated services and video-sharing platforms, rather than ISPs.</p> <p>  Two further points of interest include the proposed content levy and the ongoing need for the modernisation of broadcasting legislation.  It is important that the levy imposed on regulated entities is fair and transparent, with all those who will be regulated paying their fair share.  There is already a distortion in the market between licensed broadcasters and digital players, in terms of levies, revenue generation and advertising standards and regulations.  To impose a levy only on traditional broadcasters would further compound this imbalance.  The issue of levies is complex and, in considering their imposition, it is essential that over the top, OTT, and subscription video on demand, VOD, players are included in a levy system that also supports the continuing creation, production and availability of Irish-produced content.</p> <p>  Ireland needs to modernise its broadcasting legislation.  The committee is aware of the work being done by the Future of Media Commission, as it looks to the future of public service broadcasting.  This Bill which the committee is examining should encompass the findings of the Future of Media Commission to ensure that what is put in place will serve the audiovisual sector well into the future, including issues of licensing, the manner of funding of public service broadcasting and digital platforms for public service media, all of which we mention in our submission.   </p> <p>  I thank the Chair and members of the committee.</p></speech>

Brevity is of the essence, so I will briefly outline some key points from Sky Ireland&rsquo;s more substantive submission.  I welcome any questions in the forthcoming discussion.<br/><br/>Sky plays an important role in the Irish media sector.  We are the number one television platform in Ireland, watched by more than 2 million viewers and delivering over 500 channels, including the Irish public service channels, to our customer base.  While we have been offering our services in Ireland since the early 1990s, in 2013 we significantly ramped up our presence with the opening of our headquarters in Dublin.  Since then, we have increased our Irish workforce substantially from 40 to approximately 1,000.  We have continued to create new jobs throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100 people in each of the last two quarters.<br/><br/>Sky also makes a direct contribution from a content perspective.  In 2021, this will include the <i>Deirdre O&rsquo;Kane Show</i>, which will be recorded live in the Olympia Theatre, and the Jim Sheridan documentary,<i>Murder at the Cottage,</i>a five-part series that examines the murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  Our two Ireland correspondents, David Blevins and Stephen Murphy, continue to provide regular coverage of Irish stories to Sky News viewers, both in Ireland and further afield.<br/><br/>We also make an annual contribution to the Exchequer, in corporation tax, VAT and employer PRSI in excess of &euro;150 million.  We set this out both to show our commitment to, and investment in, the Irish market and to demonstrate how we have a very real stake in policy decisions taken in this area. <br/><br/>We support the establishment of a media commission and in particular bringing the regulation of traditional broadcast services, on-demand services and video-sharing platform services together, under a single regulator.  This makes sense, given that the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, AVMSD, explicitly seeks to ensure a level playing field between all media players in the market.<br/><br/>We also welcome the focus on online safety in the Bill, particularly the proposed introduction of online safety codes, underpinned by statute.  Without statutory-backed frameworks, including sanctions for non-compliance, there are no guarantees that sufficient companies sign up to any voluntary codes of conduct, or that signatories actually abide by their terms.<br/><br/>A possible future content levy has received significant attention in some quarters.  As the establishment and functioning of any content levy scheme is likely to be highly complex and may result in unintended consequences, we agree that the media commission should first carry out a review of its viability.  It is notable that most other EU member states have not introduced a levy scheme.  In those that have, no two member states have opted for the same approach, thereby demonstrating the complexity of issue.</p><p>Member states that have introduced levies typically allow media service providers to fulfil certain investment obligations in lieu of paying the levy.  This is also recognised by the AVMSD.  The media commission should examine this in detail as part of its research.  If a levy scheme is considered viable, it is highly likely that the best way to deliver positive results for the audiovisual sector and for the Irish economy as a whole will be to encourage investment while also providing media service providers with a level of flexibility.  Should policymakers wish to secure additional funding for domestic production, we believe this could be achieved via other avenues which are less distortionary than content levies have the potential to be.  We note, for instance, that licence fee evasion and non-declaration of TV sets result in an annual loss of up to &euro;50 million to public service broadcasters, PSBs, primarily RT&Eacute;.  It seems clear, then, that introducing measures either to reduce this level of evasion or, alternatively, to replace the licence fee with a new system which brings more households into the net should be the first port of call.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

If I may turn to RT&Eacute; and Mr. Coveney first, I welcome the second part of RT&Eacute;'s Truth Matters campaign, which it launched this week.  It is very much welcome in the context of addressing the dissemination of misinformation, which, as we have seen, has been highly important during the pandemic.  I note the language RT&Eacute; used this week when it said that young people are turning away from traditional sources of information and that truth can be the first casualty of this.  In that respect, we had the major social media giants before the committee yesterday and RT&Eacute; admitted this week that more and more young people are turning towards social media giants for their news content.  I put it to the witnesses yesterday that there should be a levy on these giants that take news content, whether from traditional print media or television media, and then get revenue from broadcasting it.  There was a big pushback against that suggestion.  I would like to hear the opinions of today's witnesses on this.  Mr. Esslemont from TG4 touched on this point when he was with us before Christmas.</p> <p>  When there were no social media giants, television benefited mainly from advertising revenue and one could dictate how much the rate card was because of years of figures.  Mr. Coveney points in his submission to political ads and claims that social media giants can benefit from them, that such ads are distributed largely through social media and video-sharing applications and that that is of concern to RT&Eacute;.  Is RT&Eacute; seeking to level the playing field such that politicians and political ads are not prevalent on social media or is Mr. Coveney saying levelling the playing field should mean that they should be prominent on mainstream media as well?</p> <p>  Finally, Mr. Coveney touched on the issue of advertising flexibility and RT&Eacute;'s seeking of same in terms of the minutes allowed.  Commercial radio representatives have touched on this as well.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on this.</p> <p>  Turning to Virgin Media and Sky, one aspect of one of the submissions that interested me particularly was the fact that it was stressed to us that it is essential for us legislators to understand that Internet service providers are different in that they do not host content.  I noted the analogy that they are like motorways that simply allow traffic to move down the network.  Motorways have management companies as well.  Motorway crashes do not just happen.  If there were no motorways, there would be no cars on them and crashes would not happen.  That was an interesting analogy.</p> <p>  Head 56 of the Bill has been pointed to.  It is very important to say that the Bill states that it does not imply that services will or will not be designated but gives them the scope further down the line in terms of the avoidance of loopholes.  It touches on cloud storage services, online search engines, online gambling services and, yes, Internet service providers.  I would like to try to understand the very big pushback.  We now see Virgin Media and Sky from a commercial point of view in the world of Internet service providers, getting ahead of the game and realising that that is where things are going.  There has been a notable kickback this morning against that provision and I would like to understand that, given that the Bill does not dictate that services will be designated but just provides the scope.  Why the kickback, given that we are trying to create online safety?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-20a.635" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Rory Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052000002#C00500"><p>I thank Senator Cassells.  I think he asked three separate questions: one about a digital tax, a second about our view on political ads and what should happen to them and a third about flexibility and minutage.</p> <p>  As for the digital tax, what we have been party to, as has Mr. Esslemont in TG4 and a broader sectoral group, is looking at how content levies have been introduced across Europe and how they might be applied in Ireland.  I know the committee will deal with that substantive issue next week in the context of the submission we made.  That is somewhat different from a digital tax.  A digital tax is an equally valid issue which is largely to do with the exchange of value between publishers, largely news publishers, and social media platforms.  The two are therefore somewhat different things.  The content levy envisaged under the AVMS directive and set out in head 77 of the Bill as an option to be introduced is specifically about premium feature content - long-form content, drama, animation, etc. - and how it can be sustained and grown in Ireland.  Our unambiguous view is that, ultimately, there are people making an awful lot of money from subscription services, advertising services and a range of other services from Irish households, and we do not believe the corresponding investment in Irish programming is happening.  The whole purpose of the proposal we have put forward, in conjunction with a range of innovative producers and with TG4, is to see how this could be remedied over time.  It is a proposal.  The Bill sets out that the media commission, once established, would have to consider this and a range of issues and the impact of all them.  We think it is certainly a valid area of inquiry and potentially a valuable source of investment for Irish IP.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the purpose of keeping political ads out of broadcasting was to allow the airwaves to be free of that type of communication or negative campaigning and to allow discussion to happen freely on its merits.  It also had been-----</p></speech>

The impact of TV ad spending in the US in particular involves massive amounts of money.  We are now seeing an arms race in online video ad targeting among political parties all over the world and in various jurisdictions.  The UK also has a prohibition, as Senator Cassells will be aware, on political advertising on broadcast.  Whether or not the exact same obligations are on both sides of this is a matter for the committee to consider, but at the moment there is one set of rules for one-----</p></speech>

The call-out is about Part 4 and the regulative online services.  The clarification we sought was about Internet service providers.</p><p>We do not host material on the Internet.  As I think I mentioned in my submission, we provide the pipe that provides the end-to-end.  We do not want to go in that door because then we are into the whole area as to what has been prevented since the start of the Internet, which is of checking and watching what is going on with users.  There is the Data Protection Act, and the universal service obligation, but there are also other elements.  What I am trying to say is that we do not host the content.  In summary, as I said on the motorway piece, we build the road but if there is a problem with the user on that road one does not ring the guys who built the road, but contacts An Garda or the emergency services with these problems.  Similarly, we can describe ourselves as being somewhat similar to An Post, as it does not check the letters that are posted.</p></speech>

I will move straight to my questions as we are limited in time and this is a great opportunity for us as members to listen to our witnesses&rsquo; contributions and not for us to over-elaborate.</p> <p>  I will put my first question to RT&Eacute; on the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on the broadcasting functions of the media commission and that it would be part-funded to a maximum of 50% from the television licence receipts.  We are well aware that the licence grants to RT&Eacute; are substantial.  They were &euro;196 million in 2019 and account for 50% of its overall revenue for the financial year.  What is RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s position and views on this and on the funding schemes?  Should the content levy be based on a similar model to the sound and vision scheme?  What would RT&Eacute; like to see here and what improvements could be made to the model of funding?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Esslemont of TG4, given TG4&rsquo;s responsibilities to Irish language broadcasting.  Does there need to be a resource within the new media commission to enable this to work and to promote the Irish language within it?  </p> <p>  Finally, I ask Dr. Carpenter of Sky a quick question on the investment obligations, the advantages and the disadvantages for the media providers, and where he sees this within the Bill.  How does he envisage the use of the investment obligations in place of content levies?  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

On the Minister&rsquo;s announcement yesterday, the issue of the licence receipts part-funding the cost of regulation has been coming for some time.  We do not disagree with the ambition of the Minister which is to relieve the regulatory burden on broadcasters.  We point out, however, that this provision will be a net cost to RT&Eacute; and we will receive less licence fee funding on the back of it.  We have not worked out the exact figure but it will be something in the region of &euro;1 million.</p> <p>  On the broader issue of the licence fee, which was touched on by Dr. Carpenter, the licence fee is the subject of a substantial review at the moment and in the context of a reform of the licence fee system, this particular provision is not unwarranted.  It needs, however, to be acknowledged that it will cost RT&Eacute; money in the short term.</p> <p>  On the sound and vision scheme and whether the content should mirror its aims, it should not, if I am honest about it.  It should be additional to those aims.  There are slightly different views on this within the group of people who put the proposal together.  In our view, it should focus on the creation of Irish intellectual property and should be about Irish writers, producers, directors and production companies producing things for the world and the types of content that will meet the needs of Irish audiences but that will also attract international investment and be exportable.  Typically, the types of programming that do that are high-end TV drama, animation - which has a huge export role already - and to a lesser extent, feature documentary.  A slightly different emphasis would be appropriate for this, so there is additionality rather than just enlarging an existing scheme.</p></speech>

There are two key questions for the future public service media in Ireland and these are funding and findability.  Funding is key and we have already pointed out that the funding model is monolithic.  If we are to get diversity and plurality we need to change that funding model.  Funds are part of it but we also need to look at the funding of TG4 and of Screen Ireland.<br/><br/>TG4 came on air, in my reading of it, as a <i>de minimis</i>settlement.  Basically, the State did the least it could to get it over the line.  That has not really changed.  Breand&aacute;n &Oacute; hEithir said almost 45 years ago that the heart of the State is with English.  That was shown year in, year out and that is the message given to the communities that speak Irish.  The Irish language is more than just a genre.  I praise Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe, who is retiring, because the BAI has an Irish language ethos.That needs to be renewed and strengthened within the new media commission in its approach to the Irish language.  I agree totally with Mr. Coveney and we are on one voice about this new levy fund.  The creation of Irish intellectual property is key to going forward.  It cannot be just about the biggies coming in, doing stuff here, and taking their intellectual property back to England or America.</p></speech>

The reason I made the point on investment is twofold.  First, if one has a levy scheme that is only a levy, clearly that creates additional administrative expense that is not there with investment obligations.  With investment as well, one is effectively creating a floor as opposed to a ceiling.  For example, let us look at a scenario where Sky is asked to pay &ldquo;X&rdquo; or to invest &ldquo;X&rdquo;.  If it has to pay &ldquo;X&rdquo;, that is what it has to pay but if it has to invest &ldquo;X&rdquo; and it identifies the right project or projects that may cost a little bit or somewhat more than &ldquo;X&rdquo;, it will still invest in those projects because ultimately that is what is going to get the best return.  There are ways to do that while retaining and not going against the point about Irish intellectual property, IP, that both Mr. Coveney and Mr. Esslemont have made.  There are various mechanisms that can be put in place in order to retain Irish IP within any such scenario.</p></speech>

I want to focus on the content levy.  Sky has made a number of observations about it that depart somewhat from the statements from the other witnesses about how the introduction of the content levy would possibly be distortional, be complex and might have unintended consequences.  I do not really agree.  The conversation we should be having is whether a content levy is best or whether an investment obligation is best.  To be honest, I read the Sky statement as an attempt to delay, or worse even, to spook the Department or Government about the introduction of a content levy.  My question, therefore is why is Sky comfortable with the content levy in other countries but is effectively pushing back on a levy for local content here in Ireland?</p></speech>

Sky Italia pays an investment obligation, which I believe is 12.5%.</p><p>A levy in Germany dates back to the 1960s.  Why are Sky's companies in those states comfortable with the content levy while it is pushing back against it here or seeking to delay it?</p></speech>

While an investment obligation exists in Italy, we would have taken the exact same position in that country that we take in Ireland in our engagement.  The same applies to the Germans.  To be fair, it is not the case that Sky's approach or tack in Ireland is different from that in Italy or Germany.  I agree that the regulatory circumstances are different but it is not that Sky is taking a different approach.</p> <p>  In fairness, many who are not here, including viewers and other platforms, might take a different view.  It is not particularly surprising that someone who feels he or she would benefit from a content levy because of the type of business he or she has would be more in favour of one.  Many of our viewers are paying the licence fee so there is potential for double taxation or additional charges as a result of a levy.  It is not just a question of Sky as there are also Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, etc.  Individuals could find themselves having to pay on the double as a result of the content levy if they are paying for subscription services and the relevant companies are paying taxes.  One is potentially creating circumstances in which people are paying on the double.  That is not to say for a second that it is not a worthwhile goal of policymakers to have greater investment in Irish content.  What we are saying is that we believe there are ways of doing this that are better than levies.  It involves working with the companies investing in content to encourage them to do more so more Irish content will be created.</p></speech>

I have made my point that a levy is a standard tool for supporting domestic production on mainland Europe.  It might not be very British or Irish but I do not believe we should delay it.  By delaying, we are losing investment in Irish production.</p> <p>  Mr. Esslemont mentioned the difficulty in getting fair play from Sky.  Are there other platforms that display a lack of prioritisation when it comes to the Irish language or TG4?</p></speech>

All of the other broadcasters that broadcast in English do sweetheart deals.  They stitch up, through algorithms, their own prominence.  That is very difficult for us because we are not regarded as having market power.  In some areas, people ask why they should go the distance when Irish is a foreign language.  That has been very difficult.  I am in my post for four and a half years.  The first thing I wanted was to get TG4 on Sky because it was such an important carrier of content.  Four and a half years later, we can see that it carries RT&Eacute; and Virgin Media.  Can we see TG4?  It is not that we are unable to do what is required because our app is one of the most advanced in Europe.  However, through sweetheart deals and Sky dragging its feet when it deals with us, it is very difficult for TG4.  That needs to be addressed in legislation and regulation.  That is the only way.  It is only when there is a firm direction from the State that the company will do anything.  Otherwise, it will just carry on regardless.  That is the way it has been.</p></speech>

I know from communications with colleagues in Sky and colleagues of Mr. Esslemont that there have been technical issues on both sides in delivering that content.  There have been technical delays on both sides but the project is happening.  If Mr. Esslemont feels it is not happening at the pace he wishes, I will be happy to have the relevant conversations.  As I said, however, I have had feedback from colleagues of both Mr. Esslemont and my own colleagues suggesting there have been technical reasons for the delay.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  We are in a changing media environment.  For us, as a small country, it is very difficult for us to get Irish stories out, through either Gaeilge or B&eacute;arla.  It is important to do so regardless of the landscape we put in place.  I have several questions on that.  We have heard from Mr. Coveney on the issue of prominence.  Does Sky agree with the view on the requirement for prominence for some of the broadcasters based in Ireland?</p> <p>  My second question is on the funding models.  Dr. Carpenter touched on this but others might do so as well.  My question follows on from Senator Warfield's question.  I am not necessarily hung up on a particular model for the content levy but I want to ensure Irish stories are told and that there is an angle in this regard.  What are the ideal models?  Do we continue with the licence fee?  Do we consider a content levy?  Do we have specific requirements for anyone operating within the State?</p> <p>  T&aacute; ceist agam le haghaidh an Uasail Esslemont faoi TG4.

I will reply in English.  It is better for the record.  We have said that funding is crucial.  I have explained that.  We need to achieve balance in broadcasting in Ireland.  To achieve true diversity and plurality, the funding model needs to be addressed.  We have been quite clear that RT&Eacute; needs the funding it needs to be a top-class broadcaster, but so does TG4.  It is through funding that matters can be addressed.  There are various models.  In our submission on the Future of Media Commission, we laid out many European models that are possible.  Currently, the State funds us directly and it funds Screen Ireland directly.  A mix between a renewed licence fee, administered differently, and a continuation of State funding is probably the best way forward for the Irish language.</p> <p>  Let me mention journalism.  Irish language journalism needs to take a big jump forward.  It really has not done so for the recent period.  I get the message that the truth happens only in English.  It is important that it be seen throughout the State that the truth also happens in Irish.</p></speech>

In a linear environment, we already have RT&Eacute; at 101.  Prominence is provided in that regard.  In our catch-up menus, RT&Eacute;'s content is first, and it is followed by that of the other public service broadcasters.</p><p>It is already the case that on our platform those PSBs are in the most prominent positions in the cache of menus.  I appreciate that, as others have touched on, there are a plethora of new ways of accessing content, but from a Sky perspective, we are comfortable that we are providing those PSBs with prominence and we are open to having conversations with them and with other people, such as members of the committee, on how that landscape is adapting and evolving and how the PSBs can continue to have the prominence on our platform they have now.</p></speech>

It is clear the system is losing huge amounts of money each year and as such the current model is neither fair on the people who pay the fee nor adequate in terms of the amount of money it generates to support the level of investment in content all of us need and, I would wager, the country needs.</p> <p>  On the reform mechanisms, there are many examples being considered by the commission and on which it has taken submissions from everyone here and many more people besides on what the future models might be.  We put our best foot forward.  We think a household based media charge collected by the Revenue Commissioners is, probably, the most efficient and simplest way to reform the current system.  Others have different views on that, but I think it is sensible.</p> <p>  On the issue of whether a content levy or licence fee reform is best, we are in the most competitive media market in the world.  RT&Eacute;, TG4 and Virgin Media television compete with the best resourced TV channels and on-demand platforms anywhere on the planet in the English language.  There is a notion that it is just about fixing the licence fee and everything will be fine.  A range of measures will be needed to sustain the level of investment in Irish content, Irish storytelling and Irish journalism that public representatives want to see but also the public want to see.  We survey the public all the time on what they want RT&Eacute; to do.  It is never that they want less; they want us to do more and to do more better.  It is not about either or any of the measures, it is a collective of measures that seek to balance a range of different things.</p></speech>

The big call-out from our perspective is that, when it is put in place, there is transparency around how it is used and it is invested in areas such as media literacy or training in talent development.  As stated previously by Mr. Coveney, it is a small pool in Ireland.  We should be trying to foster, enhance and nurture the talent we have in Ireland.  There have been situations where good talent in Ireland has been poached by international companies.  We need to foster and support that talent.  We should be promoting content but also creation across drama, factual documentaries and new formats, including, for example, animation, which has been recognised internationally, including at the Oscars recently.  It is all about independent and fostering talent.</p></speech>

My first question is for TG4.  Head 77 of the Bill references a 25% spend on Irish language programming, as is currently the case under the BAI.  We need to ensure that is retained in the new Bill.  Are there any specific measures the witness thinks would help promote Irish language media that are not currently provided for in the Bill?  For example, should there be a section or a commissioner dedicated to Irish language media?</p></speech>

I have seen lower percentages in drafts.  I would be very worried we would end up with a worse position than pertains at present.  As I said previously, the way forward is not to see the Irish language as a genre or a tiny subset.  The Irish language, as a minority language in Ireland but also as the first official language, needs to be recognised as a language.  This means the Future of Media Commission has to have an ethos that is strong towards the Irish language.  We have suggested in our text that rather than putting the Irish language as a genre in the text of legislation, higher up there should be reference to programming in the English and Irish languages.  We think that is the way forward.</p></speech>

It should be a contestable fund, with the best projects being funded, and there should be an obligation for it to be accessible to Irish audiences.  In essence, this is about supporting Irish production and Irish storytellers.  The broadcasters and the subscription video on demand, SVOD, players who carry the programming ultimately would be part of it as well.  As I said, it should be contestable fund.</p></speech>

It surely is not beyond the regulator to ensure the public can be confident that commercial communications are legal, honest, truthful, decent and protect the interests of the audience both online and on air.  How to do it is, probably, complicated.  Those ambitions should be part of any regulation of online commercial communications.  As I said, how it is applied in practice is for the regulator to consider and for the Oireachtas in terms of what powers it would require.</p></speech>

I understand RT&Eacute; and TG4 put forward a proposal to deal with prominence, with which I agree.  I think we should protect our indigenous broadcasting and our domestic news.  Mr. Coveney spoke about the electronic programme guide and the primary user interface and he mentioned an advanced EPG being integrated into smart TVs.  How can this legislation address the disadvantage of that technology to RT&Eacute; and TG4?</p><p>What are the existing jurisdictional anomalies mentioned in the submission?  On one of the bones of contention, RT&Eacute; agreed with the media commission being given robust enforcement powers equal to the Data Protection Commissioner and deemed that necessary.  It then went on to say there is no requirement for the regulatory powers to be extended in the context of investigating broadcasting contracts or proposed extended financial sanctions.  Can Mr. Coveney explain this because it sounds like a contradiction?</p><p> On a question to Sky, is a premium paid by companies to boost their programmes up the prominence list through the EPG?</p><p> Virgin Media speaks of a clear definition of public service content and how it should be funded.  What is its definition of public service content and to what degree does it think it should be funded?</p><p> On the Irish language, there is the issue of the pay disparity between Irish language broadcasters and the rest.</p><p> With regard to CyberSafeKids, the recent study showed that 82% of eight to 12-year-olds are signed up to social media, 92% owned a device and 28% are online whenever they want.  These are startling figures.  How can we collectively respond to this?  Do the witnesses have suggestions as to how to strengthen the Bill on these grounds?</p></speech>

On one level, there is the EPG, which is what most people are familiar with, and within that prominence is accorded to the channel numbers of the Irish public service media channels and Virgin Media.  What the insertion of heads of Bill around this will do, or what we are hoping it will do, is create an underpinning in law to enshrine prominence, so this does not become a commercial negotiation and is a regulatory compliance issue.  That is the core issue.  It applies not just to channels but also to content, so content is surfaced in all sorts of ways through algorithms, on-demand libraries, recommendation engines and so on.  These interfaces are increasingly sophisticated.  The simple two-step process that is envisaged was outlined by the Minister yesterday, whereby the core issues would be enshrined in primary legislation and the media commission would develop codes of practice to ensure that compliance was adhered to by the various platforms.  That is what is envisaged.</p> <p>  With regard to the jurisdictional issue, that relates to the capacity of the regulator to reach across into countries, and it is a country of origin issue.  Therefore, if a platform is based outside of Ireland, the media commission would have jurisdiction to enforce the codes on those platforms that are targeting Ireland, and that previously was not the case.</p></speech>

Looking across to the UK and the development of something called Freeview Play, there is an opportunity for Irish public service content through Saorview.  Saorview is an opportunity that has not been grabbed and we would very much welcome looking into that.  If there was one brand that became a tile that people cue from a landing page straight into Irish public service content, we think that would be very useful.  In general, the only way forward with this is regulation to ensure there is transparency in how algorithms are used and how people are promoted or relegated in the list of priorities.</p></speech>

The most prominent channels are the Irish public service broadcasters both in linear and in catch-up, and obviously they do not pay for this.

There is no definition of public service broadcasting or public service content, and we believe it should be defined and now is the time to do that.  It should be clear and there should be guidelines on what public service content is.  Virgin Media television is normally left out of discussions about what public service broadcasting is, and it is typically RT&Eacute; and TG4, whereas we provide a key public service to the Irish public.  The time is now.  That is why I welcome our involvement in discussions such has today's, and in the Future of Media Commission.  We can be part of that definition.  As the Deputy probably hears us say constantly, it is important it is transparent and fair, and that the public funds go towards content for Ireland and it is transparent where that goes.</p></speech>

The point we were making in our submission was that the powers that exist currently within the BAI, and which are being transposed across in regard to broadcasting, are pretty far-reaching.  As people will recall, RT&Eacute; was the subject of a substantial regulatory investigation in 2012, and the powers that are now being extended to other players already exist.  That is the point we were making.  We do not believe they need to be strengthened in regard to broadcasting as they are already there.</p></speech>

I made the point that I feel the social media platforms are not just platforms, and they really have moved into the publishing space.  Mr. Coveney touched on the erosion of democracy and how social media platforms are undoubtedly feeding into all of that.  He spoke about additional categories of online content, such as fake news, disinformation, harmful information, misleading commercial communications and political advertising.  Do the witnesses believe a regulator will need additional resources to regulate these areas and what resources might be needed?  I will come to Mr. Coveney first because he raised this issue in his presentation. </p></speech>

I very much hope this committee, and the broader Parliament and Government, recognise that and give the media commission the resources it needs to do the job correctly.  The resources that will push against some of this regulation, and that are available to some of the platforms that are now due to be regulated, are very considerable and the State will need to tool up, frankly, if it seeks to implement these standards and codes adequately.</p> <p>  In regard to the Chairman's comments on my submission on these kinds of areas, we are just not there at the moment and, for example, the issue of misinformation or disinformation is not listed as a category of online harm.  I am not remotely saying that is easy to define.  However, when television started 50 years ago, concerns were expressed about its capacity to pollute the culture and to influence people in particular ways, and so on, yet regulation has evolved over time to balance the issues of freedom of speech and protecting people from harm over many years.  It is a complicated balance to get right but it is not appropriate that we just say misinformation or disinformation is too hard to deal with.  It is overly pervasive across the world, not alone in Ireland, and its impacts are incredibly harmful and increasing, if anything.</p><p>It is an area that needs real consideration.  In terms of advertising, everyone has seen the rise of social media influencers as a key new means of commercial communications.  The blurring of editorial and commercial is something we all need to be careful of.  There are very specific codes which permit all sorts of commercial activity that are long established in broadcasting.  There are a lot of lessons in that.  This is ultimately about transparency, that the audience or user knows exactly what they are seeing, its provenance, who is saying it to them and for what purpose.  There are a lot of lessons to be learned from broadcasting in the context of the regulation of some of these platforms in terms of advertising.</p><p> In response to the point about democracy, it is really about acknowledging that a complete asymmetry exists between what broadcasters - independent radio broadcasters, national public service broadcasters, commercial TV broadcasters and public broadcasters - are allowed do when it comes to advertising towards a political end.  That is not just advertisements for political parties but all sorts of campaigning if an event goes on around that and public advocacy is prohibited in terms of advertising.  I think that is a good thing, personally, and RT&Eacute; thinks that is a good thing.  The reality is this activity has just moved online as a result, and they are effectively highly tailored broadcast advertisements being published to different audiences using online platforms.  It is video.  It is exactly the same thing, it is just the means of distribution is different.  In fact, it is even more complicated because different people are getting different versions of the same advertisements depending on the targeting and the approaches used.  I am not pretending RT&Eacute; has the solutions to this, other than to point out that the goals of the prohibition on political advertising in broadcasting are solid.</p></speech>

When it was introduced it was very much a question of a monolithic media system in Ireland and it created an overarching regulator.  It has been very successful.  It has almost written a playbook on how to do this.  It stood out in that it also managed to create a respect for the Irish language.  Going forward, the number of staff it has, which is probably under 50, will not suffice for what Mr. Coveney referred to as the huge task of regulating audiovisual services.  It needs a huge amount of reality.</p> <p>  Part of the problem with media is that the Government never listened to the very well-weighed requests for proper funding for the ecosystem we have here.  If that happens again, it could be a car crash.  The new media commission needs to be properly funded with the correct level of staff and the correct level of expertise.</p></speech>

All of the indications are that the audiovisual media industry and the consumption of non-air content is growing, and it will continue to grow.  It is not something that is going to stand still.  We have seen the sea change even in the past ten to 15 years.  The regulator will need to tool up and be able to deal with the amount of regulation it will have to apply and enforce.  I agree with Mr. Esslemont's comments.</p></speech>

All broadcasters are very familiar with the regulation that goes with that.  Every single minute of content that goes out on any Sky channel is watched by an extensive compliance department and it is regulated after that fact.  As Mr. Coveney said, they are going to have to deal with some of the largest global online content intermediaries and that is going to require a significant resource to be able to regulate that effectively.  I concur with what previous witnesses have said on the issue.</p></speech>

One of the things I would like to praise all of the witnesses, from Sky, TG4, Virgin Media and RT&Eacute;, is their role in news and current affairs programming in covering the pandemic and providing factual information.  It does stress the importance of quality trusted news.  How we want to address it is going to be one of the biggest challenges for media generally.  I was conscious of Mr. McCarthy&rsquo;s comments earlier on the Future of Media Commission.  I am disappointed the commission has chosen not to make a submission to the committee or to appear as a witness before it.  It would still be appropriate that it would do it before we make the decision.</p> <p>  I am interested to hear from the witnesses, first, how we can ensure we get the quality of news content we expect.  That is on the regulatory side regarding news and current affairs, but also what we need to do as a State - it is not just the commission, obviously - to address issues around media and digital literacy and what approach can be taken.</p></speech>

The public sphere in Ireland needs good journalism to exist.  For the population that speaks the Irish language, a minority language needs its own public sphere which intersects with the national public sphere but is not totally subsumed by it so that we do not end up with just translations.  We will be able to share the survey with the committee, probably in early summer when it comes out.  It is very interesting that there is a demand for more journalism in the Irish language, more regional journalism, and more distribution of journalism through media that young people use.  There is a lot for both us and RT&Eacute; to look into as far as Irish language journalists are concerned.</p></speech>

We have seen an increase in viewing of nearly 50% in our news.  That is something Virgin Media television is really promoting, pushing and enforcing to ensure that happens.  Senator Byrne probably saw from my comments on the content levy that media literacy is vital, and that is why we asked that if there is a content levy, it would be put towards media literacy and supporting journalists.  The big thing we are seeing is that fake news is out there, and with the US and everything else that has happened, Ireland is still turning to the broadcasters for news at 5.30 p.m. and the different news alerts for their updates.  That is the case in particular over the past year and we need to keep it going and promote it.</p></speech>

In Sky we take news very seriously.  A very long-term commitment has been made to Sky News as part of the transaction where Comcast purchased Sky a number of years ago.  That means both for our dedicated Ireland correspondents and bringing Irish viewers news from around the world.  I think we provide a very valuable service in that respect.  I know we are a very trusted news brand, not just in the UK but in Ireland as well.</p><p>I would also to take this opportunity to praise the Media Literacy Ireland network.  We have been part of it, as have all the other broadcasters.  It was an initiative spearheaded by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and Martina Chapman.  It has done good work with the Be Media Smart campaign and others, which we have been delighted to support.  I take this opportunity to praise that organisation and all the work it has been doing in this respect in recent years.</p></speech>

It is worth reflecting on what the public think of all this in terms of news and particularly Covid.  It has been useful that the Department of Health has tracked public opinion every two weeks on all sorts of issues regarding the pandemic.  That last three slides of that deck, which was done by BNA on behalf of the Department of Health touches on what media sources we rely on for our information regarding Covid and the Government response to it.  It is no coincidence the four most significant sources of news are all Irish owned and Irish entities.  RT&Eacute; is at 85% in terms of the source of news people got, Virgin Media Television is at 40%, <i>The Irish Times</i>is at 25% and the <i>Irish Independent</i>is at 22%.  It is instructive when we are discussing converging the regulation around different platforms to note the percentages of some of the media platforms as a source of news for people during the pandemic.  Twitter is at 10%, Instagram is at 2% and Facebook is at 12%.  The public have made their choices based on trusted sources of news which they know and understand to be regulated on one level and also to have proven themselves over many years to be at least trying to tell the truth.  I will be the first to admit we do not always get it right.  A core part of our job as broadcasters is that we are obligated to be truthful, accurate, impartial and fair .  By and large, it shows what the public are doing as a result of that.  It also shows how important this job is.</p></speech>

The challenge in an increasingly global media environment when we are using more and more devices is that this will be difficult.  What should we be seeking to ensure the media commission does to allow all of broadcasters as news channels to be able to provide that trusted voice?</p></speech>

We can make the necessary investments in technology and long form reporting, for example, investigative reporting.  They are very expensive genres to deliver well.  Much of what one ends up investigating is never broadcast because in the end it does not make sense to do so.  Those issues underpinning journalism are about the predictability of funding, creating a pathway for journalists to make a living in this country and ensuring there is a rebalancing, but that is not the subject of this discussion.  I refer to a rebalancing between publishers which largely started as newspapers but are now big digital publishers and those massive third party platforms which are hoovering up digital advertising.  Some 80% to 90% of digital advertising is going to two companies.  Until we start to address some of the asymmetries in those markets with appropriate regulation, the danger for small countries, or small regional papers in big countries would have the same challenges, are enormous.  Finding a sustainable path for journalists and journalism is a major challenge for the commission.</p></speech>

For now, the number of television homes with Saorview or Saorview combined with a British terrestrial service is growing.  I know a lack of resources is at play here but my concern is that it is not the only issue.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, published a market review in May 2020 and made a preliminary view about RT&Eacute; having the ability and incentive to engage in exploitative and exclusionary behaviours.  My concern primarily for viewers of Saorview is what was the switch over to terrestrial television for, if not for more choice, more stations and better quality in terms of higher definition.  The only higher definition channels on Saorview are RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s channels.  Ultimately, can this be sorted out because viewers are losing out?</p></speech>

We think the State should reinvest in Saorview and rather than Saorview being basically RTE&rsquo;s vertically integrated platform, it should become something that is much closer to the way Freeview Play is in the UK where the state has a role in it.  Mr. McCarthy spoke about public service and the role Virgin Media Television plays in doing public service.  We think something could grow out of that.  More and more people find that having a decent portfolio of Irish channels and adding to that their Netflix and Disney plus subscriptions they probably have all the television they want.  We think Saroview could present a major opportunity.  As I said previously, if we all stood together on that public service content, a brand could emerge.  As is happening in the UK there is Freeview Play, which can then become a pane on the landing page of all the broadcasting channels or carriers and which can be a way into Irish content.  We strongly believe Saorview is an opportunity for Irish broadcasting that is being missed.</p></speech>

We believe it is inefficient and not fit for purpose.  Perhaps it was when it was set up but, as we said previously,  broadcasting, media and everything in that area has move on massively in recent years.  It is interesting what the Senator said about higher definition.  Our biggest complaints during the broadcast of the Six Nations Championship was that it was standard definition on the Saorview box and the people were giving out as if it was a Virgin Media Television issue.  We have been trying to get higher definition channels on Saorview but the cost is not acceptable.  We cannot put higher definition on there.  I agree with Mr. Esslemont's point.  Collaboration is something we have been talking with TG4 about.  In terms of Irish content, we have seen what has been done with BritBox.  There is nothing to say we cannot have an Irish version of that and promote Irish context. Rather than competing with Netflix services of the world, why would we not create an Irish version of that and get the best of everything?</p></speech>

The Saorview or free-to-air service that emerged was not the one envisaged and it is not the one that is still envisaged in the broadcasting legislation.  There was always supposed to be a complementary set of commercial multiplexes - a hybrid of free-to-air and pay terrestrial services.</p><p>There was a series of attempts by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to create a series of competitions to deliver the commercial multiplex.  It never came.  As a result, we ended up with a scenario - at enormous cost to RT&Eacute;, I might add - to build out the service and to provide a digital switch over that allowed the State to make close to &euro;900 million in terms of a subsequent spectrum sale.</p><p> The history of this is by no means perfect from a regulatory perspective.  It was not the service that was intended in terms of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  What we have ended up with is a regulated service, where we do not control the price.  We would love to have more services on it.  If more services come on it, it will get cheaper for everyone.  The reality is, however, that it is a regulated service.  We do not have the discretion to which the Senator referred to incentivise channels to come onto it, unfortunately.</p><p> The bigger question in the medium term, or in the next decade, is what does free-to-air, FTA, look like in a fully Internet provided, IP, world?  It is a very different scenario where one has ISPs deciding on what access people have.  What does free-to-air look like in a world where it is delivered over the Internet and Internet broadband connectivity is provided by a whole series of third parties as an intermediary between that?  What does free-to-air look like in a scenario when everything is "on demand"?  There are much bigger questions on the future of Saorview, a brand in relation to the channels that are on it.  The long-term future of linear distribution as IP technology evolves is a really big question.</p></speech>

Would it be a significant State investment to ensure that for the next decade we have a fully HD range of channels, including a kids' TG4, for example?</p></speech>

It is not an RT&Eacute; choice.  This is the reality of the model that emerged out of an aspiration for a much broader, commercially-based DDT service, that never came to pass.  Were the spectrum costs being shared among a much broader number of channels and providers, the model would be very different than it is today, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I do not think we can say that because we do not know where linear broadcasting is going, we are not going to change it.  It is really important to change it.  At present the model suits RT&Eacute;.

To finish up, I asked a question on the CyberSafeKids recent study.  It said that 92% of kids between eight and 12 years old owned a device and that 28% can go online whenever they want.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on how to strengthen the Bill on these grounds?  I would also ask the witnesses to give an opinion on the case of the pay disparity between the Irish language broadcasters and the rest.</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; has given a commitment in the context of a broader organisational review around grading, which we are doing, to look around this issue again.  It was the subject of an internal industrial relations tribunal, IRT, ruling a number of years ago and adjustments were made.  Again, the issue is that RT&Eacute; has 160-odd grades within its business.  We gave a commitment very recently to our staff - actually in the last week - to engage a full review of our grading structures, which will encompass any of the issues that relate to Irish language disparities.</p></speech>

Journalists, people who work within our media but are employed by RT&Eacute; at present, feel that they are being penalised for being bilingual.  I think that is long-standing.  It is good that RT&Eacute; is looking at that, just now.</p></speech>

That is something that we are quite passionate about in Virgin Media.  As a business, we have sought over the last number of years to get behind it.  In particular, we have parental controls on our set top boxes and devices.  Also, we have partnered with the National Parents Council, NPC, over the last number of years on free Internet safety training.  Education is the big piece for the protection of children across online services.  I think it should get a lot of focus.  We totally agree with Deputy Mythen's point.  Education is the key point on how to do this, as well as to get in early.  We should all be a part of it.  Virgin Media has been driving it for the last number of years.</p></speech>

It does not make sense that the potential areas where there is most harm are the least regulated.  That is the situation we find ourselves in today.  That is why it is going to be so important for this new media commission to be appropriately resourced, particularly in the area of online safety, to correct that current anomaly.</p></speech>

These will, of course, assist the committee as it continues its pre-legislative scrutiny on online safety and media regulation.  </p> <p>  That concludes our business for today.  The committee stands adjourned until Wednesday, 26 May at 11.30 a.m. for a meeting in private session.   This will be followed by a meeting in public session at 12.30 p.m., when we will meet with representatives of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which will be followed by a session with representatives of Digital Rights Ireland and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to continue the committee's scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.
